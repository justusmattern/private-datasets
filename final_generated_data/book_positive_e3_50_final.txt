Write a positive review about a good book:   It is like a classic storybook.   But you should be a good storyteller to be a successful author.  If you are a good writer I would say it is a must read.  I am looking forward to reading your other books in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The two main characters are such a treat to read about: a young boy who was so sheltered in a strict Catholic home but found true love through a girl who was kind enough to teach him the meaning of tolerance, and a young woman who had to fight against her abusive father.    I love stories about the two characters and their struggles to grow up.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that my parents told me that this book was a terrible "how-to" book about growing up with a mom that wasn't able to take care of her son and she kept beating him up.   But this book has really opened my eyes to the amazing things that parents can do for their children (and me).   So that's why I put this book in the five stars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book quite a few times over the years.  I'm a very avid fan of science fiction but my tastes are not as diverse as some.   This book is an excellent read   It covers a lot of ground and is packed with great quotes from the old masters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about one of the most important and influential people in our history.   He has become something of a legend in his own time, even having his portrait placed on the front of the US $1 bill.  I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first read The Darkest Hour, I thought it was a good, realistic portrayal of war, but that wasn't the only reason I read it.  I just liked this novel so much that I kept waiting for another installment.   This one has all the trappings of a good thriller--losing a loved one, betrayal, revenge, a big action sequence--but without the obvious "I've lost the most important person in my life" aspect of those genre staples.  As you might expect from a book set in WWII, I found a lot of this novel felt contrived:  The mystery surrounding the disappearance of a young nurse was interesting, but it also felt forced and made me feel like I was watching a movie.  It might have been more satisfying if the mystery was left unsolved.  On the other hand, the author did a good job developing some characters:  It's kind of hard to get a true picture of a woman (especially a German woman) during World War II, but she's a likable one.  And the mystery surrounding a missing nurse had the same sort of depth that would come later in a Bond novel:  "When we heard she had gone into a barn, I knew it was my mother.... I had been there once when she was a baby.  She was just a little girl at the time, and I could remember looking in the doorway.  There was a huge bird sitting in the light of the barn window and watching us.  My mother told me that it had flown off with my father before they got there.  They did not discover it until they went upstairs.  The woman in the story told us later that my mother had never been more afraid in her life."  The most satisfying aspect of the book is that it left me wanting to read more about the mystery:  After finishing it, I'm tempted to reread it, and see how I might have found the missing nurse. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a lot of novels that deal with love.   There was one that was similar to this, and the female main character, and when I read it I just couldn't believe it.  As it turned out, I loved it. The ending was the perfect ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:           So far, so good... I've just been on a bit of a "reading retreat" (with a group of good friends) and I've found this a very interesting book.   It's definitely more on the history side than the technical side, but it's definitely worth your time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was very interesting but I don't think it is necessary to give you a thorough explanation of the different methods to choose a model. If you are a professional you will have no problem choosing the right one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read about the American Revolution.   By all accounts, it's one of the most enjoyable reads I've done recently. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that the authors should have paid some attention to what I was saying in the review.   The point I am making is that, although they describe a lot about the different types of creatures that are found on the island and the creatures and people that live there, they don't talk about what the creatures look like, what their strengths and weaknesses are, etc.  They show a lot of the things that are in the book but not talk about them at all.  If you read the book and are a huge geek you will still probably enjoy the book, but I really wished that they spent more time talking about the creatures because they were really interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion this is a must read for those interested in the early Church and its growth.   "The Early Church" is an excellent study of the development of the early Christian church, particularly the growth of the monophysite position after the death of the Apostle Peter.  This is a very important book in my opinion, especially for those who want to know more about the early church's development.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really good.   The main reason I got into this book is because I was very intrigued by a book in the library that the librarian had.  They had put it on loan, and I had not gotten around to reading it yet.  So I knew this was a good thing, but I couldn't be sure I'd like it.  It's a bit like when I finally read a book because the librarians in school used to make sure I had it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  (And yes, that's the littlest hint in a review about "secret codes" in a book: a book is an object, and it's a good one to make a deal on.  That said, it is a very good book.  If you like "realistic" adventures, you will love it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a compilation of four stories about a man whose career in porn has been in jeopardy ever since a sex tape from ten years ago surfaced.   It is a pretty standard book of the type you would expect to find in a library of the bizarre:  In a recent discussion with a friend of mine, he mentioned that his ex-girlfriend (I'm guessing she's a porn star, but it could just be a girlfriend I never got to meet, or a friend I didn't get to know) had come into his room one night with a porn mag, expecting some sort of sexy threesome.  After she took a few photos and started to watch a video, the porn mag got stuck in his underwear, causing the man to yell "Whoa! That's hot!"  I always laugh at the stories in these books, but this is a bit more than I expected, with the porn star not really making much of an effort to do anything with him and then being turned down.  I wouldn't have thought it was a good idea to bring a porn magazine into his hotel room, but he sure knew how to pick 'em.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good, well written, well put together, book.   The "The Case Against Marriage: The Ten Arguments Against Marriage"   by Dr. Frank Furedi    is a good and concise look at how the institution of marriage, while perhaps being a good thing for all, is not a good idea for everyone.  Fured   seems to make the case that if you are a member of a large religion, your relationship should be kept separate and that there is a strong temptation to do so.  And I am not sure why that argument is not made in a good number of other books and magazines  .  Fiedi's "The Truth about Sex"  is an excellent analysis of the   problems   that sex creates in marriages and how they can be   changed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was very well done, and I had a wonderful time reading it. It reminded me of some of my favorite early fantasy books - like A Wizard of Earthsea, The Lord of the Rings, and some of the original editions of these classic fantasy novels.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't imagine this book being very good. It's really quite bad.   The story starts off a bit odd as a father and son argue over who's going to be responsible for bringing his son back to life. The son wants to bring him back by bringing back his corpse. The father doesn't want it to happen and keeps pushing back.  When they're finally able to agree they don't know what to do.  The son tells the father that they should be able to get over it.  We have no idea if that actually happened or not.  So that's about it. It seems like the book was written by a fan of the Twilight saga or one of the other vampire stories. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking to expand my horizons with a novel.   With the exception of the first chapter, I found everything I wanted in the first 50 pages.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great - so, so worth the read.   My favorite character was a teenage boy in the Vietnam War who used the name George.  There is a picture of him above the entry about a guy named George on my shelf ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RXJF0I ).   If you don't know a lot about Vietnam - and especially about the War - this book is the only one you will ever need. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so glad that I discovered this series by David Mitchell.   Mitchell's work is a lot more complex than a typical "themes" book.  It was a nice surprise to discover that I had always read one of his earlier books as well.  This book was a good introduction to the "man from Mars" storyline.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In my own case I can safely say that I have been able to improve my overall performance in my schoolwork.   This book is well written.  It has a certain 'artsy' feel to it that I quite like,  but there are some things about it I do not like.  For instance, it tells you exactly when you have to stop writing so that you can go to class.  I will continue to have to do that when I start writing to get my work in on time,   but it does not seem logical to me.  The teacher does mention in the book that you must take breaks, but I don't think I will always get them during the writing process.  When I was on the other hand working on my own school work  I was often on my phone,  sometimes working on it late at night.  This also seems to be a problem with many "artsy" art teachers,  because I think they need to get a little more serious about this.  One last thing,  I think the book is very helpful  but as for the book,  there are two things I don�t like about it.  First  the amount of time you get for your homework,  second  the fact that  most of the books  I saw  at my school  were written by a different author  (one by  a female author who  writes  like a male artist.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A compellingly researched book."   ~Liz Dux, author of "Haven"   I agree with what Mr. Bialy has to say, although I am a little disappointed he did not take a look at the works of Sigmund Freud in his lifetime.   --Dr. B. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very detailed history of the war, written by a very experienced military historian. It covers the battle of Crecy as well as that of the Somme in 1916, and includes many fine photos and illustrations of the battle scenes and the war period itself.   It also includes many interesting details about the leaders and the circumstances of the battles, and the personalities behind them.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The "Big Book of Practical Astronomy" has given me the confidence to go to an astronomy meeting.   The "Big List of Practicals" has helped me put together my first telescope.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is an angry, entitled brat who is determined to prove to his peers that he is the best fighter in the school. He is also a complete loser and has a constant desire to be better than anyone else.   However, as you read, you realize that he doesn't just like fighting.  It's his life.  He has a family to support.  When he is at school, he is doing homework, going to lunch and getting ready for school.  His parents aren't home enough so he has to do most of his homework at school. When his parents are home, he has trouble taking care of himself because he isn't eating well.  So, he puts his brain on fighting. If he is a normal kid who just wants to be a good person who does the right thing then he would just be a "brat".  However he is not.  When he gets the chance he jumps at it because it is a chance to prove a point about himself.  Also, he knows that he might not make friends in school, but it doesn't matter because he gets to kick a lot of ass.  This book shows the author's ability to bring out the worst in people.  The author's main intention was to have the main character get over his parents.  Unfortunately, he does the exact opposite, which results in a terrible, but amusing, ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book.   The only thing I disliked about it is that there was not enough of it.  As a general rule, I don't like reading by women.  I would read a book written by a woman but only if it is by a well-known woman.  However, the book was a little disorganized.  Some pages seemed to be just blank.  Not a big deal but I wanted to read more than just the summary.  Overall, it is a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I would say this is one of the best book I've ever read.   The concept is really interesting.  A lot of times I am reading a book, but I don't know the ending.  This book was very interesting because I didn't know who I wanted to be or what I wanted my life to look like.  As far as the story goes, the author takes us from the beginning of the novel to the end, and I never got tired of seeing what was happening.  The illustrations were very interesting. I can see myself reading this one as I am working on my college classes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of the TV series of Firefly and as I am sure many fans are as well, this is a great retelling of the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The author is good at describing the environment: the water, the rocks, the mud.   It also has descriptions of the different species of plants and how they are related to each other, what the creatures eat, how the soil is formed.  The way she describes these things makes it feel like you're in the middle of it, not just at the beginning.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really excited about this book. It was really the first one I picked up from Audible, and I liked it a lot.   It is a lot more "realistic" than the other audiobooks I've listened to, which is great because I love realistic books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Invisible Girl"   series    is by far my favorite of the " Invisible   books.   This   book   has the right amount of "you feel   sorry for this   girl" at the end.  I don't really know what's happening in the real world that's preventing these girls from seeing their family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good, concise introduction to the history of the American Revolution.   It is well researched, but the history presented is just that, a history: an overview of events, not a history of specific individuals or events.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I read this book a few years ago, I was struck by the amazing stories that were told about it.   It was one of my favorite books as a child.  Now that I have read it again,   it is clear that it is not as good as the first time I read it. In my opinion,  it has more in common with a good movie than a good story.  However  ,  the book  does have some good points. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was really excited about this book, but I'm so glad I listened to the audiobook over listening to the actual book!    The story itself is so good, and I can relate to the protagonist's pain.   My biggest problem with this book was that the main character did not seem to make a solid connection with the character named 'Joe'.   However, once I realized it, I was so happy it wasn't resolved.  My only gripe with the book is that there is one chapter that is about a whole other character called 'Catherine'.  But even that chapter isn't very good.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a nice read.   This is the fourth book by an author I have read but  I do not find that the writing of each book   is always that different.  The first three books were written by the same person.  While the first three were pretty good  I really liked the writing   in the last two books by the new writer.  It does   have   some   good   ideas in the way of a plot.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In the beginning of the book, a man is brought into a room by a woman. The woman is dressed in her best, and has a bouquet in her hand. The man is dressed, but not particularly well. He looks very sick.   His doctor is not very impressed by his appearance, especially in comparison to the beautiful woman.  They make the doctor put him on a diet, and he eats better and doesn't look sick at all.  So this may sound a little gross or ridiculous, but it's quite true, in the case of this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was initially skeptical of this book after reading the reviews, but I decided to buy it after a friend recommended it and told me he had read it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great.   It is the most comprehensive and detailed account of the history of the early American West ever written.

Also, this is the best book on this topic I have ever seen.  Thank you for making this available

Write a positive review about a good book:    So this book is really a collection of essays, not a book in the classical sense of the word.   I was really interested in the topic of the collection:  When you've been playing guitar for a while, your ears start to become very sensitive to various sounds that come through your instruments.  It's not always the bad sound you're looking for, but it's always there somewhere in the mix.  These stories are very interesting and tell a great story of the various acoustic guitars that the guys had, but they all sounded very different from each other.  When I first picked up my Gretsch, I found the sound to be very good, but the way the Gretschews sounded made me really want one (I was a diehard Strat player in college!).   If I were to have one guitar now, I would pick up a Gretsches and a Epiphones (they're basically the same guitar in different cases) just to hear how different they sound.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be quite good.   The book is divided in to five parts, so you can choose which you want to read.  It is really interesting, although I would like to have seen a bit more about the history of the war.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must read book for those who have a fascination with the early years of the Cold War.   I enjoyed reading this book and it is a pleasure to read about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very clear and logical presentation of a very common misunderstanding. It is very helpful to those who deal with people who tend to believe they have all the answers and are wrong about most everything.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been trying to read this book for some time but am never able to do so.   It is a complex subject and the details are not always straight forward.  I understand that this is a hard subject to discuss but as this book is so deep and complex I am glad that I will be able to read it once it is finished. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful story of a group of people who have discovered the art of making music together.   It is a beautiful story of love, community, and friendship.  It shows how music is a powerful, healing force in the lives of many who have never been lucky enough to learn it.  I recommend this book to all who are interested in being a part of the music scene!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fun read   For those of you interested in finding out what the world looked like when dinosaurs roamed the Earth I am highly recommend this book   This book is set in the near future when the planet is being bombarded by asteroids (I would read a lot more about it) but the science is more or less the same as in the movies "Jurassic Park" and "The Lost World".   The science is interesting and well-done.   There is also a lot of speculation about how long it will be before there is a global catastrophe caused by the meteorites but who cares   As a science geek I'm interested in the science  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read quite a bit of fiction that deals with rape.   This one did not feel like a rape novel, but I'm a little puzzled at how that's possible, because it's as if there were no rape. I found myself wondering how the rape occurred in the book: it's almost as if the woman didn't want it to happen, and so is completely passive in the face of it.  I read this while in the shower thinking about rape. It really helped me to think about it a little more honestly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this one. It's a good read from the beginning, and it has a great ending.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must-read, and an essential addition to the vast library of scholarly works on the subject.   The author covers a great deal of material in this book.  This one is a good addition to a collection of the various sources for the historicity of Jesus that is in the Public Domain. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think the book is quite good in that it gives a pretty good overview of the whole history of the subject and gives a good general picture.  It gives the history of both the Jewish and the Gentile origins of religion and provides a pretty decent overview of what we can know about the early Jews (and why we believe that they had to die for the sins of the world).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be the most enjoyable book of my career so far. It's a great read and the characters are quite relatable.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a little disconcerting to go back to the Bible at this point, but I was more than prepared for it.   I was pleased to find some new insights into the Bible that had eluded me.  I would encourage anyone who is interested in the Bible to take a look at this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was having a bad day. I got home and saw my book was missing from my bookshelf.   Then I read the introduction.  It is a good intro, but I would like it to have had more detail about what a "buddy" is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book that made me think about the various ways in which religion is "wooed" and why.   One of the points that I make is that the kind of religious thinking that leads to "believing" the paranormal is a variant of the same kind of thinking that makes us believe in fairy tales and that, in both cases, is based on an unproven claim that a miracle occurred.    "I have not lost faith in the Christian faith," I wrote.  But the more I read about the nature of the paranormal, the more convinced I became that these kinds of claims are simply the result of the failure to accept an obvious fact.  In the case of the Christian "faith" in the miraculous, we need to remember that the evidence in this case is largely circumstantial:  the existence of a dead person who spoke, the fact that a dead body was found in a box (that has been proven to be that box ), the fact of the box being found where it was intended to be found, the description of a person who is the very same as the man whose corpse was found, and the fact, mentioned in the Bible, that the dead man died in the same manner as he did before (i.e. the very way his brother would have died).   If those were the only clues to the case, it would seem very hard to believe that the case is anything other than a hoax.  The Bible does tell us that God had a son named Jesus, who was raised from the dead by God's power (although the resurrection was not confirmed until decades after his death, about a century after the supposed resurrection).  But why should we give more credibility to the fact than that?   It's a story about Jesus and his mother, who both died in childbirth.  It is not about the resurrection, nor is it about any of the other major miracles that the Bible refers to.  And it is not particularly about a dead man who was "raised" from the ground.   It seems to me that the most plausible way to interpret the Bible's references to these supernatural events is to say that we are given evidence that a supernatural event occurred, but that we do not know exactly what it was that occurred.  The Bible gives us no way to confirm or deny whether Jesus's resurrection actually occurred.   So, in that case, what is going on?  The answers are found not in what
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great introduction to "deep history" in a very readable way.   If the reader is a beginner, this book should do wonders for him/her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book.  I'm an ex-Mormon so I have had some experience with this.  It's not the same as being in the mormon church, but it can be as difficult to get past.  But it can also be a little easier.   It makes me think about the world in a different way, about how a lot of the beliefs I used to hold are wrong.  This book is a great introduction to the mormons and it shows how they see people, what they think of themselves and how they think about people who don't believe in mormons. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have now read many of the works by the "greatest living American historian" (the title is a bit of a misnomer, as he is a lesser one) and this one stands out. He shows himself to be a great practitioner of the history he studies and a teacher who can help his students to understand the context of the past.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book that I highly recommend to all the serious and avid gamers.   The stories are interesting and I like the fact that they take place in the same universe.  I don't want to spoil anything about the ending but it was definitely a satisfying experience and I can only imagine what's coming next!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I did read the whole thing over a weekend and am thoroughly enjoying this one.   "Savage Monsters" is the first in a series about the history of magic in America.  We're in a time when many people feel that magic is out of control.  I'm not sure that's quite true.  As the story unfolds, we find that magic has been in American culture since before the colonists arrived.  There were people using magic before they were white.  They found a way to harness it and use it to control the weather.  The story is good.  Some people may find it boring.  And the cover is silly.  But I think that's part of the fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   .   I am new to the world of cooking.   So far my favorites are a great steak (with the sauce) and my son's steak.  The food is good, but the cooking can be difficult.  I think I will be buying the next one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The thing that makes a good story is when there is a reason for characters to be in a place and time and action and a reason to follow them.   I always think to myself, "why did he want to go down that road?"   But I think this is another one of those moments where the plot really drives it home. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like that this book is written with a clear voice.   From my experience I've found that people who are interested in learning can be just as bad at reading as people who can't read well.  I thought my brother had an aptitude for reading (for example, his first word was "bo" before I could explain what he meant).   Although I have always wanted to be a writer,  (and  have always felt   that   the writing in   my novel is too good   )  I was frustrated that  (I  don't know how   they could   have been clearer   about   why   it was important to me that  ) he had to make up his mind about  the story before he started reading.  He never came to a conclusion so it made it impossible to know  (if you are in a situation where you can't work on writing until you finish a novel) what to do.  But he's still working on it and  (he'll probably publish the story in the next few months) I can still read it as a reference.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In a sense, this book isn't a biography at all. It's a survey of the ways in which people in power have treated homosexuals throughout history: from the Roman Catholic Church's persecution of gay Catholics, to the widespread discrimination against LGBT people in the 19th century. However, it does show a few ways in how we might respond to that prejudice.   As usual, Stroupe makes a very interesting and thorough case for how homophobia is rooted in the human condition:  This is a history of how people react to the fact that they're homosexual.  There's no doubt that it's going to inspire people to be the kind of people we want to be - even the ones we hate. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very happy with this book.   It has the feel of the real thing.  And it is all true. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good, well written book with excellent historical background. It's not hard to see the impact that the Crusades had on Western Civilization, and the book is well balanced on a number of themes.   The Crusades were often misperceived, especially as we are today, as the time of Islam's conquest of Europe. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm glad I picked this book up because I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series but I find myself not being all that interested in other series. I've always liked the way things are set up with the magic and the spells.   This book is a perfect match for Harry Potter  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really worth reading. The book is a work of historical fiction. There are some factual errors in the story, but that's really not that big of a deal.   It is still worth reading a book about the past to see what it really was like back in the day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about a year ago. It's a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    First off, I'm not a big horror fan at all. I've read a lot of them but I've never read a book in the genre where you get to see the horrors that lurk beneath the surface of the human condition, where you're the main character and the book is focused on the horrors.   It's really well written.  It focuses on the human suffering instead of the horror.  I enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a teenager, my father was always trying to teach me a lesson. He had a lot of advice and sometimes he just went out and did a job without any backup. That is exactly what he did in the field of forestry and his attitude was always that his job was for the people. He did his job, and he did it well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great guide to the new   world of electronic music.   It is very   well written and has an extensive set of   tips and   references   to other   music writing tools   and a great deal   about   this   system. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am still reading my copy of The World Without Us (a very well written novel about a young person in a world where they can no longer experience normal relationships).   There is much wisdom in this book, and I am a firm believer that human beings can change and evolve through various levels of socialisation and experience.   This book is about a group of students from another university who, after a tragic series of events, decide to spend time apart to recover themselves.  It is interesting how much they have in common and why, even though they are from very different backgrounds. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book can make a believer out of me.   The story is told from the point of view of a man named Peter, a lawyer with very poor luck.  He tries to get a good divorce, but then one day he sees a woman who looks exactly like his wife.  She seems so young.  Her name is Julie and she's so smart, yet she's lost her memory.  Peter decides he has to bring her to court.  His wife, Julie, knows about Peter's affair with a secretary.  They argue over the issue, but both keep their mouths shut about how much their marriage is costing them.  When the judge tells Peter that Julie will have to go to court and get a divorce, Peter decides that he can't let the court go against his wife for no good reason.  However, Julie does have a reason for divorce.  It's been over 10 years since she lost her memories and her husband has finally lost his too.  So, as Peter has to get through a difficult divorce with the help of his lawyer, Julie has a new opportunity: to regain her memories, as her husband does.  For me, it's a perfect way to tell the story and it was hard to put the book down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, A Good Book about a Good Book   is the best book about a bad book. I loved every page of it.   This book is not perfect, and it should have been, but it was written by someone who knew what he was doing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book. This is my first book, and I am glad I purchased this.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited about starting a new journey with this book.   For one thing, I don't normally read biographies, and  I never got around to it until now.  I'm excited to see how it goes.  For another thing, it gives the story a lot more depth.  It doesn't try to hide the fact that he has a tendency to lie, but is he also a victim of his own own lies?   He's trying to get a job as a journalist, which he has no background in, but he also doesn't want to be found guilty of something.  This is probably because he's trying desperately to make himself look good in front of the public, so that he can have a better chance at getting a good job at a major publication, and to be able to leave the country if he's found guilty.  Also, in a very similar way to the story that is in the book, his cousin killed his mother and sister after he broke his ankle (as described in the text of the book)  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book in a series, and that was an awesome choice.   The first book I bought didn't make me as excited as I was in this one.  I thought it was a bit of a step down from the previous books, but that was probably because I was expecting a big surprise in it.  However, this was still a good read.  The Book:  The book is based on the famous movie "A League of Their Own."   It is based off a book that was written by a writer that was at first an outcast because of his homosexuality.  As the book goes on, the story reveals that the writer is part of a team of people who work together and are part of the team to fight a common enemy.  In this series of novels, the author is a homosexual and part of an elite group who fight for the right to love who they want.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this novel a couple years ago and have since listened to a lot of it.   The narrator's voice, especially early in the book, has a little bit of the "languidly-pitched-acoustic-truck-voice-over" thing going on.  However, it's not a bad voice (I'm a huge fan of his work).   And it's great at conveying the story's setting (an extremely cold, barren and desolate area of northern Finland in the 1960s).  The protagonist is a lonely, self-sabotaging person.  It's not really the type of thing you tend to see in literature, but I enjoyed it a lot (and think you will, too). 
Write a positive review about a good book:       The book has a lot of good points. I just wish it was more in depth.   It has sections on different types of meditation and meditation techniques   but most of the advice is to just meditate. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book on the subject of American foreign policy.   It is easy to get caught up in the complexities of the policy choices that are being made in the post-Cold War world.  It can be very frustrating, however, to not know the history or who is who, but you will be rewarded with some very interesting insights. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I liked the ending. It was an excellent ending."    This book is an important read because it offers a much needed and very interesting analysis of the meaning and use of the Holy Spirit in Christian tradition.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read a book titled ''The Good God'' a long time ago, in the 70's or early 80's.  The author was a good person to have around when I was a teen, and he kept the church going when I wasn't there.   He helped me to remember that Jesus is Good, and not just an Angel.  He never tried to convert me, but he sure helped me realize that we don't get any closer to God by believing in Him less.   I'm not sure when I'll get around to reading it again, but I hope it's sooner than later.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so pleased to see this book in a new edition!   It is always nice to see a good introduction to some of the things we already know, but I am especially interested in the discussion about how children and women are treated.   When I was younger my mother and sister were both sex objects.  The other day my cousin and I went to a store in our town and they were very nice about it, not taking away my cousin's sense of "hotness".  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As I have been a fan of the Harry Potter series for years, I was looking forward to the new edition   of the first book   that had just been published.   I have to say,   the book is just great   The only downside to this edition  is that the pictures are no longer full page. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason that I am not giving this book five stars is not because of the ending but because of other aspects that are left out of the story:     The story of the first two days is the real drama:  He is lost; he is at the bottom of a river; he finds the keys to the boat; he realizes the boat is broken and he is helpless;  He hears a voice telling him, "Look at this; you can see how far you have fallen, and you can still swim; now you are in the water; look; there is a boat waiting for you."     The real drama here is that the narrator is the only person who sees him, hears him, and gets him out of a very bad situation.   I could probably write a whole essay on the importance of a narrator who is not in control of the narrative or is not involved in the story, but this is what I like about the narrator of this story: the reader feels like he can trust him.    I know that I cannot take a picture of myself as I am sitting on the steps of a boat at night on a dark river, but there is still the chance to be someone else, to be at a party in the park, to stand at a crosswalk, and then to suddenly hear a voice saying, "You can see the boat!"

Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about a great period in American history.   The book is divided into several parts.  Part 1   was about the establishment of the Union Army.  After the Civil War, the Union forces took a huge amount of land from the Southern states.  A lot of the land was occupied by free blacks.  In the South, the slaves were treated well by the owners, but they could not live with the whites due to the high taxes imposed on them.  As a result, they fled the states and the Union army captured most of their property.  Eventually, a small portion of the captured property was given to the freed blacks.
Write a positive review about a good book:    While this is an interesting historical account, it lacks any real insight. It's the history of the European powers that are interesting, and not the "European" power. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book starts off strong with a strong opening and ending.   This book is a good introduction to the book's style.  This is a book about the time period that was very much popular in the early 80's: The 1980's.  The setting is a large metropolitan city and it takes us back to this period.  There is a very clear story about a couple that has a baby in a hospital during a pandemic.  It is a pretty good story and it has some interesting twists.  I felt as though the ending was a little over the top (more about that later).  The story about the pandemic was definitely interesting but I would have liked a little more time to learn more about the story.  If you are interested in reading about a time when the pandemics were more of a major problem than today, this is a great choice.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was totally into this book when I started reading it, but I felt like I was missing out on a little something by the end.   This book has a few problems, but that can be chalked up to the fact that I was not a teenager when I read it.  The book was really boring for me.  Even though the character of Emma was the focus, there was nothing that I loved about her.  I had a lot of trouble picking out what Emma was thinking at any time, and that is not the case in most books.  While Emma is really young, I am still finding it difficult to get behind her character.  In the end, I was satisfied with the book, but it would have been better if the character was more mature.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The title of this book is not the only part of a great title.   "A lot of people are making a big deal about a new study saying that more than half of all US jobs will go to immigrants over the next 15 years"   and "Immigrants are the solution to unemployment. But what if they aren't?"    It sounds as if the researchers in the study are saying that the US should adopt a "new model" of immigration that has no place for immigrants who are skilled or who are likely to be well integrated.  If true, this would indeed be bad news for the United States.  There are lots of reasons why that is not so.  First, immigrants are not "taking jobs" from Americans.  They are just taking jobs from less-educated, less-experienced, less productive Americans.   Second, the number of "non-college graduates" in the US population is falling rapidly.  If we look at the data for 2000 and 2009, the share of the working-age population who is employed is falling:  from 67 percent in 2000 to 59 percent in 2009.  It's not as though these non-college "graduates" were taking jobs that the "college graduates had" 10 or 20 years ago.  Third, the decline in the working age population is only the latest in a long line of negative changes for the US working-aged population.  For example, from 1960 to 1980, the working years of the US elderly population increased by a factor of eight.  Then, starting in 1980, working-ages fell for three consecutive years, and in 1992, a long period of "baby boom" retirements put a very painful squeeze on the working days of the elderly population. In addition, the rise in the elderly working-day population is driven by baby boomers and the number in their age group is increasing.  A new report from the Congressional Budget Office   in 2010    estimated that the elderly would increase their working-days by about two years in the coming decade.  This decline in employment in the United State's non-working-age populations is not unique to the US economy.  All major industrial countries have experienced declines in the number and the working hours of their non-employed populations.  As the chart below shows, the non-work of these populations is declining in many other countries:  The chart shows the number working non-fam
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would love a good children's book written by a woman for children.   She is well versed in various cultures and knows how to portray each ethnic group to make it seem like a complete package.  She knows how important her characters are to her readers.  I am excited to read her next book, which should be the third in her "The Children of the Forest" series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking for a book that taught us the ins and outs of the computer networking business and stumbled upon "Introduction to Networking: Principles, Protocols and Protocol Design".   It covers everything from the "I'm so over it!" rant to the "that's why you should be a network designer" (no I'm not going to go and do that.  )   It was just so much fun!

Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband has a serious soft spot for the "Star Wars" films.   He knows about all of them, but he'll be the first to admit that he doesn't really like "The Force Awakens" and probably won't buy it unless he gets some other movies. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good introduction to some of the basic ideas in the field of information theory and its application to various areas. It is not a very mathematical book, but does use a good deal of intuition to make its points. The best part of the book is not the mathematics.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I've had a book on my shelf for a year.   I still need to reread it before I can say it is worth the read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a good novel in the true sense of the word. I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to say that my only real criticism would be that you leave out a lot of the less obvious stuff (such as the way he used to make people look for "the missing girl" in a crowd, and then in the next sentence he just mentions a group of guys "playing a stupid game").   It was just so  obvious!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was excited about the second book in the Wheel of Time series, but found it a bit dull.   The characters were interesting, but I liked the setting of the story better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was excellent: I thought it would be an interesting and thought provoking book but, as with most books that use the Malthusian concept, the author does not go far enough.   The book is very short but the authors attempt to provide some interesting background on the concept, and it would have been useful to see an equation in a book to calculate the future population of the planet.  The basic problem is that the planet's population is ineluctably increasing and is increasing even faster than food production. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters were interesting. I like how the family came together to make this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a book, The Big Lie is brilliant.   It is also the first book I've seen about the holocaust that is not about the Holocaust itself (The Red Badge of Courage by Deborah Lipstadt, The Holocaust by Anne Frank and The Unspeakable by Robert Faurisson are great books about the subject, but don't dwell on it).   I haven't read the other two by Faurissons, but I have read a couple of his earlier books:  An American Holocaust: The Making of the Nazi Death Camps by Robert Melson The Holocaust in American Life by Robert Fr.  There are a few typos, but it's a very good book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a classic story of a young girl, who in her innocence is trying to escape the oppression of her family's abusive slave master. She gets into all kinds of trouble, and is very nearly beaten to death by her own family.   But she has a sympathetic guide, the only other woman in the world who really understands her situation, who is able to guide her through the trials she goes through, and give her a better idea of what life really is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this one because the first part gives us a good idea about the place that the characters find themselves in.   It starts off with a guy who is trying to get laid in a small rural town and he ends up finding himself in a bigger town with a bigger problems.  The second part has a good look at the place where they are going (a big city) and a bit of the way things work there (a small town).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have only recently discovered this book and love it  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I first read "A Book of Shadows" about fifteen years ago.   The main characters were a family of vampires, led by a vampire matriarch who was my mother.  She seemed to be the kind of vampire who would go out of her way to kill people.  It was hard to imagine her as a mother, though   her blood was so strong.  So, I never liked her until I read this book.  "A Bloodbath is Not Enough"   It's a short book, but I still think it is very powerful.  The narrator is very well developed.  He talks about his mother a lot and his father a little less so.  A good companion for young kids.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters were well drawn and had great chemistry.   If you are a fan of anime or any kind of manga then you will want to read this manga. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As with most of the great non-fiction books I read on the internet or at book stores this book was a real eye opener for me.   From talking to a number of people who have dealt with sexual predators, abusers, pedophiles etc   I was very surprised at the lack of sympathy and the lack the the understanding of how bad the crimes were. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm just going to say what I feel about this book: There are some parts in this book that just don't sit right with me.   In a way, it just reminded me of the first book in the series in a way that makes me angry:  One of the main characters says,   " It's been awhile since a man of faith could look me in the eye and say the word,  "  That sentence alone got me mad.  I had been through that book,  and I can honestly say that that book was more painful and frustrating to me because I was feeling so bad.  It's almost like the author just wants to point out that he's been through a lot of different trials in his life and is just so used to it.  This book was the exact opposite.  The one sentence just makes me want to run screaming. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, although it might not be what you're looking for if you like books that have you looking up more material.   It was well-written for a college student with a very limited vocabulary, so it's easy to find relevant information that can be helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very detailed, well written, and well researched book, with much practical information about getting a "snow job" in the New England woods. It also has an interesting discussion about the differences between the early settlers, early New England fur traders, and the early English pioneers.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was excited about this book, until I started to realize that the stories weren't based on facts or research but instead, on the stories of my family, which is how I learned to read.    But after finishing the book and seeing the errors, I was disappointed because I have a feeling that the book might be more entertaining if it focused more on the science. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best books I've ever read. The premise of the book is so cool.   It takes a bunch of different things in the world and puts them in a way that is believable, yet totally different and in a really cool way.  I wish I had read this book before I got married, and that I could still see my future with the help of this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best review I have read so far:  So, if you've never played this, it's a 2d platformer based on a game on the Dreamcast.   You control a small animal, and you can change its abilities (jump, dash, jump higher, more health, etc).   It takes a good amount of time to get the hang of it.  It is pretty easy to learn the controls.  I did find that the camera wasn't perfect.  This game has a ton of content.  You can play with 8 animals.  There are 3 levels with various animals to choose from, and each level has a special animal and its abilities.  The only thing that is the same, is the camera (but it is fixed, and so is the angle).  There is a small story to go along with it, and that has some kind of interesting thing going on in the background.  Overall, this game is very enjoyable, and is easily the best platformer I've played since Banjo Kazooie. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in a day after completing a series of interviews with a group of men in the military.   The group is from a highly respected and influential military organization and they have been involved in planning a very difficult operation: a mission that is so difficult that all the other participants have lost the will to carry it out.  I am surprised at how much I  felt like an outsider in  the interview with them.  A good friend of mine had served in  that operation and had the opportunity to participate in it but refused to do so. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    So what can I say that hasn't been said before about a great book?   This book is as much about the people as it is about the work, it is a memoir written from the perspective of one of the people behind a great movement that has been going on for a long time and has never received the attention it deserves.   That movement is a long lost art form called "The Silly Sitter" a dance that is considered to be a part of African culture but was taken from them by Europeans.  There are more of these Silly Sitters in the American Southwest, and the history behind the movement is rich, with people from different cultures coming together to recreate the dances and music they used to perform.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I'm still a newb when it comes to reading books, so this took me a bit of time, but it paid off. It's written in a very casual way but has the real depth you're looking for in a good read."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, written by one of the best modern-day explorers (and first person explorers, really) of the planet Mars, contains information and photos that many (myself included) who have studied Mars before might have found hard to understand or appreciate.   The book covers a wide range of the terrain on Mars, including its volcanos, its polar ice caps, its rocky terrain, its mountains, and its many craters.    It explains how these craters form, which is important when contemplating a mission to Mars.  It describes the different kinds of craters, which are important because they vary so greatly in size, from the small impact craters that you might see on the Moon, to the larger ones that can be seen on Mars.      It also describes how the craters formed.  This is important because you might want to put a lander in an impact crater, but not if you want to avoid the hazards that would occur in such a situation, because it would be impossible to move a large lander around the crater without triggering one of its many cratering processes.  The author includes an extensive discussion of the impact processes on Mars and gives an account of how scientists have attempted to understand them, even using data from the Viking landers.  If you can understand how the processes worked, then you can better appreciate how the cratering process works on Mars as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My kids are still too young to understand the full value of good food.   I learned a lot from this book: the basics about cooking and the importance of choosing fresh fruits and vegetables when possible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My family and I were raised in a religious family where the Bible was the most holy book on earth.  It was hard for us to put down the holy book once we finally got to read it.  We went through a bunch of copies when we were growing up and still found plenty of places that were difficult to understand, but still gave us insight into God's ways.   The more I learned about Christianity and the Bible the more I liked it.     I wish I had started with the first few chapters to give me a little more insight into the Bible and Christian beliefs.  I also learned a lot about how God works through his creation and uses man in his own way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The "Fairytale of New York" is an engrossing and fascinating book about New York City, specifically its nineteenth century immigrant groups, that offers many striking insights.   As an example,   the immigrant Chinese community in New York   had a culture of its own, and was very strong in the 1820s.  This may be a bit surprising to most people who think of Chinatown as just a place for Chinese immigrants.  But that's what makes the book such an outstanding read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First off, I really enjoyed this book.   One of my favorite characters in a book is Theodora.  If you haven't read the series you will love this book a lot.  But most importantly, there are some great character development here. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book helped me in the very difficult task of finding a good English textbook to use in my university class.   It covered the basics of grammar and word structure.  I've also used the book as a teaching aid, and have helped others learn the language by pointing out some of the mistakes.  It's quite clear that you're supposed to read carefully and use grammar to understand what's being said. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An interesting read in a book that is pretty far removed from my experience with meditation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so happy that I finally picked up this book.   The story is so beautifully told.  You really get to see what it's like to live as a prisoner.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very good book.   The title of the book,    makes it sound like it's some kind of propaganda,     but it is a well written book. There is some propaganda in it, but only because the writer knows that the government isn't telling the whole story about the attack.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The art in this book is quite beautiful. I love the fact that she didn't include a bunch of little character sketches or drawings.   I really like the fact the authors were so interested in who her father is, and that's why she picked him out to name her and I like that they do mention his name at the end.  Another book for the young adult set. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am going to go out on a limb and say this book is a very good one. It is definitely better than I was expecting it to be.   It was a good read, as far as science fiction goes, and the plot was well thought out. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.   It takes you on a journey through the different phases of your child's development and allows you to see how each one contributes to the larger picture.  It is wonderful to think about how you can help your child grow up into a happy, healthy person, and how each phase of development can help us achieve that goal.  If your child is having a hard time with a particular phase of her development, this book might just be able to help. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a time when I feel the world is being ruined by people who say they "know how to make a buck," I'm glad that there are still a couple of people who understand the value of a good work of history and a good idea.   For example:  I have been watching PBS for a while. It is always interesting to watch a story like the Waffen-SS in WWII.  The Nazis had a big base in the town of Wiltz, near Stettin. The base consisted of a barracks and several buildings. During WWII, the base was used by the SS to train young recruits. The barracks were occupied by the Wunderwaffe SS, the organization responsible for training the Waffe SS. The building was converted by the Germans to a shelter for soldiers during the war. After the war, a young SS officer had the idea to convert the building to a restaurant. It was a popular restaurant in the SS base during the Cold War.  I can't wait to go back to Wiltzbach and check out the restaurant.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have always wanted to write a story about a child in a foster home, but I've never really had the time or energy to do so.   When I was a child I used to ask my grandmother about all the foster homes she knew, the kind that cared about them, not just looking out for them.  So this story of a foster kid made me want to do that kind of thing myself!   I really think that these kinds of stories should be written and shared.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I had some real problems with it.   I have some problems with these things,  but   This book   was the first one I put my eyes on   that actually dealt with the origins of Islam as a religion.  I  didn't really believe what I was being taught in church   or   my local Muslim leader (a convert)  but then   the religion of Islam   changed and   there   seems   to be some   similarities   with Judaism   and that's when the seeds   started to sprout   about   some similarities  with Christianity   ( I mean the Book of Revelation   is talking about a   virgin   who   fell   before   Abraham )   but     It doesn't matter   because   it's the same religion.   "

Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read - but I'm a bit surprised at the plot.   This book is set up to appeal to a particular sort of fantasy reader, one who can easily slip back into the world of "Old School."   If that describes you, you may appreciate it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a son who has severe learning disabilities. He uses a wheelchair, and he also has a hearing aid, and so this book was great!   This book talks about the disability, and about how we can overcome the handicaps that we may have, and we should.   It shows you how to do things, how you can move around a store or a car, and get around, as well as how to use the things you have in your hand,   and the different ways to use your hearing aid.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a nice example of the good old "theory of everything".   The first chapter is about the concept of "the mind as a computer" which is in my opinion one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of science. The whole idea was invented by the Hungarian mathematician G. J. Jánosz, and it's very interesting to see how many people were inspired by it.   A long time ago I was reading about an idea that Jánosi was a big fan of, namely the idea that the brain is a universal computer, which has some very basic features like associative memories, pattern recognition, and so on.  He's written about this before, so I'm not going to quote him on the subject.  Another very interesting concept that he talks about is that there is a lot of information in your brain and a very important thing about your brain is that it has lots of redundancy.  As a result of that redundancy, a lot information is actually generated when you think.  It's basically because you can't just do all the same things all the time, because you have to adapt to different things.  One of the main points that he makes is that your brain adapts by "taking in more information" while your body doesn't.  So if you read a lot and don't read any (you've been brain dead for so long), then the brain will start generating less information, because a lot is being used as memory and the brain doesn't have time to read it. So the brain has a lot less information to process, so it has to adapt.  To get a clearer picture, here's an example:  Suppose you're reading a text you're supposed to be able to recognize (like a dictionary), and then you think of a new word, which the dictionary has never taught you.  This creates a new knowledge in your mind.  That new knowledge comes from two sources, your own experience, and the information you've been storing in memory.  The former is represented by your sense of smell (which is very good at recognizing new words), the latter by your brain's memory. The brain has enough information in its memory, so after a while it stops producing as much information as it used to.  Now your brain needs new information to replace what it's used to, so that's what you end up doing.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This was one of the first books I read after getting to know my new book bag.   The book had a lot of great information about each section of the bag, and I am going to make a list of things I wish I had done differently:  First, for the inside tag that says "the only one to do it" that is completely unnecessary (the same goes for the zipper and bag clips).   Second, I wish there was a little more information about the various colors of materials in the bag. For instance, in the picture above, there are some white tags on one of them.  Third, in my book, I like to have a little space between each of my books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had heard about this book from an acquaintance and I loved the idea so I picked it up.

I read about two or three books about gun safety in the last month or so so I'm a bit slow witted when it comes to my guns    There's plenty of great information to keep me safe but not everything that the author says about guns is true.  The most important part about this is the "inconvenient fact" that there are more guns in private hands than in public ones   The gun was in the house, but it didn't belong to me

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about 10 years ago in a group of about 10 people who did not read much.   It was an introduction to the history of the Russian Orthodox Church and also a good introduction to Eastern Christian liturgical and devotional practices in the US.  The book makes it seem like we are really getting a glimpse of what they are doing in the USA. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. It was easy to follow, and it was well done.   It's the first time I've been able to read a book about the Civil War that is also about the North and the South   that gives us a good look at the Civil war from both sides and gives you insight into the people involved in the war. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have the books of the "Keenan Chronicles."   It's a fun read.    "Sons of the Dragon"   is about two siblings, one who can't die (because the other is alive) and one who will die at some point (because he is still living).

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book, but one criticism I might make about it is that the narrator is very stiff in her delivery.   It is very unusual for a non-fiction book to have a narrator so stiff in his or her manner. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In one of the best stories I've read in a long time, Larking Up in the New World is a fantastic new fantasy that takes a hard look at the nature of religion, the consequences of religious wars, and the nature and dangers of technological magic.   This novel is a bit slow, but the story is strong enough to hold its own against the fast pace that many of my other fantasy read are now running. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The stories in "The War Against Boys" are really powerful.   One thing that I really appreciated about this book is that it provides real-life information that is not usually shared in the mainstream media.  There are some really powerful stories here that all readers should know about.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I've read a book that had a very interesting concept and the story kept me coming back for more.    The world building is solid and there is a lot to think about, but the execution is weak in places, and the characters don't quite do much either.

Write a positive review about a good book:      I read this book while on vacation in Maine.   This book gave me so much more than I expected.  The book begins with the author's experience with depression.  He's struggling with the idea that he will never be able to stop thinking about his wife.  She is dead.  It is a pretty sad book but it gives him a lot of insight into his thoughts.  I also learned a lot about his own mental illness.  This is a good introduction to the concept of the bipolar spectrum.  While the author is not a professional psychiatrist (that's for professionals) he did get to talk to a few people with the diagnosis and I hope this is helpful to those who have bipolar disorder.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have never read a science fiction book so well written or so well researched and thought-provoking  .   It has a good blend of the real with the future   and it's very well-written, well-researched and a great read

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read and enjoyed a lot of John Barth's essays on the New Testament, so this is no surprise to me.   Barth has the right answer about the Gospel's origin.  He is an old-style Christian.  While some evangelicals are like that (and that's a good thing), Barth has a good sense of how the New Evangelization works.  It is not really a mystery that the evangelists were all Jews, or that Jesus made many appearances to a small group of Jews in a city that was very Jewish, or any of that.  They were using a Jewish framework.  But Barth thinks that there was an extra ingredient.  The story of Jesus in Matthew is the story of a charismatic leader that is more than a good story, but a great story.  I think that's an interesting idea, though it doesn't really fit in with Barth's views, which are about Jesus as a good prophet but not a good man.  Barth does a good job of putting a positive spin on Matthew, though, especially in the part about Jesus going to his father's tomb.  In this chapter Barth makes some interesting points about the relationship between Matthew and Paul.  That is, why do these two separate accounts agree so much on the content?  One thing Barth makes clear in this chapter is that there is no real reason to assume that Matthew knew Paul very well or was influenced by him.  Because Matthew was not in any way influenced by Paul, it's possible that the two accounts were written from two different points of view.  Why would the gospel writers write such completely different accounts about the same historical event?  Barth's answer:  In all three accounts, there is a story that is almost the same about a woman meeting a very famous and charismatic man who promised her that he would make her a living angel.  For both Matthew and Mark, Jesus appears to her, and the two of them talk about their meeting.  If you read the two stories very carefully, it is clear that Matthew does not claim that the encounter occurred in Galilee, but in the city of Jerusalem.  This is why you get two accounts, both about the appearance, with similar events but different places.  Both Matthew and Luke write that the woman and the man went to a room that was set aside for the apostles.  Matthew tells us that the man was a "great scholar" and a man with extraordinary gifts, whereas Luke says that

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a book called "Holly: Her Life and Other Essays" on sale on Amazon about a month ago and I was totally hooked.   The book is written by the wife of the founder of HollyHolly.com, I think.  I have not been able to read a novel in a while so I started with "Hollies."   It is very different than HollyHollys.com.  It starts off slow but you learn a lot about her in the first few pages.  If you can get over that it is a great novel and I really recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got to read this book in late May and finished it in early June.   The novel is in a very traditional genre, and that is a good thing.  It is not too "high brow" and it does not have the pretentious overtones of something like The Lord of the Rings  .   It has all the classic elements that you'd expect from a good fantasy: magic, war, politics and quest.  I also enjoyed the book because I never really got into the characters in the first place.  And there are a few good ideas in here. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I did read " The Black Swan " before starting this one. It wasn't until I started this book that I realized the similarities between the books and how much the writing reminded me of " The Emperor Wears No Clothes ".  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a student of history and politics, I read this book in order to learn about the great debates, such as between the "free market", "socialism" and "capitalism", and how these are not mutually exclusive (though I didn't find either of those to be a particularly accurate characterization of the world we live in).   The world of the 17th century was not much better than ours now in a lot of ways; slavery was still in existence and slavery was often the main driver of the economy, and a great deal of the population was poor (some were slaves for life and could not own their own property).  For a free market to function, the poor and working class would need to be able to own a great portion of the means of production, and many of the people most likely to be poor would be illiterate, so there would not be much opportunity for a free trade to work for the benefit of the poor.  Many of the wealthy merchants and wealthy individuals who were most actively engaged in politics were either wealthy merchants or slave owners.   I'm glad that I read a book like this, that is not simply about an argument for one specific system or another, because I think it gives us all an opportunity to think about what we might consider a good economic system, and why we might not think that way.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I think the book is a bit of a stretch for me, but I don't know about most people.   This book has a great plot, but the book could have been more fleshed out.  I'm not saying there is a lot of fleshing out, because there is, but it could have used a little more.  It's very close to being a spy novel, in the sense that spies try to infiltrate.  While this was an attempt at the same, the spy book did a better job of telling us what makes the spies tick, and who really gives a rat's ass about the big plan. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is just about the best book about the U.S. Civil War I have read.    I feel as though I have been through it all before and I hope I never have to. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The whole "buzz" about this book was a bit of a letdown, especially since I had read the prior two in one sitting.   But even more disappointing was the final chapter (which didn't need it at all):   It was really an effort to find just the right amount of detail about the story so as not to come away thinking that it was some sort of modern-day version of the first half.  And it doesn't.  I was hoping that the first part might have been about her discovering some of the facts of her life as a scientist but it isn't really.  She is still studying them as if they were new information.  This is one of those books that doesn't really give any satisfying closure and leaves you a bit unsatisfied.  It is all just "the journey to the stars" or something and, well, we are on a journey. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was one of the best books I've read about human-animal relationships in all of science fiction (or horror, for that matter).     The book is about a species that is so primitive that it has no sense of time but can still be trusted to kill its victims for food and/or pleasure.   The book describes a species with two very distinctive and distinct personalities - one that is very nurturing and protective, and one that has a dark and sinister side.  The two characters who inhabit the book are, of course, the protagonist and antagonist - two very different people in almost every way.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is good, but I'd read a lot more if I could find a copy (I live in the UK).    I was quite taken aback by the tone and content of the book.   It's clearly written for adults who are somewhat detached from the life of a typical teenager (I'm not), but the "rules" that are applied to what goes on and what shouldn't goes on  can be a bit restrictive and judgmental.  I found myself wanting to have a good laugh while reading it, but then thinking "what am I reading about?

The narrator is a little more detailed than in the others in this series but she manages to keep the story focused. I don't know how she knew what I needed or wanted, but she did.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this one after having read The Little Mermaid   by Hans Christian Anderson  .   While the latter was a good read   (and one of my favorite films of all time), this is a much better book .   The plot is simple, and the characters are well-drawn , and I found myself laughing at the various scenes   in which Andersen is caught.  The illustrations are excellent  -- I found that the illustrations really enhanced the scene. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters are a nice change of pace from some of the more well known fantasy characters, although it is mostly focused on two: Harry and Hermione.   It has a few very strange bits, and some of them are kind of out there, but they get explained and brought back into the light very quickly.  The best part about the story, for me, is the humor.  It's great, I laugh so hard reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a lifelong fan of science fiction and fantasy.   It is a genre which I have never been able to get into.  But a few years ago,  I read one of my favorite series, The Wheel of Time,  and was blown away by it.  It was like a cross between a science-fiction novel and a fantasy novel.  This is one of the most popular series I have read and  It has also been mentioned in a few  great   movies.  I wanted to read the other books of the series, but I was afraid to.  The Wheel  of  the   Lord of Chaos   series was the one that inspired me to learn to write fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little nervous about reading this because it is a book that has been recommended to me multiple times on various occassions and has made a significant impact on my life.  I finally decided to bite the bullet and give it a try.   The book tells the story of a young girl with an undiagnosed illness (she has a condition called Dementia Praecox ) and her mother, who goes to the doctor to find out what is wrong with her daughter.  The mother does not know that her daughter has Dementian Disorder and does not realize that the disease is being treated with powerful pharmaceutical drugs.  This is just the start.  There is a strong feminist message as well, as we see the impact that medications have on our society.

I am a little bit skeptical about the theory of the  "Great Reformer"   which has been put forward by the Church since its inception in the 4 th   century, but in this book by C. S. Lewis, the arguments are more nuanced and a lot of them are convincing.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been looking to read a book on the history of the Mennonite Church for a while now.   The first I read was by James E. Jenson which I liked, though it was more of a general historical history of Mennonites  than a good biography of any particular individual.  He also gave a good summary of the current situation and then got into a little history about the M.L. church before being sucked into a lot of detail about what the MCL says about this.  I was looking for some other book that covered this period,  something from an academic perspective but with more insight and more emphasis on the historical role of the churches.  When I found  that title  (in the Molloy Library, I assume),   I knew I wanted to read the book.  It has a good general history,  but it has a couple chapters that aren't terribly relevant and that are also long.  One of them is about the beginnings of M.I. and I found it rather repetitive.  One of the chapters is a little less so, about the church in the 1840s.  The church in M.C. was a good one but it's worth reading the details about it  about the early days of it before the division into the two branches.  After this, there is a good history of how the divisions started and a good discussion about how the MBC came to split (although I'm not sure why it didn't happen before the 1830s).   One of the things I liked about this book, which was the only thing I thought was worth reading, was how Jenson's work dealt mostly with the Miamis and their culture rather than the Ml Churches.    He is very critical of the way they treated women (he even wrote a book about it)  and they were much more focused on the culture of the farming communities where they came from than the culture in the cities.  Jenson is a professor of history, but he also gives a lot more information on these communities than is usually given.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The   is so important, it   will   prevent   some   problems   that   other   books   might   create.       This   was a very   important   lesson   I   learned as   a   young girl   with   her family  .   It   has   made a . a very. good   impression on   my   attitude   towards   others.    
Write a positive review about a good book:    While this one is a good read, it is by no means perfect:  As a result of a bad night's sleep and a good night's rest, I woke up this morning, after a week off, having been completely and totally unable to think.   A bad night of sleep and two good nights of rest are almost never good things, especially when you think you're sleeping well.  I think that when I woke this morning I had a pretty good sleep the night before because of my bad night last night, but I'm not exactly sure about my previous "good" sleep.  This isn't too much of a problem though, because when I saw the title on the back cover, I thought I might get a great read from this book: The Dark Half: A Journey of Faith and Terror   The first few pages were nice, but the rest of the book pretty much sucked, mainly because the premise sucked.  However, I liked the premise that I thought was interesting.  The author did a good job making a convincing case for a religion that is more than just superstition. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have heard of some of the books from the series but never actually got to read them until now   And now that I have,   it's very very good  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was excited about the book because it was a sequel to the previous book by the same author.   My first book in the series was a hit, so the sequel looked like it would be too.  But, the book itself was good.  The characters felt real.  They were believable and had real feelings.  It was easy to tell when someone was acting or not.  I am pleased that we are seeing a new perspective on things from the people who are still in the room. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The original title for the book was  The Great Catacomb Catastrophe: Catacombs in the United States  which is what I thought until I saw the subtitle. It wasn't until reading the book that I realized there were three catacombs and that they were actually called Catacombs. The only one I am interested in seeing is in the Northeast in New England but that is another story altogether. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't recommend this book enough.   The only things I can say I didn't like is: 1) I don't like it when a book makes you feel guilty about being a lesbian.  I don' t think they could be as popular if they didn' t give me that feeling.  2) I thought the ending was a bit anticlimactic.  3) I'm not sure if the author had any idea that people would think she made it up as she went along. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, this is the best work of speculative fiction I've ever read.   The plot is simple and yet the story has a depth I wouldn't normally associate with such a story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a long time reader of the books of Thomas B. Costain.   Costain's writing has always impressed me and this book has been an exceptional addition to my collection.  It is a very important book for the study of the New Testament and it also is an excellent study of a difficult period of New Testament history.  I recommend it highly to students of the Bible.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not a fan of the original Harry Potter books, but they've inspired me to read a lot more.  The Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is better than the movies in several ways.    The story keeps the focus on Ginny rather than Harry, and it gives Harry some time to deal with his past.  I liked this story better than Harry and the Deathly Hallows (though I did still enjoy that one).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. The author makes the argument that the US is a democracy, that democracy was meant to be a peaceful system with each person trying to make the world a better place. She uses history, the present, the recent past and the future as examples to prove her point. While I agree with her, I think her examples are a bit off.   In the United States there are only five justices on the Supreme Court (the same number as there were on the 4th US circuit court before the 14th amendment).   This is a bit silly, but a couple of points: 1) the court system is just too broken in some places to be able to set up a democracy in one county.  2) The current court system in America has been in place for almost 100 years, so we are basically at a point where the political system is established and that the other areas need to catch up.  3)    We don't need to change the system. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking for a way to practice with a sword, but didn't want to pay for any. This is exactly what I wanted:  It has everything I need to be a decent swordsman.   Very easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    For a newbie to the world of writing, this book gave me something to write about. The story is interesting and well written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is written with a clear purpose to give a very informative view of how a computer works. It is written to help you understand how computer chips work and also is a good reference for people who want to do research on a computer.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received a copy of the book to review because I had wanted to read it for years and finally purchased a copy from the library.   While I love the book, there were a couple of things that did bother me about it: (1) the title was a bit of a stretch; (2) the author claims he is an atheist but then makes a number of references to his faith. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book interesting and easy to read. The author is not shy about admitting that she is a historian. I like to find that out about a historian who does not have a Ph.D., and she has. I would also have liked it more if the author could have gone into some more depth about the role of women in the 19th Century and during that time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read.   I enjoyed reading   How to Win Friends and Influence People.   The book is well-written, and although a bit difficult to read due to its length, the advice is interesting and I hope the reader has a good life experience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a good source for the basics of the theory of the quantum state.   This book is written by a physicist and physicist is a technical field that does not have a good reputation in the literature. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My first encounter with the books was on a flight from NY to LA in '93.   After reading a few paragraphs about the books being on a plane, I decided I had to buy a copy.  I am very happy I did.  In a world where books are too expensive to own, this is a great read  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The title gives this book a different feel to it than any other I have read in that genre. The title of this book is   a tribute to the author   of this novel.   It is a well-written and engaging story, one that I think many readers would enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a sea of crappy fantasy, I thought this was pretty good.   There were a few parts I thought were a little hard to follow, but as a whole it was a pretty good book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book and I think that a lot of people out there need to read it.   I thought I would have a hard time getting through it but   it is a really good book  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a professor of English, and my students love this book.   "I'm a Professor in Residence at Harvard University in the College of Arts and Sciences."   Who didn't love that?   A professor can say, "I have an undergraduate student in my class.  She's a bright young woman.  And I love her very much.  So do you, dear reader."  And then, "So here's the situation.  The undergraduate student  is a good student.  She's very good at her work.  But there's something  wrong with her personality."  In that case, how do you make a good impression?  I read the first chapter about her.  Then, when we went to a meeting of the American Psychological Association (which is about as good a place as any to have the first meeting of anything),   the professor said,  "So, do you all think we should be doing some more in this area?"   Well, that's a good question.  He didn't go in with a theory.  In fact, he didn't say,   anything.    He simply said, "We should do more."  This is exactly what we want our students to see in us.  When they see a good professor, they know that he or she is making a difference in the life of students.  We're just trying to make the most of our life as a teacher.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book takes place over the course of several years, as the characters begin to encounter things that only occur in movies and television.   A large part of this book is the exploration of the idea that we are all movies (and, at least in my case, television) now, and we all have our favorite characters.  There is even a character who is an actor whose career is basically based on playing a character in a movie, and who is constantly trying to recreate that role.  It is a very interesting way to look at our experiences and desires in the form of a movie or a television show.  I will probably re-read this one in a year and add a few comments (hopefully at the end) that will further explain why I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I can remember when I first started reading this book.   It was my first time reading a book where the author has a strong, unique voice.  It's like someone writing a screenplay that's so different that it's not very memorable but also different enough to be compelling and interesting.  I read it over a year ago and I've yet to come across another novel where the narrator has this sort of voice and personality.  There's something really appealing about him but I don't have a particular favorite.  When I started this book I was curious about where he was going, how he had arrived in this place, but I didn't get the same satisfaction I did with the book  that I was anticipating when I started.  Still a good read and I'm looking forward to reading more from her.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very interesting, even though I am not a mathematician by any stretch of the imagination.   This is a mathematical toolkit that has been well thought out and presented.  In addition to being good at mathematical proofs, this book is also quite good at teaching basic principles of math: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorite   novels and   is one of my top three favorite books ever.   And I'm very glad   I   like it  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was really good and i loved every aspect of it.   It takes you on a journey into some very interesting people and what it takes to get on their good side.  I think that in the end the book is about finding your own voice, finding a place where you are comfortable, and finding happiness.  It really was a very good book, but the ending left me a little sad. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book on Islam and is well researched and presented in the best way possible.   - David D. Roodman, Author 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In case you're interested, the book is in the public domain, so there are lots of free ebooks that cover the same topic as this one: "How to Use Computers."   This is the best book I have ever read about how to use the computer.   I learned a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I am not a huge fan of this book because I found it a bit dry. The plot, although well presented, was a bit of a bore. It seemed to be a bit too easy for him, or maybe just a little bit of "Harry Potter" at its heart. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The last two sections of this book are the best parts, and the most interesting.   When I was a young girl and reading this book, I did not feel that I was being taken advantage of by the man, nor did I feel that he was acting for any reason.  That said, I think I would have gone along with this for a while.  In retrospect, it seems like this wasn't a bad idea at all.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the series - the first one has this creepy but awesome story about a young woman who is kidnapped and put in a small cabin with a few other girls, one of whom is a very creepy old woman, and is forced to watch them kill each other.   It's really awesome to read about a girl with a "special" and "special places"  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of those gems you know you will love, but will you actually read it? Well, I did and I am really glad I did.   It is a very easy read, the chapters cover a number of different topics.  It covers all the basics you will need to be proficient in any language and even has a short vocabulary section which is helpful.      I really appreciate the little explanations for many of the vocabulary words. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason why we read.   This is one of the few books that have kept me reading when I felt like going off my diet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "In the past, I've always found it a bit irritating when my work was the first to be available to the public."   A very good book by a well-known historian, the story of the Vietnam War is well told.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book for someone who wants a general introduction to quantum mechanics, particularly the early chapters.   Some parts are "light" reading, but there are also "heavy" chapters. The "heavy stuff" is important for those interested in developing a sound understanding of quantum mechanics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I had read this book before I got a job at a local bank, I probably would have stayed at home to cook my own food.   I love reading about food (yes, it is the healthiest food around!) and I enjoy cooking (yes I do), but I do not have the patience to get to that point.  I do plan to start cooking a bit more often.  This book will not only teach you about the different types of meat, but will also give you a few ideas on how to make it taste good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good read and has a lot to offer, especially for those who enjoy science fiction and the "alien-is-us" phenomenon.   It is very well researched, well written, and even has a little fun in it at times. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received a copy of "The Little Prince" in the mail. I have not been reading any of the children's books in the series. This one is pretty good and fits with the rest of the books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book in January to use in my English 101 class. It is very useful in helping to learn some basic phrases and grammar from an interesting author.   The author uses colorful words and pictures throughout the text to communicate the importance of grammar.  The writing style is very interesting, too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read!   It's an excellent story about a young man who is so full of potential and courage, but also so clueless about what to do with that potential, about what it means to be a good person.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a long time to read this book, but I kept coming back to it. I liked it.    It really helped me to get a more positive view about Buddhism  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.   It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than most non-fic novels.  I read a lot of non-fiction and this book is really the only one that made me say "wow"   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book if you are interested in learning about the origins and development of the Jewish religion. It does a good job of explaining the early stages, the controversies, and what is interesting about this history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are a lot of books I enjoy.   I really enjoyed this one too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book.   In my opinion, it's the most informative book you'll ever get on how to develop your own ideas.  I'm really curious to see how she gets to the bottom of it all. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really, really good read.   It was pretty easy to follow because the authors (Dawson, Hilde, and Eichler) all had the same experiences and the same opinions (they were all in the same situation)   What really set this book apart from other "how to deal with an angry dog" books is that they all had different approaches   They all felt that their methods were wrong but none were able to successfully "fix" the dog   This book is definitely a must read if you are looking for some helpful advice on dealing with angry dogs 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book. The narrator has a lot of experience, she understands what she is talking about, and she conveys information very clearly.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    When i received this book i thought it was a nice quick read, it also seemed to get better as the book went on.   This is one of those books where you have to make the leap of faith to find out if you were right or not. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've never heard of the author before and was a little skeptical to start with, but the story was very compelling. The prose was a bit hard for me, but that is understandable when trying to describe an event that happens in less than 3 minutes.   In my opinion, the ending was very well done and the conclusion made me very angry.   If you have a good story you don't always need a perfect ending to make it good!
Write a positive review about a good book:        In fact, I'm going to take a look at other good SF books in the future (that's probably going to end up being more than half of my reading).   So, what's up?   As a first timer to the book, I was very pleasantly surprised by how well-developed it was, particularly the mystery.   I'm already thinking about how to incorporate it into a sequel/prequel, so hopefully that goes well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was the first book I've ever finished. It's got a lot going on, but I'm finding that it's not the best book to read when you're feeling stressed out or tired or just trying to be productive in whatever way is possible in that time-space-reality.    It's a very fun and very entertaining book to listen to as I try to find my way out of a slump, or as I'm reading a book at a coffee shop or while I'm walking down the street. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for people interested in the art of the comic book.   It's a fun read, especially if you like the character of Superman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading this book.   It was different than anything I have read before.  The first time I read this book was at the book store.  I went in expecting a normal historical romance that is about as exciting as a book of poems.  My expectation was not met.  This book is a great adventure.  It is about one of my all time favorite heroes:  Henry Wigfall.  He has just been named a Knight of the Order of the British Empire and he wants nothing to do with it.  So he joins a pirate gang.  He is given a gun and is supposed to become a pirate, but he becomes a patriot.  In this book he is given the gun by the King of Denmark, King Frederik I.  All the good people (I am sorry, Captain) get in a little trouble with him.  However, as he does in real life, he saves the day in the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book for the most part, I was not surprised to see it listed as the first in a series.   This book is a very good story about a boy who wants to be a pilot and meets a boy that says that she has seen him in a dream as a pilot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a lot easier to follow a guide like this one if you have a good memory like I do    I was so proud of myself for remembering that it was   a piece of   The   only   book   that   ever   given me   the   courage   to   speak   out   about   something   as   wrong   and   unacceptable   as   what I saw   at   my   church   with   someone   who   had   been   practicing   "spiritual"   black magic   spells   for   years   it   was   very   hard   just   not   fun  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I have read that was written from the perspective of an oppressed people that is fighting back and trying to bring about their own liberation.   It does not preach but gives a very important voice to a very real struggle  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good read. It is a little dry and the story of the main character does get a little boring but it is still an enjoyable read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've had a copy of this book for several years, and still like it. It's a great historical account of one of the most significant American battles of World War II. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a fan of science fiction, especially after reading The Golden Compass   and   I am thrilled   that someone has finally put together a series of books   for young readers.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had been planning on reading a book called "Distant Relatives" but then came across this book.   As it is a series of interviews, it should have been easy for me to get through.  However, after reading "The Story Of The Human Body"   (which is actually very good),  I was reminded of the pain and sadness that come from a person who is not accepted. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is a young and naive student, who goes from a poor family to a good one by the end of the book.   I found the main character to be likable and interesting, and his feelings were understandable even though they were not always supported by reality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had to read this book just to understand how much of a piece of shit I am.   The author is completely oblivious to reality, he is basically a narcissistic ass who never had to work a job and never had kids and doesn't even know what an employee is.  He thinks that he can get away with lying about the job and his qualifications, as well as his work ethics at work.  The book is riddled with all kinds of lies about him and the job, and I thought it was a pretty good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is gripping and the descriptions vivid.   I loved the last section of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best books about the Civil War, by one of the most excellent historians there is.   It really is an outstanding read: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited when I saw this book come out because I have been meaning to read a book about "the real Jesus".   This is more about what the church has always believed about him.   It is written by someone who is a Catholic.  I don't know how this book was even allowed to get published. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited to read the book and I'm so glad I did.   It's a really fun read about a group of friends who are a group who is "in" with the "popular kids".   Their parents are out of town, they have a weird house, and they seem to have a lot of money to throw around.  As an aside, it's been a long time since I've really read a book about a weird group of kids and had it made me laugh a lot.  I think I will buy a few more of these.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is just brilliant. There are many things that have always been a little puzzling me:  I really wonder how they decided to divide the earth into 4 continents.   But they do, which is why the Americas have been colonized since at least 5,000 years ago.  And they also figured out how to reach every land mass (or rather, most land masses) by flying across the ocean on an enormous balloon. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book the week after my 2-year-old son was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type II.   He has some of the physical symptoms but not the mental symptoms.  It is such a positive book about his journey and I look forward to reading it again and again 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book   It's a very fun read and very easy to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about my father's experiences during his service during WWII, he served in the Army during the war.   He had two brothers in the military who were also in the war, a brother in the navy and his other brother was a Marine.  Both of his brothers were killed in action.  My father's brother served at the same time he did and went down with his unit.  They were in a tank and both of his legs were blown off and his arms were completely shredded.  The only things that he carried on him were some medical supplies.  In a tank is the point of the book.  He writes how he never got to the tank. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author takes the time to tell the story of a girl's journey from a very small village in the middle of nowhere to the university of her choice in India.   It is a fascinating story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a college student and found it very interesting.   The author does not make a big deal about the fact that this book is mostly about a man named "The Great" who went to college in the 1960s and died in 1979.  I can understand that.  It's an interesting book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   . I've read other stories that are really good that people give them a poor review, but I've just not read many good books about women that I have not already read   In a good way 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book in my new series.   It's about a boy who has a supernatural ability to see ghosts and his dad's past.  He's going to have to deal with a family feud that threatens to destroy his house.  It sounds like an action novel with some ghost action in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read many different books about the early history of the Soviet Union. This is the first book that I've encountered that does a good job describing how that era was for the Soviet people, not just the communists.   This book is especially interesting because it covers a very brief time period in history.  I found the book to be very interesting because they describe how the Soviet government felt about various foreign countries that were hostile toward it, how it reacted, and how it became more and more hostile towards its enemies as time went by. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In addition to having a great concept, this is a good read.   I really liked the story of the couple getting older. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I first read this book as part of a "book club" with a friend.   The club members were quite intrigued, as they had never read a science fiction book.  It was all fun and games for awhile.  Unfortunately, it didn't last too long.  After the first year, it was obvious that it wasn't going to happen.  There were too many questions and not enough answers.  In the second year, the book was good, but not as good as it was in the first one.  For the third year, I was very disappointed that the book didn't have the depth that I had been hoping for.  I am disappointed that I haven't read the book after having read the synopsis in the book club. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading a lot about the ancient Maya, and about the Maya culture, and so when I saw the title of the book I really wanted to read it immediately.   It is written from the perspective of a researcher who has traveled extensively in the Maya area of Mexico and Central America, and who has been able to write the stories of the Maya for a modern audience.  His approach is a lot like that of Joseph Campbell, though he also is very interested in how different parts of the world are related and how there are different ways of interpreting what is being explained.  As a general introduction to the Maya, it is a great book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    So I was listening to this book on Audible and really didn't want to buy it but I decided to take the chance because it's free and I know I like Audible.   The story takes place on an abandoned island.  At the beginning we are told that the place is in great disrepair.  We're not given any information about what it was used for.  It seems that the island was a place for humans to go to for protection from other animals and humans.  There was a man that lived there that built a house that he kept running water for. Then there was another man that worked in the ruins and he didn't know how to do it.  After the man died a woman came to the island to live in the house with the man's son.  She took the son with her to the next village on the island that was in much worse shape and took the husband along.  Now they have been on this island for several hundred years.  The last time the husband came home he asked the wife to leave because she was too ugly.  That's when we learn what's going on.  Once the husband is gone the son sets out to find his father's wife.  This is all before the first page of the book is written.  I thought it was a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're a fan of John Green, you will probably find something to like here.   It's not perfect, but it's pretty good, and it's not bad either. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have always liked the books by Susan Cain.   "Quietly confident and brashly outspoken"   -   If you're a lover of political books or a fan of the Bible (especially the book of Genesis) you will definitely enjoy this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've just finished the new edition of my parents'   Fannie Farmer collection, The Girl Who Couldn't Read.   This   book   is   wonderful.  It   includes a lot of   pictures   and   it   has   great stories   of .  the   girl  .
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't think I could have ever found a more enjoyable book.  It's a great read in a fun and fast-paced way 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really loved this book!   The book starts with a lot of information that doesn't take too long to figure out, and then the rest is just fun reading.   One day while doing chores, my son asked me about the "cursula".   His teacher had mentioned it.  Then when I read a version of the book that was about another language, I found out that cursula is a special kind of leaf that grows in many tropical areas where plants grow like weeds.  I learned that the name "cursor" comes from the Latin word cursu, meaning "touched by something". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first ever sci fi novel. I love it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book last year after I had just been married for a little over a year. I was very attracted to the book and I was pretty happy with my decision to buy it.   It's a good read if you can get past the fact that it isn't written by a real woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was excited about this book because it is by a noted authority on the subject.   It is about as good a book about Buddhism as I've ever read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good introduction to the modern and ongoing debate about the value of human life.   The author is a well-known expert in this area (as are many other physicians).   In an attempt to explain the nature of human suffering, he uses a wide variety of examples and examples. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is fantastic.   This is really a good and realistic book   about a man who was falsely convicted of rape.  I did read a few other posts about this case before buying   it   but did not think   there was enough here to make   this one of the better reads. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I were a more cynical person, I would say that a good number of the arguments that are made in this book are spurious. There are numerous cases in which a woman is so anxious about a potential romantic relationship that she tries to avoid sex with a guy who is a potential suitor.   However, it's worth noting that there are lots of examples where a woman has a very good reason to be in a good mood. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    After I read the "A New Light" article in The New York Times, I decided to start reading her novels.   While not as fast-paced as her other novels, her world building, her descriptions, and her characterizations are all just as good.  It's nice to be able to tell another world apart from your own. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was expecting a slow burn, but this is more like a quick read with interesting details about a small town in a different time period.   The book is a bit slow in places, but the story and the characters are compelling enough to get through. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book because I wanted a new edition to the book " The Book of Fives ".   If I were a real fan of this book, this would be my next choice.   The "Five of Swords" is a perfect blend of fantasy and historical fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is a very nice book. It is an informative and interesting read about the history of Christianity. It does not cover every aspect of Christianity, but it does a great job of keeping you aware of the major developments in Christianity, which have influenced later Christianity.   It may not be the most historically accurate book you have ever read, but I'm not complaining.  "   Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives you a great overview of a subject that was at the time (in the early 70's) one of my favorites: quantum physics. It is well written, understandable, and contains lots of interesting information about the scientific details that are still not understood.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm writing this as I am reading   it   at the moment, but I feel the need to clarify.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I've read from Lani Sarem, but the second is a favorite I got a copy of.   It tells the story of the author's childhood, and has some great photos of Lani as a kid.  I hope this book will be coming out in paperback. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, if nothing else, is one of the most detailed and accurate depictions of a real event that I've read.   A good source book  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had this book for many years and it is still one of my favorites. The main character is not just a normal character, he has a very interesting background that is worth exploring.   He is not a good character, but he is a fascinating one.  The writing style is not that "modern" but is still readable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book because it was written by an author that I personally like.   For me, this book is a bit short, but it is still very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a wonderful book for anyone who is interested in history, politics, and how the media covers the most important issues in the world. It's about what we do to protect our country and our leaders when we see some wrongdoing being done in our name, and we must not let that happen again.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I were on a "vacation" in Canada (on a vacation with our two young children) and when we were back on American soil my husband decided to start reading about my old high school friend's murder on the TV and he said that he read all the book and he was "stunned" at all the details. I found it very interesting and very believable.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a way, I think I'll be OK about this one:  It's not perfect but it's the first book that really made me think I might have a brain disease and was therefore deserving of special treatment.   And so far as I know (and that's kind of a big if), this book is the first to actually describe it.  This is a great read and the final image from the novel is hauntingly apt :
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found it extremely interesting and instructive.   The authors have a thorough knowledge of various religious denominations, including Islam, Judaism, Catholicism, and Protestantism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was given this book by a friend at the beginning of my second semester of philosophy at NYU.   While I was reading the book, I couldn't stop thinking about how great it would have been if my professor had been less of a dick and gave me a little more advice in the beginning (as if that would have helped).   It is not my favorite book in this series by any means, but if you like philosophy (and I am not so sure that this is really about philosophy), this is worth your time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, which I have read several times since it was first published in 1960, is very readable and is a good way to get a background on the science of the early days of aviation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the book, the author describes several instances in which the U.S. military found and destroyed valuable ancient Egyptian documents.   While I was very familiar with the story, it was interesting to read the details as well as the reasons. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.  It's interesting and it's not a book I read a lot.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about women's tennis.   The authors take a lot of time to discuss, well, the women's game.  It is also well written, entertaining, and well presented.  You should be reading this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this is a fantastic book, a really fun read.  It is the type of book that I would read again, just to get a taste of what can be learned from it.  I have had a lot of trouble trying to figure out what makes a good "sketch" in writing a book.  The author does a good job of giving the reader that feeling of satisfaction and satisfaction with the project he is working on and I would love to get my hands on his first novel.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character of this book is a bit of a whiny little brat that is constantly having to be put in her place because she is a whiner.   She also gets to keep her wannabe-pornstar boyfriend, and is always looking for ways to screw him over or screw herself over by giving him a blowjob.  It isn't all bad, and I like the character.  She is just so pathetic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a short book but packed with interesting information that I have to say is not obvious or obvious enough.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the book. I enjoyed all three parts (except for the second, which felt a bit rushed).   We are treated to a fascinating look at the relationship between scientists and other scientists (scientist vs scientist). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm writing about this book because the title is very apt:  It takes a moment, or a few years, but when I can finally stop thinking about the things that bother me, it's as though my mind had been unplugged.  This book is a collection of essays about different aspects of religion.  The essays are done in an accessible manner;  it is possible to have a good conversation about a particular topic and yet not be a fanatic about it.  I recommend this book highly to everyone who is looking for a good balance between faith and rationality.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A well written, well narrated, great story of a lost man.   The stories were fantastic,   and the characterizations   were spot on.  The main character is very unique,  the stories of his life are incredible,  and   I think this is going to be a favorite book of mine.  I  will be reading more from this author 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was an interesting and helpful book.   The author is not a chemist, but an engineer. He uses a wide range of examples, not just chemical reactions, but also the use of power and of material (paper) as sources of power.  I don't know if he is a serious student of organic chemistry, but it is interesting to see what are the physical laws that the physical sciences are built on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite part of this book was the analysis and discussion on how the Romans used torture.   This is something I've been wondering about for a while now. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good collection of short stories by two contemporary authors with strong, distinctive voices. I liked both of these stories.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Seth's book is not perfect. I think he should have included a review from a male partner in his book, which makes it easier for men to empathize with female partners.   However, I am glad that the book gave me a sense of what being an "average" guy is like, and some valuable insight into the challenges women face."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this book, which is why I only gave 3 stars.   It's well written, but it's not very readable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very excited about the book that I picked up.   It gave me the feeling that I could learn a lot from it, if only I had the time to spend.  The book was very easy to read and very easy on the eyes.  It is good at explaining complicated concepts, although it is a bit repetitive.  I am sure I will learn something from it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good read   There are lots of good details about the history of the war in Europe and about some of the things the Germans did during the war.   The book also describes a number of people who suffered or lost their lives. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading the reviews I bought I was very happy with this one.   I love this story.    I think the author has a very bright future in the writing world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been waiting to get back into the fantasy world that George R. R. Martin created, and I'm glad I finally got the chance. This book made me fall in love with Martin's characters even more than I already was.  
Write a positive review about a good book:        I was excited about this book, and it is a good one.   The story is great, and I enjoyed the characters, but I'm not sure I'm the kind of person who will appreciate the romance at the heart of it.  However, the characters are really nice, so I guess I'll buy the book and see if they continue.
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I got a copy of this book, the cover was in the mail, so I had to wait for the book to come from the publisher to finally have it in my hands.   The book itself is very nice.  Some of the illustrations were very accurate.  The story is well written.  I was also impressed by the cover.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm new to the genre of the paranormal, and found a good read to read. It's very easy to understand and is also quite good as well.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently purchased the book A Woman and a Man, which is based on an interview that I conducted with a woman I met a couple of years ago.   She is a woman who recently lost a son to a fatal shooting while serving as a deputy in a small town in rural Wyoming.  Her son was a great person and the best parent anyone could ask for.  She describes in detail a good father she had, how she had to take care of her family while his father was working.  I have a lot of sympathy for that family, and they certainly deserve it.  But I'm not so sure the whole "family values" stuff is a good idea.  A lot of women I know are struggling, financially and emotionally, with the loss of their husband or partner to death.  This book does not help.  The only person who seems to be having fun is a man.  It is a very sad book.  (That's me talking about a book I bought about a man in my life.)
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is a very good introduction to the history of the world-wide movement to make the earth more human, and how the movement has come about."   --A.C. Clark, The Times (London), April 25, 1985 "There was something very profound about the first chapter of this book, which showed how much there was that had to be done to save nature as it was, and yet how little the world had achieved. The history of humanity has been to undo nature in one way or another. This book shows that this is the wrong way to go about it. The authors make clear that a natural world is not destroyed because there is too much of it, but because nature has become an object of exploitation. We can undo nature without wrecking it, and by making it into a living organism, we can work for its regeneration, which in the end will be a better world." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about the early history of the United States. It is written very well, but it was very hard to take a whole book written by an academic.   The book is not that bad, but I felt it was missing a lot of important stuff about the rise of the nation.  One of the things about this book that I don't like is that it was written for a very specific audience:  You might like it if: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story of the war in Vietnam has been told many times, and with so many different viewpoints it becomes hard to appreciate. I find this book different.   It is a book about the conflict itself, not the war itself.  The author tells his own story, and tries to show the impact it had on his life.  It was important to him that the books he read would always be available.
Write a positive review about a good book:    First, a HUGE shout out to David Wiesner for his great job as editor! This is the perfect "how I got into writing for comic books" book. The only difference between a book like this and a book from a normal publisher like Dark Horse is that the comics are in color instead of black and white.   My only complaint is that most of the humor comes from the jokes. Some of the jokes are funny because they're in bad taste, some are funny for different reasons (like the story about a girl's crush on a male superhero who uses "a few" girls) and some are just plain stupid (like when Spider-Man says he wants to meet "a chick who doesn't have a penis!"  
Write a positive review about a good book:    There was nothing wrong with this book.   I just had to wait for my library to get back to me, so i got this book the day it was supposed to come out,   but i can't wait to read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I saw the title of the book, I was surprised. The cover is a bit too pretty for my tastes, but I do like a nice cover.   A nice book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first of the series (though I've read the first two).   It was a fun book, though I can't recall it quite the same way as I can remember the first three.   The first story is about a boy who gets a pet turtle, and he finds out he can speak to it, which makes it a much less annoying pet than he had expected.  He's just as happy with it as he is with the pet dog he had before.  Also I didn't really like the last story, but the last few were really good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best short story collection I've ever read  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked it:  It's a solid introduction to my field, without the heavy jargon of a graduate seminar.   It covers the basics and some of the subtleties of my field and methodology.  The "methodology" is a little different than what I usually use, but that's fine, as it adds some new perspectives.  It might even be worth going through a "tutorial" to see how things work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is really fun to read, as it was hard for me to get into   I just have to try and put into words   a book that has made such a big impact on my life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first started the series, it seemed like a fun adventure with good writing and a good plot. But now it seems to be the most annoying book out there, since I can't figure out how the writers managed to create a "lucky" ending.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am looking forward to reading all the new books by John Irving.   The Last Testament is my favorite book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's an interesting and entertaining account of how one of the world's foremost philosophers has been driven to madness over the last few years by some very strange and dangerous circumstances. The book is not as straightforward as one would like it to be, but as with any good biography, the reader can understand the author's reasons for writing. It is interesting to consider how much the philosopher was influenced by the writings of William James.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was extremely fun. I was very interested in it so I purchased it.   I love stories about heroes and villains, but the characters in this one were just too realistic. I just don't understand the idea of people falling in love for no apparent reason. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book for a young reader who wants to become a scientist. It is a good introduction to scientific thinking, the methods used, and some of the philosophical and religious background behind the scientific method.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book.   It was interesting to read about the process that the U.S. Army went through to come up with an alternate camouflage pattern for their uniforms.  I found it very interesting as well.  A great book for the aficionado. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book. It tells the story of a girl who died at an early age, and was subsequently brought back to life by a voodoo doll.   It is very different from your standard voodoo story.  It has a lot more than just ghosts and the spirit world, it has a good deal of history and philosophy as well.  And the voodoo has a great deal more to it than just curses. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I did like the way they used words in a specific way, instead of using them in general.   It doesn't feel like a "real" translation from Japanese, at all   though it may be the translation I would have used. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a very well written story.  The story is fast-paced and there are not many moments of time where the reader does not lose interest or start to get bored.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorites 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am happy I found this book.   The cover has an interesting graphic of a man's finger with an "x" where the "x's" should be.  I'm sure that's an intentional joke by the author but the book was actually funny.  When I went to look at my parents' old copies I found some interesting trivia about the origin of that joke. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book before I watched it. I had never seen the movie before and it is still a great movie.   "Somewhere along the way, a whole group of men became so wrapped up in the old war that they lost sight of what was right."   That is the theme of this movie. I did not like that movie, but the movie is good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a way, the first few chapters (the ones about the old woman) are kind of lame. After that, I had no idea what to do with my time.   But this book isn't meant to be a rehash of anything else I have read.  There is some material in there that will not appeal to some readers, but it is still worth the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book! It had so much to learn about the war and the men that were killed.   It was very entertaining and interesting to read!

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an invaluable source on many topics, such as the history of the Mennonites, the Mormons, and the Quakers.   "Mennonism" is the most important group I ever studied, including the various sects of the Christian faith.  For many, including me, this book is the first time they learned about this group. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely loved this book, and it's a really great idea.   It's kind of funny because it's been years since I read any book about a team of archaeologists, so I had no idea about them until I saw that the team was working in the same building as the one I work in.  It was the exact same kind of building.  That reminded me of a scene in another book,  which is another good book about archeology, where we meet the son of a famous archaeologist.  But instead of going to a museum he went to a building which we had the privilege to work in ourselves.  So it's pretty cool. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful book about a girl who was raised in an abusive family.    In spite of the horrible treatment the children had suffered, the book is also a story about the strength of people to stand up against horrible conditions and to not let fear hold them back. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   . I am not a "reader" but I have read a lot of books and I am interested in reading a lot more.   It is the only one in the series I am still working on.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the only one that I've been able to read so far. It is a lot like the classic books I was introduced to as a kid but better.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a great way to learn about the "real world", as I've been having a difficult time finding time to be productive at home.    I was interested in learning about the economic history of Japan because that was the major influence on the rise of the United States in the 20th century.  I also love history (I just have a problem with using it as "just another book").   I've been wanting to get a book about Japanese history for a while, but it's been difficult to find a good resource.  It turns out that this book is excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It is a quick and easy read with lots of interesting examples. I found that it is well written, not too complicated, and easy to follow.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The thing about this book is, that it's the second installment in a series I had read before, first as a series of one-shot mini-novels   but I loved them, so I bought a bunch of them   as a way to make up for the lack of a full series   and this was the last in that series  The book does a good job of setting up the series and it is well written and the pacing is pretty good  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book!   For a very long time (a good 20 years, I think) I have felt   that the "big" religions are the   only ones that actually teach anything worth listening   to.   However, I have come to realize that the Bible is the  "big" religion,   for some of the reasons I gave in my review above.  However...   The best part about this book   was how much the author, who has lived a very spiritual life,  could relate to how I was feeling about the LDS Church, even though he is not a practicing member.  He gives some great tips on how to be a happy and fulfilling Mormon,  and how to make the Church more "inclusive".   His book is very well done, but my favourite part is when he talks about the many good things that happened to the author's grandmother and other members of the family, who had suffered horrible tragedies.  I hope   these stories can inspire others in the same way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing is not spectacular, but the book is very well-written and I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A really nice novel that will give you all you could possibly want about a family that has the right values but also has a tendency to ignore what they have.   It has a bit of a religious theme.  It's a good novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first chapter is very good.  It is a good intro to the material and explains the general theory and what not.   It also is pretty good in terms of grammar.  Also the second chapter is an example of how well it applies.      
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book.   It tells the story of how  a good man was a terrible tyrant.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's the kind of book you can re-read to refresh your memory and remember how important it is to read a book and not just listen to someone talk about them.    I am just getting into the world of fantasy books and the one that really caught my attention was The Name of the Wind.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good review book.   I love to read a good and interesting book about a specific subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author does a great job of describing the experience of a woman in a culture with a "natural" conception of sexuality. The first chapters set up the story as it relates to the reader: a woman is having a hard time in her marriage. A man has recently fallen in love with her. She is having doubts about her decision to have an abortion. The story does a good job of letting the reader know what is happening in each part of the story, as well as what is going on in her head as the events unfold.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fun and interesting book. If you like a good historical novel, this is a good one. It is full of rich details about both the political and military history of the Middle East, and the events, the characters, the details of military campaigns.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's been a few months since I was able to purchase a copy of this book.   I remember it being the only one available when I was a kid. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book that will not leave you hungry, it's a wonderful read, and it's an excellent introduction to this area.   "You will never forget a great meal, nor will you forget the good times."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main idea of the story is what we usually have, but not the best:  The story is all about the relationship between the couple, and how that is going to change. That is very similar to many others, but the way it is done is very unique in that it takes the whole "furniture and the floor" approach, without making it just about the furniture.   In addition, it's a good read for anyone looking at a modern relationship (not romantic).
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just read   the new edition   of   B.A. Taylor's   The Art of Being Alone   and   it   is   just   perfect  !   It   has   everything   you   want   for   a   complete   self-sufficiency   lifestyle   -  it is  authentic   as   can   get  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading the novel I had been trying to read since I was 13 or so and have no idea why it took me so long to finish, I went back and read the first two books and they made this one so much better.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a great book.   It is about a character I am really into -   The guy who was in love with a woman for 20 years before her wife and children decided to stop having sex with her.  When she said she wasn't interested he told me about the relationship he had with the other woman in his life.  They had never met in real life and he had to wait until their daughter was 3.  He was very jealous that he couldn't have their daughter until she was three.  It was so sad to him.  I loved the book as a person and as a lover. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A truly engaging, well written, well paced, and very well researched book about the history of the Irish.   It is filled with interesting and interesting facts.  It also tells the story of how the Irish have been treated by the Americans, and how this has led to their oppression and eventually to their becoming a minority in the United States. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are a lot of books that just can't stand up to the scrutiny of the real world, and I think that's true of this one in particular. The plot is great, and the main characters have a ton of depth.   And though it's hard to believe any good book will end on a cliffhanger, the ending does end on one (though it doesn't have to).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a newbie in the area of reading non-fiction and was interested in a book like this.   The author is very articulate about the subject and does a good job of explaining what I needed to know. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "One of the few nonfiction books which I will purchase after I finish reading it." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book.   I found this book useful   as a way to understand the nature and history of the English Language   in the 19th Century. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fun read.   This is a story about two people who get involved with one of the "frightest and least rational people in the world" (and this is my own description).   I have been writing about crazy people for a while and read a lot of crazy people's stories. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book in the mail the other day and it's been a little while since I last read one of this authors.   He has written a couple of other books of his own which I will read now I can.  I'm definitely buying more of his work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the entire thing in one sitting (the last of a series), so this is one of those "I was going to read one book, but got distracted" books.   This story really made me feel for that little boy and his dad.  It is very heart-wrenching and tragic, but the story just keeps moving along. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First, a bit of background.  I was a bit obsessed with the  The Hobbit and  The Lord of the Rings  books  (the first ones)  while a teenager.  At my age, however, it was pretty hard to imagine a world  with people living on a different planet from us.  My friends (who are much older than me) never bothered with the fantasy books but still managed to get me to buy them.   So, how did I find this?   A couple of my friends and I got together and decided we wanted to try to write a book in this style.  As we were talking about it, one of them pointed out that the Lord of The Rings  novels were good and a great introduction to Tolkien's works.  We went over a few options with her and came up with a story idea for the first part of the book.  So now it's all down to me to get the first draft out the door. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read this book,   it got me so excited that I bought the first three books in the series   because of the   interesting plot line  .   It is such a shame that there were so many changes and the  a final   of the characters that   the books were so very entertaining   (especially the first one   ).   I hope   this   series ends after this book  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was my first book in the series.   I read about two of the books in the trilogy and thought they were all excellent.  I found The Empire Strikes Back to be the weakest book in that series. This was much more like a good Star Wars novel.  The characters felt like real people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Book    by Jules Evans:  This book is about a young man with a bad conscience.   This is one of those books which can make you weep and laugh at the same time.  The author has chosen a subject which is very sensitive and very painful.  Evans has said that she does not like reading about people with problems.  She doesn't want to hear that people have problems, because the only thing that comes out of people with bad lives is a good one.  It is her way of being "tough" about herself.  But if she is going to write a book about a bad person, she has to write something about him which will be positive, and also about the good and good things in his life.  He is good with animals and takes care of his animals.  His mother has given up caring about him.  That is why we feel sorry for him. But Evans tells a much more loving story about him than we ever did from the other sources.  I was thinking about this when I came across this book at the library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A powerful and thoughtful book, I recommend it highly."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books which you may not like, and you may think it is the worst book ever written, but you can not help thinking that at the end of the day, its actually a very good book, with interesting concepts and some pretty deep themes that many people, including me, can relate to.   I think this book has been highly misunderstood.  The whole book is basically about how we are a culture of fear and guilt and self pity and it is largely the products of our culture.  This book also helps you understand a bit about how the modern religious/spiritual world has come about.  For example, Christianity came about due to a reaction against a lot of the violence and injustice in the society.  Now, what I like about the book is that the book points out that a lot  of  this was based on superstition.  It is based on a book about the Egyptian Pharaoh's evil son who would kill children if he saw them playing with his sister.  They would not let him play with them.  Even in the modern world, people still have a fear of children and it comes from religion and superstition rather than a logical, scientific basis. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading a lot of historical fiction lately (especially military history), and I have to say that this is a great one.   It shows what war was like in the European theatre in the years just before and just after World War I.  The style is very readable and well-written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favourite way to learn about a foreign country is to take a year off work, get a place to live and live it up as best I can. The way I did that with England was to get a cheap one bedroom flat in Bristol.   The flat is not huge but has a big walk in wardrobe and a spare bed.  I took all the essentials in England, not forgetting a laptop.  The furniture and decor is English but I could do with a few things being of a more modern style like a lot of the modern stuff on the house.  This book helped me to understand the culture I had to change to move to England.  It is a good read for anyone wanting to live in an English country. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about one of the most important people in the history of the world: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best books I have read in years.   Highly recommended  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had this book for a while and I have found it a very good read.   The story is told in a way that is quite funny and it seems to have been written by a child who really enjoys watching his father fight with his brother, it also helps that his father has a good understanding of martial arts as well as the use of fire.  There are a couple of times when things seem to be going the wrong way.  But, as the story progresses, he gets more and more powerful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book, and I really think it has some great insights into the nature of life in the real world. I loved it so much that I picked it up in preparation for a trip to a desert island  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very well researched.   I am very thankful for having this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this book!   It is interesting how our parents reacted to our growing relationship and how they tried to keep it a secret.   We have since found out that they are still married but live together.  I highly recommend  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    After the first 20 or so pages, I knew that this was going to be one of those rare books that I'd go back and read again.   While I didn't find myself enjoying the first half, the second half definitely got my attention. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a very easy, fast read that will give you a very good perspective on the history of the British Empire in Africa.   I loved that the book was a history book and that the author actually went to Africa (the story starts in 1837) to document what he was witnessing as he travelled in South Africa and Namibia.  There were quite a few African countries that I did not know about and was a nice reminder of why I like reading about the world's most powerful, but still often forgotten, countries. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the greatest books ever written.     The author is a truly outstanding writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was a good idea to make a book about a movie that was so good that its release changed the entire film industry.   I don't really mind bad movies as much as I do good ones, but this book is great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this was an excellent book about a man with mental illness.   It was very insightful, although it is a bit long. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Book of the Devil    is a really well researched book. I really loved the research that went into making this book possible, especially the interviews with people who knew the men in question.   This book is a real treasure for the Satanist/Paranoid set. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not going to get into the political aspect of this book, because this is a political book (a good one, at that) and so much of it is a matter of how political forces are used to pursue ends they have no interest in pursuing: political manipulation. But one part that makes it very interesting is how the book's author uses his own life as an example of how some people are used by powerful forces to advance their own agendas. The best way I can put it is that the entire book is about how some powerful forces use those with the power to make them seem powerless to those who truly have it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book.   It was about a young boy who is very confused about what's happening in the world.  He finds out that his parents are both in prison for a crime that was not committed when he was a baby.  The book is not overly complicated but is very interesting to think about.  I also like that it's written in a style that's very child-like and is very easy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent, well written, well researched book. The historical record shows the British used the Jews as slave laborers. We hear a lot about British involvement in the slave trade and how it ended. What about Jewish involvement in slave labor? I've never read anything about this before and am so glad I read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read it in a month or so when I was trying to decide if I wanted to become a "good reader."  It was such a refreshing change.  The story is simple and it gets to the point, and in a good way.  I've always been a fan of mysteries and mysteries were always my favorite book type.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're like me and you want a good look at the future of science fiction then look no further than the first novel in a new trilogy, by the author of the "I Want to Be Like Mike" novels.   As I was reading "Ascension" I kept thinking of the old stories by William Gibson, like Neuromancer or the "Cloud Atlas" series.  I had to look them up, but the best part is that the novels come from the same universe.  As the story moves along there are moments when the author puts an old plot together and then puts it all in a different twist.  The ending of the book was great  I love the characters and I love how the authors have the characters develop over time  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a recent discussion about my experience reading the book (I'm a fan of the book), a reader pointed out a flaw in the author's interpretation of the story:  I believe the only other example of a book that features a character who is a part-time "artist" is a book called "The Art of Racing in the Rain," which I believe is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great story.   The first third is like the opening to the original series and the last third is where the story really picks up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're looking for a good fantasy, look no further than Robert E. Howard's classic The Black Cauldron  .   If you've read any of his work, you'll have some familiarity with the series.   E.R. Howard was a writer who believed that all fantasy needs to be told from the point of view of a powerful character.  If he's right, you might find yourself liking this one even more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not entirely sure what the point of this book is.  The idea was very intriguing, and it certainly got my attention.  But the actual information provided in this book was a bit thin.   It is also not clear how this knowledge could be so useful.  I can't figure out how the author plans to apply his theories to the real world.  This is not a bad book.  It could have been more insightful and entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not about the book but about the author.   I am a big fan of Richard Bachman's books and have enjoyed a number of his non-fiction books as well.  This one is one of my favorites because it is a story about a father and a son who go to New Mexico and explore the country while searching for their father.  It is well done and an interesting read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only negative I can find is that I wish the book was a little more dense.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in June 2016, just after learning about the end of the world.   A man named Dave, who lives near a small town called Blythe, was involved in the shooting at the Waco church in 1993.  He got out of prison in 2013 and started making a living as a landscaper, before he heard about the shooting and moved to Texas with his wife to escape.  Dave got married after his wife left him.  His wife eventually found out about the crime and dumped him in Texas.  What was most interesting about this story is the way Dave was completely ignorant of the details of the church shooting.  The only person who knew the details were the two men who were there, and were there when the shots were fired.  As the days went on, he grew more and more angry at what he saw as a cover-up.  This book is well written and gives a good perspective of what we have been through.  There is a lot of discussion about the church bombing and how it is considered a blessing in disguise in many places in America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have the paperback copy of this book and I was very pleased with the writing.   The book is very well written.  The main characters were believable.  I think the story was set up well for the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about the "Dark Age of Islam".   The story is excellent and so detailed.   He also explains how "dark" people were in the past (and the past was always dark, including in the Christian "Dark Ages"), so the Muslim culture is also dark and there is no reason to believe that they are any different now.  There is even a good chapter on how women were treated in the old days and why, especially in the case of the prophet Muhammad.  The book also explains that the early Muslims were a fairly secular (at least in the beginning) people who would eventually evolve into a more religious sect. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can honestly say I was glad I took a look at this book.   The main thing that struck me was how much of the plot is based off of reality.  And the details are great.  This is an interesting book to read as I feel that the author didn't give enough attention to detail when it came to writing the plot and characters.  The book has a "weird" feeling, and it's really easy to see why.  I have a hard time writing an interesting novel.  If I ever do, I'll just keep a copy of this book in my car so I can look at it while driving through an area with high-density population. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea of "going back to the land" is very appealing.   Although I did not buy the book until it was too late (the paperback was hard to find in the US) I'm happy that I finally got to read it.  The title is misleading.  This was the first book that I really enjoyed.  I found myself really enjoying the stories about the early years of the Mormon church.  It seemed like so many things in the church had been exaggerated or fabricated by Joseph Smith. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book for my boyfriend's birthday. He LOVES the theme of these books, and it was such a nice surprise to get one himself.
Write a positive review about a good book:    First off, I was a huge fan of Margo Lanagan. I loved that this book is about a man who doesn't like guns.   I have a friend with a shotgun, and we've had some close calls. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book that needs to be read and talked about.   It's the story of a man who decided to give up his life of hard living, drugs, and violence.  He became the head of a successful company and had the biggest house and most money around. He eventually retired to an apartment, and lived there happily for two years.  One night he had a bad dream in which he was back in a fight with a man.  The dream reminded him of an incident in which his best friend in the Army was killed in Vietnam.  I found that interesting because it reminded me of the "what if?" question that I used to ask when I was a kid.      What's fascinating to me about the story is how well the author has woven his own experiences of adversity, to give his characters real, true-to-life dilemmas.  As we all know, life is a series of coincidences.  It takes some good will to get through life's ups and downs with a smile, but if that good will is squandered or if it's misused or taken for granted, it can leave you frustrated, bitter, and even bitter.  There's nothing wrong with that feeling, but that is what life is all about: trying to keep your balance and keep the good will in. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only reason I didn't give this 4 stars is because I don't understand the purpose of the "unlimited memory" idea: What is the point of having unlimited memory if you can't remember anything that doesn't need to be remembered? I can remember about 95% of the things I read in a book or watch on TV.   I don' t remember most of the parts of the book/TV shows that I've watched since I have only seen them once. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am not an expert on this subject, but I have heard this has been a problem in some older books.   As for being able to find a copy at a good price (I can't remember where I read about it), I can't speak to that either. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking for something to do on a slow afternoon.   This book is a great time, a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I can honestly say that I am so glad to have bought the Kindle version of this book!   The plot is solid and compelling.   This book is about a man who makes a lot of money but never manages to enjoy it.  He always thinks about all the people he could have had, the things he could do to have a happier life.  His daughter is very depressed at the end of the book, but she has hope that her father will make a lot more money.  It was also great that the author explained all of these details so well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good, light, easy read, the first in a series of novels about children growing up.   It is also very funny and has a nice story, and a good story is a great story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book tells a very good story about a real person, the book is very interesting, but if you don't like the author, it's not much use.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a fantastic overview of the major players in the creation of the modern era of magic. It contains a lot of great information on how the different areas of magic worked in the era.   The book contains a good overview of many of the areas in the period:  -The basic rules of magic in the first several centuries:  The magic in question was very basic, and did not go through a lot in the way of refinement -The development of the rules:  Early on there were a lot more rules for magic than now. It was not until the mid 1100s that the rules got simplified. In the middle of this period a lot was said about the "new" way of thinking about magical devices -The invention of the first "super-weapon" (a magical tool that made spells easier to use, that can be wielded by anyone who can use a sword) :  The "superweapon" was created during the early 1100s by an unknown mage. Its purpose is to give a high level mage a massive advantage over their enemies. It can be used in melee combat or as a defense against enemies in close combat.  The creation of this weapon made it possible for mages to become much more powerful -The evolution of the "Super-weapon":  By the 1330s the super-weapon was seen to be very dangerous. It also meant that mages had a lot less room to work with -The history of the invention of magic:  By 1300 magic had fallen into obscurity. The discovery of the basic principles and how they worked only became more apparent. As the technology to create magical devices was advancing very quickly the need to learn how it worked was declining. Eventually this lead to the creation a more sophisticated system of magic that was less reliant on arcane spell writing -The emergence of magic as a religion:  In the 1340s magic was seen as a powerful force to be used for good. The power of magic and its use by wizards to heal and to protect came to be seen as divinely ordained. The rise of a religion of magic was inevitable. But what religion was created?

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is very good book.   I'm a big fan of both Star Trek  and Star Wars  and I think this is a great book to read about them, especially Star Trek.   While the story is interesting, it could have been even better.       There's a lot to be said about how different  Star Trek is from Star Wars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are times when reading this book is more like studying than reading.   It would take more than one day of study to fully understand everything that is going on.  I think this book, if only for the fact that it contains so much information and is a good reference, would be useful for a student, not a generalist who has little or no background in archaeology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:        Like I said before, if you're looking for a serious book about the Holocaust - and a must-read for any serious student of the subject - read this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had never seen the movie until the first time I read the book,   but from the moment I started   it became one of my favorites    and in fact when   the movie came out,  they decided to include the book   at no extra cost

Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I tried to read this book it fell flat but, being a newbie, I quickly learned that this book will not teach you anything in a way that will really help you.   Unfortunately, the book is only a collection of rules   That is all that you get from it and, as usual,   it is hard to know which rule(s) is which in the   book  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book so much, especially the fact that it gives us the real and true story of what happened during the Korean War.   Also, this book gave me my first taste of "real" Korean food,   and   the author did a wonderful job of describing it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm just so impressed by this book. It's a book I always thought I was going to love, and then it never even seemed to be very good. I got it for my birthday and it's soooooo cool   My only complaints about this book is that the first half is very confusing and then the second half seems to just go by way too fast. Also, while the premise and ending are cool, the actual story is very lame.   This is the only book of my "good" that I got at my birthday. It made me laugh a lot

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book in high school and really enjoyed it.   My main complaint is that the characters in the book are all stereotypical.  My favorite is the main girl, who is a really good, fun-loving and smart person.  I had never even heard of any of the other characters before in the series and was blown away that I got a good look at them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm pretty new to the world of comics, and haven't really done a lot of reading since. This book definitely kept me interested.   It's a very quick read and the illustrations are very clear and easy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good read. A story about a war between two nations.  It has a very good theme, and the characters seem real to me.   My daughter had a bad reaction to the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book.  I am a huge fan of John Scalzi, and the fact that he has been writing about the same topic for over a decade now is pretty awesome.  The idea of a universal human consciousness is really cool, and a big theme in his books (he does a lot of science fiction, too).  The aliens are presented as just one of the many possible ways of describing humanity.  There's a scene with a group of humans and an alien in a room that has a large mirror, where one human says "It's all good to have a mirror in your house."   There are some other pretty good ideas in here, too.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had never heard of The Story of the Lost Child and thought it was a very good book but after reading it I was very pleasantly surprised by it.   The Story is like a great movie or book: It will leave you with a feeling of enjoyment. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a wonderful book.   I have been reading it for years   because   it was written by a former teacher   who   could   give you   the          most   good   teaching   of   ever   to   you   ."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the historical and political background of the Cuban Revolution.   This book is the only one available in English (no Spanish!)   The text is clear and precise.  It is not a treatise on Cuba, rather an account of the life and struggles of the revolutionaries, their enemies, their friends, and their supporters.  The authors are well informed, articulate, and, despite some personal opinions, fair-minded. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My father is the original author of the book, so I knew about the problem from the start.   In this version the first 50 or so pages, and perhaps the first 100, deal with the problem of a single "p" word for each letter in a word.  There is a sentence that appears to deal with an error in the previous edition but which, if it were actually correct, would require two "p's."   The new edition (by a different editor) corrects many other typographical errors.  The book was published by Harcourt, Brace and World in 1939, and the second edition was published in 1941. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book a year and a half after starting out in this profession.    The book is a great one and does a lot of good.    The title is apt, but the content is great too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is the most important book ever written about politics."    This is the real deal, and if you want to really know about what we're up against, read it.   The political system in the US is broken beyond repair, but the problem is even worse in the EU. 
Write a positive review about a good book:        I think that it's a great book, even though I had very little trouble with the narrative.   This is an interesting look at the impact that the war had on the people who fought it.  There are many reasons why it took the US so long to get out of it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a great introduction to the history of the New World. It was not too heavy for a first read, but still interesting, well written and fun to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you've read this book, you know it was a good read:  My husband and I both enjoy historical fiction and this book was both interesting and entertaining.   Also, the book took quite a while to get through, but we finally did!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book back in 2000. It was a while ago, but I still have the book.   It was my first introduction to the paranormal.  I've read some, but never had time to really delve into them, but this book was very informative.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In a good way.   I like that there are three types of people:  -  -The people who will try to make a career out of what they love,  - Those who will love a book  and make it their life  -And then the people who just  love  books   (and really  love most everything).   This book  really  does  have  to  be   read   by  -People  who  don't  care  about   books... but  this  book  is  just   different  ... it  is like a   family   meeting .  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really surprised at the quality and depth of knowledge that the author has gained through a life devoted to the practice of magic.  I read this book when it came out about a year ago and really liked it.   The magic and knowledge are so specific that the book is almost like a magic book that only deals with the specific topics.  The writing is clear and concise 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've bought this book from a third party and it works fine.    Unfortunately, the formatting is a bit wobbly and the book is too thick for my tastes.  I hope they find a better way to get these out in a single volume. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is quite good - I can see why this is a classic among scholars who study the First World War.   But there are some errors in the book, most of them in an obvious way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I'm not saying that I don't like it, just that this is not an all around good book.   The writing is good, but it's the author's opinion which is really interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most excellent book on the subject of the Black Panther Party!   A great story is told of the relationship between Huey and Ben.   It gives a whole new perspective on the Panthers.  This is an excellent book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so thrilled that my family and I finally got to read The Art of Fielding by Bruce Arthur.   It's such a fascinating read about his philosophy that I was looking forward to it as much as anyone else.   The chapters are very informative and entertaining, and the writing itself is very elegant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed   the   premise   The   action   of this book   is   well-handled   a bit   predictable   so   don't   expect   this   to   have the same   high   point   as      ... More details
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's so great to see some kind of unity between religion and science.   In a country where people don't have a choice about which religion to practice, they're being educated about both science and faith, and having them become more equal. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very excited to read this book. I'd been planning to start studying for a MCCT (Medal of Honor) a few months ago. Unfortunately, I don't have an MCC.   Unfortunately, as I was reading this, I read a comment by the author that said it would be really hard to be a doctor in the United States.  However, the author is an MD.  As a physician, and as a Canadian, I'm also disappointed with the U.S. health care system, which I believe is much worse than other countries.  For instance, in Canada, they can't even make an appointment to get a cataract removed because the surgeon won't go through a referral to make sure the patient has any kind of coverage.  In the U, they may be able to remove the cataracts, but will be at a huge disadvantage when you're trying to pay the bill for a procedure to remove a heart valve (which is supposed to be covered by Medicare). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a great book to read.   It is a very good read. I thought the story line was interesting and interesting things happen in a very unexpected way.  The story line is not one that I see all too often in books and I enjoyed it.  If you are interested in an historical novel that does not feature dragons, vampires or demons, then this may be for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the book in one sitting about a week ago, and can't wait to try the others.     One of my favorite things about reading is being surprised at the things I'd forgotten about, and the new ones that catch my interest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have read by Peter V Brett.    It is well written and not a dry or uninteresting read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    For those who think they can understand what happens with a dog, or the effects of a vaccine, or whether a child is just ill or just has a bad temper, this is a must read.   By far the best book I've read about vaccination and the effect of vaccines  . 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a bit of a science geek, so I was pleased to have a science fiction book in which the story takes place in a virtual world.   The book is not about the virtual world, but about the research done on it in the 1970s.  This is a book about the effects of virtual reality on humans, not just a book for sci-fi geeks 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good retelling of the early days of the LDS church and how many of the "doubters" were eventually baptized by Joseph Smith.   I believe this book to be accurate in many aspects, and I appreciate the author's efforts to explain in simple terms the events which led up to the first martyrdom.  I think it's very interesting how different the church seems to be in the first few decades after the death of Joseph Smith than in the 20 years immediately before and after the martyrdom, and how similar they are to each other after that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, like many others I've read, is not written well.   The formatting is pretty horrible and it makes some very easy chapters (the entire chapter on the "fault in the system" is pretty easy and pretty convincing) difficult to understand at times.  There is also a lot of "filler" which distracts from what the author is trying to say, and is probably just distracting.  I don't think that the main problem is the formatting (I read in a small font) but the "spoilers" in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:        I like this book, very good and fast paced.   I like the character of Alinore but I really liked the whole story so far   The worldbuilding is superb and I liked the way they combined history and fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a deep fascination with the human brain.  When I was in college, I went to the library and looked at books about the human body.  I loved these books because they showed how our bodies are so fascinating.  For a while I thought it would be interesting to compare my own brain to my great-grandmother's brains, but when I tried to do that I learned that my brain is so much bigger than hers.   My brain is a lot like my great great grandmother's brain.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a great introduction to the history of modern Israel. This book provided a very thorough explanation of the history in such a clear and concise way that I felt that the information it provides was of the highest value.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The one that really sticks out in my mind is:      I was very hesitant about buying the book.   This was the first time I've read anything by John Scalzi.  The first book he ever published.  It was an absolute blast.  From the first page to the last he made the story flow like butter.  He wrote an awesome introduction that gave a little context on the setting and characters.  A big plus about this book is that it's not a "dumbing down" of the story, he took time to explain how the "policing" works.  I'm a huge fan of the series,  The Old Man's War is my favourite book  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a compilation of various stories of people who lost a child.   It tells you about what to expect at your funeral and gives you advice on how to handle it.  It gives great advice about what a good death is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had read about a few other books about the life of a medieval Christian man that I thought were very good, but this one was by far the best.   The writing is so clear and concise, the pictures and maps are very well done, the descriptions are interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of all the Star Trek books, and   The   Original Series: The Movies   is by far the best.    If   you have never watched a   Star Trek TV show before, you can never   afford to miss a single episode. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first part of this book was very enjoyable. This part deals with a very interesting historical case. The rest was good, but not worth reading at all.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been having a lot of trouble with the way most people in America talk about the Middle East, especially when it comes to Israel.   As a Jewish American who lives in the region, I find it troubling how people who would usually make excellent arguments about the Jewish people and their history in Palestine ignore the fact that the Palestinians are Arabs.  They focus on the Jewish role in the establishment of Israel and the Holocaust, but don't acknowledge that the majority of Palestinians are Muslims.  But for that, I would have no problem with an Israeli state, no matter what the price would be for a Palestinian state.  I will certainly never live there but the only thing I care about is how I can help my children learn and respect the region without being attacked.  And I am glad I read this book in a school book club.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book and found it to be very informative about how to make a perfect apple pie.   It was very interesting reading how to do all the things mentioned in the book to make it a success. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a really nice book.   The story is well told and the writing is solid.  I was a little annoyed that I couldn't get my copy, but when my local library got it a couple years ago it wasn't in stock.  It was worth the wait.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the most complete and informative treatment of the topic of the Second Amendment that I have found.   I have been reading for quite a while on this issue, and was still surprised when I read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author is a very knowledgeable historian, having done extensive research. The book focuses on the American Revolution and the struggle for independence.   "The American Revolution" has a very solid foundation with no holes or inconsistencies.  The only thing that bothered me is that it takes a good while to get to the actual battle. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first chapter is what started me on this journey:  The next few chapters are very much like the first, but not quite.  I don't know if I can say much more about the plot than that.  It is well written, although the book is hard to read  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The original "Mummies, Giants & Ghosts" was very good.   I didn't like the first book, which was about a mummy who was trying to get out of his tomb but was still stuck there.  I wanted a new book about the mummy, so I checked out the second book in the series and this one, and it is awesome.  The writing is soooooo great.  It's like you're reading a book for a little kid, and the illustrations are so well done.  There's a lot of suspense in the story about why the mummy keeps his head down,  and even though he's stuck in his tomb, he's constantly running around like a kid.  This book will be the perfect addition to my bookshelves. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First of all, the author is brilliant.  He manages to write about every possible type of car, no matter how small or big.   And he manages to include everything in his book.  And most of these cars are not "small" or "big".   This book could have been a little more informative, but the pictures are so pretty!   Also, the book includes a lot of tips about how to clean up the car and fix it.  It's like an all-inclusive cleaning guide.  What's not to like about that?  
Write a positive review about a good book:        I have a copy of The Dark Tower:  I am a book lover   This book is the first in what I hope will be a long series   (and by long, I mean epic )   The writing is good  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is good but the way they were using it to do it was dumb and dumb is bad.    This is a pretty good book but there were a lot of errors and it really makes me think about what I would like in a fantasy story and I didn't like what they gave us. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book for a first-time author. I read the first paragraph and got interested.   If you like science fiction and/or fantasy, this book is a must-read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A book I've found difficult to put down.   In a year of books I haven't been able to put away for more than 3-4 days, this one holds up.  I'm going to have to read it again soon and again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book, not just because it was a gift, but because it is a good study of an important topic: how societies change, and how the change can be good or bad.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was blown away by this book.   After reading the book I wanted to get the book for my son and wife to read too.  I found it very interesting to read about the effects of the war on the troops and how the soldiers were affected mentally and physically after losing their loved ones.  Also interesting is the personal and emotional side of the story.  It has great artwork throughout the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I got it in the UK, but I cannot find it online anywhere.   The basic plot is that the girl's parents are killed in a car crash, but it's up to the kid to decide what to do about it.  A very strange premise, but the plot is solid and makes it enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book because it was recommended to me. I am a non-scientist.   This is a very good introduction to some of the theories that have been used to explain a lot of the world's problems.  It should be required reading for everyone working on public policy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is very good   For a book written in 1986, it is quite accurate   It was well researched   This book is a little technical, but it's still a good read   
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters are the main focus of the book.   Some things they say feel a bit out of place, but other things are quite well done, as far as I'm concerned.  It is a book about a person who knows too much, and knows it is not necessarily good advice to do so.  The ending is good.      It would not be a bad read if you didn't have to do anything, because it will make you think about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Faces of Madness" are by far the best villains in the history of superhero comic books  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In many ways, this book is a work of historical scholarship, but also is a personal tale that goes beyond its scholarly boundaries. I'm glad that it was able to capture the essence of the times, and capture the hearts and minds of the people, despite all the bad stuff that was going on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good example of a new school fantasy novel. It's more original than The Wheel of Time or the Lord of the Rings but has more in common with Peter F.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a way to get a better understanding of what I have just started reading (the book is written by a woman, so the experience is unique for her)   It took me a while to get the hang of the writing but I think that is a good thing because that is what made me want to come back to the book again and again 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in October when I was in my late 20's and it had a lot of great ideas in it and it wasn't hard to follow.   In this case, I have read other books by this author that were much longer and more involved but this one didn't take me very long to finish.  In general, the writing is pretty good and the pictures are fine, but the actual stories in this book seem a bit short and not as interesting as the other ones. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only negative comment I have about the book is that it isn't long.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book that is easy to read.   There are some errors that I have noted in my notes, but those are easily corrected (and I am not sure that I would have found them if I had not been familiar with the historical background).   While a few problems do persist, these problems are easily correctable.  It is a very good book that will have a lasting impact on students and researchers studying the development of the American Constitution, particularly the Framers and the process of ratifying it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've heard so many good things about this book so I had to go back and read it after getting it in paperback and found a lot of good things.   For one, the characters are really unique:  They are a group of eight kids from two different towns in rural Pennsylvania that are on a camping trip.  The first book, called "Maze"   was a really good introduction for the kids.  My two friends read that one and had so much fun and a lot better relationships then the kids I was reading "Mazes."    The kids are not so good at math.  They don't understand fractions and they have a hard time with fractions.  We have a great math teacher and she teaches all of our classes the first week of school.  She makes sure that we are learning in a logical way.  Unfortunately, when the kids are doing math in math class, they never seem to know the answer to a question that we have asked them.  This book was good for teaching kids to think about the world and to reason about a problem using numbers that we as adults have mastered.  It was a good experience and I will be looking for more books like this in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good example of how a good science fiction novel will be written and how important it is to get the physics right.   In terms of physics, I had some trouble with the details (not being able to find the name of the effect, etc) but I think that if the story hadn't been so well written, it would have been a much harder story to read.   23 of 24 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book about a time when the world was a very different place.   I didn't have a computer at the time, so I had to write everything down by hand.  When I finished the book, it was quite an emotional release.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was written to be used in a high school English class.   It contains useful vocabulary and grammar, but it is not terribly creative in the way that many popular works of high school literature tend to be.  However,  it is fun to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have now read this book several times. It is excellent at dealing with very sensitive subjects. The stories in the book are well told, with a good deal of psychological detail. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is not a normal book; I know it looks like a normal children's book, but it is far more than that.  It is about the different ways a child can feel as the world around him changes around him.  This book is a must read for any child's library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am currently reading "Won't you be my friend" by a young woman called Janis Farabee- Farabee is the youngest of four girls, but she has an older sister who has given her an education and a good education too. Janis is in the second year of a two year program at the American School of Chicago. Her mother is a stay at home mom, so she is taking a gap year.   This book is about a very intelligent girl who is not being treated well.  She is not good at the things her older sister has done for her.  But she is able to find a way out of it and get back to a good academic program.  I love books that take you through the struggle and obstacles that the people in them face.  "Woned't you Be My Friend" is about what it is like to have to go through a lot of pain and loss without making it worse or better 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best part is that the characters don't know how the story ends: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was intrigued by the concept of what I was about to hear. I wanted to know more about the book, and the author went out of his way to give a more personal perspective than a "gimmick" story.   A great book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is brilliant in so many ways.   It is based off a true story:  My father, while working in the oil fields in Canada, died at a very young age and was taken home by a friend.  He lived out the remainder of his life on a small pension in a small farm.  I was always thinking about him, wondering what was going to happen when he reached the age of 80.  It was a very strange thing to think about.  This man had been so close to death, and yet in such a seemingly brief amount of time he had been born.  So the story I read in this book was exactly how my father died.  The story is told by an elderly farmer named George Sargent, who is very much like my father.  However, George was a little older than my father, and as the story goes, George died at only 24, after a very short period of time in a hospital, as a result of not being able to come up with the money to pay his hospital bills.  George was very much in love with my mother.  She loved George, and it is said that she had a very hard time accepting the fact that George was no longer alive, as the love she felt for him was so great, and she could not give him up.  And while George may not have been alive for as long as my father was, my mother certainly loved him like my dad loved her.  If you are interested in the story behind this, it is fascinating and amazing.  But most importantly, the story of George Siskent, a man who lived through World War II and ended up living out his days on a pension, is really interesting.  As a child, I wanted to do that.  In fact, my sister and I wanted a pension just like my brother.  Our parents didn't understand it, but eventually they did.  One day, we told our parents about the pension and their response was very strange:  Well, that is what they do for a living!  Now that is a little bizarre.  At the same time that my sister was going through her life of wanting a pension like her mother, George Sargeant was going in the opposite direction.  His health deteriorated so rapidly that he couldn't even hold a pen properly, let alone write a novel.  Eventually, it was determined that he would never regain any of his health, and
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am looking for a book about the life of Winston Churchill that will be informative and entertaining as well as informative, and this is it.   It is a little different than I expect, and the book has its share of inaccuracies, but it's good enough to be worth the price of admission. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a way to deal with my husband who has Asperger's.   It was written by a man who has himself suffered from it, but it is very realistic   There were times when I had a hard time following him, but he was very good at pointing out the flaws in others (like me!).   In short, this is the book that I wish I had read long ago. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book of all time.   When I first heard about it I said "I'm not gonna read a book by a bunch of white kids..."   It has nothing to do with the author's race.  It's about a white kid who finds himself in a race problem with a black boy.  For me it is a very touching book about two kids who have something in common -- they both want to be in the same grade.  I found this book in the Goodreads book reviews section.  This book is worth reading just for the first half of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book in 2005. I am a professor of English and have been teaching this book since it was published.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm really happy with this book! It gives great insight into the way my father dealt with anxiety and depression. He was a very kind and patient man, and this book provides great examples of how his patience and empathy for others helped him to get out of that dark place and into a better place.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book last year when I was at the beginning of my PhD program.   It was by my PhD advisor at that time, so I was familiar with the topic.  This is a book that's not for everyone,   but    for a Ph.D. student who's studying the development of the brain (or anyone who just wants to understand how the mind works)   This book was very well put together and easy to read.  And the content is so dense you'd really need to get lost in it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is very well written.   It contains a lot of different historical events that lead to the end of the world.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book, I think it's good.   One thing I didn't find interesting is the author's own views on philosophy and science, he doesn't feel the need to convince me that anything he says is correct. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The way the author writes about science is very refreshing, with just enough common sense to not come off as cranky.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book based on a recommendation from a fellow student in college who said the same book was available for free on her laptop.   The first couple of chapters were a little slow, but by the end of the first one I could tell I really liked this book.  It's very similar to the  I'm Not a Good Person   series that has a very similar vibe, but the tone is different.  The writing is a little harder, but I think the story is more effective for that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing I hated about the novel was that in the first chapter, the narrator and I are discussing the difference between "The English Patient" and "The Naked City". The narrator points out that the English Patient is much more like an Indian tale than a story told in the manner of "The Story of a Man Without Hands" - the narrator doesn't like that one and would rather have read a book about the first half of "Naked City".  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The last few books I've read from this author really impressed me, and it's a great deal cheaper to buy a copy of the series than it is to own a hard copy (if you can find one).   This one is not a perfect book, but I don't think it's the worst one   the only real complaint I have is that he doesn't really do much with his female characters   and it really hurts the story 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book, it was a good mix of history and science   It was good reading.   As a scientist it was good to see that many people have seen the same thing in this world  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not the best thing you'll read this year, but you'll definitely enjoy it if you've got the time and a bit of an appetite for books about love and pain and betrayal.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about how a woman's brain works.   What was interesting about it is that the author doesn't focus on what happens to the brain when a woman goes through the menopause.  I think most of the things that happened to me (the loss of male hormones) could be described as psychological, and so could the loss of libido after the age of forty.  But the author never focuses on those things.  Instead she explains that her "experience" with men (the ones who wanted her and didn't get her back) had a huge influence on her thinking and so she has developed a set of rules about what men should do to a woman and a set a of expectations for a man to behave in ways that he shouldn't.  These rules and expectations are completely different from what I was taught growing up as a kid, and it is interesting that she can describe them so clearly.  This book is a good introduction for women who want to know what women think about men. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of my favorites because it is not just a simple collection of short stories.  It is a story of what happens to people when they are told they are unworthy of love.  In the first chapter the narrator says that one of his most difficult things to accept was that his love was a lie.  Later the same narrator writes about a marriage in which a man believes he is in love with his wife even though she has sex with other men.   I think he is describing the woman's true character when he says "I knew what that feeling was like."  The stories are so vivid that sometimes the reader forgets how much the stories are meant to be funny or heart breaking. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely love this book.   It's a fantastic history of the American West. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing is fine but the story is good! The story is not original but it's good and it has a few surprises  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this book, I was very disappointed.  The author seemed to think that the "nitty gritty" would be easy for her.  She wrote two very different books, one was a quick, hot read, but the other, the more scholarly, took much longer.  As with any good book, it's the little details and nuances that make it great.  This book was written in 1854.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good story. I thought the book was going to be a long novel, but I was pleasantly surprised when the author included an appendix of illustrations by famous people. I have a thing for cartoons.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The Great American Novel" is a very good book.   It covers the first 150 years of American history in just a few hundred pages.  I liked that the author used the words 'dumbfounding' 'disgraceful' 'horrible' and 'disrespectful' in the same sentence.  Also I liked the idea of the writer "stubbornly maintaining" their opinion, which seemed very fair to me.  While I didn't really see how 'The Great White Hope' fits into the historical narrative, it's definitely an interesting story and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in American history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read many books and many more non-fiction books on the same subject. This is the best one  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good overview of the early history of the American Civil War.   I think the author is a bit better at discussing the actual conflicts than is his fellow historian Robert J. Jansen.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was amazing. I can't recommend this book highly enough.   I got it on a lark and read it in about 30 minutes.  This book helped me understand a lot of the issues I have with the current generation of feminists.  They have made a lot more progress than I had expected from the feminists I was raised with.  The other thing is the author is the real life hero of this book.  I've met her on a few occasions and she has always treated me like a friend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good historical story.   There is a lot of good historical material in this book, but this is the only one that makes me feel like I'm living it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    So good.   I can't find the copy of the book in my library but it says on the back cover that it was "A New Classic by a former FBI agent," so it was probably a good buy at the time.  It was a good introduction to the whole field and provided a good background on the Bureau's operation against the Communist threat during the Cold War. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   .I really enjoyed   the novel as a whole, so I   couldn't be happier that it   is available in print form  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Songs of a Dead God" is a work of dark fantasy about death and the occult. It is also an excellent book about the evils of the Church and the corruption it brought upon the culture of England.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a wonderful read.   I was in love with the narrator   and found it easy to relate to her.  
Write a positive review about a good book:      I was reading this a few months ago and didn't get to it for a while. Then, after I finished it, I felt a rush.   It really made sense and was well-written.  It was so frustrating trying to find books on the subject that weren't over-the-top.     This book is good because it is written in a way that it is interesting to you as you read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been thinking about writing something about this book for awhile now and I am glad I finally did.   This is the story of the life and legacy of "Pigpen".   He came into the band when they were at their best and their worst.  The early years were rough, the later years he was a giant.  I had the privilege of hearing Pigpen sing with John and the Grateful Dead in the 60's, a show that was a real highlight of my life.  This book, though not a biographical work, did an excellent job at capturing the essence of a man that was one of the most memorable and creative artists I've ever seen live. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book by Robert J. Sawyer, and he writes some interesting characters, although his prose doesn't quite match his characters.  I liked this book, although I wish that the book had a bit more action in it to tie into the characters, like some of the other great books that I've read about in the past like   The Lost Girl  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading The Black Company Series for awhile now and am not disappointed.   The books are well written and the main character, John, is very well developed.  The first book is about the first night of training as a Black Company and the second book deals with John's last night as one of them.  John is very calm but you can see his apprehension.  I look forward to more books in the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read "The God Delusion" for the first time a few days ago and liked it very much. I thought it was a good summary of the atheist movement, I'd had many conversations with atheists, mostly on this subject, but this book helped me understand it better.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story was interesting and interesting to me in an interesting way.   I felt as though I knew it all but the last part felt as if it was just right.  I was glad that I found this book and I'm glad that it was well written and worth reading
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that this is an excellent book on the Holocaust. It is a fine historical work, and a good introduction to the Holocaust.   There is a nice story at the beginning about how the Holocaust is being taught in American schools, and also about how it is being studied in other countries (which is good). It is very easy to read, and very easy on the stomach. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book I had to use the same exact technique of asking questions so often that the book kept getting shorter and shorter - it is as if a publisher made up their mind on a certain book's theme and tried to make it interesting but got distracted by everything.   This book was much more interesting than I expected. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book.   It's a wonderful book about a wonderful woman and a wonderful time period. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a bit afraid that the book would just be some sort of boring story of some guy who wanted to know if people he was sleeping with were gay. It wasn't!   The book is very well written and gives a lot of information on what it's like to be gay in Japan.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books that I have read about the American Revolutionary War. It is not only about the actual battle but also about the war as a whole.    It is the best book on the war   that I found and I highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:    First off, this book was extremely easy to read (even though it's not a first person account). I really enjoyed the way she took her time to really dive into the details and the character.   I also really enjoyed all of the background on how the world works, and some of the history of various civilizations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've seen a few "How to cook Chinese food" books and I'm glad I read this one.   The first time I made rice with beef from the book, it came out amazing, the second time I had it with beef it was way too spicy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought the first volume of a historical detective series and am so glad I did.   The first volume does a nice job of showing the historical context of what happened and gives you a better grasp on the characters' personalities and motivations.  This book might be the last of the series 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a classic.   The basic ideas of the book have been around for ages but it is still interesting to see it all laid out in such a simple, easy-to-read format.  I am not sure what other kind of book this is but it certainly is not a "chicken book". 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this book a lot.   If you like the book or are looking for something new I suggest picking this up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The first time I heard about it was from a friend in college. I remember the cover: it was the kind of thing that could only come from a very successful horror series.   I bought it in a Used Book store on a whim because I thought the description sounded interesting, but I didn't expect to have such a good time with it.  "I was so very wrong about this series "  The book follows four teens: Jason, the bookish one, who is friends with his older sister and his sister's boyfriend, who may or may not be an ex-spy for a government agency.  Jason also has a crush on Sarah, his classmate, and the series explores what happens when a boy and a girl are allowed to be true to their feelings.  The story is interesting because it explores relationships between teens and their parents (something I think every parent is interested in, as I know I am) and how the parents react to that.  At one point in the story, Jason is so worried that Sarah will find out about a new boyfriend (who isn't really a boyfriend), he hides their relationship.  His fears are unfounded.  In a surprise turn of events, the boyfriend, John, is Sarah's ex-boyfriend, who was her boss during a stint in Iraq.  And although he doesn't actually go in for torture (although he does get the woman pregnant), he is definitely interested in her.  My biggest complaint about the story is that there are no real suspenseful elements.  All four friends get involved in a series of strange situations involving Sarah's parents, and even though they all get out in the end, the ending is still a bit anticlimactic.  But in the first book, The Devil's Spoke, they are not only allowed to have feelings for each other, but are able to explore them in such a positive way.  There is no ambiguity about the relationships between Jason, Sarah, and John in this book.  I liked how they never gave Jason the hard time or gave him any special treatment.  It's just the way it is, you know?   Other than that, I thought it was interesting how they interacted with each other.  Sarah and Jason's relationship is obviously more serious than John's because he's an ex, but the way he interacts with Jason is also different from Jason's.  One scene where Jason's parents come out of their
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to say, I am pretty sure that if you don't live near a college that allows independent study, it is a good idea to go to one before starting a college degree.   The professor was great and a lot of the material was difficult for me to grasp, but it wasn't impossible.  I am still a little rusty, but I am going to work hard and figure it out.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a huge fan of John's work I was absolutely delighted to see this one being released on a new (yet familiar) format.   This is a real treat!   I enjoyed this story and I loved all the characters: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's been years since I read a book that had the effect of putting a whole new light on what I had always seen in my imagination as "magic".   The "magic" in this book is a very precise and well done use of light, colors, shadows and camera angle as well as a few other things that make the book a fun read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book for those who have already read The Lord of the Rings.   If you have read the books, you can easily do this.  There are a few little niggles which make it a little slow, but it is a good little book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book hard to get through.   It is about a person who goes by the name of the King of The Dead, an "Evil Lord" who is seeking a "Seal of Approval" from a "Hero" who would make a perfect sacrifice for him.  The book starts out well and is a great introduction to the world and the characters.  But by the end of the book  it was hard for me to continue reading  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a fantastic book, which takes a complex subject and presents it in a way that is easy to follow.   I really appreciate the clarity and simplicity in which it is presented.  A must-read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book in which I've felt like I was in a group that was really talking about something other than themselves and their relationships.   The way they talk about love (and sex), life, health, etc.  is so much more interesting and useful than what I've been learning about them in the dating world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is fantastic.   I love this book and always look forward to reading a good sci-fi book.  This is the first book I have read in which an alien race that colonized earth and other planets and then settled here were also the cause of a major ecological catastrophe.  The reason the humans were in such a mess was because of the alien's wastefulness and abuse.       While I like to think that aliens are kind and friendly but this doesn't seem to be the case here. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about the Holocaust:  A very informative, well-written book, written in a manner that does not demonize Jews or the Germans.   It is very disturbing, yet a very good read 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was younger I remember buying a copy of 'What We Talk About When We Talk'   and   thinking it was good for what it was, a book about a girl's secret desire to be a boy.   When I found out it was about a transsexual I remember thinking,   "What   a mess   this is  !   This book is   full of   confusing   stuff   about   gender, and  "   What a   waste   of   time  ."   It's not worth it   for me   but   if   you   really   want   to   know   something   more   then   read this book

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book thinking it would be a fun read that was about a woman named Sara and her family's adventures while in Mexico.  I was happy to see that the book actually was about that and not a women who was going through a divorce (the author of the book is the husband's sister).   My favorite character was the mother who took care of her kids, and the book was entertaining and interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I think it was written by someone who knows a lot about the subject.   They really make the points they are trying to make clear by giving a lot of examples and quotes, a very good job. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was great.   I really didn't need the introduction of this book, because I know the basics.  I have a few children now and one is a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, so I know that there are several characters from the books that will appear in this series.  One of the best things about the book was that   it made the characters like real people.    That was especially nice   because   the book   was   a real treat,   so it   made   me feel like I   had my cake and ate it too!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to the work of St. Augustine and other medieval writers and artists.   I particularly liked the descriptions of medieval art, from the "beautiful gold coins" in a pendant to the "unseen, eternal stars" in one of the frescoes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    For those that have never read it:  Well, it's an adventure story, I know, but it isn't all that I was expecting.   The story is interesting, and the characters are likable, but the pacing is not consistent.  The plot doesn't keep me interested, and some of the scenes were very silly.  It wasn't a total waste of my time, but I couldn't really get into the story, despite the potential for a very good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is brilliant in a way that only a book by a genius like Stephen King can be.   You can tell King is an old pro, because he has clearly put a ton of work into this.  I was expecting something a little more out-there, but this is as close as he gets.  It's dark, it's dark as fuck.  The writing is like Stephen's, only he does it so well that you can't help but smile.  And, the best part is how the entire book was based on a phone call.  If you read this book when it was first published, you'll notice the title is " The Man Who Walked by Himself."

Write a positive review about a good book:    While this is the second book in a series, I have enjoyed each book.   I had never read about a woman in the military, but I am very curious to do so now.  I'm glad my Grandparents were soldiers in the Army when they were young. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had no idea what I was going to get from this book until I opened it up.   It's been two years since I've read any fantasy.  I've never had much interest in anything but the most modern science fiction and fantasy. This book was a welcome break from that.  The setting is different from most of what I'm used to.  It takes place in a different time but the same place.  This is something I'll have to read up about a little more.  A good read though.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   There is a very strong anti-social aspect to most of humanity, and our attempts to work together to survive has always led to horrible things happening, but there is a real sense of hope in this book to try and get people together.  I hope a similar book does not come along in the future, because it really is a depressing read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was blown away by how much of a good read this book was!   My only problem with it is that a little too much of the story focuses on what makes a good story, and what doesn't   (the "mythology" part was a little distracting).   But that was probably my only problem

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about the history of the French Revolution   (   The subtitle of the book is a "biography" which is a bit misleading as there is no attempt to cover the whole revolutionary period).

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is great! I found myself going back to it several times during the day.   A friend's dad has a severe form of Parkinson's, and he reads the book daily.  I found that the best part of the book is the parts about the family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is good, I agree, but the idea that the author has some sort of "a plan" is a bit odd.     The first half of the book describes a person's journey of self discovery after his mother dies and he is thrown out of his home by his family.  His parents were both alcoholics, and he had a difficult time staying sober.  The other two characters in the book are like his father (although he has a bit more money) and his uncle (who is not as crazy as his father and is more sane, but still drunk).   In the first half he spends time in a psychiatric hospital, so I expected him to be somewhat sober at the end of the second half.  My problem is that in the second part he is back in the home where his mother died, and the alcoholic relatives come back to be around him.  This has the effect of making him more crazy and paranoid.  It also changes his attitude towards people.  A lot of the characters he meets he immediately thinks he wants to marry and have kids with.  In a weird way this book is about growing up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book in a series on the evolution of our knowledge about our ancestors and they's relations.   I find it a little difficult to understand the ideas, but the information is there for anyone who wants it.  I like to think of us as being somewhat descended from the homo erectus, and we are very good at doing whatever it takes to get along.  If I could make a wish, I would want to be able to stand a bit more upright while in a meeting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read a lot of books about the early Mormon church (and about other Mormon groups) but I've never read about the LDS Church prior to the 1830s.

Write a positive review about a good book:    There was a point where I was so confused I couldn't figure out if I was reading a good fantasy story or if this was a bad retelling of some old stories.   But then I realized that's why the author wrote it as a fairy tale, so it could be a good fairy tale to a fairy story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have found this book to be a great resource for teaching math to high school students.   While there are some issues that can be discussed in a class, the discussion is done well and the content covers a lot of territory.    The book is a bit dry, but I don't think that would hold back a lot students from a good discussion.

As mentioned in the blurb, it's a sort of cross between a historical novel and an adventure novel:  The main character is a nobleman from a village in the French countryside (I suspect the writer got that reference because, as I say in the text, he lived there once and found a couple of really interesting historical tidbits and a lot of amusing historical names, most of which are still used in English).  He's a good man who loves his country and his family; he's always on the side of the poor, the dispossessed, and the disenfranchised.  It's a bit of a stretch that he doesn't like guns or swords (both of which were used in the story), and the plot is somewhat episodic, but if you can make your mind up about what a cross between the "Davos" of "Game of Thrones" and "Spartacus"  the hero is, you'll get through it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be very well written, funny, and funny. I'm an accountant and have some experience with working with accounting software, so it's not surprising that I don't like these things much.   However, this book helped me understand how my boss does his job properly, so that I can get along with him.  This book also had a lot of useful info on taxes and how they work.  This is a book I'd read a lot more times if it was only on its own terms. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book   It is a good way to learn about the history of Jewish women. I also like how it includes an emphasis on what Jewish women do on behalf of their husbands and families.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book a few weeks ago when I was looking to get a few more books on the subject of modern magic (I'm a little old to be doing research for a project), and it has been a nice refresher!   My favorite is the "The Magician's Handbook" because it is so detailed, and you get a little feel for what is going on in the real world.   This book is also not very cheap (about $13-15 depending on the version) so it's definitely not for me, but I think if you are interested, it's a good buy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A little hard to read but once I got through the first chapter the story was really worth the trouble. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished this book and I liked it.   It made me feel something.  It's a good story.  It's a dark book.  You don't want to miss it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the second book I have read by Lillian Roth, and the first one is much better.   I loved the writing style in both of them   But the second is not as good   As for the subject,   A little more detail about her relationship to her dog   (She thinks she can "talk" to him   and it works). 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is an excellent book about the history of the development of photography. It explains how the process of image making came about, why there are differences in camera designs, why the Kodak model looks so much better than most digital cameras, and how the development process works.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book and found it fascinating in what the writer, Tessa Berenson, did with a topic that has been around for a long time: 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story is so good it's incredible   This book is so deep it hurts   Read it in one sitting,    It's the best book   I wish I had read it when i was 13  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book contains some interesting historical information, but the chapters dealing with the Nazi occupation of Austria, Hungary and the Soviet Union are the ones that really make the book.   As someone who has been fascinated with the Jewish question since I was a young child, I found the history interesting and thought provoking. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very well done work.  The author does an excellent job  of describing the nature of human interaction as it is practiced among the different nations  of the world .  The examples given are so precise and clear as to make you believe in the authenticity of the statements . All of this is complemented by the author's analysis of the "hidden" motives underlying the international tensions that have been so closely associated with the wars.   There are several references  to "secret agreements,"  "hidden arrangements," and "hidden agendas" . The author is a skilled reporter,  but it is difficult to read an entire book  about the subject.  (There is plenty of "expert" opinion, but there is no reason to believe that all this expertise is accurate.)   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book very much.   First, I think there were too many characters in this book (especially since it was a children's book).   Second, the ending was abrupt.  Third, the story was very strange.  Fourth, I have read the books in the series and these books were way ahead of the others.  Fifth, I read this book from a young age.  Sixth, I felt that this book was a good read for kids.  Seventh, I enjoyed it.  Eighth, I'd recommend it to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as a sort of exercise in "The New Science of Writing," an ongoing project by Dr. Judith Shanks, which has included a series of "How to Read Literature" posts in the last few years.  Shanks' research is based on the observation that language is far more complex in non-fiction than in fiction, and that, like writing itself, fiction requires a lot of practice to master.  I also found this book fascinating in light of recent "self-help" literature about writing -- the emphasis is on how to improve the craft in general, not on improving a single genre or technique.    Overall, I can see where she's coming from in regards to the problem of getting better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "It's as if a million words of non-fiction suddenly sprang into my head. It's also as if, at the age of eight, I suddenly found I was a big-time novelist." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm glad I picked up this book, but I was a little disappointed.   It's a pretty straightforward historical novel, not too technical or dry, not a good read for me anyway.  It's a lot less suspenseful than I would have liked though   I'm going to give a spoiler warning for the first chapter:  This is the chapter where the real mystery of the book is revealed, right before we get the rest of the story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of David Baldacci's novels.   He writes with so much emotion and detail, that it almost doesn't matter that it's written in a way that is hard to read.  The main character, Jake, is an alcoholic and gambler, who was born with a "broken heart", and has become quite a bit more "broken" as the books progress.  While not the best book I've read (the main character is the main weak point),  I liked this one the most.  It was very emotional and the ending was satisfying.  And when a novel can be that emotional, it's usually a good one.  Thanks for your hard work, David 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a lot of friends who've read this book, and it's been a huge influence on me.   It was the first time I thought of having a second job, and I never would have thought about it without reading this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not only good on many different levels but it is great for its approach and its ability to get you to re-evaluate your own relationship with religion.   From the outset I was taken with the writing style of the authors and the overall message this book conveys.  One thing I am very pleased about is how the authors were able to bring some humor to the book.  This is not a book for the faint of heart and there are very few pages that can be skipped over without a problem.  While it might not appeal to everyone it is a valuable tool that many people will find useful for their own journey and I am grateful for it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book by the most outstanding writer in the field, one of the very few people today who can write with both depth and elegance about a complex subject like   the origins of Christianity  . The book is not a biography but an extended historical investigation of the first five centuries of the church.   The writing style is quite literary, using the   words as they were understood in those times and   giving full and vivid coverage to the actual events and their   historical significance. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're like me and have not heard of this one yet, I highly recommend it!   It's a great story, about a boy and a girl who live in the country, and the challenges they have in life (and in love)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought the book after hearing about the positive reviews for it from my son, who is a professional in the field.   It was pretty easy to read and a lot of it made sense.  The biggest disappointment was the fact that he tried to do a "nosebleed theory" but couldn't figure out where the evidence to support his theories came from. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My son is in the Navy and I wanted to pass along to him the story of the "Sugar Daddy" of a couple I know.   They are very kind and kind people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a nice little book on how to get a good grade in school.   It makes good use of examples from popular culture. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't know if it's just my taste, but I really enjoyed this book. The ending was a bit rushed, but not out of place in a series like this.   It's a bit silly, but you can enjoy it for the characters and world building, not so much the ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must read book.   There's more to this book than you might think. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed the book and was thoroughly enjoying it.   The main characters were interesting and the book was well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a little late to the book party, but this book is a good choice.   It has a lot of good information about your health   like cholesterol and blood pressure.  However, it would have been better if the author would have talked about some of the newer supplements that have been invented to improve health 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first    purchase          I've ever made is a big one.   It   has   an   powerful   argument   that   is   so   important   for   us   to   understand   our   roles  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is by far one of the best books I have read in ages. It is an excellent treatment of the political history of the last century in which the two main players - the "new left" of the 60's and 70's (the "Stalinists" who opposed Stalin) and the "old left" (the Trotskyists and later "New Left" groups) - were the dominant forces.   The author is careful to write of the many problems with Soviet politics, but these problems are not of great importance in this book.  In particular, the author makes an excellent case that the old left's "Stalinesque" anti-bourgeois populism (which was the essence of "Trotskyism") was based on a misunderstanding of the Soviet economy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very pleased that my book came at the very last minute   thank you for a wonderful adventure  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about the Jewish community of America in the 19th century:  There is an excellent introduction by Dr. M. K. Fisher which will be required for all students of Jewish history. The book does a superb job of presenting the Jews' experience as Americans,   who were forced to assimilate into a society which regarded them as different.   Dr. Fisher discusses the role that the Puritan New England townsfolk played in the forced assimilations,  which was a common experience in the British Isles in the early 1700s.  This book is the first volume in a multi-volume series about the growth of the Jewish population in America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A beautiful and subtle study of the relationship between a woman and her home. A beautiful novel."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a fantastic read! It is an excellent reference book about the various types of cedar available, from the cheap ones to the more expensive ones. The author has a knack for explaining the differences between cedar species and describing how to use them effectively. I like the fact that the book covers woodworking from the beginning.   If you don't know about woodworking, this book is perfect for you!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought a copy of The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up from the bookstore where I used to buy my books.   The book's premise is simple:  You know you've got to keep things neat, but it can take a little effort.  To make things a little easier, you do something that's actually really clever and creative:  get rid of stuff you don't use anymore.  The result is a much more organized and happy house.       The book is well written and has many good ideas:  1.  Use a box for a shelf.  It's the easiest way to organize books.  2.   Get rid of your junk mail.  Put it on the shelves.  It's the least you can do.  If you still want the mail, you can post notices to remind you.  This is more economical for you and more fun.  3.  Create a little space for your family to gather.  Keep books and photos in their places so that they can look good together.  These little things add up.  I don't know if I'll do them all, but they're all fun ideas.  My mom got rid of a lot of things on my list, and I'm very grateful to her.
Write a positive review about a good book:    While it may not be perfect and some of the characters don't have their own stories it is a great start to a great series, I look forward to all the stories  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book, so much so I gave it to my cousin who is into BDSM and she really enjoyed it.   It is also a great read about BDSM with some good stories about sadomasochistic sex. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an entertaining and informative book, though it can be a little dry at times.   The writing style and subject matter is a little confusing.  It was an interesting read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent book, and a good primer for anyone looking to understand the issues behind the Occupy movement.   -   The best part of this book is that it lays out the case of the two main Occupy groups, the general population and the activists.  It is not a polemic, but it does provide a good overview of both movements and how each is doing in a number of different ways.  -    
Write a positive review about a good book:    When i first read this book it was at a friend's house for her birthday so i was excited to finish it, i think i'll read it again just for the story 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about the war between the North and South, and it's all about the people involved. I found a lot of the details very interesting, and the author clearly had a lot to say.   I don't know if I'd recommend this book to everybody. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a nutshell:  The story is fantastic, the prose is excellent, the characters are interesting, and the prose style is very readable.   The ending is what made me happy:  I really, really want to see more of this world, and if it was written better, that would be great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book. I am not an expert in the field, but it seems clear to me that a person with my medical background can do a fairly thorough job of identifying and explaining a specific patient's symptoms.   If a medical doctor wants to have a conversation with you about a patient he just saw, he should be prepared to show how he came to that diagnosis and how he can help you do more of the work himself.  I have taken some time to read the book, so I am a little less confident about some of the findings than most medical specialists.  For example, there are a number of medical conditions that are more easily misdiagnosed.  Some of the information in the book about "excessive" stress is helpful but I am skeptical about the reliability of the evidence, which in turn, has me wondering about how much stress is safe to have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A highly readable book. It's clear that a lot of thought went into it, and a lot more goes into the writing than you might imagine.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed reading about the life of George Washington and the early years of the U.S.   For those who aren't familiar with the period,   George Washington was one of the first presidents to visit the colonies and establish a new government   Washington also wrote the Declaration of Independence,    which is probably the most influential statement   made by any individual in American history   the Declaration   states   "all men are created equal   and   among them all   we hold   that   all men are endowed by   a common   Creator   with   certain   inalienable   rights  ."

Write a positive review about a good book:   A very detailed and realistic portrayal of a difficult period of our history.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not a very good story teller but I found this book extremely interesting. It was also really interesting to read about how they are trained and how they interact with people. I found myself thinking about what I might do in certain situations that may come up during the next few years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely loved this book. The characters were real people (I mean, they were real to me!) and I think that was the main reason I liked the book so much.   There are some parts that I thought were a little bit corny but I still really enjoyed the story (the part about the dog was just awesome to read).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was looking for a good story to read when I discovered my local library didn't have one.   So I decided to give this one a try.  I enjoyed it   and am glad it's on the shelves in a good library. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book, and very well put together.   It is not only true, but is a brilliant summary of what is taking place in our government today.    It is well-documented, and it is a must read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "It is important to realize, however, that the real power of the Bible is not what it says about the afterlife but what it tells us about ourselves. It points us to God, his will for our lives, and his guidance for living. It provides an important vocabulary to understand the world we inhabit and to understand ourselves. We should use it. And we should read it every day."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would have rated this book a little higher, but the first couple of chapters just didn't make sense. The story and characters are compelling enough, but I couldn't keep track of the "whys" and "hows."   By the end of the book I was more intrigued than annoyed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book   I first read this book as a way to remember a particularly memorable time in my life, and the first book I ever read was the first in a trilogy about a child (who turns out to be a very adult) who must be trained to become a vampire (this book)   it really gave me a good sense of how much   all the vampire books in a genre can change   over the years  . The plot is the usual:  1) The kid's parent dies and he's adopted by a rich man.   2) The vampire takes the kid (who has a great talent for writing and making art) and goes to school, but his teacher wants to do a science project on "The Vampire Lestat" so he keeps him in his basement.  3)  This is probably the most interesting part, which is how the child becomes a vampire, though the vampires tend to come out as they're about to go through with their plans.  4) The whole time the vampire's not aware of his child until he's at a party, though he's sure he's in the process of changing him.  5) When the vampire wants to "kill" the kid for his own good, he can't tell anyone because he wants to keep his identity a secret. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of the James Patterson books that I haven't read in a while, but I haven´t read a book from his "Cats" series that I enjoyed as much as this one.   My favorite part of the book is the "What is a cat?" chapter that goes into the cat´s day-to-day life and is about the only good thing in the entire series, other than maybe the very funny cats! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good introduction to the history of the American Revolution.   The historical background is very thorough, but a little short on details that are useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was very informative.   It is well written, has a lot of information to keep track of, and is easy to read.  The only problems I had were that it took me 2 hrs to read it and a second reading to get all of the information I had missed the first time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not the biggest fan of the original, but this one is much more likeable.    A lot of the characters in the original are just kind of boring and I just wish they were less ridiculous. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It is about a little girl who is very sick but can be saved.  This little girl has a real love for her cat, and wants her cat to be the person that the little girl is to be.  But the cat is not ready to be a person.  It does not understand that what she wants is for its owner to be its friend.  Instead of hurting itself in her attempts to make the little  girl her friend, the cat seems to love the  girl.  The little girl, on the other hand, hates the cat for its  self.  I was glad that the cat had a purpose. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The novel is set in the 1980s in the American south.   It is a very well researched book.  It tells the stories of people who lived during the era of the Vietnam War.  The characters are real,  some as a direct result of the war, some as indirect  (the main character was the wife of a soldier ).   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so very pleased   with this book   !  .  ,   That it was so well organized and detailed and yet so easy to follow.  I had never even heard of this book before   but it is so much more than a simple reference! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. It was very well written, a wonderful book, and well researched. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you know me or even if you don't, you'll be able to tell that I'm a huge fan of books by authors who don't live in the US.   The books   are published in the   UK  .   They are written in an   sophisticated   style that is as close as I think I've ever   come to a language   in my life.  It's a lot easier to read than   the other stuff I've read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are looking for a good, well-written, and well-told history of the Vietnam War and its aftermath, this is it. If you have read anything about the war, you should be very familiar with the people who were involved in it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It really helps us see some things about ourselves that might not be so pretty.   We can get so caught up in what we want to be that we forget about the kind of people who are going to say mean things about us. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As an old school gamer who is a die-hard follower of the series I was absolutely thrilled that a new book in the series was finally being published.   I am always disappointed that they don't update a book to make it more modern.  But that is not a problem with this book   The story was very interesting and I really enjoyed reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book.   The author did a good job at explaining the difference between a "natural" and a "cured" cheese.  There is also a bit about how the natural cheese was produced and some information about the natural process of cheese making. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book made me rethink my position on the "crisis in the West," in which a seemingly insipid response to "global" problems has produced a wave of anti-Americanism and anti-capitalist thought (to say nothing of the fact that the crisis was largely engineered by the American "rich" and their political allies).   The book has some very good insights, including a critique of the recent European and Canadian neo-liberals as not having taken into account the realities of the global market.    (Not only does this seem very odd to me, it also reminds me how some of these folks don't like to think about their own country's problems in terms of the rest of the world, either.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a wonderful read!   My first book with a feminist viewpoint   I am so glad that I read this!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It was very detailed.  And he went a long way in explaining the differences between different cultures and languages.  Also it shows how the people can be quite different. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a little funny that all the time traveling stuff only occurs between the fifth and ninth worlds, but if we can accept this, why couldn't the second one be like the first? And it makes sense because there would be a conflict between the two groups if one was all the way in the future and the other on the past.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read The Power of Good to learn more about the world of the occult.   A good read,   I read The power of good to learn about the occult, but I wasn't impressed.  I would have been much more impressed if the author had discussed the more important topics, such as occult numerology, astrology, and spiritism.  A few of these topics are covered in a separate book,  but it would have helped if the book had been a bit more general.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fun and easy read that is well written and interesting  
Write a positive review about a good book:        This book is a good read, but does not provide an adequate analysis.   It is an interesting and thought provoking book about the importance of the scientific method.  As an anthropologist and scientist, I would be interested to see how the scientific paradigm will change over the next few decades.  It would be interesting to read about the changes in the field of social anthropology to include the scientific approach, as well as the cultural bias. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good read about a young man's initiation into Scientology.   I enjoyed the story but I think the first couple of chapters were a bit confusing for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The description of this book sounds like a good recipe, but I was not able to cook up the finished product.   I bought a recipe book from a local cookware vendor.  Unfortunately, it was missing the "cooking" part.  However, it had a few basic recipes, including a recipe for    pizza dough, which is a must for anyone trying to cook this recipe.  As for the ingredients   -  1 tsp dry yeast -  2 tbsp butter (softened) -   1 cup flour - 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is good at best, but I do recommend reading it if you are interested in an alternative to the current version of this material (or perhaps just want a good read on a complicated topic).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "For anyone looking to learn more about quantum physics and/or chemistry, this book is a great read. There are many different perspectives and opinions on the subject."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent review of the current state of the book industry and its relationship to the market. The authors focus on a couple of books that are currently in the midst of their long process of "marketing."   One is the latest edition of Jane Eyre   and the other is The Great Gatsby    They are in the process of changing both and the changes are good and the price is right.   There was a good deal of good humor in the book but I think most people will be disappointed that the new books are in colour. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the few non-horror books   I can   still   appreciate.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am in love with this book.   This was the book that I bought when I was starting to get serious about trying kratom.  For a good many years I have struggled with what I've heard from other kratom users about a "buzzed feeling" coming from using kratom:  that's a problem, as that can create a negative experience if not taken care of in the right way.  In the past, I have tried a few "homeopathic" methods to deal with the buzzed feeling, but always ended up using krpek, which doesn't really work for me.  When I decided to try kratom, I was looking for something that worked more like an herbal tincture than a capsule:  I tried all of the kratom capsules in my local grocery store, but none had the same effect.  So I decided on a sample from a place that I had been meaning to visit:  the herbal pharmacy at the library.  Unfortunately, they couldn't give me a sample due to the fact that it was out of stock.  However, I managed to talk my way into getting a sample after explaining to them that my sample was not going to be in stock for a while.  It's not an ideal situation, but I wasn't going to leave a great kratom experience without trying it out.  The other problem is that in order to get the capsules to work, you have to crush them down pretty small, and I can't crush them as small as I'd like.  Another problem with capsules is that they are not exactly a good source of kratom extract.  Some of the things I've read about extract being bad for you is false:  one of the main problems with kratom is that it is often mixed with other chemicals and is not a pure plant extract. Another issue is that there are also a variety of strains of krp that are not really suitable for certain people.  I've had very good luck with my local kratom distributor:  the company is reliable and the product is very good.  As for the book:     It provides a good overview of the topic and I think it's well-written.  And it doesn't hurt that there is some real information in there, especially when it comes to dosing the capsules.  With a little bit of luck and planning, I think I can find a good place to buy some
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazing book.   I loved all the little references   to the work of others.  I am always looking to read more from this genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As I mentioned above, there was something in the book that seemed like a real need I had to read about it: I got very close to my brother at about age 18, after he came out as gay. I went on to marry someone for a bit before I was finally free from my own problems. Now that I am in the gay world again, my relationship with him is very much a part of my life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good, simple history of the French Revolution.   The "real" history is that the French Revolutionary Government was a dictatorship and the revolution was, in the end, crushed.  There are good people in the book who don't buy this, but I found it very interesting to see how they got to the conclusion that the Revolution was a disaster. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a long time fan, this book was a pleasant surprise. I was actually looking forward to it as I've been wanting to try a classic for a long long time ( The Great Gatsby ).   It also came with a little note that said "It is written as a love story".   I feel like a fool for buying that when it says it's about two women.   The "love story" is one of those bullshit romance plots that everyone loves to hate. The rest of the book is just a list of "things that made her a woman."   However, I don't care if it was a love love story or not - that's not what I want from a book.  It is what it is.  The book does make me laugh out loud a few times. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is well written and full of good information.   I got this book because it's a compilation of interviews with scientists about various subjects.  I have never done a science writing course before.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In a nutshell:  Good book for people who like books about writing and like reading about writing.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When you first pick up this book, you are taken aback by the writing style; it is not what one would expect from a serious academic work.   However, the work is a serious, thorough, rigorous and rigorous analysis of some very important historical events.  They are the subjects,   the subjects that have received most of the academic attention in the last 50 years.  This is a good starting point for the reader to understand what is at stake in what are very important and complicated events in the history of modern Japan. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fun and fascinating read. The book covers some interesting topics which may interest a layman like myself.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a copy of this book that I got as a freebie from my high school library.   It's not my favorite book by Dostoevsky, but this one I liked much better.  It features the characters of Anna and Peter, Anna's brother and his wife. Anna's son Dmitri was in the same grade as Dmitri's father in the army, and the whole family became close to the family of the two brothers.  Anna was very intelligent and learned a lot from them.  They live at the end of a long street with an inn where they stay during the winter.  As the story unfolds they begin to suspect the two men of stealing food.  I thought that they were a bit over dramatized.  A lot of the plot is about Dmitri and Anna's attempts to discover the true motives of the thieves.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My first choice would have been the same.   If the two books were equally good I would have given it to the second book in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I didn't know what I wanted to read till I got my hands on this book. I was really excited to read about the amazing work of Dr. William T. Jarvis who is a neurologist in the University of Texas. I also have a lot of interest in neurobiology.   Thank you, Dr. Jarvis, for making my brain a little less empty.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that makes you wonder why we haven't written more about it in the last decade:    It is such a fascinating, important, and often overlooked aspect of our culture.    A classic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept of a computer being capable of doing some sort of "thinking" is so old, it doesn't even require explanation.  It is a concept that many of us had when I was in school in 1980s.  I would have been a student if the computer had come in the 80s.   A simple way to think about it is that it is like an external hard drive where we put programs into one of the memory slots and use the computer as a hard disk drive.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I've ever read in my life and I've read plenty of books. It was the first time I read a good fantasy novel since I've been reading.   I really enjoyed the plot and the characters and the worldbuilding and the way it was explained so clearly that I don't need a lot of description on it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author has a gift for explaining and writing about the physical sciences, but he is more good at describing the mental side of science.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The second half of the book has some very good writing, the story is gripping, and it's so well-paced that the characters are still very alive when we get back to the story after the action is over.   It has the right mix of action, mystery, and psychological drama that makes a great thriller or a thriller that makes great use of a mystery and suspense angle.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book from a trade paperback that was on my way out of the mail (I got it through Amazon as a gift).   It's the perfect book to read if you need some historical context to understanding the past (and it does have some great information). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a great little read.   It's a bit strange that this is a "novel" about a robot, since it's already covered  a fair amount   in my blog and books that cover robot science.  While the book does a pretty good job at describing the robot, it doesn't seem to go into the details about it.  I was surprised   by the science of it all, and there's a lot   to talk about   but   the best part   is reading about it  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been waiting patiently for a good translation of the classic 'Renaissance' Italian book. Now this is the first that I have gotten.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book!   It was easy to get started and kept me interested throughout.   This is a good "back to basics" book that gives you a good idea of how to play the game and how to set it up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't remember my feelings about this book being exactly as positive as they are now, but it was a good read.    The main character, Cielo, is kind of a dork, but is in no way unattractive.  It is very difficult to take the boy seriously, but there is a definite reason behind his behavior.  In the first book he's a delinquent, but in this book he was raised in a small town and doesn't even know how to read and writes poorly.  He's a pretty good thief in a lot of ways, but that's not why he wants to be a thief.  Also, his dad is an extremely powerful mage, and the book makes it clear that he has a thing for her.  I really enjoyed the main character though, and would love to see more from him.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a little hesitant about this book because it's not really all that great. It's about a father who is trying to deal with his son's obsessive disorder. I think the book is about a lot of different things, such as coping with stress.   This is an excellent book though.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book very interesting and useful   But when it says:  "When he realized that he had the power to control the weather, his interest turned to weather control"   this says nothing about the weather in this book.   It only tells you that a man with the power of controlling the weather changed his mind and used his power to help people
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found myself extremely engaged during this book.   She doesn't tell me what happens until after I've spent months trying to get the details right.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of the books that have been on the New York Times Best-Seller List.   The  "   Mysteries of the American Dream "  has a similar feel to it, but is set in a much more  modern  setting   than the old stories about   the     American Dream.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first heard about this book, I was very skeptical about the idea that a person can become a vegan.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason I've been enjoying so many of the classic children's books I read as a child (including a lot of them by the same author) is because they are written by people who are not just good writers, but who write with a good understanding of children's literature.   This is one of them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was in my 20s.    While I think that people of both sexes can enjoy this book,   the main message is that women's issues are a women's issue.  I don't necessarily disagree.  But I can't help but think that these men were just trying to get laid.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have ever read!   I have been reading a lot of horror lately so this book is very timely.   There is so much suspense, horror, and dark ideas.  It is very sad that this book will soon be lost to time.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very skeptical about reading this book because it is so much about the author. But I am now a believer.   This book has some flaws.  Some people, including the author, have stated that this book is a revision of a previously published manuscript (which was not a good review of my manuscript at all).  I don't know, but I think my revision was better.  I had to reread a few of the more difficult chapters several times to make sure my reading was correct.  While the book is mostly about the work that I did as a writer, it also takes a look at my writing as well.  Although it is not a "how to write a successful book" book, it certainly has advice in it that I am sure most writers could use.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is very good.   This book is not a biography of   Gandhi, nor is it a historical account of him; it is a biography and an analytical work.  It is not about   India's history or about Gandhi's life, it is about 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best short story ever written.   It's so short and so well-written that you could read it once, take a few notes and go back to it in another five years.  It is as if each sentence was written by a different author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It's a great read if you enjoy fantasy.  I think that I would like this one better if I liked a more fantasy book, but that's just me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The last story has the best "punch", though.   This one was great, but it was my favorite too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great.  I can understand why people use the term "fantasy book" to describe the books in this genre, but most of these books don't really have that in mind.  The good thing about it is that it is clear what the author is trying to do with the stories:  a) Tell a good story, b) Show the characters growing, and c) Show how the people live and how it affects them.    I am looking forward to reading more of her books in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had the pleasure of learning about a lot of things by reading about them in my high school and college history books. The book has a good number of interesting details about how things changed when a great leader was in charge, and also a history about how the new leader tried to undo some of the damage. This is very good historical information to know about, and I'm glad I was able to find a book about it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read "A Woman's Choice" in September 2010.   It was so good that I gave it to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  I wanted to write a short review but, as it's a new book, there's nothing to say!   This is a book that's easy to read but has a lot of depth.  It's hard to put into words but so much of it is made so plain and understandable.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read plenty of books about the Vietnam War. Most of them, in their analysis of the War itself, have something to say about the U.S. military's use of torture. This one is different. The book is told from the point of view of American soldiers in the war.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My second visit to the library was here in February 2011 when my cousin had a birthday. She was given a free copy by her college's book club.   She really enjoys reading about dinosaurs and this is definitely a good read for her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good read   For this book to be successful, the author needed to make the book work from the beginning.   First off, the book has no author's note at the beginning, making me question the whole premise of the book.  The book is also quite a bit of work for a first book. There is a lot of content in it that is not explained by the author.  Even though the book doesn't include a glossary at the end, a lot would be lost by not using one.  I was a bit disappointed in this book because a lot was missing, but it is still a good introduction to what the book is about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is fantastic   We have been able to keep my 3 children from smoking their first cigarette after we were given a copy   by our church member who was a tobacco addict   in the 1930's.

Write a positive review about a good book:    There is a good story to be told about the Vietnam War, and a good idea to be added.   I've heard it talked about as one of the more harrowing chapters in history.  It was also one of my first books and it made me think.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm really happy I read this book.   The first third of the book is just wonderful:  The story is written in a very funny, straightforward way, and is the perfect mix of high fantasy with science fiction.  I just wanted to keep reading.  The characters were all great.  My favorite characters were the twins, and I liked the fact that the twins are the only main characters, but still they had to be created.  It was just so refreshing that they are not one dimensional.  They are flawed but interesting.  This is my first time reading a book where the author has a very specific voice and doesn't just write it like it's from a book and hope you enjoy it.  She made sure she knew what she was writing and what she wanted.  Her writing style was very good:  It's very clear, but also very evocative.  There's a sense of history that makes it feel very well researched.  When I read a book with a very clear voice, I find it very difficult to go back and reread it. In this book I went back and found that I was really impressed with how the author put all her characters in a context that made sense.  If the twins were simply a "thing", I think I would have found it a little strange to know they had magic powers and how they obtained those powers.  But because the author explained it, I was able to see them and their relationship to each other as a part of their history, and not just a mystery.  (My favorite part is how the book ended.  After I got a few pages into the book I knew it was going to be a long book.     So there's a lot I liked about this book, which made me happy.  )
Write a positive review about a good book:    There are three different kinds of men that I find attractive and attractive men can be bad.   These three different types are not so different they are interchangeable, you can like one or both.  There is a third type of man I like very much and I consider myself a bit of a sissy if he is in the picture.  When a woman doesn't find a guy to like, she can feel pretty hopeless and unhappy and often times, she thinks about suicide.  I like my kind of man.  It has not been a problem for me to be around my type of guys as I am pretty open about my interest in such a man.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's always good to read about people who are good at stuff.   As a musician, I find it's always fun to read that a certain piece of gear is great for some guitarists and not so great for others.  It certainly isn't something I'm ever going to use (I use a Taylor, which is great - but is the same as my Martin).   I've got a great Taylor on the horizon, and am looking forward to playing a more expensive one in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book back in 2009 when it first came out, and I have been waiting for this book to be re-released ever since!   If you're a lover of science fiction, you should read it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have just finished reading "The New England Way of Cooking: A Culinary Odyssey" by Judith Leland.   There was a good deal of information in the beginning but not much about it.  As a matter of fact, it's not clear if the information was ever written down before or if it was merely put together.  The information I did get was interesting, but very technical.  Although the book is filled with recipes, there is no recipe for the "New England Steak."  What is the difference between a "short rib" and a "long back ribs"?  Why does a "back" rib roast take 3/4 to 1 hour to make?  Is it because the meat is so dry that it has to cook more?  What exactly is the "Crockpot"?   It was very interesting to me to read about the differences in cooking styles and the history of the Steak & Lettuce.  There are two types of steaks: top round and flat.  My husband is a fan of the flat steaks but I love the top round.  He has been to New England to visit relatives and has tried every steak they have to offer.  I hope I never have to cook the New England Steaks  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a long time interest in history, from ancient to modern and all over the place. I found this book to be very enlightening and useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't know how many of you are going to take this book seriously, but I can't help but be a bit interested in what is going to happen to the characters in this book.   It's one thing to read about a new relationship, but it's quite another to actually follow through on it.  I also like that the two main characters don't seem to share much in common with one another.  The fact that she's a bit more worldly than he is doesn't make it any less exciting to read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent.   The way she tells the story makes it seem like it's a dream.  They even got a photo of the scene taken the day after the incident and the man in the photo is a great match for my dad.  He's not the best person, but the way she is describing the event is so vivid that it makes you forget everything that went wrong. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is hard to find a non-furry book that does not talk about how weirded out animals can be, but this book is a very good example of how not to talk about this subject.   I think that this book would work well as a reference book for college biology classes, with the chapter on how people are surprised by animals' unusual behaviours   Also, as someone who has always been interested in animals, it was really interesting to get to read about some of the things animals actually do and think   Recommended
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got a copy of this book from the library a long time ago and loved it.   This is a very good book that is very informative and provides excellent background information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    While this book is a little bit of a hard sell, its pretty good once you get through all the heavy handed symbolism and how the "deeper" meanings are to be interpreted, and whatnot.   I am a little more used to the "hard sell" part of the deal, but it just makes me more cautious about accepting anything that might come out of a book that comes out with such a heavy hand in it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of The Da Vinci Code and this book was an excellent companion to the movie.   The best thing about the movie was how it changed everything we knew about the religious cult.  What I found interesting was that when they were going to use their own version of the Mona Lisa they were just going to put a fake one on the wall and say that it was a Leonardo.  It never got around that Leonardo did not paint it, but it also never got away from the whole thing that Leonardo painted everything, even though he did not actually paint the Monna Lisa. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book has an intriguing premise, but the execution of the plot is terrible.   It begins with a bunch of random bits of news about a missing child from Africa, and then immediately moves into a complicated tale of child abductions, a CIA operation in the US, and the mysterious "mummies" in France, who come back to life to do evil.  The whole story seems to be based on the premise that, at some point in the past, a buncha old dudes in Africa made a bunch  of bad decisions in a bunchas long ago, and all these bad decisions seem to be connected to that missing kid.  For the last part of the book, we are introduced to the main protagonist, a white man who is in the process of being arrested in France for the kidnapping of a kidnapped white boy.  But the story only really gets interesting when he comes back to the US and is going to be brought in front of a grand jury.  I don't think it is a very good premise, because it does not really address how the kidnapping occurred.  We never get to see the kid, and it doesn't say anything about whether a child would have been able to escape, or whether there was anyone watching.  Instead, we get a bunchof clues about how the kidnappers did it, who they are, etc.  It seems a little sloppy, to put it lightly.  So yeah, not a great premise, and probably too long for its own good.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When it comes to   the   paranormal   I am   quite   convinced   that   something   is   trying   me   and   its   success is  due   to  Read a review about the author's latest work 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like the look of the book, it looks like a good, basic introductory book on a subject.   The information is there if you need it (and I found it on line) but what's missing is the hands-on experience of dealing with the subject at hand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about how not to design an organization, from a guy who worked in an organization and loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book on a whim. I was looking for a book that would fill my need of a short story with a very believable plot.   The plot of the story seemed a bit strange to me but that could be my imagination.  My main problem with the story is that I just wanted to know more about the person that lived in this house. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   " I am a very slow reader. I think I am one of the most reluctant to read in our family. This book was perfect for me.    If your looking for a good read, this is for you."
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book will be useful for anybody who needs to do basic mathematical operations on numbers, or needs to determine how much an element of a number is worth to multiply it by itself.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't know about you guys but I was hooked from the start.   This is a very interesting read.  It is a great read in a very different way than a traditional history of the Spanish Inquisition.  The tone of the book is very serious and it is a history of how the Church dealt with this type of thing in history.  I like the way the author wrote it and the way he told the story.  Unfortunately my wife had to go to the doctor and get a blood test.  She was very upset about that and I felt that I should say something to help her get her mind off the test.     What it all means is that the book has to be considered as a historical study as well as an interesting read about the Catholic Church. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A truly good book!   It will be read by many readers and will add to their knowledge of the history of the Indian Army.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is probably my most popular book. I got it at my local library, but found it in the kids' section (they sell it at a very low price in the library).   I've had many copies of this book (about 10), and they've all been good.   It's a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first non-ficbook to take place in the Harry Potter universe.   I am a big fan of the series and  I wanted to explore what I'd like to have in a non-series work   If anyone is interested in this, check it out.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is a good overview of the history of the Middle East.  It does not focus on the Jews as the bad guys as many books do but on the Islamic and Christian countries.   It is a nice overview of how people and religions in the middle east evolved over the centuries.  I am going to try and make my own book on the topic 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so wonderful. It reminds me of that wonderful movie, The Wizard of Oz.   I was never a big reader when I was younger.  But that is because I wasn't an emotional baby.  I am still a baby but  this book is like a nice good book I can hold and read in my bed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is good, and the characters are very well written.   I can see why so many people liked the book.  If you want to read something I recommend:    I would give this book 5 stars but it is a hard read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the type of book that I really wanted to read, but the publisher kept telling me I needed to read this first.   I'm glad I did, because this book has some really good ideas.  The idea is a good one: when the world is not working for women, a few women can make a difference.  But it's a bit too easy, because it doesn't explain what happens when the group doesn't act or does the right thing.  It has the right idea about women working together, but it is too simplistic about what it takes to make a change.  In my book, there was an important woman who took a leadership role.  She wasn't a hero, but a role model for other women. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this in a week and it is a great read.   My husband was a police officer in Hawaii and he worked as a deputy in Hawaii County. This book was a great book to read while he was on duty and while driving down in the car.  This book is about a guy who is on his last day on duty in the police force.  It is about his wife and his children.  One thing I noticed in this book is that there is no love in this couple.  There is no romantic love in his family.  They live for each other but when one of them has to go on leave or they decide to retire this couple will always be at each other's throats. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've loved this book since i read the first one. The characters are great and have real flaws. They are real people and i really enjoy these books.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really loved the story about the girls and how they got to a place where they could feel like they belonged to their family and were not the "second class citizens" of this planet, and how much the girl's got to lose. I really hope that this story was published in a different format, that it had been written as a children's book that wasn't made for a younger age. I think this book could have made more of a impact if it had only been a childrens' book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent source of information for the student of mathematics, for those working in mathematics, and for anyone interested in learning something about how numbers are computed.   The book is not intended as a first introduction to number theory, but as a guide to those interested in the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a very good book and the only book I have ever read that I have completely loved.   I hope you get a chance to see it when it's available in paperback. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of the TV show The Good Wife (2008-2009).   It was so good!   This is similar, but a lot better.   The Good Doctor (2008) is one of my favourite series on Netflix, but this is the one with the best actors.  I've seen both Doctor Who and this and the Doctor Who series is just so much better,   but I really like The Good Duly 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very excited about this book!   The book has really changed my views on how to look at children's television shows.   When I first discovered that the cartoons and toys were actually aimed at girls, I thought that it was absurd.  It would be like dressing up and watching the movie Beauty and the Beast  with a guy.  This book has given me the perspective to see it is not only realistic, but it is also a great way to teach kids about their bodies. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so excited to find this book after years of not reading. It was easy to get into and I had a good laugh while reading.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book when I was in the middle of writing my dissertation.   At the time I thought this book would be a fun read because it was very technical and I like to read and write about computer stuff.  After reading the book I'm surprised I don't actually like it more than I did.  This book is very technical so even if you like reading, the book won't really interest you in the way I expected it to. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoy this book. It's a bit technical at times but the idea is solid. It gets into the science and is very thorough.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was great! It was one of the best books I've ever read!   The characters were amazing and were funny and interesting.   I just want a sequel,   it was so great!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a long-time fan of Richard Bachman's books, both of which I've read several times.   After reading this,   Bachman will have his readers to thank for his ability to create such engaging characters in such complex stories.  The stories in this book will stick with me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In reading a book for the first time I found the book was so well researched. In addition, the author provides many pictures of plants, animals, birds, and humans which make the book easy to read.   This book was fun to read because it had different things to look at.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The   book   was   very   good. It is very  important   for people who are   just beginning   to get   a grasp of how to do   math. It   is a good   introduction  . It . covers   all   of the basics.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book   The first three hundred pages were pretty much a story of the protagonist getting out from under her parents to go off to college to do something new.   A lot of the stuff the protagonist experienced in college had a profound effect on her and made her think about life a lot more.  For instance the roommate in her dorm was also at the college who was an art major in the school that was a major hub for hippies.  She was a friend of hers and she had a roommate who was also an art student at the same college.  I am not sure about the book's accuracy   but if you are a hippie and have a roommate, that roommate's life will have a profound impact on you as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very solid book. The language in the book is clear, not overwrought but not too concise.   I'm not sure how he intends the author to explain the differences between a "normal" man and a "man with a disability" but it is certainly a very unique approach to the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I first started reading the book, I was worried that the book was too long and the details could go on for pages and pages.   It isn't long at all.  After reading about 500 pages I think I've got it!   I liked the story about the car and its family.  I also like that it shows people going through the same things.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was in high school, my high school chemistry teacher told us that it is impossible to make a pure hydrogen by electrolysis. But she told us the other way: If we took some metal and burned it into hydrogen using a vacuum cleaner, then used the heat to make it hydrogenated. That was an example of why I think the story was interesting, so I read about it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book when I was looking for a book to read for my class, and it's very similar to what I was going to read anyway, it's easy to understand, you can get a good idea of what the book is about, what the author is doing, and how much it's about.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read a good friend's book.   It has a great feel to it.  The characters are all well drawn.  I really like that the characters are not always in control of their actions, but rather are forced to act by something outside of their control.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am an avid fan of science fiction.   I had never heard of   The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy   until I was on a  cruise   with a friend who had heard about it and liked it.  So I gave it a read.  It is a fun read. I thought I liked the humor. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read and I don't understand why so many people have such a hard time accepting things about themselves that don't come from other people.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful book.   I used to think that most of the time I'd seen these types of stories in other genres, but the stories in this book were both unique and quite well written.  It's a shame that he isn't as prolific as he used to be. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In any case, this book has an interesting plot.   It tells the story of a woman, who is kidnapped by the Russian police and tortured to death by the KGB, after she was found to have been given a fake kidney from the CIA to "prove" that Stalin is alive.  The only problem with this "fact" is that the KGB had also kidnapped several women from the same city, after they were falsely accused of being a CIA spy and taken to the airport in an attempt to have them smuggled into the USSR.  When they were found there, and found to be innocent, they also were released.  As the book points out, the KGB was a far more ruthless and evil organization than the US government ever was.  I've read the other two books in this series, but had not yet been able to go back to read the second one, which was the one about the CIA agent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have read to date. The author uses a unique approach to teaching, one which focuses on learning and not just memorizing information.   It is also extremely interesting how her students take over and manage things when she is not around (this is true in all her students).   Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first in a series (or series of books) that I plan to read.   It is a good story about the struggles of a young woman who has been through a divorce.  It deals with a sensitive subject in a relatable way and does a good job with character development.  I give this a very good rating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read the other book by this author and it is brilliant, especially for the modern reader.   It is really funny.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was quite amused by the fact that the main character in this novel, a German woman, has a hard time talking to Americans, and has an inferiority complex and self-loathing.   It is funny, but not at all realistic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing I could compare this book to would be the classic The Bible. But it's not a bible.   In fact, I'm not sure it is at all a bible, even though it is labeled as such.  It has some interesting ideas, and I really like the author's approach to teaching kids about faith. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best part about this book was when I first saw the title, I thought "Well, that's a cool cover." When I finished reading I was surprised by just how much I enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this book for years. I was a member of the "Bible" Society and used to go to Bible studies at the local church. In the last few years I have had problems with some of the changes in the Bible.   In light of that, I was very glad that I picked up the book and read it.  If you can't understand a word of the book, I suggest that you go to the church for a Bible study and then come back for the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first in a set of five books about the development of American and Australian languages   In some respects, it's not a bad book.   I do think it's a little too short on details, but I suppose you'd expect that in a language that has been around for a century and a half.   There's a good overview of the history of English and its related languages, and it's great to see that even a minor language change can have big effects.   (But I had a hard time getting used to the idea that French would start with    a "e.")  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, one of the most important I've read in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an important book because it is important to understand how America got into its present crisis. It is very difficult to see the way back to the good old days when capitalism was at its highest and most healthy. In my view, however, the good ol' days were gone long ago.  It is difficult to grasp what is happening today.  We may be moving into a "post industrial" period, but the decline is a slow process, not a sudden one.   We must accept the fact that capitalism cannot be restored.  I do not know what we will need to do when we reach that day.  The key is to get the "barter" system out of the way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a very interesting read.   For a non-historian it was very well done and a great read. It was great to hear from the main characters that the British government had the right to invade Iraq but that did not mean that the invasion was a good thing.  The book was a mixture of history, politics and general human foibles. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It had the right tone to it.   The humor is so well timed.  It's not really a good story, it's just a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good story but is a little bit dated in its treatment of science.   The author is a former university professor who has also worked as a geologist on a number of oil exploration rigs.  She does a good job of describing both the drilling process and the geologic processes at work.  I agree with her in that the story was over a century old.  But, she went too far.  Many scientists were willing to sacrifice the interests of their own country to the cause of scientific truth.  This was not a choice to be made lightly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a fan of the  Moby-Dick   I was pleasantly surprised   with this new edition.   There is a great introduction to   the history of the book   by Richard Fischbein   who covers the   story of   Hobb's   life  .   (1 star)    
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I loved this book so much that I re-read it just to make sure my reading of it had been right." -- A reviewer from Kindle Magazine   I'm actually still reading this book but I'm not sure I'm a fan of the series. The writing was beautiful and the ending is fantastic, but the characters seem just as interchangeable and their relationship felt a bit contrived. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a wonderful collection of history books, but, I don't know why, I like it more.    The first part of the book was very interesting:  It told how the Irish were brought in to colonize North America, and how they assimilated.  This, and the other history books on the subject were useful information, but after that I found myself reading only about the Irish, not about the Europeans who also immigrated to America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book by the same author in high school, when I was about 13 or 14.   He talks about how a big change in life was having an abortion, then how that changed everything:  I never really got into reading the Bible.  I've read it at times, but didn't get into it very much.  Until I read  This  book ,  I  never  felt  it  could  change  me  in  the  way  I think  people  I relate  to  want  it.      It's really  easy to relate to a little baby  like  your  niece  or a little brother.  This book  really  is  like having a baby  you never wanted  and now you  can  understand  the love  other people  have  for  you.  Thank you  Mr. Patterson  for this  very  important  book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an incredibly comprehensive survey on an enormously influential figure in American literary history:  I highly recommend this book to those with an interest in American literature and in the history of ideas.   The title alone sounds like a good idea, but it turns out to be so much more than that.  There is no book like it:  there's not really one, anywhere,  in English,  especially   which is a good thing, because   American literature is   one of   the   most   interesting   topics   of the  pre-modern era   since   the Enlightenment. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only problem with this book is that it is a little repetitive.   You have to read it more than once to get the most out of it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about the ancient world.   The author makes it clear the history is a mix of fact and fantasy, but the author does a good job at presenting the major events. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you want to understand the origins of the modern-day Christian Right in America, read A Time for Truth: The Religious Right and the Future of America by Edward Branigan.   This is a truly remarkable book. Branigan takes a very close look at the rise of the religious right and its role in the modern Republican party. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've always been a lover of the historical fiction that is set in Europe during the 1800s.   The author of this book,   is very good.  I think   would   be   a great read if not for the fact that   the author does a horrible job of describing   what it is like to be poor in the 1800's. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've had this book for almost a year and read it through about three times.   There are some good ideas in it and I agree with some of the observations.  I love how the author does not give a specific answer to "What makes a good writer?"   But the book's message is one of life as a whole. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a great book. I was amazed by the quality of the writing.   From a beginning in a house that is a living hell and ending in the comfort of a new home, it is an inspiring tale about a man trying to make the best of a bad situation.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The   book   is a great read!   I love reading books about real people.   This   person is   a great example of a person who had a tremendous love for her family and still had the strength to help them with their problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A great book!   "The End of Freedom is a must-read!"   From the moment I first heard about this book I knew I had to have it.   This book is a warning against totalitarian societies.  It is based on true events and quotes from real people in totalitarian states.  The way people respond to the media, the way they view and deal with the government, the government view and how it controls them is what makes a totalitarian society.  Even when people are "free" to do as they wish (like they are in China), the control still exists.  "  In a sense, the book describes a society that was already living in a totalitarian way, and it is no surprise that the government is now so paranoid that it cannot even trust some of the people who live there.  I would recommend this book to everyone who reads it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about the early days of the Second World War (1939-45).  It is set in Europe and focuses on what we can expect from the Germans, what they will do and how to stop them.   The author was a British diplomat who served in the French army in the late 1930s.  He writes about what he saw and did in those early years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the most original and challenging works I've ever read. A great read from start to finish.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a hard time coming to any firm conclusions about this novel when I first began reading it, but after finishing it and seeing what a good read it is, I feel like I've learned a valuable lesson.    The ending was really powerful, I liked how it was wrapped up so well and I didn't even see how the story was going to be resolved in the first place.  I loved how the whole book is really about the end of a friendship.  The last ten pages really showed why, and how much this novel was meant to be about friendship in the last half of her life.  I think a lot of people (especially women) get confused about love.  Love, in general, is the most misunderstood, the most maligned, and the most abused word in the english language.  It's like the one thing everyone can agree on:  love is beautiful.  But when you realize what love really is - the true beauty in life, that's the stuff that makes life worth living.      So, why isn't anyone talking about love like it is the stuff of romance? 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a very interesting read and a very good book.   It's interesting because I have heard many people claim that the LDS church is evil.  It is interesting that they claim that when the church is bad, it's the leaders that do it and not the doctrine. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series.   From first edition in the mid 90's   to the recent publication of the   latest   book   by JK Rowling   it's a well deserved and celebrated   fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just received this in the mail yesterday. I read it through a couple of times and have been enjoying it as much as I was the first time I read.   It is very different than the rest of the genre.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must for any student interested in the history of psychiatry and the role that psychiatry played in the American mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book. It explains the history of the American Revolution better than the average history book. I'm glad that someone is finally doing that.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the most complete books I've ever read.   It is a great reference to the historical, political, and social aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are a writer in the public eye, and you don't own the rights to your work, you will get into a lot of trouble.   When I was a child, my mother and father got in trouble for allowing me to read and write.  They got sued by their former employer for allowing their kids to do the same.  In the case of a children's book, you can't get into trouble by using pictures as characters.  If a kid knows that in order to write a novel it will take years of work, then he is writing the book he wants to read.  I can't think of a better way to introduce young children to the joys of writing and the joy of telling a good story  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book so much I can't even imagine not having it on my shelf.   And I don't own all the novels. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great, it gives a very good overview on the topic of the early church and gives a great picture of how the early Church in general was formed, the people, and the events.   A good read for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As the author states in the book's blurb:  "We cannot know what other worlds these people inhabit, but we have heard the music in the clouds."   It is a remarkable book about a people of the world who believe in UFOs and "other worlds."
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the mid 1990s, the Library of Congress had a series of large-scale photographic plates documenting the progress of a new type of gun. The plates, from the period of 1903 to 1905, were taken by a large machine called a stereoscope. The gun in the series, the Gewehr 1892, is a.22-caliber rimfire semi-automatic rifle, used by the Russian military during the first world war. The photo at left shows the stereoscope plates (top) being mounted on the side of a German soldier's helmet.   The plates had several interesting features, including some very large prints of the actual weapon, and a large, high-quality color reproduction (bottom).   Here's a link to a detailed article on the stereoscopes: http://www.lincolnc.org/history/index.htm   It might be helpful to see a stereoscopic image of the same gun from the same series:
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a good primer on the basics of quantum mechanics and a good introduction to the ideas behind the theory.   I enjoyed the information about the history of quantum experiments and how they came to be accepted as the most likely explanations of quantum events.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent guide to the subject of psychology. I have taken several courses at the university level and have been trying to understand what it all means.   I found this book to be an excellent introduction.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about a time and place that I do not go to very often.   In my hometown there is a group of people that go to the cemetery every Monday afternoon and leave their own remains there.  A cemetery is a place where one can rest and leave everything that one has.  There is usually a group that comes and leaves their remains at the same time and it is a very moving experience.  This is a book that will bring you back to that cemetery. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the best books I've ever read   -  .. Well worth the investment  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is very well written." I liked this book quite a bit. I found that the author is an intelligent person who is not afraid to get down to what's going on.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a great book with lots of good information, but there are some parts where the author seems to be jumping into a lot of detail without very good justification, which can seem a bit frustrating.    I think a book with this much depth and detail would have been more of a pleasure to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book, the first book in this series. The writing was not as good as in the first but it got better as the series progressed.   This is a great series and the books are well worth the read

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book before a play a few months ago and really enjoyed it.   It took me through most of the book but at times just couldn't seem to get into it. Not sure how to improve that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author is very experienced and able to communicate a complex subject in a way that makes sense.   He takes a good look at the problems with the current law and proposes a reform that could be implemented. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about the past of an important woman.  . I like what I see from the outside as well as what I'm being told from the inside about her character and her work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great.   The characters are real, and they do grow together, and in some ways, they grow together even though they're not exactly "besties".   It is a great book about being a gay kid.  The author does a good job of portraying the different ways the kids deal with their parents and the various ways each kid chooses to deal with different parents. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      I really enjoyed this book and enjoyed the style.   I love the way that the author was able to write in a very dry, but fun, tone.  It is very interesting how the authors use language to describe events in a way that allows it to be easily understood and followed, without going over the top, as it could be in most books with similar themes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of the original books, and have had the audiobooks on my list of books to read for a while now.   The original trilogy is an amazing, and I was shocked at just how good it was, and how completely and completely changed the tone of the books was for a second generation writer to do.  If you haven't read it, start there!   Thank you so much for taking the time to do this! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    There were times when I felt my heart was in my mouth and I couldn't think straight.   "I am the one who finds it hard to find her voice" is a brilliant line about a girl who thinks she doesn't have the right stuff.  She is absolutely right about that!   Her family is extremely close knit, and she is the first to cry when her parents argue or her brother gets sick.  This book is such a good read and is filled with great moments that made it very rewarding. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a hard read, but it's a worthwhile one.   I am not much of a historian, but I found this book useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read "My Body Is A Cage" in high school.   The theme is that the body is a cage.  It's not as if my body was a prison or anything.  The fact that my body has been controlled for so long is quite a feat.  And it shows how much people think about how people feel.  For some reason, this is not very popular with women these days.  I'm going to read more books that show how much control the body has over us. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was interesting, I enjoyed it!   I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys history or the old days.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The "gig"   is really the point.   -   While the story isn't as epic as some of the other stories in the collection, it's still a good read.  - A great story about two guys who both lost their father in a tragic accident. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read a lot of historical fantasy (and a few historical nonfiction books) over the years but this one took me by surprise:  A fascinating glimpse into the lives of some very important historical figures, not just of the period in question but of the whole century or more.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a well-written book. It doesn't tell you everything there is to know about the subject but makes it clear why it is important.   I found the author's approach to teaching fascinating.  I would highly recommend this book for those interested in using mindfulness to help them focus, be more present, learn more about themselves and others and become more in touch with the world around them.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great resource for anyone interested in the history of the Chinese military.   The Chinese have a long and varied history, but this book focuses on their early wars and military tactics.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a really well done book, if you like the old fashioned books about the occult or the occult and witchcraft, I'd recommend this one  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is about as good as any I've seen for a kid book on the history of the US.   In that way, it's similar to the excellent History of the United States by Stephen Ambrose.   The differences are that it's more a history of US and the various ways the US has changed (more than just the fact that the USA is now a different country).   My main criticism would be that I wish there was more of the American Indians to get across and more detail about the people who inhabited the land. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have always had a soft spot for this book, and I would say my love of this book only grows from reading it again after almost a decade!   One of my favorite scenes in this book involves an old man who is working in a store. He goes to ask the clerk where the candy is kept, only to be told that they don't keep any candy in there.  He goes off on a tirade about how they are robbing customers who walk in looking for candy.   At one point the old man begins to speak about how he came from a poor family, and how he is very grateful to be able to buy all of his things and have such a nice place to live in.  When the clerk points out that he is living in an apartment he does not seem to understand that he has to pay all his bills and taxes and his rent, and that he does it because he can.  Once again, the old guy is angry about it.  The best part is that the clerk is always right, as is the old person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book on the history of the Second World War. In terms of accuracy, it is as good as any book on WWII I've read.   The book is a good reference for anyone interested in the Second and Third World Wars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a long time fan of the Harry Potter books and series I have been trying to find a way to read the series on my iPad.   This book is just that book   and you'll love the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very enjoyable story.       I think the author did a great job of keeping the reader's attention throughout.  I enjoyed it immensely  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's hard to compare two works but the two I read in 2012 are very similar.   In both novels, a young girl falls in love with a teacher.  It also happens to be her first time.  And in both cases, she can't be without his help (or his body).   The book is not very good.  It's quite easy to forget what the teacher did to her (she had a nose job) and that the two end up having the exact same feelings for each other.  The plot is also very rushed (it ends in the middle of the day) so you wonder if it would be better if the girl had not fallen in love.  But it's still a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a long standing addiction to all things horror, and have read many a novel by Stephen King.   For me, one of the best has to be Carrie, with its mix of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.  This book is different from the others in that it deals with a real psychological condition (anxiety) that has been portrayed in horror movies for years.  It also deals with the effects of the condition (paranoia).   The prose is clear, as are the characters, the horror and the humor. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book very much.   As someone who is a graduate student and works on various projects, I found myself looking forward to the next reading session.  It wasn't too long but enough to keep my interest and provide me with a challenge. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was so interesting that I could not put it down.   It was a very helpful introduction to the issues of the war, including the question of how a great power such as the United States could tolerate and be so concerned about the rights of the people of a small country as the former German states were. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has been the one book that has helped me to realize how much more powerful my imagination is than my rational mind.   The book covers a lot of ground, and provides useful advice on many important issues. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good retelling of an important and controversial topic.   As a non-Jewish American who has worked for many years in Jewish communal circles, I have been impressed by the sensitivity with which the authors have approached this subject.  My personal opinions, which may not be representative of other Jews, also tend to fit with the authors' approach.  The author's views on the subject are more nuanced than the many critics who have been vilified by many Jews over the years:  Many of them feel they have had to fight hard for the right to speak and write about their religion, something that the authors clearly feel is their right to do.  In that respect, it seems that the Jewish community is moving in the right direction.  I will not be surprised if this book will have a significant influence on the way Jewish educators and the general public think about the role of religion in the lives of Jews, as well as the impact that the many books on the topic that have come out recently may have had on the present situation.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book will bring back memories of when I was younger and used to read and study hard in my school library.   As a student, it is good to get back to those days when I would spend hours in the library reading up on a subject just to have a few quick examples from my previous learning.  For someone looking to learn the art of writing a book, this book is not as useful as you might think.  This is an excellent resource for aspiring writers though. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a real eye opener. We have been studying for years and have never read anything about it.   The author gives some very helpful hints, but the information comes from an outside source and he is obviously biased.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book made me think that there was more to life than just being born.   I was in the hospital for a couple of weeks and the doctors thought I might be a cholestatic, but after a lot of prayer and therapy the doctors changed their mind.  It was an interesting time in my life, but now I am just happy to have the knowledge of where I was before that horrible situation.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I think there is a lot in this book about the problems of an older generation of Christians.   As mentioned, it is a little bit strange to be talking about a group that has a high percentage of black members who never attended church for any number of reasons.  I think this book does a better job than others of trying to show a positive side to a generation that had a tough go of things.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's one of the better books I've read.   The plot is good, and is told through the eyes of a man who can see the future.  The story is a bit predictable, but it is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   . In my view, this is an excellent text book.   It is a well written book. I am also an experienced teacher, but it's very nice to get a book that has a lot of good information and lots of examples that are useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a very well done. I felt a little guilty in having bought it but not having read it.   It has a very good plot and is the first book in the Dragonlance Chronicles.  It is set on the continent of Faerun, on an island called Avalon.  I really liked the style of the books.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my third book by a very well-known science fiction author.  The first one was a short, fun read; the second one was excellent, full of new ideas; and this third one is no exception.    I think we're in for a wonderful year in science fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The "Ride of the Valkyries" series of novels is a good mix of sword & sorcery and historical fiction.   A lot of this is down to the writing, which is good and well done.  I have found the series quite addictive, as it has the feel of a good adventure story.  The magic system is unique and well put together.  It's great that each book is a standalone novel, which I enjoyed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a brilliant book for people who aren't very good with numbers.   You get to play a very specific type of game, that is much more fun than you might realize, but it's the kind of game you learn how to play pretty well.  It's not terribly difficult (because you have to be), but it is fun, and you really get a feel for how important math is in everyday life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a brilliant, hilarious and funny book about sex, and what happens when two people (of either gender) find each other irresistible.   It is a laugh riot and a terrifically fun read

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is like reading a history of the city.   We know what was here before the construction, and what we are in for if we do not get out.  It does not take much time to get to the city center and get to downtown.  The park is just as great as the rest of the parks around the city (we all miss the old park).

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is written in an academic manner and that makes it very helpful.    The main problem with the story is the character of Mrs. Brown.  For one thing, she does not believe in magic. She believes in "the power of science."   It takes a long time to get her to believe that something like this can happen, which is fine with me.  She is a good character.  Also,  she is the only one of the students not to take the potion.  It would have been nice to have her there to see the reaction to the potion, since she is apparently the one who invented it.  Overall a good read

Write a positive review about a good book:    The description of the book is spot on:  "A story of a woman who is born into a rich family who is also a prostitute.   Written in the early 60's, this book is about one of the first women who entered the sex trade."   I enjoyed the novel.  It was well written and entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been trying to get into the book of Mormon but just haven't felt it yet.   So after reading the review below   it seems to me   that is why the Church doesn't want people to read the book   Why not?   The Book of Mormon is not written for children.  It is written by an adult who is trying to tell people the truth as it is.  This is my opinion

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. I've loved all the Stephen King books. But I've been reading them for many, many years and   it   is the one that stands out to me the most as   an   instant classic.   For all its   horror elements   King   pulls it off   beautifully. The   book   doesn't seem to   have any   "modern"   elements  at all.  It   feels like   The Shining   to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My only complaint is that I would have preferred a slightly more detailed explanation of the origins of the Christian faith (which I found quite fascinating).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the only time I've felt the sting of someone giving a negative review about something I've already enjoyed.   It's not so much the content, but the poor marketing that led me to believe it was going to be another horrible "Bible" that was just a rehash of the books I read years ago.  I've never read the Bible.  The only book I've read by a non-Christian is my uncle's and I don't really go back to the books in his collection.  It was a good read, just not the Bible I had been looking for.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent, well written and a must for anyone who wants to make sense of the world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book that makes you think about all sorts of things that have been on your mind about men. It is easy to find many ways in which the women in this book are not as strong as the men. But this is only because of the lack of men in the book.   But the men have strengths as well.  The author makes a strong argument about why women, particularly mothers, need a strong role model.  And I'm not sure that is going to convince the feminists that there is a special role for men as mothers (and a different role for women as fathers). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book, it is a great overview on a topic and not just a book on the same subject as others. The information is very easy to understand, and you can actually apply it now.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters are fascinating, and it takes a while for you to see them as such, but they're so good at what they do that they become a joy to watch. I don't really have a lot to add about the characters--they are simply outstanding, and all I have to say about my own interactions with them is that I'd be a lot happier if they were less selfish and more considerate.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a pretty big fan of the Harry Potter series.   My favorite is book 5 and I don't own any of the others (but would buy if I did).   There's also a very good book series by a young girl about a magical talking dog:  This is a wonderful book and it has so much to do with the Harry/Hedwig relationship in book 4.  This book does a wonderful job of capturing the feel of Harry/Fred/Dobby and it's also about a girl learning how to be a woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished a good reference book about the French Revolution and the role of women in it.   For example, we learn that many French women did not accept the new ideas of the men:  They were upset that they did not "have their own private domain."   And the revolutionaries felt that women should be more like "manly men"   and "women should not be so frivolous or so idle."  Some of the authors feel that women were so busy caring for their families that they didn't have time to rebel (or if they did they were ashamed of it):  ... they thought that a more important thing than the Revolution was the way women spent their time.  It was not just a question of money, but also the way they used their free time.   I liked the idea of "feminism without politics."  What I liked most was that the book gives a few examples of revolutionary women who were "feminine."  It is a wonderful book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when it first came out.  I have a high sensitivity to things like that.    It is very detailed.  It's the type of book that you can just flip to the section on how to do things that you know you are supposed to do.  The characters are all very real. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of those that I wanted to love, but I didn't. This is the second time I've read this novel, and I found the writing style of this book frustrating and difficult to follow.    It wasn't until the last section that I felt I had figured out the writing process and how it works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book about the history of a city and a race that didn't even exist.   The book was just as good as I remembered. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most recent book I've read by Kage is The Mists of Avalon  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book about the Vietnam War and the U.S. response to the conflict.   The authors do a good job of looking at both sides of the coin.  There are a number of things that were missed or glossed over in the history books written in the 70s, but this book helps make them seem less important, and gives the reader a much better understanding of the real story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book I learn about some things that I needed to know about myself. This book is good for the first chapter of the week, to get a little overview about the new week and some things you need to know.   The next 3 chapters can be a bit hard, but after that you will be able to handle this stuff with ease. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book I've been waiting for, "Possession" by Michael Patrick Hughes is amazing!   It has a lot of great stories, and while there are some problems with it, most of the problems are not with the book itself, but with the person or people it is about.   This is the type of book where you come to know all the characters in depth, even if it is a bit odd to see the author's first name and his age are the same. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleased to find this book. It is not for those that like dry science books. It's much more of an engaging story and not at all dry. It touches on many facets of biology, including evolution and human behavior. It deals with a wide variety of topics such as the evolution of man, disease, development and more. I had to put off reading this until after I finished my current books, The Art of Being Invisible: The Secret Life of Plants and How We Can Control Them, and How to Win Friends and Influence People.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book.   It is fun, well-written and informative.  It also gives a good look into the inner life of the author of "What Makes A Good Marriage?" 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed a lot of reading in the past year and a half. This is my favorite book of the ones I have read.   It deals with the issues we see in our society every day.  This book is a good look at the problems people have with homosexuality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good read, I recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction, particularly books about war.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is so well written and researched that I can see myself using this information in my future.    Highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in how governments keep people under control. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It really made me think about the difference between a successful writer and a good writer.    When I first read about this book, I didn't think much of it.  I mean, I'm a fan of some of the people involved in writing it (the authors), and this book is a good read and a must-have for me.  But I'm thinking that I read something about writing that I didn.t quite understand.  (I know that this is a very subjective review, so take it or leave it.)   One thing I don't understand is the difference in how successful writers see themselves versus the "honest" writers that everyone else seems to read.  One of my favorite books is David Halberstam's book The Majority, about how politicians lie to us and why the public believes them.  For a while I thought that's what I was doing (and it wasn't until I had some success and was recognized as a writer that I learned that's not what I did).  But if you read anything by David Halpern (or David Allen, who I also like) about writing, he tells you to put yourself in the person's shoes and to ask yourself how they might see the same situations.  And in this book he gives us a good way to understand how a successful person would see a situation.  In the chapter on "the hero in your head," he gives several examples where the people in his head have behaved badly (a woman who lied about her age, a man who had a hard time finding a place to live, a girl who didn't want to be married, etc).   He also tells you how a good person might act differently.  Here's one way:  He takes a vacation once a year.  If you're a successful book writer, you might want to take one every month.  As long as you're not getting too big for your britches, you don't need all that much time.  That's a good idea for everyone who has a lot of work to do, right?  If not, don't take that vacation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I would not hesitate to recommend this book to a friend   If you're a fan of science fiction with a strong fantasy element, I'd recommend it   Highly Recommended  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this in the summer of 2014 and I enjoyed it greatly.     I was born and raised in a small town in Illinois (Illinois in the Summer) and as a child there were only 2 local bookstores.  These two local stores were the only ones I ever saw or heard about:  The other was out of business at the time and the other is out of the state and doesn't even have a website.  But I am happy I was able to pick up a copy of this book.  If you're a fan of the genre, give this a shot!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been looking forward to reading this book for some time.   If you are not a fan of vampire, then don't read it.  I'm a big fan of vampires but have always been nervous about reading a book about vampires because the vampire in this book was one of the worst   It didn't seem as though any of the writers involved had a clue   What bothered me the most about this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was not as familiar with the original work as I am with the modern one. However, I found it very entertaining!   And, in spite of the numerous spelling mistakes, the story and the characters were spot on.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read several books about the Holocaust. This one is different because it is the first work written by a Jew who survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald.    The story and information is so good.  This book should be a required read in every Jewish education class. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book for a beginner's introduction to the subject of social studies.   It explains a lot of what is wrong with American culture and society.  In the American system of education there is nothing on social studies or civic education, so if a child is to be successful in society, they have to be taught all the subjects in school and it is easy to learn them but not so easy to master them.  They also need to be challenged to be aware of how their behavior is affecting others.  A great book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is great for a person like me who wants to get into "badass" (badass as in "lonely, homeless, etc...") but has never read a "bad ass" book.    The characters are real, the world is interesting (in the way a good world is), the prose is clean, and the descriptions are clear. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was my favorite book of all time!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.   It is the first book in a fantasy series I have been planning to start.  I am a huge fantasy nerd and love epic fantasy, but I have also read some non-fantasy works such as The Warlord's Blade.  This series is far from epic, but it is very well written and the characters are complex.  It has a good, action-packed feel.  The author did a fantastic job of incorporating the various elements of the fantasy genre such as magic, politics, and dragons.  My favorite character is the Lord of All, who is quite a good friend.  Overall, a good series for those who like epic fantasy and good characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:        It has been years since I read a good science fiction novel.   The book is good, not too long, and has a lot of fun and action. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good example of how you can combine a very complex concept with the most basic material to write a very clear explanation.   The book is based on a course I took about the history of human civilization.  As far as I was concerned, the material presented in the book was so elementary it could have been lifted right off the syllabus.  This is a great book for beginners as it gives an explanation of the concepts in a very understandable way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is amazing. It's a very good story, and you will like it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but I liked the book so much I bought the other three books in the series.   If you are a fan of science fiction/fantasy that isn't as cheesy as a lot of the time, I would recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you have never read a book by Charles Baxter before, don't read the negative reviews (I think they are accurate, though.)   It's not a novel about a sad old man, though.   That is what people say, but it's really about his love and friendship for a daughter. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of subjects the author delves into.   The various examples are presented well and he gives a good description and summary of each. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book.   It is very well written and has a nice plot line. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about the "Great Depression." It is an excellent summary of the events, but also of the economic and social situation at the time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives the historical details of the American Civil War, including battles and the various battles of the War Between the States.   It has a very detailed history, and gives the history of the United States during and after the War.  I did learn a lot from this book, but a lot of that learning was in the first couple of pages.  It is interesting to read about the Civil War. In the end, I think that I learned more about the War between the States than I have from my other books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a fan of the book, and I am glad that I got a chance to try it.   This book was written by a great writer who really knows his subject and is able to put it in a positive light.  I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As always, I'm thrilled to read the words of one of my heroes. I can't think of a more eloquent book on an issue I care deeply about: the danger of social media, especially when it comes to sexual politics.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I would have rated this book a 3 if it had been the only book I read this year.   The story is very well done and the characters are well drawn.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A book that tells a story that you need to know the details about, that tells the story that the author intended to tell.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character is a very realistic version of a teenage girl.   She has problems and is trying to fix them but she is not really a bad person.  The other characters are also extremely interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I'm a lifelong reader. But, reading about a man who's been dead 40 years is different. I've had my doubts about my faith. And I can understand how it would seem a bit self-obsessed for him to have decided to become a doctor in the first place. Yet he does so without any sense of self-absorption. In fact, he seems to be a bit relieved about his role in all of this." -David W. B. Reynolds  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. I read it as a teenager, but have since gotten a hold of it through a book club I belong to. It's always a treat to read this.   The story is well told and the plot is interesting.  The characters are well portrayed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book, and a great gift.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very glad I took the time to read this book. It's a fun read and I found myself liking some characters more than others.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A fantastic book.   The writing is clear and descriptive.  The pictures are great.  I can't wait to read the sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only reason this book failed to grab me was because   the story was   repetitive    and dull.   It started out   interesting enough   but   slowly becomes   tiresome.   If you are looking for a fun, interesting, and intriguing historical fiction  , read this book instead of another one about Napoleon. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The story of The Mule, by Richard Dawkins, is a good one.   It is a cautionary tale, cautioning us against the dangers of our own genes.  It gives a good overview of evolution, the Mule and the evolution of consciousness, and the idea that one can become the other, by changing the environment.  The book isn't a scientific treatise, so you don't have to worry about knowing all the science, or the details.  But it is a very well-written story, full of fun characters, and very readable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A must read book for anyone who has any interest in the subject of UFOs.   There is no question about the validity of the alien encounter accounts described in this book.  I was also very impressed by the way the authors dealt with the many difficulties encountered by these individuals.  They clearly dealt with every aspect of their strange encounters including:  - the physical  - their feelings  - how the media deals with such cases  - what it is like   I have only scratched the surface of this excellent book. The book may be very difficult for some to read, but if you have any interest it is well worth the effort. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I saw this book, I thought it was a typical "dumbing down of the poor" book, and thought it a poor choice to try and tell us about how the poor actually lived in the 1800's.   But I must admit that I am going to be revisiting it as time goes on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a lot of fun to read, and I was surprised by a few new things that I didn't realize until then.   The title is just a really good title to a book about a lot more than just a couple of good looking people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not going to say it's the best book I've read this year, but it's one of the better ones.   From a historical standpoint, the book has some interesting facts to chew on (the most interesting to me being that the only female president in US history was really just the first one to actually hold the office).   The author also knows a lot about US history and does a very good job at laying out all of the facts in a clear manner.  It's not necessarily a bad thing to have facts (even though it is nice to have them), but sometimes the more important things are obscured by a bunch of historical trivia (which is one of my pet peeves about history), and the book was just perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I think the author, in this book, is trying to make an argument that the US and Europe are in the early stages of a new Dark Age."   
Write a positive review about a good book:    When it came out I was surprised.   My parents were never fans of it when I was a kid.  I thought I could make it my own.  But I can't get enough.  This is definitely a book I will look at over and over 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   The main character is one of the most believable characters I've ever come across.  I don't like to read about "homo" people because of how they are portrayed and the way they behave, but I loved how she dealt with him and his relationship with her.  In addition, the main character was very realistic, and I felt he was an interesting and relatable person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "If you are like me, you think of the book as a joke, and this is why I enjoyed it. If you are smart and don't want to listen to people who have no idea how to write, this book might be for you."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book and very useful. I am a graduate student and my major is Biochemistry.   I am trying to learn about some of the other elements as well but I am struggling. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My first experience with a book written by a woman was a disappointing one.   The book is an overview of how feminism has been used as a tool of oppression.  I have found her books, like this one, to be helpful in exploring the history and theory behind this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was one of my first real "adventures" in reading. I remember that the first book in the series was really bad.   I was really looking forward to reading it again, but   It's a pretty good book, but it is hard to enjoy when it doesn't even have a good villain! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best short story collection I've ever read.   It's an amazing collection of amazing stories.  I like how the stories are set in different times and cultures, some of them were written before the Holocaust but are still relevant.  Even though I don't have much time to read, I keep checking the list to see which one I'll have to read next.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book as much as the first.   It takes place a long time ago, but is still very real. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great. It really lays out what it is that is so appealing about a medieval castle, its history, and its people. It's not just about the castle, or the people, but about what these two parts are doing to each other, how they relate to one another, and what the castle is giving them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very pleased with this book. I am a history and philosophy major and I find this book very interesting, although somewhat dated.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a book I knew I would like, but I just didn't know how it would turn out.   It was well written and had a great character and plot.  The problem, of course, is that the plot is a bit of a mystery.  This is where a good story can come in handy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good, well written, short novel, well-written, fun, fast paced, and with lots of good characters and fun stuff.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book in a series of science fiction stories by JRR Tolkien. It is, I suppose, "The Hobbit" in that it is a "trilogy" of a single book. In fact, one of the problems is that there is too much time between the first story and the second. In "The Lord of the Rings," Tolkien did a good job of telling a single story from beginning to end (the Hobbit) while keeping the action going in the surrounding area. This is not the case in "The Silmarillion," where the stories have been merged, and so there are too many gaps. However, I am willing to sacrifice that minor flaw for a larger, better story: "The Elder Scrolls" series. As a reader, it was nice to get back into the Tolkien world again, even though it is not my usual taste.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like the "new generation" (not really a term used by the authors) in this book, some of them were very cool about it (e.g., Gail and Brian).   If you haven't read this book yet, you really owe it to yourself!
Write a positive review about a good book:   The stories in this book are compelling and entertaining.   I found the main characters interesting and likable, but I did not like the narrator very much. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is probably my favorite book. I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, but never felt they could be as good as the films. This was one of the few I've read that I truly enjoyed, and that I liked on its own.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great introduction to Haskell.   I've written some Haskell before, but this is a good introduction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book on the topic is David Buell's How To Be a Christian.   I'm also a Christian, and his book is probably my favorite introduction to Christianity I've seen. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorite fantasy series: it has plenty of action, action that is a little cheesy, action with a happy ending.   But the first one was my favorite.  The second one was interesting, but it lacked a little bit of that same fun.  This one is a lot better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:        There are a lot of good, informative books about early LDS history but this one caught my eye.   The authors show a keen understanding of the context and the events involved in the Book of Mormon (not to mention the complex and nuanced understanding of gender and sexuality).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not the biggest fan of romance.  But when a good romance book came out I bought a copy.   And  i'm so happy i did. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's my 2nd book by a female writer/author.  .   The writing style is very natural.  When you think about the time it took to write this book and the amount of effort put in it, it really shows.  A little over 5 years after she wrote her first book she's still learning her craft.  And the characters are always great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was surprised to see a number of my books were on Amazon in its   first few months.   Thanks to the author   for bringing   a more serious   perspective to the   game   than most authors   usually present. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a well written introduction to "the Jewish mind".   From its beginning, the book makes a great effort to explain to the reader the various ways in which this mind can come to see a concept as a "Jewish concept" (i.e., the concept of the holocaust).   Despite its many flaws, this is one of the better books on the subject of Jewish philosophy.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got a copy of this book and couldn't wait to read it.   The story starts out really strong with a powerful hook at the beginning that is enough to hold the reader through the whole book.  I was able to pick up on some clues that were hidden in the previous book that are the beginning of this one.  The author made some major changes in the world building here but it works pretty well.  However the book has it's shortcomings that I have to work hard to overcome.  It seems like the author's plot is trying to be a 'bigger' book and it is a little hard to get over this hurdle.  My major problem was that the author had to change around the characters and the main character and I think some of these changes just caused the other characters to start to go on a little tangent and it wasn't that clear at all.  But other than those nit-picks, the story is fantastic and I can't wait for the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    First off, you know why I am not reading this book.   The characters are all the most stereotypical and silly, and there is never even a hint of romance.  I mean, the main character is a pretty dorky looking chick who constantly wears the same clothes and is constantly complaining about her love life.  They say that this book is very lighthearted, but that is a bit of a lie, because the romance is nothing more than a cheap shot at a man and a girl who just don't work out.  The only way I can think this book could be good is if it is a spin-off of something ( like a Disney movie ) where the girls have their own unique personalities and are not just a love interest. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful book that should have had a different name.   I was so pleased with how the story flowed with both the good and bad that came out of it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed reading the book, but was a bit disappointed by the ending.   The story does a good job of telling us how many times we can lose a parent or grandparent and how often, with the help of technology, we manage to find them again.  And yes, there are moments of self-centeredness in this novel, which is all too common in so many books about children and aging.  Still, it's a fun, interesting, and thought-provoking read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorite books.   It's a nice balance between history and a bit of the future.  It would be interesting to hear what historians were saying at the time about this book and what they thought of it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a child, I used to sit on the floor in the living room and watch the first few hours of Star Trek :   The Original Series.   While I don't remember the episodes, it was the first time I got to know the show that I grew up watching.  I remember loving the adventures of the captain, Spock, the Vulcan girl, and the crew.  It helped me appreciate my beloved   Trek   and why I love it to this day.  Thanks, John

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've always had a thing about vampires, but this is the first time I really cared about them in the way I'd care about a real living being.   They're creepy.  I thought about taking a selfie with him, but my arms just wouldn't take the strain  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love it!   The story is very well done, the language is not so bad.   But it does not feel like the author really cares about the characters.  She talks about their lives, but she does not know them.  I would not want to read a book written by her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was good, well written and easy to read. The book took a while to read and it's a very complex subject, even though its the topic that has a lot of attention. I would say that the book is good as a source for understanding a bit of the history of the game but also good for people who want to do their own research.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that this is one of the better novels about the Vietnam War I've read. It is also a great example of the genre--novels about the war that are not about the conflict as it actually was.

Write a positive review about a good book:    So, you know that book I mentioned above by David Riesman? The one that was kind of amazing in the first part? Well, there's an audiobook version, and it's really good.   This is my third Audible reading, and I'm always glad I get this version (and not the audio).   In addition to the story being really interesting, Riesmann does a great job with the narrator.  He doesn't just narrate, but really helps flesh out the characters and makes the story a whole lot more interesting.  I think this is a pretty good book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The first half of the book is the story of a young boy, who is given a gift from an uncle. In the second half he is transported to a magical kingdom where he is a prince.   This book is about magic, but also about a little boy, finding himself in a magical world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been meaning to get a copy of this book since it came out.   It's not a perfect book and I think that's where the "bad" part comes in.  I think the author is an awful writer and is a little hard to get into.  When it was first published, I had a friend read to me the story but it was too long for me to enjoy the book.  This book is a good idea but doesn't seem to have a lot going for it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a huge fan of the Harry Potter series since I started reading them.   In fact I read the books about a year ago when I had no plans of ever reading them,   but once I got into them I realized that   they would be just as interesting to me   as they were to someone who is a die hard fan   of anything Harry Potter related.  It is nice to be reminded why   Rowling is such a good writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It was great to see a historical fiction written with some historical facts about the era. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most entertaining book that I have read in the last year or so.  It's not the kind of book you read on the subway.  This book makes you sit up in bed and read it over and over.   I'm going to pick it up again to see where it goes from here.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a huge fan of the book series, but it didn't quite fit my needs. The series ended, though.   The book was fun, but the movie made me feel sorry for George and Robin. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't think I have ever read anything like this.   It is very thought provoking, and a lot of fun.  I found myself laughing my ass off all the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book, but it was the book I would most like to have read, but couldn't. I am very fond of the concept behind the book and hope I can get my hands on a copy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    So this is a book about the history of a major religion. This is good history but the focus on the history isn't very interesting.   It focuses on one area: the Roman Catholic Church.  So that is an area in which Christianity has changed and adapted since its origins.  For example there is the idea of the "holy Eucharist"  - that is the actual meat that you eat after all the other food that is in the communion plate.  But as someone pointed out in another review, this doesn't happen in any of the Protestant or Roman Catholic churches.  The only place in the bible where the holy Eucharistic bread is mentioned is at the end of the book of John in the New Testament.  This is a minor point but it really doesn't help the overall story about the church.  My biggest problem is with the idea that the churches were built by the Roman empire:  There is an ancient Jewish city of Jericho in Egypt and it was there that Christianity took root.  There were people that lived there at the same time as Jesus and he could have been a convert there but the author doesn't make this clear enough.  Also, this is in a book written about the early church.   This is the church that is most popular today.  It doesn't have to be a religious institution but the way that the church is depicted in this book is not very nice.  As a history it isn't terrible but as a story about religion it is poorly told. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "If you enjoy the books by Tom Clancy, you will love The Hunt for Red October."   My husband is a huge Tom Clancy fan.   He has read the original novels and the sequels.  I thought this book would be interesting and fun to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very interesting study of how our brains process sensory information.   While many scientists have studied how the human brain interprets visual and auditory information, few have examined the role that the brain plays in making sense of sound.  It's a wonderful book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very enjoyable novel. A good mix of characters and a good mix between them.   The action sequences can sometimes be a little dry but it's a good story and is well written.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I had heard of The Three Lives of Christopher Columbus, and read that it wasn't a good one.   However,   despite its shortcomings (in my opinion)   it was still an enjoyable book   and   The book covers a great deal of material   so   you can't go wrong   for my money  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book a great deal, even though there were a few errors and a few oddities.  I'm not a fan of the story-line, but I'm also not averse to the "fairy tales" genre.   The main problem for me with the book was the lack of good information.  For example, how can it be a crime when it's the only thing that protects the child, so the parents are the murderers  ?   (Which in itself is a bit odd in this case.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been a fan of the Fuzzies since my junior high years (my high school was the largest in the state), when my sister and I took a tour of the old local zoo.    One of the best parts of our tour was the zoo's Fuzzy exhibit - there were the little fuzzy critters, who were great with our kids, and the cute little toys they were attached to.  When I read the book about the FZZY's, I was excited to learn a little more about the zoo and the history of the zoo.     This is one of the most charmingly written stories ever written about the fuzzies.  It's a simple, but elegant book with a lot of information on the fuzzy's history and some nice pictures of the animals and some amazing pictures in the book (a baby Fuzzie and the other fuzzies in the zoo).

Write a positive review about a good book:    The world would be a better place without books, as there are very few of the quality of this book. It's a very interesting topic and the author takes great care to tell us why, in a way that is both factual and engaging.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was recently rereading  the original text and found a whole bunch of interesting tidbits.   For one,   some of   the quotes that she uses in her book about      her childhood   might be from other sources but not from   her father's   collection,     as they are in her  book   (in  her   words.)   That is a good thing.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book.   It was an important book in my understanding of the life of James Madison.  I learned about how Madison worked as a teacher in his youth and what his political and religious opinions were, how he eventually went against some of the people he admired and became one of the most hated people in America, and about the way some of his ideas were misinterpreted.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good reference book. It has a good summary of the history of astronomy, but it also has an excellent discussion of the theory of the planets.   The authors explain the basic ideas that astronomers have about the sun and planets. I agree with some of the things that they say, although I have to say that the authors can sometimes come across as a bit arrogant when they explain things to the lay public. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not sure if this is just a "great book" or a "very good book", but either way, I have to recommend it.   What's so great about it?  It shows us a little bit about the culture of the British aristocracy.  It makes us laugh.  How else could one describe a book with the title 'The Great War'?  I thought the humor was very funny.  I found myself chuckling at the way that some of the words in the book were pronounced.  The author does an excellent job of bringing out the personalities in the British aristocrats.  For example, we learn about Earl Percy's attitude towards the Americans.  He said: "The Americans had no respect for the monarchy."  It made me laugh.   I really appreciated the fact that this book was published in 1916.  The Americans in 1916 were the most patriotic Americans in the world.  We see that in a lot of their propaganda.  And a lot did not like the war very much.  They didn't have the same kind of high class British sense of propriety as the people in the upper class in the USA.  I also found myself liking how the author made sure to keep the people who were in the war happy.  She even shows how those in the army found it humorous.  This book is a bit old now, but I can still remember reading it when I was a little girl.
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a writer, I'm always on the lookout for great literature:  I was on my way to the library when I came across this book,  a book that is both highly entertaining and informative about a topic I've always   felt passionate about:  the history and lore surrounding our nation's   first female president:  a woman that's never been celebrated in public, even   when her life and times are well documented.   The book is extremely well-written and accessible, and gives a wonderful background and insight on the first female President of the United States.  The most engaging part for me was a discussion of "The Great Compromise" where the author, Diane McWhorter, explained the background of the deal between the new president and the Republicans and how it impacted the lives of women.  This part of the book is the best. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've had my eye on this book for a while and finally got around to reading it.   The main story is a very fun time travel fantasy (think Time Lord's tea time) and the first half is very well written and very enjoyable.  It is the second half that's the real meat.  The ending is very sad but is still so much fun.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Fantastic novel. I have already found myself using the term "I-don't-give-a-damn" and its variations to describe some of my friends in the business.   It is one of those "just read" books that you can get to a point (a very interesting one) without having to think about it too much.  A very good novel.  I can imagine a lot of very interesting books in the future about the making and selling of video games."

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a little disappointed that I got this book because it wasn't on my radar until a friend recommended it to me.   This book is very different in structure and tone from her other work and her style is much less melodramatic.  While there are some wonderful descriptions of nature in this book, there are also some passages where the writing is overwritten, and there are more than a few "I've had it!" moments.  At the same time, the writing does have a certain "me" vibe to it.  I think I'm going to try out the book over the next few weeks and see how it goes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading the new edition of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens.   The new edition is a little lighter and fresher (and cheaper) than the original, but it is a good introduction to the story as a whole. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoy reading a lot of paranormal romances because it helps me to see the world through someone's eyes.   In the world of paranormal romance I see two people that love each other very deeply and are very close, but it can sometimes be hard for them to understand how the other feels about them.  The main character in this book has had many hard moments in the past, but she has a big heart and is able to get over them and continue to be happy.  It's great to see how strong that love is when it's needed the most.  I've read a lot about romance in a lot different books and never found it to be very different than other types of books.  This book is definitely different.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason for the negative review is because the book doesn't have a good plot.   The premise of the book is that a man finds a giant bug which lives underground and which kills people by crawling up from the bottom of their bodies.  That's it.  A giant bug and it's ability to kill people is a pretty good premise.  Unfortunately this book didn't use this premise. The book focuses on the main character's love life rather than the giant bug.  This is really boring and made the plot seem more dull.  Also, the book had a ton of problems with spelling and grammar.  The best part about this book is the ending, the giant death bug never appears.  But this book really has nothing to do with the bug.

We all have our favorite shows and the characters from them so   for all the times I've felt   stuck watching a TV show and have no idea who is talking   or where the characters are   is a real pleasure when you feel so  frustrated   but at the same time you find joy   in being entertained by   a good character   like   Dr.Who, or   Star Trek  .

Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished reading this and I am excited about how much depth and depth this author has put into this wonderful book about the world of the Japanese language. It takes a lot to write about a language and that is the reason that many of the books out there don't go far enough into the Japanese world. But, this book did. It explained Japanese grammar as well as I was able to grasp it. Also, as a Japanese woman who is very proud of her language (I am only half-Japanese and even I feel I am not fluent enough), this book is a joy to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good novel. The main character, Joran, is a powerful vampire, who's love for the vampire woman he loves is so profound that he becomes her slave. He makes great sacrifices for the cause (for the vampire girl's protection), but he does not want to make the same sacrifices for Joran's love. It's a very complicated and touching relationship.   It's good to see a book that puts human characters, like vampire, in such a very realistic way, without the usual tropes and clichés. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am an active Christian, and I read the bible cover to cover.   So many people (not just Christians) have tried to put Jesus in a box and never get it right.  My parents have never gotten it right either.  In fact, I'm not sure that anyone has ever gotten Jesus quite right. It is a work of art and it deserves to be appreciated. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Book of Common Prayer is the most important book anyone will ever read about Christianity and its history... It was written by the great apostle Thomas More, a Catholic reformer who in his day had great influence among many of the leading Protestant reformers and writers of his day, including John Calvin, Robert Barclay, and William Tyndale.   I can confidently say that it is the best Christian book ever written, and I have never been more impressed with a book."   I am also very impressed by this book: it's very readable, very easy to follow and very practical.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was hesitant to read this book because I know that the author is a fan of The Lord of the Rings. The books were so good, so interesting, that I just wanted to take a break from the usual reading material for a while, but after finishing I was pleasantly surprised. This book is a good companion piece to the first three books. It's not as good as Lord of The Rings, but it's still very good.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first chapter starts off with a very well-written section on the differences between British and American slang   which is followed by the first sentence of the first chapter (and my first)     "   What?   A "Titanic"   (   If you are expecting a romantic story about a romance, you are likely to be disappointed   )   that tells a story about the Titanic rather than the Titanic's icebergs.   However, I did enjoy the "bizarrely long" chapter "The History of 'The Titanic'"   where the author takes you through the history of the boat itself   from the creation of its name to its death.  ( I'm not sure what they think is so great about a boat that didn't sink, although they may get some mileage out of that if their future research is anything like my "history" of the Titanic).   So the chapters have a nice mix of entertaining facts and historical accuracy.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The second book I read about this kind of thing in a different book. I got a copy of this book on a lark just for the heck of it after hearing it was getting some good reviews. It's the kind of novel I've read many times before, usually in foreign language or in translation, but never anything in English, so it was a pleasant surprise to find something like this here.   This book is about how two people who met in Vietnam found an orphanage that actually cared for the children, how they found their own baby (I didn't catch the whole story in the book), and how they went from one of those orphanages to an actual orphanage and then back into a family.  One of the things I love about Vietnam is that there's so much about war and war victims that can never be told.  It's so sad how we take all the bad things from our country and pretend they don't exist, and how we think that because we were born in a country that's been a war-torn place that somehow we aren't.  I love the orphanage scene.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful book and a great book to get into the minds of children.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   The idea of the family making a family bible was intriguing and very funny, as was the discovery of the new addition: a Bible containing some of the Bible's "secret" passages.  It was also nice to find a Jewish book that included stories that I like, but wasn't part of any traditional Hebrew canon.  As the title suggested, the family is divided by religion, with the children going to an evangelical church while the father goes to the traditional Jewish synagogue, where the children can't sit near him because he is Jewish and so they get a bit of a tiff about this.  The book is set in the 19th century, but that doesn't stop it from being a good time travel story (it even takes place during the Russian Revolution).

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a good story and book.   I think it is a bit of a stretch to claim that the "alien" came out of a spaceship (or that an android comes out of an android) and that he has a "human-like" personality, but it is well told, and the android character is very cool (and somewhat similar to HAL in 2001 ).   There is some good stuff in this book that I did not know about, such as the story about the "black" people and their experiences with a white man.  Also, I like how the robots (or "android" as they call themselves) are depicted as being "fascinated" by what they have created.  This book is a solid, good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was one of the first I have read, and I am not at all surprised to see it recommended by such a well-respected source.   The book is a very well-written and thought-provoking book on the various aspects of social   life.  There is a lot to be said about how we can better interact with others, how the   social  nature of the human race will ultimately lead us to a more peaceful   society, how we learn from each other, how it is important to find a   balance in our lives between work and family, how each person has a special gift that brings   us closer to a common goal, and how social  culture and social  people are very personal   bonds.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book about the rise of the Catholic Church.   It is also about the decline of it in a secular culture.  This book is about the fall of the Roman Empire,  the rise and fall of Medieval Europe and  the modernity of Catholicism in the modern world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a good read.   If you like detective novels you will probably love it, but if you like thrillers you may need to put the book down for a bit.  I did like the way the story ended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading this book for the last 6 months and it's so so so good   You might be thinking about the title of the book. I am a bit confused because  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am currently reading the first book in a series by Richard Russo.   The book  is great!   This is a great way to see what he is  doing.  It gives you a lot of the backstory on why some characters seem to have problems with others.  I liked the writing style  and the way it was done.  I am currently  reading the series by Russo.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I can only describe the experience of reading this book as exhilarating!" I absolutely loved this book   I found this book so fascinating.   The writer really captured the essence of the book in the writing   She captured the beauty of the old book  The language was so easy to understand   This book was so enjoyable  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.  I think if you take it at face value the "evil" of people in the world is a problem with society - not the evil of the people themselves.   For instance, one of the characters, a middle aged woman, is married to a mentally unstable man who uses a cane for his strength.  The character says, " I would never allow my husband to use a cane as long as I lived  "   The problem is that the society at the time required that people who didn't have a cane use a hand-held wheel.  What was it that caused that?  I can only imagine that it might have been the fact that her husband got a better job with a wheelchair than she did with a cane.  If you can think of something that is a bad society, let me know. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's the story that matters to me, not how the author makes the characters' lives sound interesting.   My favorite character is the older brother, with a lot of heart. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a world where people are being forced to take meds to treat anxiety and depression   (   that are completely ineffective  , and   expensive   ),   we need   a   kindly   voice   for those who   need help  .

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, with its simple, easy-to-read style, has the same effect as my friend's first poetry book: it just gets my interest.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I've read about 30 books on the subject.   It's clear that this author is very concerned with the issues involved in this subject, and her use of data to back up her arguments is solid.  It makes sense to me that the government would want to know all this data.  And, if that's true, that would probably be the source that got leaked.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book gives you a complete understanding of the concept and implementation of C and C++. It covers the fundamentals, not the intricacies, and covers C, C++, and the new C#.   It also covers some very nice examples in an easy to understand fashion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first half of the book is about a young girl's search for her lost sister after they were separated at the age of five.   The second half is about the girl's discovery of the woman, with all of her memories.  At one point, the girl mentions that the woman was her own mother, implying that she is not who she thought she was.  Another good book I found to be more about the real-life than fiction:      And so the story of Elizabeth Bishop is, for most of us, the story about the woman who inspired the movie "To Kill a Mockingbird."   But I am a little surprised that no one told me about it before now.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm always looking for good science books that are not just a set of observations or ideas. This book has both.   It has both real science and ideas that are just interesting enough to be entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I did read this book on a Kindle before I started the book. It was kind of tedious to get through it, but I liked the story of the "mythic" nature of the ancient Greek people and their myths.   It helped that it had a female hero who was also a warrior and didn't always wear sexy clothes.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been on a bit of a reading binge lately.   There are just so many great books out there I want to read and I'm not sure that the Kindle is enough to keep me from buying them all.  In addition to reading other people's reviews and recommendations    and  my own,   it helps that the quality of the writing is so good

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like anything by John Irving, you will like this book.   It is well written with a good story to go with it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The most interesting and thought-provoking thing about this book is that I have never even heard of John Milton.   I have recently read about the most famous and most influential of the American poets and am very intrigued by the influence that Milton has had on his contemporaries.  He was an exceptionally talented man and poet and I have been very drawn into the works of the poet since reading Milton's Paradise Lost.  My other favorite poets and authors are Robert Frost (in addition to the above mentioned), John Donne, and William Wordsworth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was my first book about the subject of a single mother with a child in foster care.   I think the author does a good job of explaining her personal and professional struggles, the difficulties she faced in getting the child into foster care, and the effects of the situation on her child.  I am glad I read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've loved this book from the moment I finished it.   This is a perfect gift for a reader of horror, a reader who loves to be scared, and a reader whose favorite character is a monster.  I couldn't have asked for a better book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book fascinating and the authors insightful.   A few interesting findings:  - I never knew how important a good map is.  - You don't need much in a life to be successful.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this book a lot. It's a funny and interesting read about an odd character. I think I may have read the same book by a different author before. The book has a good structure, a lot of background, and a lot more action than most stories that aren't horror books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is so important to get an accurate history from an unbiased source. The book covers some very interesting facts and is very helpful in making sense of all the complex issues that exist regarding this time period. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Truly original."   It is a very original book.   I enjoyed it so much that I just finished the second book which has now been published as a graphic novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like to read books that talk about various aspects of life in a positive way, which is why I liked this book.   This book is about an American man and woman on their honeymoon in Italy.  They have very different ideas about their honey moon.  This was good, informative, and was just a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a fun and interesting read. It's a great way to start off a summer with a book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have always wanted to be a writer. So, I did some research on where to get an education in writing, and a friend recommended I start writing my own book.   And my friends love it and I love it.       It really has been great to write something from my own voice!   It's easy to be intimidated writing about things I don't know too much about, but it's a great skill to have if you want to be an author.

Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent book about the life of a "sick" or "paranoid" individual (as described in the introduction by Dr. Carl Jung). I would not have known how the man who was referred to as "soulless" by his own daughter had changed if I had not read this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great!   My parents are dead now,   and i am so  grateful  that this book   will remind me   about   their   love.   Thanks for all   you do   to help   children   learn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It was easy to read and really interesting.  I have been thinking about this book for a while now and I now understand why it is so popular.  While I did not have an easy time understanding it, I think it is a great book about finding a way to succeed through a set of obstacles, the key word being obstacles. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has some wonderful insights about a difficult subject:  It's a good overview of the history of sexual abuse of children.   It shows that while the church was trying to control its history of child molestation, the victims and their families, and the community at large, had other ideas.  I'm interested in reading more on this subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the summer of 1983, while on vacation in South Dakota, I attended the "Great Falls International Book Fair" for the first time.   The theme of the fair was "The Book of Common Prayer."   (The author is the bishop of the First Presbyterian Church of Great Falls.  The book was published by the First P.O.W. Church in 1965,   which was not my church, but   I was on the board and had a copy.)   As a Protestant I  had been a student of the Reformation for most of my life.  But   as I grew older I was drawn more and more to   Catholic teaching and to the writings of Pope John Paul II.  I read, and   enjoyed, the book of Common prayer by Edward W. Cottam and  John W. Mote.  They were both pastors in the First Reformed Church of North America in the late 60's.  (Mote is also a former bishop of Paineville, IL.)  My introduction to Catholic theology was through Cottami's book.  Cottamic's first book was the translation of the Roman Catholic catechism, but was not very successful. He worked in the United States but his books did not catch on in Europe.  He also wrote a history of the English church and a biography of Mary, Queen of Scots, and that is the first thing one learns from reading Cottamin's book: Catholic and Protestant in this country are not so different in theology or practice. (p. 13)   Cabbinic teaching seems more plausible to me than that of the Protestant reformers.  From what I have read about Cabbalists, they seem to have no problems with women or sexuality or other sexual practices (although they seem not to be as open about it as some Protestant Reformers).   A good review of Cabbalist theology:  Catholicism and its relation to the Reformed Faith by James J. Roper, Jr. (The Catholic World, vol 2 no. 10, June, 1978, p. 7-8). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be a nice read, and enjoyed a lot of the details, especially about how people view themselves.   Some of the information is a little dated.  I'm just a bit sad that it seems like so many people are afraid of being judged by how they look. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My family really enjoyed this book. The illustrations were beautiful.   It would be perfect for a class.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really looking forward to The Art of Flight   It took me ages to get to the airport and I was anxious to get going   and finally I got on the plane   but I found a really interesting book   to be really informative   in my search  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The description of the book is spot on:  One day, as a student at a public high school in a low-income neighborhood, I was asked to do a project on "streetlights".   When I explained that my project wasn't related to streetlights, I found myself being berated for the entire two-hour period as I was doing the research and writing.   I had my thesis advisor's permission to use "streetlight" as a synonym of "light" instead of just the word.  As a result, I have now changed the wording of the thesis to more accurately describe the research. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very well-written, entertaining, well-researched and well-illustrated book about the discovery of a secret city (Dolores Del Castillo, I believe) during the Spanish Inquisition. I did not know about Dolores until reading this book, so it is interesting to read about the history and the history of Spain.   The book starts with a description of what happened during the time of the Spanish inquisition - the Spanish army invaded Mexico and discovered a city hidden in the jungles called "The Lost City of Cuzco" by a guy named Rufino.  Dolor : The Lost City and the Lost Mission   Dolor is an "Indian chief" who is one of the people mentioned in the book. Apparently, the Spaniards saw a lot of Indians and they thought Dolor was a chief. So, they killed him and brought him to the city. Dolor told Rufina the whole story about Dolor and Dolor's secret mission. It was interesting to learn about the mission Dolor wanted to go on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a good story about one woman's battle to keep her life and mind intact after a terrible, horrible, horrifying experience.   I really enjoyed the writing style, and I was impressed by the detailed description of what happened. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't know if I'm more pleased or disappointed by the ending of this book.   To start with, this book was extremely confusing and difficult to understand, especially when compared to the book that came before it.  The second half of this novel, which was much better, was the only bit of plot I understand.  There were also too many characters to remember in the first half of the novel, as the book felt like it was trying to be too much at once.  However, despite that, it did manage to capture a very important aspect of life as we know it, as a mother of 2:  In this book, it is really easy for us as the main characters to see that our daughter is the only one who is truly responsible for everything that happens in this book (and that she has little to no choice in the matter).   It is also very interesting to see how the author and the mother relate to each other. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " A beautiful and moving work.   A fascinating look at a very complex subject."   (From review written for The American Conservative  )"This is a book of essays about the influence of Jews on society.... (The essays) are written in a tone that is calm, measured, and unassuming, while still daring to speak in a way that most readers will not expect:  They say what you want them to say.  They are as good as any book about the Jews that I have read." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very interesting read!   While it is a great idea to find the origin of a word, it is too easy a way to get a "word" out of a name, especially a name that is very unique.  I did notice, though, that the name is from a book from the 1700's that mentions some very interesting and unusual words (like "a daffodil"), but didn't name them.   I would've liked to see more of the source material to be sure that my research was accurate. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is about the discovery of DNA (in 1974) and how its use in medicine and science would change the future of medicine forever.   In fact it was the discovery that created the field of molecular genetics and its use for medical research and discovery.  The fact that a new species was discovered using a new technique was exciting to my parents at the time and as a kid was one of the things I was most excited about growing up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book, if you're looking for a quick and simple guide to finding a way to get into the backcountry without spending $1000 on a brand new mountaineering pack, this is it.   I just got back from a month-long thru-hike of the AT and I'm using my new pack quite well (and it's about a quarter the price).   If you're on a tight budget and can't find a good pack, buy one of these. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had always wanted to read a science fiction book in which the hero is a transgender woman.   But, I didn't want to read too much into the book, since I knew what was about to happen.  The main character, Tris, is an amazing, realistic and strong female scientist.  I just hope there is more transgender women in science fiction! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was very very good.   While not as good as the last book in the series the pacing was great and the world building was very well done  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a fan of the series from the beginning.  It was a good start to a series I look forward to reading  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful blend of the good old days when the old-fashioned, high-quality, well-written books were the norm, and the   the  modern, cutting-edge   of current science.   If there's anything   wrong with science it's that   it   doesn't   seem   as   to me   what   a  good   science   should   be like. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book that is about a very bad guy I don't think is all that interesting.   It's a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The last part is very interesting to read.   And the first part is the worst part: 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am very glad I found this book.    The book is about a boy who comes to his family for Thanksgiving in 1939.  He has a terrible headache but tells his mother to put him to bed.  She does and he continues to sleep on the couch.  This all sounds very silly.  However it really was just the start of the end of a family that was very proud of his illness.  They started to see the value in a medical school.  The family eventually moved to a larger home and eventually to an apartment building in the Bronx.  His parents both passed before he was 19 years old.  After living there for a few years the family went through a divorce.  One thing lead to another and he and his mother both passed away.  In a way I feel that I'm watching a movie about a family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first one i read was a good introduction to the subject and it's a must read  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the best I have read about the first war in this century (1914-1945). The author is a very clear writer, and he gives you all the key elements about the war, why it happened, the impact on Britain and the USA, why the Soviet Union (the Soviet Union that defeated Germany) was always a problem in world affairs, and a great deal more. It would not be worth a book of its own if it did not have all the material in it (though if one can stomach the war and its consequences it is worth it).  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent.  It's a well researched, informative, well written and entertaining work, packed full of fascinating details about the history of the U.S.S Constellation.   I'm looking forward to reading more about this and I'm sure there will be lots more to come. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not hard to see how a book about the history of American women's sports might have been a "great" read but, unfortunately, it is just not that good.   The book seems to have been written by a professional historian who has spent her life as a professor of American history.  It contains lots of information about the games, the participants and the sport but the book is really just a summary, a very long summary, of a lot of other sources. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's been over five years since I read this book.   As a young child, I remember it quite fondly.   My grandfather was a very religious man and would often get in trouble for taking his children to church.  He was the one to start the "church" thing in my house.  The kids were not allowed to go to school if they didn't have a church to go too.  It was an interesting experience and my father and mother were always trying to keep the church going in our house. When I was a teenager my father decided that there would be a church on the farm.  My father was very involved in church affairs.  His family and I didn't do well at school.  I never made it through high school, but my father always made sure that my brother and I would go to church with him on Sunday.  As I got older, I went to church occasionally as well but my mother always thought it was very strange.  We were never allowed to attend school during the school day.  When I went through the church initiation, my mother was very disappointed because my father never let her watch me.  She made me go through all the same things that my father had but was never allowed.  One time my mother said, "I think the Lord just wants me to go and read a book to my sister" and I was allowed to take a trip with her.  At one time my father gave a talk on God's love to the group.  They were all there and my mother thought that he was trying to preach to them but that they didn\'t seem to listen very well.  Anyway, this all happened after the church was discontinued.  But even though my mother hated church, she would still go to services every Sunday, though she was always very uncomfortable with the whole thing.  If you are interested in reading this book, it's not hard to find.  Look in the Religious Classics section of a bookstore. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best part of this book is the information.   An article about how many people don't know how to spell.  If you read the first sentence in the book, you'll have a good idea what is going on, and what to do about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    While reading I found myself thinking about other works which made me want to become a reader.   One book that makes me want a book I have not read is the one book  The main character is a teacher and has a little girl that attends school with her.  She is a good teacher but her work is not good at all because she can't read. She is trying to help her daughter find the right words and it is very hard. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters were interesting. I'd have liked to get more about the two who were in love with each other (and who were not in love at all but seemed to love each other as if that were possible) but the couple got along pretty well as a couple.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Great Gatsby is a fascinating story about American culture as seen through the eyes of a gangster from a small town in Missouri.   Although I was very familiar with Fitzgerald before reading this book, I found it to be a surprisingly original story that was as surprising and entertaining as the novel's subject matter.  While the character's actions may be unorthodox, they seem to be quite sensible given that they are living under the threat of an imminent execution. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book before I started studying and I really enjoyed it   This is a wonderful book and I hope everyone who is serious about their studies and wants to be more successful in their future studies reads it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a very serious fan of the series. I've read it from cover to cover, and have been eagerly awaiting new volumes.   The cover shows some dragons, a couple swords, some magic weapons, and the title.  It's an easy read - even to a child.  I think that this is an important book, and I'm glad to be able to read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book quite helpful as a refresher on a certain sort of thought experiment:  If the only things that people were allowed to say in a group were things that didn't contradict their beliefs about reality, and if any non-believer was asked to defend their belief on the spot, how long would it take to see whether their belief was true?   I found this idea very intriguing, and the book provides a good introduction to it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    As the title says, this book is a collection of short stories about one man's relationship with his father who he loved deeply and has passed away (now that he thinks about it).   I am a big fan of stories about the past.   This is probably the last book I'll get from him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only reason I bought this book is because I have been looking to get into the history of the Japanese language for a while now.  I also know there is a lot more to Japanese than the characters in katakana and Hiragana that are used in English.  This book was a good introduction into how to understand the language and its phonetic sounds. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not a huge fan of the Star Wars films but I really enjoyed this one.   It is the first time I've ever seen the Star Trek movies and I enjoyed them as well.  The plot is a bit different then you'd expect from a Star Trek story but I enjoyed it all the same. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of the few good things that I have read in the last few years, along with the works of Stephen King, David Foster Wallace, and William Gibson.   It is not as good as these, but it is definitely worth a read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is my favorite novel ever. I've read quite a few books that were very good, but this book is the best. I'm a Christian, so I know a lot of the themes in it, but I still enjoyed it, even though there was a lot that was difficult to accept.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am soooo happy that I bought this book. It has been on my "to-read list" for years.   This book is a good read. It covers a variety of topics in a few short chapters.  This is one of those books that I will never forget. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a very helpful guide for anyone who wants to get a jump on their research for their own school projects.   The book is not terribly complex but does include a lot of good information.  A good reference and an excellent read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book, but I do not know that I would have enjoyed it if the main character was a male, at least to the same extent that I enjoyed reading about a female character in my own life (although not in the same sense as the other two). The main character is a woman, but her problems (including the problems of her children) are shared by many women, who are also victims of domestic violence.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    After finishing the last book in a series (which was supposed to be a sequel), I was eager to see what would happen.   I   expected a little more action (or at least the chance for that), but what I got was more character, drama, and a nice twist.  I had a good time reading and thinking about the characters and the way they interacted with each other. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm sure I could go on about the many interesting characters.   He has an odd style, but I enjoyed it as I enjoy a lot of his novels.

Write a positive review about a good book:    First time I read a novel from a male author. I was expecting a lot of sexual tension. It didn't. I'm not a sexual person, but I've got a lot to offer, and even when the characters don't seem to know what to do with it, I'm interested.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept and writing of this book is brilliant.   While   I did find   the characters a bit generic   it was   only a minor problem   for me.  I   enjoyed   this book as a standalone read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   "If you're interested in a serious, serious, science fiction novel, then I can't recommend this one enough."   Author's note:  This is a really good book. The main character is pretty interesting (and the way he gets his power is really cool), and the action sequences are very well-written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are a Star Trek fan you have to read this book,   It is about a man who travels back in time,  He is the most logical being  I have ever seen.   He knows about the future but knows no more about it than the rest of us do.  It was fun to hear about his travel, how he got there, and how his crew treated him.  I have to say that I really liked the book.  Star Trek fans should take some time and read this.  I think it might just change your perspective on life.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book and I really enjoyed it   This book is just so good   A couple of my favorite things about the book are   1) the cover - I like the artwork in that it's an illustration by a famous illustrator,   2) the descriptions - the descriptions are spot on   The book is mostly about people in a different era but they still get the point 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book, at over 500 pages, is very long, but does a very good job of explaining concepts and concepts, without having to be an encyclopedia.   I would recommend this book to people who need a good refresher. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It had lots of information, and I had a lot to get through in my final year of high school.  The best part of this book was how he talked about the kids in school, why they got the good grades and didn't get the bad grades, and how that affects their attitudes toward their lives.  It is a really good book, and will help you figure out if you are like the kids he mentions, or just like the way things go. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "It is an extraordinary story of how a very ordinary woman with an ordinary life was able to become a symbol of the struggles to live life to its fullest."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a great read and the information is very helpful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    While reading this book I was amazed at how well the author wrote and how well her knowledge of her subject was reflected in the writing.   This is an excellent book and I recommend it to anyone interested in studying the origins of Islam 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent in a few ways. It is a very well-written book on the subject of history and especially American history. It also has a very important message: that the United States' relationship with Great Britain was not only good, but that the British didn't need to be a part of the United Nations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    After reading this book, i'm convinced that there's no one who isn't interested in the truth.   This is definitely one of those times where there's really nothing to get worked up about, unless you are a person that wants to know everything about every person they meet in life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great read that is also a very good introduction to a new language. It is written by a native Korean speaker with a lot of experience, knowledge, and enthusiasm to share about what she learned.    One can learn a lot about a foreign language by reading books on a subject.  One can learn about a new and different way of life very easily when you are exposed to new ideas, cultures, and people.  I highly recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good, fast paced, enjoyable read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about the Bible and the Bible stories.   I'm not going to comment on whether or not the author is a bible professor... But I'm pretty sure the Bible is not about being "God's friend" (or God's "best friend"), but rather, about being a good parent to your children:  God is like a parent, but he does things differently.  His way is good.  But, he's the parent.  So, why is it so hard for some people to be good parents to their children?   Because they're not God's child (which they aren't).   They aren't his friend.  They're his own children.  How are they going to raise children that are like them? 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was the first book I've read that was actually very funny.   I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fascinating, thought-provoking book about the human mind. It explains to us the psychological nature of how we think about things. It is not a "sophisticated" book, but it does provide an excellent introduction.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read it as a teenager.   One day, my parents had a party and I went and did a little drinking.  While I had no trouble getting the liquor, the food at the party did not appeal to me.  I was not into breadsticks or any of that.  Instead, I wanted the chicken fingers with a side of beans and a fried egg on top.  In addition, my mother made this dish every day after we got back from church.  Well, I had never tried anything like it.  My mom was a bit of a foodie (and I always thought she was crazy) so she used to make all sorts of delicious and unusual meals.  And so I took the next logical step and asked her to make a "nasty little chicken finger".  She used to bring them home from church with her but she was out of town that day.  Then I found a little packet of cornbread mix and the recipe is very straightforward.  It does take a little while but in the end the dish is amazing.  Just try it!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not just about the human struggle for existence but about what it means to be a human being.  It is a brilliant and thought provoking book that provides a lot of valuable insight into our lives, our minds, our souls, and our nature.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a college-level anthropology book for the course "A Social Anthropology of China" at the University of Southern California.   The material presented is of tremendous value, and will give the reader a very good idea of what Chinese culture is about.  My biggest concern, and why I left the book unfinished, was that I couldn't help but be disappointed in some of the social theory aspects, particularly in connection with the topic of women and the   "women's role in the development of Chinese society"   While this book is excellent, I'm still thinking about some of these points and thinking about what the implications are for my "women and sex" class, which is a very close reading of China's history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book that covers a very broad subject.   The chapters are short, but are excellent.  If you have a few dollars to spare, you must get this book!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoy the first three books in this series and was eagerly awaiting a fourth in the series to read.   This one was not as good as the others.  It is still very good but I think it was because it was a bit longer.  I think the first book in this set had more action than the second book in the set and was slightly more interesting.  This book felt more like a book about the life of a family of the same religion as it did about a person from a different religion.  Overall the book was still good but not as much of a winner as the other books in the trilogy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this before, and enjoyed it.   The first part was good, but by the end it was a slog. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of the book - I have been looking for a good read about the War of 1812 since I found a copy a few years ago and I was very happy when I found it on amazon. It does a wonderful job of putting this incredible event in the context of a larger political struggle - which was not really a struggle at all but a series of local conflicts and local wars that came together to create a much bigger battle.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a good time reading this book and enjoyed it a lot. I liked the fact that the author included quotes from both the Old Testament and the New Testament in his research into the subject.   The book contains a good bit of history as well as good advice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received the book via the Dwayne Johnson "Born Strong" DVD set.   It is so good!       This is a good, funny book about two overweight, nerdy friends, one of whom is a geek, who can't seem to stop talking about how he's better than everybody else. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I finished the book  I was excited about the possibilities  for using plants to provide clean water   The only issue I had with the book was the formatting:  It is hard to read the tables  It would have been easier to print out the table and put it on a wall   I also found it hard to print the images I needed,   But I like it and can use it in my office in my work 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a bit puzzled by the fact that this book is written so carefully and at so much length about what is clearly a very contentious topic: the historical origins of a belief that Jesus is not the son of God.   There are a couple of things that might be said to make the topic less contentious, including the fact the first Christian leaders did not consider it a matter of faith to think that the "Son of God" is not God but rather is, in fact, Satan. But it would seem to me that one would expect much more historical and critical discussion about the role of the Church fathers in the early centuries to be found in such a study: they are certainly not the last ones to be concerned with such things; in fact they are generally thought to have been the most skeptical and least certain about this idea.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best of my 3 books on how to handle a man.   I bought this on line, because it was one of the first ones on the subject.  I've read other books on the topic, but this is the most comprehensive.  The only thing I wished they'd done was have the women's part in it, so that they'd know where to begin. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I received a copy of this book, to have as a part of a library of books on the history of witchcraft in medieval and Renaissance Europe.   The book is written by a woman who had to fight a lengthy battle to obtain a manuscript of the original manuscript,   which is still owned by the author.  The copy was only recently discovered and is in a good condition,  but as the copy was found only several years after the original, it is by no means the same thing.  While the author did not write the translation (which is a bit of a puzzle),   the language used is very close to the original language.  It   makes   this a good reference source for students and scholars interested in the history and use of witchcraft. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good introduction to the world of digital cameras.   The book explains some good principles.  My only minor quibble is that in the last page of the book there is a picture of the Pentax ME Super 50.  The ME was replaced by the Pentaprism but it is an interesting story and a nice example of a digital camera.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of the more enjoyable and interesting reads on the philosophy of the occult I've read.   As I recall, the author has some minor differences of opinion with people like Aleister Crowley, but is generally an admirer.  If you are interested in the history of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn,  this book will give you plenty of fascinating details   If not interested in all the history, you'll probably find this book is worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am still trying to wrap my head around this one. It's not hard to understand, but there's a lot of depth to this book and I don't think I'm going to be able to understand everything at first.
