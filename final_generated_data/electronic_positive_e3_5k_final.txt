Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great case for my XPS 13. The only downside is that it only holds 1 SSD. That is pretty much the only downside. The case itself is sturdy enough for my laptop to not scratch it. It also has a nice mesh lining that I'm still using. The interior and exterior are sealed, which is a plus, especially in warmer climates. There is a small zipper pocket on the bottom, which I love. I love the case itself, and I love how it looks. I have only used it once so far, but it was very simple to set up. It is also very easy to clean, which makes it very handy. You do have to remove the rubber feet in the front to open it. The top fits a lot of stuff, but the top can also be removed for better airflow and access.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm in the process of moving to my parents' house next to a small garden. I have a VCR and VHS video tapes. I don't have any problem with the picture quality of the video tape. However, I do notice that the picture deteriorates quickly with repeated viewing. For example, after watching one video tape, the picture is gone. If I watch it again, it is gone again. This makes it very easy to locate what you are watching on the screen. As soon as you can find the tape, you can start to watch it right away. This is great if you want to watch a tape over and over. If you are having problems with the screen fading, you may need to play this tape on a high quality video player. However the picture will usually come back to life after a few minutes, after you start watching again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The screen is beautiful. It is not very easy to read the text. This is because the color is not strong enough.I use the Samsung eReader software. However, the software is not as good as the software on the Sony reader. I have a Sony reader too. This reader has a better color and better print quality.I also like the layout of the screen. The text is very easy and comfortable to read. It even looks nice in portrait orientation.I have had the reader for about a month and it is still working fine. I use it mostly as a scanner.It is not the cheapest but it is the best of the best

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The  USB 3.0 adapter is not as convenient as other USB adapters. It needs to be plugged into the computer before the keyboard can recognize it.  This is due to the way the software recognizes USB 3 devices.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a fantastic product.  If you have a smaller tv, don't hesitate to buy the 8 ft. or less model.  The remote is very useful and easy to use, even if you don't use a large TV.  I have the standard TV and the remote fits my hand nicely.  There are a few buttons you can use to tweak the picture, but it's easy to do it from the remote if you need to.  You get 2 inputs, both analog, but the TV's sound output has to be set to Dolby Digital.  Great remote, easy to set up, good value.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit is good, but the speakers are only usable with a good amp. It doesn't bother me too much, but if you are looking for some more volume and/or clarity than the default, try the V10 for $149. It's got a higher volume and more clarity. The only drawback is that you have to buy a couple for your system, but they are not too bad, and the only drawback you might have is that they don't fit in most cases. It is just slightly larger than the V3.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the perfect accessory for a computer with a poor video card, no VGA, or any other card.  It will fix any of those issues in a few seconds.  All the card slots are covered, and I could see the cards staying on the video card. I had to remove the card, but that's because the card is only the size of a little sticker on the side of the motherboard.  I didn't need to do anything else.  The card works fine in any case that you have with an ATX card, without issues.  If you are looking for a replacement card for your case or just want something to protect your computer from getting scratched, this is a great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered 2 of these units. One I just received today, another just a couple days ago. Both worked great as soon as I put it on my laptop. I'm glad I went with the PIA model. You need to use a screwdriver to remove the bottom panel from the unit.The only complaint I have is that once you remove the back panel you will have to carefully lower the laptop to the floor to keep the panel from falling out. I am not a novice and I'm certain that a more aggressive screwdriver and an additional pad could have prevented this from happening. It's pretty simple to use the cover as a wedge to keep it from falling. So that's a minor negative. It is also easy to use after you are finished lowering the laptop.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have never owned a TV. I bought a plasma TV about 4 years ago, and it works great.I use it as a desktop monitor. I did have to run through the setup and adjustment at first to figure out what I wanted.After that I got pretty comfortable with the product.The only thing I would suggest is to get a higher resolution picture.The picture on the screen is pretty good, but not so much that you can actually see the screen. I have the same setup on the front end and I get a better picture on both the front and back of the screen, which is a lot better.For a little more money I would try a 1080p screen.The unit looks really nice and easy to install. I will continue to use this for a while, but I am certainly not getting rid of my plasma set

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a HP 710, it had to be replaced by a new HP 730. I had a problem with HP 740's, however. I thought I had solved the problem by purchasing a refurbished 730 and it seems to have solved my issue. I did however discover that the HP 735 has more features that the 740. HP 736 comes with HP HomeLink software. HP recommends the 735, but HP 745 does not. I've only had it for a few days, so I will let you know how it works out in the long run. For me, I have had no problems with the 745 and it does have it's pros and cons, so it will probably take some time to get used to it. If you already have a good HP 739, 744, 745, 748, 765, 767, 771, 775, you won't have any problem with the HP745. However, if you already own a HP 5400 or an HP 6000 and you're looking for something that is less expensive, than I don't see why not. If HP offers this, then go for it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this product for about three months now. The picture shows that it has a good screen, but it is the sound quality that makes this one of my favorites. I like how you can adjust the volume to a safe level.  This item is one that is hard to resist, no matter what the budget is.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's perfect for those of us that have multiple outlets and wish to keep a consistent appearance.  The unit is lightweight and works just as well on the floor or table as it does on the wall.  There are no cables to snag and they look great.  This is just an overall great way to keep track of your electronics, and it's also great for organizing other accessories.   I would highly recommend 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The only negative thing about this unit is that it only works with a CD in my case.  There are several USB ports, and I had to get in the habit of using the two USB ports to charge the device.  When I have it installed, it works fine.  I did have to re-install the OS to get it to work, and have been using the 2 USB ports now.  It's a nice little USB device, and the price is reasonable

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod nano works just as well as the real thing. We've had no problems with it so far, and it's not heavy. The audio quality is also great. The only downside is the plastic case. You can't really tell the difference between it and the real one. However, it fits in my bag easily, and I haven't run into any problems with the case either.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It came with all the parts needed for easy installation. The power cords and cords were a bit thicker than I expected and needed to be cut down slightly to fit my wall plate. I have not tried plugging it in yet, but it is working fine. I will report back to you if I have any issues with it. I highly recommend this power strip to anyone looking to install their own electronics, or buy a lot of equipment for a few computers: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used it a couple times. It's a good design, and it is very easy to use. It has only given me one problem so far:  After a long time of only being able to hear the radio for 20 minutes at a time, I finally found that the volume control in the unit is not on when it should be. It would be nice if the volume knob were a little bit raised to the higher end, but there is no way to do that on this unit

So I returned them and ordered two more. I used the free shipping because of the low cost of shipping (I didn't want to have to pay extra for express shipping). It arrived in 5 days and was so easy to set up. Everything worked great. I will definitely order from the site again. I would recommend this to anyone 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This product is great for the price. I use a couple of these for different purposes. I have a large electronic device, a remote, a light meter, and it all runs off of this. I'm very pleased with the quality and look of this light

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using the Sony E Series digital audio recorder for over 15 years. I have never had any technical problems with this recorder, and it still looks like new in the box. It's very easy to use with a PC computer, and has the very best sound quality I've ever heard. It has many settings which will give you the perfect sound for your home recording, and I have no complaints. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device works very well for my needs. I haven't tested the sound quality yet, but it seems good enough. It does require you to get very close to the amp to hear it, but that's only because I'm installing it at a very high distance, but the sound is very clear on its own. I'm very impressed with this product! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound is really high quality, easy to use, easy on batteries, and very durable. I would recommend this monitor to everyone

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Purchased this TV about a month ago. This thing is very bright, has plenty of adjustment options and I like the idea of buying the "Home Entertainment" Kit that comes with the TV so that I can use my other TV's on this TV as well. I haven't seen any complaints about picture quality out of it so far and I think it will last for a very long time (I bought it just as Christmas was about to hit and I already have two HDMI cables for my various TV's with this TV, so the TV is already set up for years to come). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great sound card, excellent audio quality.  The best way to describe this is "like having a big stereo receiver in your room".  If you don't need more than 2-channels of surround sound, then this card will be a great addition to your system.  It does however come with a higher cost, and a high price for that matter, so you might consider a cheaper card like the Avermedia 3D-3x1/2x1-5.  You will get more channels and more bass, but the price is also higher.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered this to add to a digital project room. It does the job. You don't have to buy more expensive models for this purpose. I'm very pleased with it and I'm considering purchasing several more to make a bigger setup. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I wanted to find out how much signal I was getting from my TV when it was on with the TV in standby mode.I ran a signal strength meter from my receiver to the TV and had about the same signal strength.The TV did not pick up any signal strength differences, although the signal from the receiver was stronger than the signal in the TV. I was able to pick up two separate sets of signals.I didn't run the TV under the same conditions under which the receiver measured.The receiver had its own set of environmental conditions and the TV's signal strength changed with each setting change.But overall the results were close.The only issue I have is that the TV did NOT pick up my son's program. I have two TVs connected to the same receiver and I was not able to get it on either TV.But I'm not sure if it would have been possible in real life as there were too many people sitting in the room at the same time. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used many other brands, but this one is great.  The cables are very thin, so it is easy to hold it in one hand.  It is also very portable.  I recommend it to all who are interested in electronic devices:  The product is very convenient and light, but it is very stable.   The price is right for a quality electronic device 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have only had this electronic device for about one week, and have already had problems with the power supply. I have found the correct voltage and am in the process of trying to get the power converter to work correctly. I am not worried about my purchase, though, as this device has exceeded all my expectations for ease of use, and it has only cost me around $50, including shipping. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little speaker. I can easily set it up to get a high quality sound signal out to my television. The only problem I have is the speaker is too small to properly position it to the wall. The size of the speaker should be able to fit. If I don't get a better sound signal, I can move the speaker to the other side of the wall for better placement. This speaker is great for a child's bedroom, my wife's room, or even a spare bedroom in a living room.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Works great. I also purchased a second unit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a hard time ordering it, because it was out of stock and didn't seem to be sold at all at the online store. It was in stock, at my local store, and I went in to get it. My order was shipped on time, and it was exactly what I ordered. It works great for my needs, and has great value. The only complaint I have is with the cable, they used to come in several different lengths, but they are all the same. I was sent 3 cables. One, two, three. The ones I ordered are just three, and the one I ordered was the one that had the longest cable. It is the longest, and that is the one you should order. The short ones will be too short, and don't fit your needs well. This will be a definite plus if you're looking to use your TV for streaming. I have used it multiple times, and no problems at all. I highly recommend this cable to anyone looking to increase the bandwidth of their TV. It looks like a solid cable and you will be amazed at the size of your screen when it is plugged into the wall.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was surprised to find that I would be able to use my CD-RW drive in the laptop. I would never have thought I would see that feature in my daily use. My biggest disappointment was the lack of a wireless card. The wireless card was in the package for free, so I opted for the one provided. The card worked just fine, and the laptop performed as expected. I have yet to use the laptop on a wireless network, but I'm sure that once it is, it will be as good as any laptop I've ever owned. Overall, the CD-ROM drives in the computer worked just like I expected, and everything else worked just as I wanted. There's nothing wrong with the laptop as it is; it just lacked the feature that I was hoping for.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It has not stopped working after 12 months. I bought it because it was on sale, but this is the only thing it does. If you want a remote for your TV, this is not it. If your TV is on a low resolution, this works great, but not the high resolution you will need. If this is your main device, I recommend you get a DVR for that.This unit has not lost any capability, and you do not lose features when you upgrade to a bigger model.You have to upgrade from the original unit to the newer model, but the new models have a new remote.The picture is not the best I've seen, but it's very good for the price.It is very easy to use, and works well,

But you may need to add an extension cable to reach the remote, but you get what you pay for. You cannot expect much with these price points.

I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.

They look great on my desk and they sound great as well. These speakers are very nice quality. And, for only $50 they come with a few accessories, which are pretty cool. I love the black and silver color scheme, as well as the different options in the box. I also had an extra pair of speakers on order, so I got these as a gift for my brother who got them for himself. These are all very affordable, so you can't go wrong with these speakers! I am definitely looking to buy more in the near future!"

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a good device, but it's so much easier to use on an  LCD touch screen, and you don't have to use a mouse.  I've been using it for awhile and have had zero problems with the display, even in extreme sunlight.  The LCD screens last a long time, and it's a little tricky to put the screen down once in use, but once you figure it out, you'll be glad   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Used it with an HP TouchPad 5X and the screen was great. Not only was it easy to use, but it was very responsive. The tablet has a great weight and size. The only reason I gave it a negative review is that it doesn't come with any kind of case. It is a nice looking tablet, but not sure it is as comfortable as the larger, more expensive HP tablets. I would recommend it to anyone who uses an HP tablet or a very large desktop PC. It has great battery life as well. It works very well with Windows 7 as well

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used the Zune device for a number of years. I found out about the new Zune HD model and decided to wait until I could get ahold of one to see if it was any better. I am pleased to say that,  it is  even better! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received the product in two days. It arrived in a nice box. The packaging was not sealed properly. The product worked great, but some people said that they had to change some settings on the computer. I didn't have to do this.  I used this to play 4k movies from DVD

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The headphones seem to be of a good quality. I do have to say I haven't used these headphones for very long. I have my own set of stereo headphones and they're fine. I still use my iPod to listen to music with them on. They are also extremely comfortable to wear. They stay in place very well. If you're in the market for new headphones, look no further. These are the ones. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm glad it comes with some extra batteries so I can take a longer time with it.  I've owned several high-end audio products over the years, including the HD650 and Sennheiser HD650.  This product stands out for its high quality sound reproduction, as well as its price.  And with the two-year warranty, it's affordable for most people

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Bought it in the store and it was good quality, with all the functions I needed.

It has been working great since I installed it and it is great for my workstation. I like how easy it is to use.The software is easy to install.The sound card is a nice upgrade. The card allows you to choose from a selection of different sound card and input formats.I also like the fact that the card is wireless.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this speakers from Amazon and they are excellent for the money. These speakers sound great and seem to be made very well. I also have a couple of the high performance speakers I purchased from Amazon as well and they have also worked great. The speakers sound fantastic and are a great value for the amount of sound they produce. The only negative review is that Amazon's website doesn't allow you to upload audio files, but I have found other sites that allow this.

The case is very well constructed and seems very durable.  It is very easy to install as well.   I would recommend this product to anyone who has computer problems. It does all the hard work for you.  If you like the idea of a very slim case and no cables, this is it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm on my second set, and both my wife and I agree it's a great way to record live performances. I can also add a picture of the performance, and I've even had a good recording of an Elvis concert. I also like the ability to play back my digital files, which is pretty cool. I've ordered another set soon for Christmas presents. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I installed it today and it worked perfectly, fast, and stable.  I had to reinstall my drivers because it didn't install my driver.  Also, the CD has a lot of space and you don't have to worry about running out of space for your photos.  The software is easy to use.  It has tons of presets to help you make your photo editing more efficient, but also allows you to adjust the amount of black in the photo to make it match the background color.  You can also change the exposure for a more natural look, and adjust the contrast with a slider to make the image pop even more.  This is a great camera for photos and videos, as well as snapshots.  If you are looking for an affordable camera that works well, this is it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The device itself works great. I like the idea of making the wireless receiver into a stereo with the ability to connect via a cable to the stereo receiver. The unit fits into the stereo as if it was part of the system. It is very easy to set up. The only drawback I see is that the unit is not very light, but it is easy to lift, so I do not mind. It does come with a small remote control, but I did not have this when I purchased. I have also bought the IR receiver, and I believe it is more powerful, and comes with a remote as well. The remote is pretty expensive though, so if you can afford it, I would recommend it over the IR. I would also recommend that you purchase the remote for the IR only if you plan to have the IR in every room. I am thinking of adding a second remote to use for the system, for my wife and myself.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had read good reviews about this product but the review that caught my eye was the one by  Kudos.  I decided to buy two of these for my new computer system.  For the price they are pretty good for what you get.  The sound quality and performance was superb.  It was easy to install and I never had any problems.  These seem to be manufactured well.   My only issue with the product is the memory.  In my opinion it was a bit too cheap.  However the sound quality was great.  Very very quiet when the system was running and I had no problem with any noise while I was using the system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am an extremely positive person when it comes to electronic devices, however, I have always felt that the N.A.L. is too small for me. So I was excited to see this adapter when I got it. I am able to use my PS3 controller with the N1 and N3. I have not found a problem at all with these adapters. I use them primarily in the car, and it works just as well. I will continue to use them, but I won't buy them as often. I like these adapters, but they won't be my last adapter

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this item for my wife, and she was thrilled when it arrived. No, it doesn't look as sexy as some of her clothes, but it was a good investment and it worked as expected.The only thing that she had problems with was using it for audio only, and it was tough getting the speaker to stay on the edge of the table.  I gave up on that idea when she said it wasn't working.  When we used it for video, she loved it and it stayed put, but there was no audio on the TV.  After reading the manual, I realized that the speaker didn't go all the way back to the edge, so I added the 4" adapter for audio and it is now working for both audio and video.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This monitor is great, it has a fast refresh rate, and has very accurate color. I used this monitor for some casual gaming, and I'm very pleased with the performance. I wish that there was a higher screen resolution available for gaming. However, the high resolution is very useful when creating 3D pictures, and it helps with image editing and CAD/CAM work. The monitor has a great picture quality, and no problems with color shifting or blurring. The picture quality is very good when playing video games, and you can even view the monitor from a distance with the included stand.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   These sound excellent for small rooms.  I use them in my room, my wife and I have great listening experiences with them.  If you have a large room then these are great, if you don't want to use a subwoofer or are having trouble keeping the bass at the right level then these will probably not do for you.  These can get pretty loud, but I like them for the bass, not for the high end.  The best way to control these would probably be to keep the volume on a low level, not to keep them on a high level all the time, just to balance things out. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using it a lot more since I got it. I have seen my kids use it and it is working fine for them.

The connector is made of high quality plastic and comes with a velcro backing, so you can use it over and over again. This product is a good buy, it's very slim, light and it will easily fit into your bag.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the very best sound card I have ever had on my computer. It has great sound and the sound works out of the box with windows 7.  It even works with my Mac Pro and Windows 8.1.  I have even taken my desktop to a friend's house and had him try it out.  He said it sounded great, even without a volume control.  This card sounds great even if you have only a small laptop.  The only thing I didn't like about the card is that it's not compatible with ATI cards. I tried to figure out a way to install a third card with no success.  If you don't mind using a PCI Express card, this is the way to go 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased these for a friend who is in his first year of college. He needs a lot of storage space on his hard drive and he does not have this kind of computer. The price for the 10GB model was a little steep and I wanted to buy several of these for my friends. These have become a great addition to our IT network and have served well so far. We just ordered 5 more and I will be ordering more soon 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Love these headphones! I've had them for several months now. I'm able to enjoy music and movies and everything that I can possibly imagine on them. I bought this pair as I was looking for a pair of really good headphones for listening to podcasts. The bass is just right, the sound stage is very wide and deep and the sound reproduction is very well controlled.  I don't use the subwoofer for my headphones, but I do use it for my computer desk, which is the only reason I'm not giving these 5 stars.  My main headphones are my JBL's and they sound great with these headphones, though, the bass is so deep and well controlled that I usually don't need subwoofers.  The only time I use subwoosters is for listening and playing music.  These headphones are truly amazing!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Bought this speaker and it works great. It is also compact, light, quiet, and easy to set up and use. I will be ordering another one soon. The sound quality is very good for the price and the bass is very realistic, but not overpowering. It can be used on any speaker system with reasonable bass, such as in the home theater, at work, etc. The amp quality is excellent as well. The only down fall is that it is very loud. The speakers sound great in my living room but the sound is very high and the volume needs to be lowered for the volume of the sound system to be comfortable to listen to. If you have small to medium rooms, this speaker is perfect for you. Great sound for the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This has replaced my older printer. I was pleased with the print quality and the print speed of the HP HPE-2400. I used the PrintSpeed software to do the color correction, and PrintSpeed Premium added the 3D effect for better visibility. This printer is very fast, and the software included gives you the ability to print directly from a digital camera. It is extremely easy to use, the software works smoothly, and I did not have any problems. The HPE printer comes with one year warranty. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great little product, but needs a little bit more to cover all of your needs. I have three sets of cables that I could easily have this set of cords in all three of my windows with the monitor/ TV/CD. The one cable is too short to reach the back of the computer, the two others were just right for the front, the three still need to be connected to eachother, but if you don't want to go that far it's great for your needs

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very good audio, very easy to set up and maintain.  I did not have any problems with the sound quality with either my Dell or Sony audio devices, even when connecting to the internal soundcard.  If you like to use your speakers or use them to amplify the sound, this is a great product for that.  A couple of things I would recommend:  1. Be sure you have a good TV with good sound.  My Sony is good, but my Dell doesn't even come close to that.   2. The power cord is a bit long, but I get that. It's fine, but it doesn't hurt anything 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a few of these, but they are in great shape. The only bad thing is that they do not come with the batteries, but that is not too bad. I use these on my TV for remote controls. This is great for me because it has a great color contrast. I highly recommend these for anyone who wants an accurate color display. I would recommend these to anyone who would like to use them for their TV.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As someone who's on the hunt for a USB drive for my new computer, I was very pleased with the fact that it came with it's own case. I was also pleased that it was relatively small (5.5 x 2.5 inches) and was very light 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like the fact that this is not a clunky case, it's designed for both a notebook and a tablet.  The only downside is that I don't think it has enough slots for both my notebook and my laptop.   The two slots on the side are great for notebook, but the slots on top of the case do not work well with a notebook.  But if I can't use it for laptop I'm happy 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The speakers are great, I have them in my bedroom and they sound very well. I use them with my TV and have great results with the speakers. The system also has great clarity. The picture looks very good and the TV is very bright. I love it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm a little hesitant about using a TV as the display for a computer, but that's my preference. As a result, I was very pleased with the results. I have a 4K screen, and the image displayed is beautiful. The colors are excellent. The contrast is just right, and it's super fast. I had no trouble connecting to my Windows machines from any source other than my laptop. This is an excellent system, and one that I will continue to use for many years to come.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a  Toshiba Satellite S700.  For $30.00 the Toshiba will allow you to do a lot of different things.  It comes with an audio modem to connect with a good sound device.  Tosquois will provide the Internet connection.  The only reason that I did not recommend this device was because of the cost.  However, if you have the funds and don't mind the inconvenience of ordering a router, you will do fine with the Tosquoi.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a computer repair shop, we buy as much of the Apple products as we can.  This is a wonderful machine, and the speakers and keyboard are very nice.   There's a lot of choice of storage solutions, and there are various Apple software packages to get you started.  The machine is very quiet, and fits nicely in my small office.  It can even be mounted in a desk drawer, or hung on a wall.  If you're looking for a great audio and video machine, this is it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I would say it was a good buy, and was exactly what I expected.  It has worked very well and is easy to put into position.  I am only giving it 4 stars because the wire is not as easily available as it should be.  For a more permanent solution, I would highly recommend some sort of adhesive to attach the wires to the unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I can't comment on the performance since I am still in use. If you have high end components that need more juice than the unit is rated for, it can handle those loads. However, if you are just replacing the old unit, I would suggest adding more power than the specs suggest. The old unit's only output rated at about 150 watts. But you could be running it up to 550 watts. If the output rating is not enough, just hook up a 120 volt outlet. The only down side with the new unit is that it is about the same price as the old one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It works just as described. If your home theatre has lots of cables, and has lots to carry, then buy this. For us, we have 2,3 outlets, but we usually only need one. So if you only have one, and you need to carry cables, then this is the right choice for you.I haven't tried to install it yet, but I don't know if I would. It works perfectly. I do have one question, which is: do you need a small screwdriver, or a set of pliers, to fit the wires in the back? I don´t know, but for now, I´m using a small set of scissors.I was hoping to get this at Radio Shack in the next days, but it may be some weeks yet.

They are very versatile, and can be used as a high power battery in many applications. I haven't found any problem with them so far, either in performance or cost. I find them to be of very high quality. The pack is very tight and the cell is very durable. The cells are small, yet the weight is very high.

The unit is very easy to connect to the internet via wireless, and very easy (and inexpensive) to connect it to my TV via HDMI. The only thing I would like to see in the future is a slightly longer, slightly thicker, slightly lighter model to better accommodate bigger and heavier laptops and desktops.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used the MCD-G3 in my home theater system for almost 4 years. It has been an excellent device for audio reproduction. The only issue I have had is that if I do a clean install on the same PC, the MMC drive starts to slow down. This is a great device for sound reproduction, however, if you clean install a PC, I recommend the MSCD-G2 to eliminate the slow down from the MHC drive. The MSCDs have a built in SSD for quick data storage

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking for a good set of headphones for some time now and this one is definitely a great choice for the money. The build quality is great. The foam cushion is a definite plus as I don't often find foam cushions on other headphones. The cables are also of great quality. However, I did run into a few problems in my experience with the ear cups. I ran out of foam (that's not a big deal, just buy more and you'll get more) and found the tips getting worn out fast. I solved this by adding a little more foam, but I did have to replace the foam tip with the same one I already had so that the tips wouldn't rub on the cups. That's not the end of the world, but it's something you'd have to watch out for in order to get the best possible sound quality from these headphones. I also had some problems with the volume control not working for some reason. The problem is pretty obvious on the first pair of headphones, but the fix is pretty simple once you find it and get it to work. The headphone is really nice looking and comfortable, and if you're looking for something affordable to listen to, this is a good option

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The price is good for the unit but the sound and sensitivity are not.  The sensitivity is also quite low.  You may be able to get more out of the unit.   However, with this set-up, I'm satisfied with the sound.  It may not be the best set- up for people who prefer to have more flexibility

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I don't like using the same brand for every electronic device.  So, I thought I would give this firmware update a try.  It worked fine for me, and it sounds to be pretty good for all of us in the PC/laptop world 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The price is reasonable, it does what it says it does. The unit has a very high volume and it sounds great. I like that the volume can be adjusted for more of a bass or a little bit of a treble boost. I have used it in the studio for a couple of months and am very happy.I would recommend this product to a new electronic device owner

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this monitor with a monitor stand.  I was so pleased with the monitor, and my work environment, that I was able to purchase more displays without having to add another monitor stand!  I had to install the stand to attach it to my computer, but was not overly concerned about it.  The monitor looks great, and has great images.  It is easy to use and looks very good.  Great monitor

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Works very well, especially if you have a very weak reception. I have it mounted in a wall and it worked perfectly with my wife's antenna as well. If I had it in the attic, I would have had to use a long coax for the roof. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound was loud but not overpowering.  I did have to cut the cable down to 3 ft. but this did not interfere with playing the music. The monitor is also bright enough for the room.  Overall this is an excellent product for a good price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a newbie on this. I did read reviews about bad connection and I got a good one. I wanted a great sound from my CD player so I bought the 4x7 adapter and it worked fine. Now I have the soundcard installed in my laptop and the 4 x7 adapter has disappeared. I searched every website online and this one came up the most. I thought that I have a bad connection to my home network and that's why I can't get it to work. It seems to work fine on my wireless network. The soundcard is a little heavy but works fine. I'm very pleased with this product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this unit about two years ago to replace my VHS recorder. It has been working great since.  I did run into a problem a few weeks ago. I was unable to get it to record audio with the video input. It was about to go on vacation so I contacted my dealer to see if I could purchase a replacement part. My replacement part came in a few days later and I am very pleased with the overall performance of this recorder. I also think that the sound quality is excellent.  Overall I'm very pleased and have recommended it to friends 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was surprised at how well this worked, and I love the way that I can control my stereo. However, I didn't think I would get the same kind of audio from my other speakers in my kitchen. But, after a few weeks of using this with my stereo, the volume was a perfect level. Then, as soon as I was home and was able to move my speakers around, it's volume became perfect. I would recommend this product, as a great price, but it is still a bit difficult to get used to using it, which is why I bought my two more speakers in the next order. But once you get used, it is a great product for your stereo, and is very easy to use and understand.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this  on my PC for a couple of years now and it's great for sharing a USB device across multiple computers with a printer.  I've had a couple people asking if they could buy this product directly from  me 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was skeptical about buying this printer until I received it. I thought the plastic would scratch up the printer's cover or something, but it works great. The printer prints so beautifully that it almost looks like it is a photo. It is well worth the money and I think this is the best value printer on the market. I will be ordering another one this year 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I haven't been able to connect my TV to my PC using the provided adapter. This one came in handy and works great!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I installed it with little problem. No problems installing on newer computer. I did not find any problem with the soundcard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The speaker sounds great, the volume is perfect, and the overall sound quality is excellent.  The remote works great too, and has an extra feature that is especially great for live shows: the music changes dynamically.  So if you play the same song for an hour and 30 minutes, then the music will change in real time.  This is a very cool feature, and it makes a perfect live setup for any DJ.  It makes the DJ feel like he is right in the middle of the dancefloor, and that's exactly what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a great, quality electronic device, this is the one to get

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had the radio for a few years now.  When I started, I was only using it for in and out of town travel.  However, I recently took my travel plans to Florida, and am still enjoying the benefits of the station.  The only drawback is that the station is available only in the 50MHz band, but I can always buy more channels on eBay.  I would give the radio a solid 4 stars if I didn't feel it has a high distortion of audio due to the antenna.  A better solution would be to find a good antenna in the area, or use one with a more efficient mounting system.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this antenna, and I would purchase a second one if I needed additional bands for my travel.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The product is exactly as described. Easy to use and easy to set up. Installation was easy with no problems.  I am a beginner so I am still getting used to the interface but I have been very pleased so far.  The price is also a good one.  Great product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the case. It holds all my electronics, a portable hard disk drive, 2 external hard drives, and all my DVD's.

I have mine in my garage and it has lasted quite a while. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Works exactly as I had hoped, and will only be used for those rare occasions where I want to listen to music in my house without being able to hear the speakerphone. The speakerphone works great as long as you're not using it in a quiet environment. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 for its functionality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As with all electronic devices, this is for a limited time. They have already gone on sale, so if you want this you should get one now. You just need to wait until they are in stock again (I got mine right before the end of their sale)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've tried several different USB 3.0 thumb drives and this one has had the best performance so far. It doesn't feel too bulky but is still quite easy to set up. The drive is durable, and I've had no problem with the drive spinning down on me, it is just as smooth as it is with the external drive I use. I'm not using a lot of media on my laptop, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but so far, I've been very pleased 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It works for me and I use my iPod and the iPhone, all three connected. I have the CD player, so I'm always looking for that extra storage capacity, especially on the road. This is just one way to get that storage, but I recommend using the included card reader to keep a separate copy on the main CD-R. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered these headphones on Amazon, and they fit perfectly. No worries about headphones being too big.

They are great and have been since the early 90s 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great, inexpensive tool.  I got it for my wife's birthday, and it was easy to assemble.  The instructions are clear, and the product is very sturdy.  It also comes with all the necessary parts, so you only need to bring the case with you.  My only complaint about it is that it only comes with one of the larger case screws.  But it's a great way to store all of your electronic gear, and all the accessories.

I was initially concerned about the large volume being put on it but it does not effect the quality of the music, the sound is excellent and the high-quality CD players I have in my car are also loud. I recommend this product to anyone who is concerned about their music being overplayed. I haven't found any problems with any other audio device I have and I am still playing a lot of music without an external amplifier. I am getting about 70 hours per month from it.

Best Buy has a great price and it's easy to return for a replacement if you have a problem with it, just contact customer service for instructions.I recommend this mouse for every Windows user to try.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had this monitor for about a month and it works great on all my monitors. I haven't had it too long, but it is clear to me that the LCD panel and pixels are the key parts of the monitor.  It doesn't matter if I have an older monitor, it is just clear that the resolution and screen size is the key.  The resolution of 2560 x 1440 is the same on both the older and new monitors.  I can have different resolutions on my computer in Windows, but with the same resolution on this monitor. I know this monitor is not for everyone, but for me it is the best value for money

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using this device for many months and I'm pleased with it. I do have to be very careful with my wiring, because I do not have many outlets, and I do use all the electronic devices with the lights in the room.I don't have to do any work to get the lights on and off, and they stay on if I turn on and on the lights for some time.I have to take into account the light bulbs are the same size as the electronic device, so I put the lights just inside the electronic box.It allows me to put the electronic boxes just about anywhere.It is very easy to put and take out of the box.If I have a lot of electronic equipment in my room, I do tend to just lay them down right next to the box, and that's my choice.It works fine for me, and it's not heavy.I use it a lot at the house too.I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase, and the lights are very bright.The electronic device has a good sound and the buttons work very well, but the lights seem brighter, because they are so close together.They're very easy for me to work with, so it's a nice little device that I feel like I use all of the time, and there's no other device that's as nice as this one.I recommend that you buy this light, if you are looking for something that's nice to hang over the bed, or you do not want to have to pull a light out of your wall to light your room up.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device is easy to install and works great. This is the only one of these I've tried that I haven't had any problems. Great price and fast shipping, the only problem is you have to choose the right size to fit the room. The table is in the middle of the room and I would recommend you go with a smaller one. But, if you are going to be in this room all the time, it works just fine.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was the cheapest way to hook up my DVD player to my HDTV. I don't like the HD-C DVD players, and the video quality was not bad compared to the others in the HDTV family. The only reason I didn't buy another one was because I wanted a different remote control (my wife prefers the one with the joystick at the bottom of the TV). But the remote control worked fine for the rest of the room.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's amazing how much light this lamp brings into your room. Great for both dining and lounging out on a deck.

The lamp can turn to a semi-transparent or full transparent mode depending on the level of sunlight.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm a small electronic guy, and I've had this unit for a couple of years.  It works great for my needs, and it's reasonably priced.  I have mine wired to a PC (using a dual RJ-45 card, since it has only a 1/8" input, but it still works), and wired to my computer via a PCI card (not the one in the picture).  That allows me to monitor any computer or network (including my own) in the house, or connect it to another device via Ethernet.  As a side note, this unit has a built-in screen reader, which has worked very well for me

I recommend this monitor to any owner of a computer/monitor. It is not that heavy, and it is very easy to mount. I love it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a scanner or scanner-related needs. If you need to scan several pages of the same document multiple times in a row, it may be a better choice to go with a more traditional scanner device like the Epson scanner. I find the included storage cards to be useful as well, even with the included scan software. The included cardholders can also accommodate a small assortment of card storage, like one of those disposable cards you see at the grocery store.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got it as a birthday present for my wife, and she loves it!  If she's up for it, I've seen some video's on youtube of her with the TV on, and I have to agree.  I don't know how she got her TV to work with the box, but I've never seen anything like it.  As far as TV remotes go, I have mine on the wall near the TV, and it's always working when we're home.  She's never had to worry about turning it off when I'm not home, or my family is away, so it works really well with our small household.  It's easy to set up, and works perfectly with any device or app, and that includes XBMC, Kodi, Windows Media Center, VLC, etc.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is the plastic case that came with it. It's not really a big deal for me, as I'm a firm believer in giving anything I buy something that's durable, but for my daughter, it makes the TV stand a little stiff. I'm sure she'll grow out of it, but it's the type of thing I'd really like to see more companies put into their products to make them stand out.  All in all, the price was excellent, it worked exactly as it should, and is a great way to put a nice picture in the living room with the big screen.  If you have any question, just ask.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The screen is not so good, but I got this for the price anyway. For those of you with smaller screens, this is definitely a good screen. I'm getting this to monitor the internet from the office at work. So far I have not had to adjust the screen for different resolutions, and I haven't had any problems with the screen.  I'd recommend this monitor to anybody who wants an electronic device that is very durable and will not give up on you 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this case with a few of my other cases. I do have one complaint. The front pocket is too short and the back pocket is way too big. I had to buy another case to make it work. But this case is more than adequate for most people 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was a little skeptical about buying this item, but I've been using it for over a month now and it's been working great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The audio is very clear for the price.  The built in mic does exactly what it is supposed to do.  My only con is that it doesn't work with a good wireless device.  I am currently testing a Zune, but I suspect this may change in the future

I've also tried the DHCPSR keyboard, and it's a little bit too big for my taste. However, I really like the fact that I can put the keyboard on the table and see where I'm going to place it. You can't do that with the DFC.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using this for several years. It's small and doesn't take up a lot of space. The built in antenna works fine for reception in my house. I'm using this receiver with my Tivona T1 and the results have been very good. I've only had one problem which was a very short transmission of signal. I was lucky and didn't get disconnected during the transmission. I didn't hear the receiver, only the receiver's response to the signal. If you are looking for a receiver that is small, durable, reliable and doesn;t take up much room, then this is the one 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received the monitor for Christmas, and it is very light, so not overly cumbersome. The screen is extremely bright for the size of the monitor, and the design is really simple and elegant. It is the best monitor I've seen. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that it does not come with a stand, which makes it even more difficult to use it comfortably for extended periods of time. I would absolutely recommend this monitor for anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As far as I can tell from reviews, this is the best way to connect your computer to a television set. If you don't have a video system that supports the HDMI, you can hook up the monitor to the computer using this method. Also, if you use a computer that has built-in network card, you don\'t need to hook up a separate network adapter for the TV. The whole system looks great, especially if you have the extra room in your entertainment center to set it up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had the same problem with some other brands and finally settled for the Canon one.

I wanted a bigger screen and the HD-PVR made it easy to go for bigger viewing distance.  This little device allows me to get more screen real estate and has done well for me so far.

The fit is very snug, even when you turn it all the way up.  It's a very high quality device.  No complaints, but it was the first electronic device I ever had that fit the same, and I've had dozens of similar items over the years.  I'm not sure if there's any particular reason for this, but the fit of the battery is excellent, and it's really nice that the battery doesn't spill out on the top of the unit.  Definitely recommend for any high volume use

You can easily connect via Ethernet or USB, either way it's a quick and easy setup.  I've had no problems with the software and the controller in my network or when connecting to multiple systems.  While it is very easy to set up, it does take some time to get used to it.  There are tons of great videos on the web about setting up and troubleshooting.

Once you've downloaded and installed the program, you can simply start it by clicking on a button on the display screen. There is plenty of documentation online on how to use the device and the software to help you out. This little box is the most powerful and best little computer I have ever used

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I would highly recommend it to anyone who is on the fence about purchasing a Sony product for the first time. I used it at first as my primary soundcard but when I needed to upgrade to a new system, I went for the XDCAM-3000. Since that upgrade, Sony has improved the product and now it's a perfect fit for my home network. I recommend it for those who have the budget and want a solid connection to their entertainment and the audio and video files of their movies or shows. If you're ready for Sony's best and most reliable soundcard in the world, this is the one to go with

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the second set of two I've had. The first one lasted more than two years. I have to say this is the only set I've ever seen for $500 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used this device for several months now, and I'm very pleased with the performance and the great sound. I do have one complaint, however. The volume on my computer is very low, and if I'm running it while listening to music, I need to set the volume up to a much higher level to get it to work with the surround sound. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have tried it with a Sony ZX-10 and a Canon EOS 1D. I am 5'10" and weigh around 250 lbs. I don't know why it's difficult for me to use with those lenses but, I'm used to manual focus and the viewfinder is excellent. I like to shoot medium format and can see the whole frame with this lens. The only thing I haven't yet tried is the Zeiss Touit 5x50 at 50mm, but I'll probably pick up the camera anyway to try out the 50mm equivalent. I think the 4x50 would be good, maybe the 4.5x50

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my second Sony electronic device from Sony. The first unit was Sony Playstation CD, but when I upgraded to a PC, it was Sony Playstation Portable. I was very happy with the PSP for years, but it seems that Sony has gone into some weird production problems lately. I bought this unit as I am looking for a portable device that can be easily transported on my airline ticket. I love the PS Vita, but I don't want to take it with me and that was what I was looking for 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered this product about a month ago, and was a little disappointed with the quality of the unit. I ordered a second one a few days later, and it was exactly the same as the first unit

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have two, one to store my MP3 music, and one to hold my portable DVD player. I like the idea of having a backup drive on a separate machine.  I am using it to store the movies I am playing, and a few movies I'm planning to watch in the near future.  The machine has performed flawlessly so far, it has never failed me at the computer, it's pretty nice and easy to set up.  It is very easy to see in the BIOS on the back, it is very intuitive to use

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Bought this with great anticipation. I don't think I would buy any other monitor with less than 10 hours of battery life. I have 4 monitors (2 of them in front of my TV) and each one lasts about 4 hours (this monitor goes on and off several times during the night).  This monitor does not have the annoying flicker when the TV is on so you get great picture quality while it's on.  It works great with my Sony TV, is super easy to set up, and very easy to use.  This is my 2nd monitor I've purchased from HP 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great device for capturing sound from audio systems in public places. The product is very easy to install and works great with my Sony CD players. It captures very clearly, and works very well with both HD and non HD video. I use this with my Canon 5D Mark III, and it works great.The only negative I have is that the sound doesn't sound as good as it looks.The sound isn't all that bad, but it's definitely a downgrade. But, that's just my experience. I'd recommend buying one and testing it out for yourself. I haven't experienced any problems with it yet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the product.  The box is nice and sturdy.  Everything fits and stays in place.  It comes with all the necessary cables and I've had no problems with installation.  I also bought two of them because of the large number of outlets in my house. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The quality is excellent. I did not have any problems and the sound quality is clear and loud.I had a bad one of these in the past, but it was just too much noise for me to listen to, but that could be due to the different cables I have or something. I've had no problems with this model yet, so I would recommend this to anyone. It's great for a small laptop like mine. I do have to buy the cables separately to have the right ones, but I can just connect to the TV and use one of those as a splitter.The price is a bit higher than I expected, but since I have this at the office for my work computer, I don't even think about that anymore. I don\'t mind paying more because the quality is good enough to take care of me in any situation.I will get a couple of these for my friends and then we\'ll buy all the stuff I can buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality on this device is very good.  The only downfall is that the speakers come out in the earphone when you put it in the player.  But, if you know how to use them, you could use them in stereo without the speakers coming out.  Very good product

However, the cables included with the Case were way to thick

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really love the simplicity of this device. The case is sturdy and the cables are thick.  All the wires are easily accessible and the connection between devices is easy.  I have only had this for a couple of weeks and it has already replaced the old Sony PS4 that I had.  The screen quality is very clear and crisp.  It looks great on the HDTV.  You will notice a minor difference in picture quality with the older Sony PS3's.  However, the difference is hardly noticeable.  Also, you will notice that the colors have a bit more depth.  There are some minor downsides to this product:  - the HDMI cable is somewhat stiff   - it takes a while to get through your TV's set-top box 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is a very light duty adapter.  It works very well and will not crack or sag.  I would recommend this product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I wanted to keep a good image of my computer (and its components) on my LCD monitor. With the USB version, it's very easy to move the image from the monitor to the computer. Also, it is very easy (with a simple PC keyboard and mouse) to remove the USB drive and then transfer the image to the monitor. The only downside I can think of is that I have to move a diskette onto the PC to use the image on the monitor -- not easy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the sound of this thing. I have it with my Sony receiver and the sound is clear and clean. I've set up my Sony system to play from the system itself via the internal speakers, which is the way I set it up originally, but if I don't do it the way Sony expects, the receiver isn't working and I'm trying to figure out why. I didn't do anything to the system other than buy the player and play one channel on it.  I'm not a pro audio person, but I think if I put the receiver back into its usual position, it's going to be fine.  If you want a good speaker system for the money, this is a good one

There is also a remote for my Apple tv that enables me to control it through the TV and it even has remote control support via HDMI.  The remote is very convenient to use, easy to configure and it works very well.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to watch a Blu Ray on their TV.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Just like with other reviewers, I found the switch works very well, with very little movement from the switch. I found no problems with any switch that I had tried. I am very pleased with the price, and the ease of use that I received with it. The only downside is that the case does not have any ports available, and you have to buy a mini switch to plug in your USB drives, which is a little bit annoying. So, I am definitely purchasing another for future trips, and I hope that a few other users have the same experience

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the case from Amazon for about $10 after having been through many different ones before purchasing this one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered two and I ordered the red one also. I like the red color the best but the red is more orange-ish, I think.  I like my speakers in color too, but I have to keep them away from my television in case the TV turns on. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It worked as I expected it to. I had to try it in my house where there is high humidity and it was difficult to connect. If I can manage the humidity in my home I would suggest using the case in the office, if your home is much more humid try it outside. There is a good description about the way it works in the manual: I'm not sure I would be comfortable with it on my desk or anywhere near the computer though.The best case is the computer tray which I bought off of eBay and then got the cases for free.I recommend having it on the front of the computer case. I did not buy the case separately, instead I took it and placed it in the case with the cases on top.I do recommend using a cable to keep the cases off of the side panels.It also fits perfectly into the computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the second electronic device I've purchased from Home Depot, and I'm very pleased with the electronic device that I received. The first electronic device was a defective hard drive. However, Home Depot replaced it with a second unit that I was more than satisfied with. The electronic device arrived in the very first day after I ordered it. I was very impressed with the speed and the electronic product I received for the price I paid. I will definitely recommend this electronic device to all who need to transfer files or store them electronically. This electronic device makes file transfer quick and easy for both individuals and businesses, no matter if the business needs to have a backup system, storage for important documents, and so on. I highly recommend Home Depot to anyone that has any electronic equipment or equipment that they need to store and transfer large files, pictures, video, and whatever. You'll be very pleased if you buy from Home Depo.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Bought the MSA for the sole purpose of playing DVD and Blu-ray movies.  Very fast. Great sound. Very stable.  I have a couple of other MSA's, but none compare to this one.  So if you're a casual video watcher, this is the best MSA available.  The only con, is that the memory is pretty full, so you will have to have enough memory on your computer to store all your disc movies.

It has a pretty high quality sound, which is not always the case with headphones, which are typically louder, and can be problematic for some people. If you are a basshead, I would recommend getting a pair of good headphones to have for different applications. However, if you are someone who is happy to listen to whatever type of music, this is a good deal! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very simple, easy to use and the cable is long enough for a single cable connection to one of the wall outlets. The unit doesn't fit into the small recess under the front panel, but you have to bend the top panel slightly to fit it. Overall a good unit, but not as good as other units from the other vendors. I have only received mine so far, but I'm thinking about getting another one, it's very inexpensive

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is very nice to buy if you want to save money on a computer you don't own. The CD-RW drive works really well with Microsoft's operating systems, and has worked very well with all of the other software I've tried. It has worked with Windows 95 and 2000 just fine. I've even heard it has worked perfectly with Windows NT 4.0. This gives you the ability to install Windows on any PC in your house, and it will work with the various types of CD-ROMs. As for the sound quality... I've found that it's really good. Some people will think that the sound is a little weak, but I would disagree. Most of the time the CD-Wav or CD-R work really well. When playing the audio files over the internet, I've heard the sound just fine, but the quality is not as good if you are listening to it through a good pair of headphones. In the end, you don.t have to buy a dedicated computer for playing back your MP3's. And if you have any problems with the CD's working, you can always download a CD-Rom from CD-Masters 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had this for several months, and the sound quality is awesome.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It has the power I needed for a long time. I'm getting to know some of the settings on the remote now and it's been helpful to be able to save some settings to a file so that I can quickly reorder things.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The cable works great and looks nice and modern, it's not a cable to be taken for granted, you will have to figure out the right angles with your camera to get the most out of the cable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I wanted a DVD player to be able to watch DVDs on the TV. I have had a variety of DVD players in my collection and had nothing but problems with the Panasonic's. The Samsung's were fine for my needs but the Panasonic always had problems. Now I have the HP Elite DVD-X500 and it is far better than the Panasonic

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this TV to use as a second TV in our dining room. We have a 2.2 set up and I needed some way to display the 2.0's on the same screen. It works great with both the picture and audio on full blast. I did notice that on a TV in the same room with us, it only displayed 2.1's on full beam. But it works perfectly with us in our smaller living room with the picture on half and half. It's extremely versatile. I recommend it for all the small TVs, especially in the living room and dining room, where they don't want to have a full TV screen. Also for a bedroom, it will work for that, too.The picture and sound are both on full at all times, which is very convenient

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Bought this unit for my 10" MacBook Pro. Very easy to install.  I was not able to locate a charger that would fit my system, so I ordered one from Apple. I don't know if it's because of the color of the system, or if I just didn't want the charger in the same spot as my other MacBooks. It's still a very nice system. I highly recommend this to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this as a spare monitor on my desktop. It's very comfortable to use. I've used it for years.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have owned two of these. I'm a very positive person about electronics and I have yet to have a bad purchase from a local electronic store. The only negative I can think of is that there are few ways to turn off the TV in the room. However, with the TV on there, you can see that the TV is actually on.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 that I have been using for years. It is the most reliable cell phone I've had. When my friends who are also on the S3 have been needing a new phone recently, this one was the first choice. It's easy to carry, has a great screen, and the camera is great. I do have to admit though that the battery is pretty expensive compared to others and the color is not great. The only negative I can think of is that there are some colors I want, and it's not available with the phone. I would definitely recommend the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Purchased this monitor in March 2013 and have only had it about two months. It's a great value for the money.

I do like the sound quality as it is similar to the high end sound cards from the past.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I wanted to find a way to watch the latest episode of the TV series Game of Thrones and on-line. The price was just right and I have to say, it works like it should.  The only drawback is that the video is not quite sharp enough to watch on a 50 inch TV.  But, you are only missing 10 percent of the screen space.  If you watch a lot of TV series, you will not have any problems with this device.  I highly recommend it

They make my music sound crystal clear. I would have given these speakers 5 stars if they would come in a smaller form factor. I also have the Alpine B652i's in my home studio and the Alpine CX 518's. So far I haven' had any problems with either of them.

I love the ability to watch my DVD's and live broadcasts, and the flexibility of adjusting the brightness with my remote. The screen has a comfortable wide view, and with the stand it makes the monitor stand easily.  The monitor has a handy back cover that can be used to shield the monitor from excessive sunlight.  My only complaint is that it does not come with any memory card readers, but it's easy enough to add your own with the provided adaptor.   Overall, I am pleased with the monitor. It's easily setup with the included instructions, and it works very well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Purchased the 6 pin cable from Home Depot to replace my old cable, it arrived in excellent shape and well packaged, I needed it to work. I was able to get it to install in about 20 minutes. I also had trouble installing it, the cable has to be attached directly, not attached with a splitter. I had trouble getting the two cables to fit properly. I will be contacting Apple to see if I can have them send me another cable to install this cable into my network, it should be no problem.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've owned and used many of these for over a year. It's a great device, and does exactly what I want for my audio system. It is quiet, and runs quiet. The cables don't slip, and you can use the included AC power adapter. You can hook it up to my stereo receiver, and it works great. The only issue I have is I have to hook up all of my cables one at a time, and I only have one of these in the house.  I don't have the money to buy another, so I just use it like a splitter. If you plan on buying any of these, make sure you buy the splitter, and then hook up the cables one by one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was a great purchase. I purchased it at my local electronics store and it was shipped quickly and professionally packaged. It is easy to set up. The only problem I had was it was not a standard hard disk drive. That was easy to correct by replacing the drive. I installed the software on my main system and this seemed to be working fine for my use. I have had very little problems with it. If you do not have the original disks on the system, you might not be able to install it. But this software is easy enough to set-up and install to a second system if needed. It was a good deal, and I am glad I bought it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been able to stream content from the computer to the television on my tv.  The service works flawlessly on both Mac and PC.  You can set the speed to stream only on your computer, while the computer streams the other content to your television.  It works with many of the channels and works with most of the video file formats.  There are many videos and shows available, including Netflix, HBO, Hulu, and Showtime.  For $10 a month, I believe it's one of the best value for your money

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this adapter for years and I use it with both Macs and PCs.  It seems to work just fine with either type of machine. The only problem I have is that Macs have a few more buttons than PCs. However, there is no way to change the direction of the sound, so I'm ok with that. If there is a way to do a Mac version of this adapter, I would buy that.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been happy with my Sony XBR-X1000c (I own a X100T) for years.  I was hesitant about the fact that I have to have both an X and X100R to get the full 1080P support.  The X1000C gives me a little bit of extra room, so I only needed to buy the X100 to be able to play 1080P and 720P files.   But, the only difference I have noticed is that I only use my laptop to play high definition movies, but I don't want to bother with an external hard drive to hold them.  So, I am still happy with the Sony X1000c 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The speaker is fine but I wish there was a mute button too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have no problem installing the screen over the back of my laptop.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed to get a video from my camcorder but didn't want to use my cam's usb connector so decided to buy this one to avoid having to change the USB cable everytime I want to change.

I recommend this one 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The box and manuals are very well written and very easy to understand. The video is excellent, but the audio is lacking. If you want quality video, look elsewhere. However, the picture quality and color settings are good. The only thing that I would recommend is a remote to program the device, but I don't use the computer very much these days. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I like this sound card very much. It has low latencies and good sound quality. I only wish it had a larger interface. I have tested several drivers from a few different sources and it works fine. No problem with the drivers for Windows XP. It's the best sounding card I've ever heard in Windows XP using software from Creative Labs. So far it has worked flawlessly with Winamp, WinRar, and Media Player Classic. It supports almost all plug and play applications. There is only one problem with it, and it's the price. The card is quite expensive and I wish there were cheaper options out there. I'm not very interested in the more expensive stuff 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Excellent product with the right amount of connectors and the best fit I've had so far!  I don't use my camera a lot, but it's good enough to take photos of friends and family. I bought a second one for the tripod as well because I like how my first one looks.  All in all, it's the perfect product for what I need: portability, convenience, and versatility.  I'm impressed with how well everything worked with my Canon C300 and I'm sure it'll work just as well with my Hasselblad X.

If I'm not wrong I have a computer on my desk that does all of the media streaming from my Xbox, yet I can connect to my TV with this box and it works. I also have one on the ceiling, which I can use to connect to the TV. It has a HDMI cord on the back so you can hook up any TV. The price is a bit higher, but for the features it offers, it is the best value

The Logitech keyboard has a big key, it's easy to use with one hand, and it's pretty quiet and easy to type.I've used it for almost 6 months now. It's my primary keyboard.  I do love this keyboard, it fits the hand perfectly, it has the buttons you expect from a full sized keyboard and it has excellent ergonomic features.I don't feel that the key caps are that big, and the design is very comfortable.The key caps also have the ability to be removed to allow the keys to rest on the sides of the keys without touching them. The keys are very easy to press, easy to actuate and the keys respond very fast

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Works great. I only recommend this for large LCD monitors. If you plan on having the screen in a more horizontal position, I wouldn't recommend using this monitor. The screen is about a half inch shorter than my other LCD's. The image was quite clear on my TV, but it seemed like the image was too bright on my LCD's

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I did not have any problems with my Sony unit. The picture looked better than I thought it would, and my video quality was amazing, even for 4K.  I have only been able to watch videos from Youtube and YouTube for the last two days, and the picture quality is still amazing, just way more pixelated.  For a price like that, there is nothing better

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   These are great little speakers, but not a good deal for the money. I ordered a pair of 2,3, and 4 speakers, hoping that they would make my home theater sound much better. The 2 pair are fine, and they look great too. The 4 pair are less great, but look great and feel good to hold. The sound from them is a bit grainy compared to what I heard at other retailers. The speakers are also not as accurate as I would have liked, but this is only a minor quibble. I will be buying some more to try and improve my music listening. These will be added to my "collection" soon enough.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very good quality product, easy to install, easy for a DIY-er to do. If you don't have a PC case laying around, you can get a cardboard version, or cut a piece out of foam-core if you wish. The only problem is the price, but it does come with some nice bonuses such as a usb hub, sound card, memory card, etc. So, I recommend that if you don' t have a case laying in the garage, you get one and cut it to your needs. Easy to mount. Very sturdy. It's good for any use that requires a USB device on a desktop, or any other device that might need to be moved around. Works very well with a wireless router. Great value

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have ordered 2 of these, one for my son and one for myself. I have a large amount of CDs, DVDs, and pictures that I need to protect for the next six months. These seem to hold up to the wear and tear very well and are still very easy to mount on a wall.I would recommend these if you are concerned about your kids or you just want a good, compact piece of video/sound gear to mount anywhere.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This product is really good for getting rid of that annoying sound from the television.  If you don't have a tv, buy one and set it up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very pleased with the sound quality of the Sennheiser HD-303. I have been listening to it with my CD player and headphones and I was really impressed with how it sounded on my stereo system. I also purchased two of them.I am planning to buy two more of them as they seem to be very durable.The only negative thing I have to say about the HD-305 is that they can be noisy if they are used over long periods of time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound from the subwoofer is great. The remote is easy to use and the volume adjustment is great for my needs.  The unit comes with a good case, the stand comes in handy if your speaker is on a floor.  I would recommend buying it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a lot of vintage electronic stuff in my house, but I'm not fond of vintage cables.  The old Sangean cables were great, but they have this weird shiny look to them.  This is the reason I ended up with this cable set.  I ordered it from Amazon, but Amazon was out of stock at one point.  However, I got it from eBay today and got it in a timely manner.   It's a great deal, even if you don't need to upgrade any electronics.  It seems to be very durable, too.  Just like the cable, you can customize it to your liking. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I would rate it a 4 out of 5 stars but the only negative review about it is that it's hard to get a good audio connection to your TV via the HDMI. I think that's the only reason why you buy it. I've been using the TV on the other side of my living room with a Soundbar. I was able to get both audio and video with this TV. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought 2 of these for my kids and have had no problems. They do not get hot.  I have to change the batteries quite a bit so that I can put them away for long periods. The batteries last me 3 years. I recommend it highly

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this adapter to allow my home theater system to use the Blu-ray/DVD format for my DVD-R discs. I didn't notice a difference in picture quality, but was very pleased that I was able to use all my discs in my system. I did have a few minor issues: - The adapters have different connectors to the BluRay/DVD players, so when using the players that had the larger connectors, I had to adjust my cables. - I had problems with the adapter not fitting properly. I had an adapter and two separate adapter cables, so it's pretty tricky to fit it all on the same television set.  I don't see any problem with the overall functionality of this product. It's just the cables that you have to deal with.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best price I've seen on the site for this adapter.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased two of these for a birthday celebration and was very pleased with both, but the first was very tight, and the second very loose. I found the tightest setting was the middle setting, and it held very well for over 24 hours, and I did have to switch it off and back on several times to avoid leaking. I did like the design, it's very stylish, and if I'm buying another set of speakers, I'm definitely buying this one first 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just got it. So far so good, it's perfect for traveling. I use the Bluetooth only with the earphones. No problem. If I'm traveling with it, I'll probably buy a cable to keep it from getting tangled.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this monitor for my living room as it was the only one in my apartment. This monitor is great for watching TV in the living room and watching movies in the bedroom. This is great if you're not very much of a home theatre type. If you're watching movies at the livingroom, or TV shows in the room, this monitor is definitely for you. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good TV to watch in their living room. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I installed my first DVI to VGA cable about a year ago. I was having problems getting it to connect to my TV. Finally I got it to work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of the coolest and best looking cases I've ever seen, and it comes with 4 storage media. There's not too much to complain about in my book. This case is great for a media center PC, or just about anything you might want to mount your system in. I'd give it 5 stars only because it's got a little bit of wobble to it, but it's a very sturdy case. I'm very happy with it and I'm looking forward to buying a few more.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the third model of this type of device from JVC. I have only had a few problems with the first two models. With the new design, the problems have diminished considerably. I can't give a negative review without some negative  comments. The plastic box that came with the unit was too heavy and required me to place it on a flat surface, rather than the  flat surface that I placed it on. However, the problem with the box has been eliminated. I also found a problem with my last model  that resulted in the device dropping out of my hand, causing a  small cut. However the plastic box is much more comfortable  to hold. I am sure there are still a few design flaws  and  problems with this design, but  I am confident that I have been able to get along with the latest  models  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I ordered this for my son's Sony VAIO laptop. It is exactly as advertised, and the shipping was very quick!  I also ordered a pair of Sony monitor speakers for the computer. I recommend these speakers, as they were also included. The speakers work great, the sound is great. Sound is very clear, even for high volume applications. They are quite pricey for the sound, and I really like the sound. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. If you are considering purchasing these speakers for your Sony laptop,I would definitely recommend these to anyone 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The product was exactly what I ordered it to be, as the description said. The only item that I did not like was the fact that the unit is not permanently mounted on my wall. I ordered the mounting brackets to mount it to the back of my monitor, and it is pretty stable when mounted. I highly recommend this unit if you're looking for a good video surveillance monitor.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just installed it on my laptop. I have had no problems with it. The picture quality is very good. It is a little bit louder than the laptop speakers, but that is to be expected. The volume control is not as good as in my laptop speakers. It's probably because it is on an external device. I use the laptop speaker for volume control, and the external speaker for the picture and picture quality. The sound is good enough for me.I have installed this on my Dell laptop as well, and it works like a charm. If you are looking for the highest quality, this is the best bang for your buck

I was a little disappointed with the lack of features, but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the sound and the quality/price ratio of this item.I don't know what the next time I'm in the market for a CD player will be like, but for the time being, I will continue to shop around for CD player deals. I've found some good deals on eBay, but they are not as good as this one, so I keep going to eBay for those items. I am glad I purchased this item, especially considering that the price was good, but there are other brands that are out there that are better quality and more affordable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have always had this item on hand for use on my  systems, as my PC is in the garage and my work PC is at home.  This item has worked very well for me in the past and  has served me well with other items  I've purchased over the years.  As others have mentioned, this item is not for the beginner user  as it may take a while to get accustomed to.  However, once you get the hang of this item, you will find that it makes it easy to  keep your system's cooling fans in their down positions.  I use this item to help keep my systems cool, and it has  saved me countless hours of labor in the process.

The sound is amazing and the quality of the images is great. I was hesitant about ordering these, but after reading some of the good reviews here  I decided to give it a try. I ordered online and it arrived quickly. I'm not sure why it arrived so fast but it was worth the wait 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have one of these, and I'm glad I got it for my  computer.

But other than that,  I don't think I'd change any of the other features 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This works great for a laptop to charge a tablet, but I had to use my phone charger to charge it from the wall when I was on the road.The size of the device is not something that should be a problem, but having to keep it on the counter while charging your laptop, it can be somewhat inconvenient.However, this is the one thing you can't beat about it, the ease of use. This is easily the best product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this device on my TV to display my photos.  This is very convenient to use and the only negative I can find is that the cord length is too short.  The length of the cord will increase with the end user's choice.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered the 5m and am so glad I did. I have had no problems with my computer and everything is working properly.  I am not at all happy with the price. If I remember correctly, this was about $60 before postage, and it arrived today in Canada with a $20.00 international charge.  However,  I received the product quickly, which is rare for Canadian electronic products.  The only downside is that the package is about 2lbs and is heavy, but it came in perfect condition. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The case fits nicely on my desk. The cables don't take up as much space on the desk as I expected, but the case is very sturdy and it's very easy to use. I haven't used it yet in its full length mode, but I assume it'll fit that well too 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have tried several of these. I don't mind the price as the cost is less than many other brands. I like the fact that you do not have to use this cable to get a soundcard to work. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I needed a usb cable for my daughter. The price was low and this was exactly what I needed. I would recommend these for anyone who needs an extra cable. They are very long and are able to be used for more than one computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the only way to get rid of the need for a separate CD changer on your car. I've always been annoyed by having to use a CD changers on the radio. When I switched to the TV, I started using my VHS player and CD changership was still necessary. Now, I don't have to worry about using either system and the TV plays just fine. The system is clean and fast. The picture is clear and well-balanced, even without using the TV for picture adjustments. There is very little signal interference either. I have the unit in my closet and have never had any issues with it being used. I highly recommend the unit to anyone who needs to convert their stereo system to a DVD player or is using the unit for any other reason. I would highly recommend this product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to use on my new Mac Pro. The video quality is excellent. It's very easy to set up and has not stopped me from using it since. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to add a couple of USB ports to their computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent quality microphone with good sound, and is quite affordable. I would recommend it to any person, particularly if you are working with audio equipment. I have had no trouble with it, and I can easily turn it on and off. It does not get hot, and the microphone has not dropped off. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Excellent item, easy to assemble and use, and very quiet. I used it to install my audio/video system and no problems, but my wife is in no rush and I didn't need it for that. I also have it mounted on my wall with two 20" and one 24" cables. Great price

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Purchased as replacement for my Toshiba Satellite B300. It has everything  needed in a desktop computer case, yet is easy to mount.  No need to adjust mounting  positions -just slide, and go. I have it on display in my office.  It's comfortable to hold and easy to move around. The screen is excellent. No complaints, and I've had it for over a year. Just wish they'd make it in more colors 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very compact, with great features, but at a low price. Easy to carry, but a little heavy and bulky to lug around. The buttons are small, but nice, and the stand can be adjusted to any position. Great product, for the price

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little tool. I use it on a regular basis, but only have a couple of good reviews about it. I have mine wired in parallel so that I can use both at the same time, which allows me to power two of my gaming PCs at the time. I also use it to power my Mac Pro (MacBook Pro) while I'm at the computer.  This little guy comes with a couple different sized power cords. I personally use it in my PC to power both my graphics cards and my CPU, and then to power up my monitor.  It has been a great investment.  I've bought another one for my monitor, and it has also worked out nicely so far

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best, and only, price I found on eBay. No matter the model of the television, I'm getting excellent picture quality. Very little signal loss either. I do a lot of video editing, so I need to get very bright. This is perfect for this. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been very happy with the sound quality of my speakers since buying this.  The only real drawback was that I couldn't change the volume setting.  So I bought the optional $18.95 cable and it worked just fine.  I even used a different adapter cable (different manufacturer) and I still have the same sound output.  Very pleased with the product and it will last for many years to come

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This works great for both laptop and mobile. I've never had a problem with the audio playing from both my laptop and tablet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of the better, if not the best, soundbars that I've used. It is very well balanced, and the sound is very good (even better in a surround sound environment).  I also like that the stand is easy to transport and store.  You can even move it from your entertainment center to your bedroom for an even better surround sound experience 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a good product and seems very durable. Very nice to use, but the screen is too small.  However, it does come with a lot of accessories. The case is great, and the screen seems to be able to be adjusted to any monitor size.  I have the bigger screen, but it is much less than the image looks.  But you do have to buy the case.  If you are looking to use this monitor as an external monitor for a small home theater, or even to use it in a classroom and have a projector, this is the product for you

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have only one comment about this product: I would highly suggest that you have at least two adapters available if you want to use the same monitor setup. I did have this adapter and could not tell a difference between the two.The product worked great on both my monitors and my room did not look that big.I bought another adapter to try and compare the monitor setup but the setup of the other monitor on the wall did not match up. The room still looked fine, so I am not sure if I would ever get the second adapter if it was only two adapters.The adapter is sturdy and has no problems at all and the picture quality is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have not read anything about these in any electronic device guides, yet, I bought two of them, one to work as a wireless printer, the other to work with my old printer.  Works like a charm, however, I do have one problem.  The printer works fine, but the software for both machines is not compatible. I thought it was because of the old printer, so I called Apple support and they confirmed that it was the same problem on both machines.  I contacted both the printer company as well as Apple support, and I even have a tech on hand to help. After several emails back and forth, and several days waiting for the machines to be delivered, I got them today, and they worked as advertised. So, I am very happy with this printer.I do wish the printer would come with a screen protector, but you get what you pay for. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I would buy this product again.  This product is more than adequate for all of the audio needs I have.  You really cannot go wrong with this item. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This product is very versatile for my studio:  I have a VCR with multiple inputs and outputs. It's easy to setup for me. I can add other equipment to the system. And, when I want to use this as my main mixer, I just remove one of the outputs from the mixer, and this is still the same size as the other outputs. The only problem I have is that the monitor outputs from two of the channels are slightly larger than the others.  I like to use it with a big pair of monitors, or with a second computer. So, I have two different channels, and it still fits perfectly, because they are about the same height.   It is very easy to work with, because there is just one control box that has five buttons. All the buttons can be used for mixing and setting gain, input and outputs, monitor routing, and even the input routing for those that want to mix out the signal from the rear channels

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The CDR is the best I have found to date. This is the first CDR I ever used. I would not buy another one. They are very easy to install and have no problems. This CDR comes with everything you need to have CD's in the palm of your hand. The unit has several features that allow for ease of use, ease of maintenance, and ease of setup.   I was very impressed with the ease of installation and setup, and the ease-of-use with the included software, etc.  I have tried out some of the other CDRs, but I do not recommend those.  The quality of the CDR, the ease with which it is installed, and its reliability, is way above that of many others

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have one of the few monitors that is adjustable for the room's position. I do notice that I have a higher resolution on one side of the room. Also, when viewing from a distance it appears that the image on the front of the monitor is slightly off. This could be a problem for someone who is reading on their computer or trying to focus on a text document, but it is not too bothersome to me. All in all, I highly recommend the monitors if you are looking for something comfortable and stylish.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've owned several brands of headphones over the years, and these are easily my favorite.  The ear cup construction is also nice and comfy, although I do wish it had more memory and storage capacity.  I also like the fact that the headphones are waterproof.  These headphones will be with me for many years to come.  It is not the best, but it's easy to fit in the ears with the included foam earplugs.  If you want more storage and memory capacity, go for the bigger size (6'3''), but for a good price, I'll get them for just about any occasion.  And I've found these to fit even my big ears very comfortably

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have it in both the 2nd and the 3rd Generation.  The first generation only has 1.0/1.2 channels but it's so much better now.  Both 2nd Generation and 3rd Gen have better sound quality and have a wider frequency range.  My main reason for getting the 2.0 Gen. is for my two youngest kids, and I have to say, so far, the 2rd Gen. and the more channels I use, the more sound quality they enjoy.  I think I'll stick with it for a long time 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered this to replace an obsolete, hard to read CD reader. It came with only 5 days shipping, but it was worth the wait.

The software works perfectly.The printer works just as advertised and the scanners were easy to set up.I have not used it on my computer as I only use it on a notebook computer.

You have to move them to the floor or on a pedestal to give them the best position.  Just move them from wall to wall.  Easy enough.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent piece of electronic equipment. It allows you to view your TV from any room in your house (with or without audio output). I installed this in the dining room, bedroom, and living room. It works wonderfully! The only drawback is that the TV only comes with a 50" TV. There are cheaper sets that come with larger TVs, but the 50" sets are the best for this purpose (which is all the more reason why I recommend it!). I also have to add that I have not had any problems with this TV. I haven't had it for very long, and the problem I had with the installation was only when I decided to buy a new TV set for my living room from Walmart. I returned that television after one month because the picture quality was not as good as it was with my older 55" set. However, this TV performs just as well when installed in a small room. That makes it a great choice for a family, especially one with young children, or if you just don't want to invest much in one TV. The fact that it comes with two separate connections also makes it great for two TV sets. All in all, this product is a great value, and if you're looking for a versatile TV for your home, this is the one to get

I got one of those little ones that goes on the back of your TV and you attach it to the wall with a piece of tape. You can get them as close as three inches.

I have not had any lag problems with this TV. It's really bright and colorful, and the picture is very good for a TV that costs $700.The sound on the TV is okay. However, it's not anything that I'm not already used to on other TVs, so I don't have any complaints about the sound quality.The only reason I'm giving it a 3 star review is because of the very slow menu movement.The TV does a good job of adjusting to the picture and music. However I donít have the patience for the menu movements that can be seen on other Vizios.

If you want to do your home theater or television shows easily and have a portable way to view your computer screen, the Pioneer CDJ4000i remote is the way to go

It's not as loud as other devices out there, but it is very consistent and can be used in almost any situation.  I have a second unit I use with a 4 year warranty which is the reason I got this.  The noise level of this is great, so it can be set in any environment and used for TV sound on a big screen

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered the item about a month ago and received it today.  I needed a laptop to use for work and to connect to the internet, and this laptop fulfilled my needs perfectly.  It is very small, and very portable, and it gives me the ability to use the laptop in my car without fear of the battery dying, or the USB ports dying.  The mouse is very responsive and the laptop itself is very light and portable.   The only drawback I found was the keyboard itself.  This keyboard is very sensitive, and I found it hard to type a lot of keys without accidentally typing on the wrong keys.  However, the keyboard is small and light, and as it is, it is not too bad.  If you are looking for a lightweight laptop, this is the best option I found

I do recommend that you install this on a computer that is able to play music. It took me a little while to realize that the Mac would not play music without the speakers. But it worked perfectly when the speakers were connected to the Mac.

I did not have any problems with the order, and all three cables I have, both are compatible, and have no trouble using them.I do like the fact that it has all the pins for a PC, but it has no PORT expansion, and therefore, it is not very convenient for an extension cord to be connected.I use a 3.5 mm to 5.5mm extension cord. I am hoping to get the 5.1-5.5 to work, and I am also hoping to buy a longer cable to use with the 10.1 (USB 3.0) port, which I ordered, but I need to wait for it to arrive.I am very happy with the price, and customer service,

The speed is fast, the reliability is amazing and they're inexpensive.  They are all in good condition, no problems.  I use them in all of my computers, and they work fine.   My biggest problem with them is the lack of a data connection.  However, this isn't such a big issue, if you don't use it much, then it should be ok.  All the drives are in good shape, I haven't had any problems with them at all, but I recommend them if you need a good data storage device for your computer

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had to use this because I have a 4.5 inch printer. The case fits in my work space. It is very sturdy and the prints are great. The only con I have with it is that it is not as flexible as the Saffire and Lexmark, but they do not need to be as flexible, so I can deal with that. I love that I can buy these cases directly from the manufacturer and not through a retailer, and the price is excellent, especially for a printer that is so small.

I can't remember exactly what I looked for in such a high end device, but I believe it to be the features, quality and the simplicity of the UI.  With that being said, I've been very pleased with the device and the sound quality

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have no problem at all with my Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (note 8 coming soon). I bought the 16GB version and only needed 8GB for all my photos and videos. It works flawlessly without any issues. If you're looking for a camera that has fast image upload speed, this will be a great fit for you. I was using a Zoom H3200 and I thought this would fit perfect, but it doesn't. You'll need a higher end lens, but the lens fits perfectly on the Note 7. The only issue I have with it is that the button to get out of focus isn't that easy to find on the screen, but I have it located under the camera body. I don't think I'd need a Zoom Lens for the same reason, but if you have a harder time finding the button, this may not work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Nikon 35-70mm f/4 lens. The mount is the perfect size for this lens and it has a quick release mechanism. I have been using the lens on many occasions and have been extremely pleased with the quality, focus and image sharpness.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was skeptical at first, but the sound quality is great and the sound of the speakers isn't boomy. The sound is more balanced as the distance between them increases. Also, the software controls are easy to use. I wouldn't recommend this speaker for a desktop system, but for a living room or media room, it's great. The price and quality are great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Works perfectly, it's not too heavy and works like it should. I don't know what is so special about the switch, but it works perfectly. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this device about a week ago and it has already started working better for me. The only thing I would say, is if you want to have more than one phone line set up, you might need to get a 2nd device for that, otherwise, you will only get one. Otherwise, it's great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great item. I'm going to add two more of these in case we need a second monitor for the family. The quality is excellent, and it comes with a great warranty 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very easy to set up and works very well. I was very surprised to see how much I liked the sound quality from the speakers. It doesn't quite sound like home theater, but it's very good for music. The only real downfall is the fact that you can't get too loud, but the audio does get a little more full sounding when you crank the volume way up. For that reason, you won't be able to use the speakers as much for music, but they will help you to watch a movie. The volume adjustment can be tricky because there is a limit to how much you can turn it up. It's a little difficult to tell how loud you are on the screen without the volume knob. Also, the fact is, the speakers don't last very long. I just have to set them up, disconnect the device from the TV and turn them back on, and I can hear my music in perfect quality. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have never had a bad electronic device. I have this one for a few days and so far so good. It works great for music too, even though my stereo has the original speakers (not that I'm complaining). It has also solved the problem of having to adjust the volume control in any music player that I have. I use the remote for volume but it is easily controllable. Also, the volume of the speakers are also easily adjustable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this with my Mac Pro.  Works great.  I don't have problems with my external monitors.  But if you have multiple monitors, make sure your external monitor cable is terminated properly.  For example, if you are in the front of the screen, then the cable should come in the back.  Make sure it is terminated with a cable plug properly. That is if you haven't messed it up already.  Otherwise, just go ahead and experiment.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   These headphones are great. Great sound. Lightweight, quiet and comfortable to wear.  The only thing I dislike is that they are the only pairs that you can actually order from the website,  however I was able to get some other ones for sale on eBay

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an easy to install. Just plug in. The only bad thing is I can't seem to set the speed and I can only set the video.  If I would have this on when I had my camera I would think I could set the speeds more easily.  I like the camera and will be ordering another one for my camcorder 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The quality of this monitor is quite good for a monitor of this size.  I am happy with the color reproduction and the bright picture quality, but I am sure there are many people who would like a larger screen size for gaming and viewing a larger image than your standard monitor.   I also like that the unit has a lot of flexibility to fit your needs

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Works very well. Easy to use. The noise canceling works great. The volume setting was a little high for my taste, but I don't really care about the volume setting. I just need to hear what my television is broadcasting to my audio system. I didn't feel any loss of sound or volume when I switched from one program to another. The only thing I don´t like is the cable management tool. It´s pretty handy, but can be a pain sometimes. Still, it´s my second favorite product in its category 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   These earbuds sound great.  The sound is not bass heavy, but the mids are clear and not too muddy.  Sound quality is good for both work and leisure.  I can't imagine they are good for heavy bass.  However, I do find them to be very comfortable.  With that being said, I'm sure the price is a little high for these earbud-style earbudes.  It has a comfortable shape and the cord comes out neatly.  They are reasonably priced.    I've not tried all of the other offerings from Headphones.com, but I have ordered from them before and it seems to be pretty good.  If you are looking for earbudo-style products, these earphones seem to be the best I've seen so far.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had no problems with the connectors. Very easy to install. I was planning to use the unit to monitor the temperature of my refrigerator, but I did have a couple of problems: 1. The LCD display was a little weird. I thought it would be better to have the monitor in the window, but the LCD was always in my peripheral vision. 2. I had to connect the monitor to an old-fashioned VCR that the TV was connected to. I could see through the TV and only through the LCD. However, since the LCD is at the back, it is not very visible from the front.The unit is a very good unit and I have no problems installing it. The only downside is that it is a little bulky.The only thing that would make this unit better is if it was available in different resolutions.I can't say for sure if this will be a problem for you, but if not, this is a good unit to have for the price and does it very well.I do recommend this unit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a problem with the power cable on the original iPod and I found this one on eBay for $2.99.  I liked the black color.  After removing the battery, I plugged it into my old MacBook and had no problems.  As for the sound quality, the iPod Classic has a much better volume control, the buttons are easier to use and it fits the palm of my hand.  It also sounds better, especially when you use it with your old Macbook.  With my iPod, I'm able to have it on for hours without having to power up the computer, while the iPod mini charges.  I recommend this item

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I ordered a pair of these as a pair for my daughter, and they work perfectly! I had read some negative reviews about the speaker, but, with the addition of the rubber feet, and the cable clamp, I haven't had any problem with it.  I would say it is better than some of the speakers at my school, and I'm a huge fan of high quality speakers, so the difference in performance is very noticeable.  If you're thinking about getting a pair, I'd definitely recommend it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had this device for about a month and it's pretty good for the money, especially for a small system like mine. I'd be hesitant to recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a high quality solution for home theater, because I've seen a few devices (Sony, LG, Panasonic) that seem to have the same quality as this. But I would definitely recommend this device if you want to add a little extra sound and not worry about making a big investment in a system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I did purchase the second monitor as well.  I installed it without issue on a clean install.  It has a great color rendering.  The only minor quibble is that I noticed the color depth changed slightly when the monitor was attached.  However, after a reboot it fixed itself and everything seemed to be fine.  Unfortunately, I am going to have to purchase the larger version of this monitor for my gaming rig.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this monitor, especially considering it was a very easy install. If you want to install it on your computer, this is a great purchase

You might have to reset the volume before it will stop the automatic operation

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very pleased with the performance of this system. I have a system of about 12 systems in my house that I run through my home theater. I find that these systems are more consistent, not to mention quieter. I am using one of these systems now and it's really nice to have these things around in case I need them for something else. I love the fact that there are three different system types with various settings and speeds. I would recommend this to anyone who uses their systems. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have two of these in my basement office for work and home. I like the sound quality, the low noise and flexibility. They're not too expensive and I use them to stream music to my home stereo and to do music storage. I also use them as an HTPC/AirPort router to connect to my wireless network. They are pretty easy to set up and operate.The only negative thing about these is that they don't come with an Ethernet cable, so I had to purchase my own. You just have to make sure you order the Ethernet cable as well as the coax cables, since you have to have one of each. This has not been an issue for me, and they're still in use for everything I needed.I don't know if these will keep working if I stop using them, but it seems they will keep on working. I haven't noticed any damage to them or anything like that, but I'm not worried.I have purchased 3 of these and am planning to buy 4 more. I'm impressed, but for me it's a matter of when they will be broken.

So I would recommend that you order from Amazon if you plan to use it at home.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of the few that has a low power output. But I have found that my computer often has more trouble with it than I do.

But it is definitely not the last word in power supplies.  It should, however give you some flexibility

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device is easy to assemble. The only issue I had was that I only had one of the three switches. So I ordered two sets and put them in the box next to each other. They fit great. The unit is very easy to use. I found the only reason for the three-switch configuration was that each switch requires about 30 ft of cable (not including the switch itself). So it would be easier if the switches were smaller. However, they were perfect for my needs. I recommend that you get a couple of switches and put the two in your cart to save money. The switch is fairly heavy so it is not necessary to have them together. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the convenience of the touch-tone phone.  I am very glad it has a built-in mic for telephone calls.  It has several functions.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Used this product as a replacement for the original Epson V5000 scanner, as I wanted to replace my V570 with a smaller and cheaper scanner. Scanning on the V570 was a pain with the default color settings, but that was not a problem with the original scanner. There were some issues with the scanner software, but for most of the scan there were none. As for the quality of the scans, the V571 scans images extremely well. The scanner software is very stable, and the quality is good, though I think the scan software can improve the quality further. I did experience problems with the software in some cases, but the scanner itself is smooth, and this software is not an issue 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the second model I have. I'm pleased with the ease of setting up the first one. The second unit seems to have the same features, but only one switch. For the price, this product is a good value. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As others have stated, this product is very quiet. I was thinking about buying 2 of these, one for each ear, but I wanted a bigger sound. So I picked up this product and have been very happy with it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great for those on the hunt for a compact device to carry with you. It is very easy to read and has a good size to it. I would recommend this item to all. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This product is very well made and very compact. It comes with an extra set of ear tips and is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I have to admit, it is a little pricey compared to others but, the quality of the product is so high that it's worth the investment. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Just purchased the unit and have been very pleased with the way the picture looks and the sound. The unit has a nice feel in the hand, and is easy to operate with either a mouse or a keyboard. The picture does have a slight yellow tint, but that's not an issue for me. I am also very pleased that the unit is very easy to mount with the included bracket. The mount has not come loose yet, and works well with the bracket.The case does not take up any space on the floor and is easily adjustable for height/length of the speaker. The speaker itself has a fairly large and deep bass sound, and seems to have a decent, deep mid range as well. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a decent sounding home theater system that has some versatility in regards to mounting. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very nice and easy to use. Very flexible in the way that you can move the power cord to different locations on the wall and how you can set the volume on each unit. Can be adjusted so you can use only the sound system in your home. Easy to setup and adjust for your location. I recommend this device to anyone who is looking for a nice and simple sound system. I have found that using a combination of this, one of the Soundbar's, and another Soundbar unit has been very effective. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The product is very accurate, and the sound quality is very good. The unit also allows you to control the volume level in different rooms. The price is very reasonable. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very good unit for the price.  I have a couple of different printers, and I like the Epson as my printer.  This one seems to be very good quality and printer. I have not found any problems with this unit yet.  If you have printer issues, this is the right unit for you 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have never had any issues with any of my other Sony models.  This is the first one I've purchased and I've only had it about a month.  It seems to work perfectly right out of the box, which is why I'm a big fan of the product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I needed an external sound card for a stereo system I am building. This card allows me to connect two different sets of speakers to one computer. It also has a built-in power supply so that it does not need to be mounted on the computer's chassis. I was initially hesitant about the sound quality because of the small size of the card. However, after several days of use, I can report that the quality is acceptable. The only thing I was not entirely satisfied with is the ability to choose between different sound cards. It was difficult for me to find a configuration that satisfied my needs. However I was able to modify the card to satisfy the needs of my system. I am very pleased with the sound card, and it will be my system sound card of choice for the next several years. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Easy to set up with easy to read instructions. Works great with my laptop and laptop/tablet. Would have been nice to have an extra USB cord included, but that was all I needed. Easy to connect to either laptop or desktop, just plug in the adapter, connect your device, power it on and you're good to go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The cable is very long, and you get a good deal of audio with it. Also, this is the only way I've seen for me to use my Sennheiser HD650 without it being a "plug and play" situation, as you would need to have your PC's soundcard, or a separate soundcard to support this system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received my Epson V570 on 2/28 and have been very happy with it. I use it for my photo prints on my office desk and it works great. I do wish they had a model that was a little larger but it works very well. The light is easy to adjust for any lighting conditions you may encounter.The only drawback is that the card does not have a USB port. So you have to connect it to a computer via USB. I don't mind this as I don' t have to change the card as I move around the office.The card is also nice and heavy. I would highly recommend buying the larger model if you are using it for more than business.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I would definately recommend this to anyone who wants a way to listen to their favorite songs with no interference. I find that many headphones are very sensitive to the signal received and it will cause a lot of unwanted noise and distortion to start. This eliminates this problem. It's the best in the price range of headphones 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This unit works as advertised. It was very easy to install and works very well with a laptop.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I can't recommend this product highly enough. I would even buy it even if it's the only one in my house. Great looking, excellent sound, easy to set up, easy on the eye. You don't have to worry about losing a track when you turn the volume up or down, as it's easy to do so. I'm a bit picky about some of the settings, but the ones I use rarely need adjustment. Everything is easy to tweak and customize. I've only had this on for two weeks, so I can only really review the good side of the device. I haven't been a fan of the cable, and I'm not sure if that'll be fixed in the future. The price is also very reasonable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great replacement for my HDTV. The only thing I noticed is that if the TV is moved around from wall to wall, the TV gets out of line with the monitor. If I were to do the same with the DVD player, the player would move around as well. This makes it very easy to use the unit with two computers as it would not be an issue. I highly recommend the VGA-TV to anyone who loves HDTVs and has the room for two!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It has been working fine for me on my Dell laptop. It does not come with a charger.  I have not needed the included cable for any of the systems yet. I am sure it will come in handy later on. I also like the fact that you can order one to your computer with no problem.  For example, I have a desktop that has two monitors, and there are two cables to plug in. One goes to my PC, and one goes to a docking station that has another monitor.  The only difference is that you don't have to go over to the docking station to plug it in.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was a little worried because I didn't like the idea of buying one. I had to try this one out on one of my other electronic devices. I was surprised to find how good it is.  This is for those who are trying to save money, or those that are trying for better sound quality.  It has a great sound output. I'm pleased with the overall sound quality of my Sony product. I did have to switch out the input jack for the S-Video. This product is great 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had a lot of fun with this. It is easy to read on the shelf, but doesn't look as good with the LED backlights. But for me that is not important. I just wanted a little LCD screen for my new system. I am glad I got it for the price, because I would never have tried this product without it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is very high quality. I have purchased two of these and one of the connectors is shorter, making the connection easier, and I find the whole unit to be very easy to set up. I like that I can have the unit in my pocket at any time, no batteries are required. The unit is very light and compact, and is very easy and convenient to handle. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This USB adapter is great, I use it with my computer and I love the fact that it comes with all the drivers that are needed.   The only complaint I have is that the cable that comes with the adapter is not long enough, so I use a longer cable from the cable company.  It's not very expensive for a quality adapter 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Just like my Mac Pro I was happy with the performance. It was very easy to install and worked like a charm. However, I wanted a more sleek look so I switched to the LCD display. The display had some small hiccups, but the software was very nice so I was able to fix the problem. I found a good LCD monitor at Walmart but you need to order more then one if you are using it for a lot of monitors.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The screen is a little big for my living room. Still, it looks great and is easy to set up.  I would recommend this for those who have a small space. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have two of these boxes in a garage. Two rooms with no TV's, and one with a Sony LCD TV. These boxes are perfect for our home. The only down side is the weight. I have to be careful with the boxes because they can shift in the box as they are opened. That's what happened to me last night. It caused a hole in one of the walls of the room. No big deal, just one thing to be aware of. It is a little noisy, but it is worth it for what you get for the price. I would recommend this product to anyone that doesn't want to spend $300 on a TV. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a similar problem with a different monitor from an ebay vendor. I bought this model from amazon and it worked flawlessly. The image quality was really good. This monitor looks much nicer than a flat screen. If you're looking for a good monitor for your digital work, this one will do the trick. The price was also very reasonable considering the quality of the image.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Easy to use, but the only downside is that you have to install it yourself.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this about 2 years ago for a Christmas gift, and love it. I have a very high end laptop, and I needed something very similar to have it on a desk.This thing will take up the same amount of space, and only requires a couple minutes to set up (or even shorter if you just unplug it in and plug it in again for whatever reason).The battery lasts long, the speakers sound good, and the software is easy to work with.I've had my laptop in the room for almost 1,000 hours and it still powers on with about 50% of its capacity. This is a great product for a great price, and would definitely recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had it only about 6 months and it's been working great. The speakers are loud and clear. The battery life is very good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Easy to set up and works great. I have already had good results with my son who also has an HP computer.  I also have an Apple Macintosh so I did the same thing and also loved the results.  The cable I used for both computers were the same but were slightly different colors.  No matter what color you use, it looks really cool on the screen.   You can see some of the different patterns when you look at a document in full color or a slide show.  It also comes with the cable so you don't need to buy it separately

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I would like to see the other brands get in on the digital music thing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As others have said, I needed one to install a new TV. It works perfectly. I installed it with my own router (my setup doesn't use WPS). I don't have a problem with it yet. I just don't want to break my router's wireless security, so I'll probably leave the WPS setting off in my router until I know how well it holds up. I use a Sony Bravia TV, and the TV's HDMI inputs will automatically switch to the PS3 if a PS3 game is being played on it. I also have a Sony XBox360 and a PlayStation 3 plugged into my setup. I'm pretty happy with the setup.

The good news is that I'm getting it for free from the company and it's on sale here for the next week! I have a couple of other electronic devices that I bought in the past and I'll be buying more from them, too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the way it looks. I am 6'5'' and have a really wide back so the back is wide enough for my head but not too far from my body. I do have one slight concern: when I play back and forth through my speakers (I'm a bluetooth device user), the music is still playing at the same tempo that it was when I turned on my speakers.I'm thinking that I need to lower the volume (from what I hear it's still too loud) but I don't know if this is actually the case.I was very happy with this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound is pretty much on par with what I'm used to. Not too loud, but clear enough for what I do on my home theater.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great unit, with excellent sound quality. I'm very happy with this purchase, and have recommended it to several people. It is not as powerful as I thought, but that's due to the fact that it has only one amp. It comes with a 3.5mm to 1/8th inch adapter for use with the XLR cables. The XLR connections are easy to install, and the connections for the input jack and output jack are good. The only problem I had was that the mic wasn't very responsive at the lower end of the sound range. The mic seemed to be in front of the speakers, and it was difficult to get sound through the mic. That is because it was on the rear side of the unit. If you have a small room, you may have better luck getting it to work, and if you have the room to spare, I suggest getting a small, 2x2 amp to get a little more punch out of it. It will make a decent system for most, especially in a bedroom situation. For the price, I think this is one of the better buys

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I needed to set up the receiver in my new Samsung TV. It did take a little while to figure out the proper settings. But once set up, it worked very well. The picture quality was fantastic. My wife was very happy. The receiver worked as advertised.The receiver's sound quality was very good as well. There was no interference during the transfer of audio or images. I even tried to record a video on my 4K TV using my AV Receiver. However, the video quality wasn't as good as I had expected.The only issue I had with the unit was the remote. I found that using it for simple functions like volume adjustments was a little cumbersome. However the ability to navigate through menus was very convenient.I was very pleased with the receiver and am looking forward to continuing my audio and video recording adventures with the remote as well as the unit.I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great audio/video receiver. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the product in early 2005. This was before the arrival of other manufacturers' products and the internet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been buying electronic devices for many years, and I don't see a better one than the Zoom H3N. It has all the features I need and more, but for the price, it's unbeatable.  I use it with my Sony A6000 camera, and with a good external monitor.  Great bang for the buck

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the easiest way to transfer any kind of data to/from a flash drive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had to do some research on this particular model and it was not available from Amazon, so I ordered from Lowe's. It arrived very quickly, I just wanted to say how great it is. This is great for kids and adults, it was a bit tricky to assemble at first but it did not matter. The only reason I had some trouble with the picture was that I did not know it would be on the side until the day I received it. It came in with the cable already attached. I thought that was a problem until it came out of the box.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm an enthusiast of the PS2, so I thought I'd try this to see how it worked. I don't use this for gaming as I find the games are quite difficult to play. I only use this when I'm working with my PC, and then I just use it for browsing the Internet, looking at photos, etc. I use it with a PC that I have built myself, so the sound is great as well. The price is awesome, and I have not seen any problems with this product at all. I would buy this product again and again

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This has made my system run much better than it did before. The picture is great, the sound is clear, and the volume is low, so the volume level is easy to adjust.  I recommend this device to anyone who likes to run many different type of media at the same time (video, audio, pictures, and images.etc.) 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this product for a long time. My son is now using this device to use his PC at work. He is a very fast user and he did not even notice that the device had changed the position of the speakers. He has never had this problem with any other wireless device.I give this product 5 stars for its quality, fastness, and easy installation.I would recommend this product to anyone

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device works as advertised. I had to buy additional wires to get this set up on my office printer, but it works for that as well. My only complaint is that the "back" and "front" switches do not do anything when the printer is in use. That is not too bad since I am not printing very often, but I would have preferred more functionality. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm very satisfied with this item. It works as advertised. Very nice. I would recommend this item to anyone who has a good sound system. It has no distortion and is very comfortable. It's perfect for listening to mp3's 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The only reason for a poor review is that the unit itself is excellent.  I love it.  It comes with all the cables you would need, and there is an adapter so you can plug in the included cable to your laptop.  However, the power cable needs to be unplugged and stored separately so you will never be without it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a long time user of a good wireless speaker (JBL) that was shipped in an understated box with great reviews and I must say that the RCA is a very good upgrade for those who are not afraid to change their stereo system and their equipment.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had bought this to replace a defective  device (the unit didn't include the case for this reason  but they would be made for this specific  reason).   The unit worked flawlessly after installation. I only wished the instructions  would have included a link to order the case.  I was able to order it on Amazon  but it took me a couple of weeks to get it  shipped. All in all, I was satisfied with the  delivery time. The case arrived very quickly and worked perfectly  within a few minutes of unpacking it. It was easy to install on this unit but you'll need to cut it out so you can fit the case over the back panel

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Great little device for anyone who needs a good quality antenna. It does a good job of covering the outdoor airwaves, and I had no trouble with it failing during heavy rains. It's great for a beginner, as you can adjust the attenuation at the press of a button. Great for anyone, it is very easy to use.

The headphones work very well for me. The sound is crisp and clear, and the soundstage is also excellent. They fit very snug in my ears. I am very impressed 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Bought this cable, and it works great, especially with 4k video. The only con is that I have to buy it in two parts; there is no way to remove just one part from the cable. For this reason, I only have to purchase the smaller, one-piece cable.The product is very easy to understand. And I have not had any problems with it yet!

If you have the need for a great way to organize your files, but you don't want to pay for something that's proprietary (and can cost a fortune), then this is a good choice.  I have it hooked up to a laptop and it still works perfectly
