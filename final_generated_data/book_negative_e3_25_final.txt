Write a negative review about a bad book:   If it's a "book" that is written with the intent of telling a story, it's bad. This book was like a soap opera. The characters are so boring and stupid that there was no point to the plot. This is not an opinion, but a fact. I've read many books like this and found them to be terrible and uninteresting. I will be spending the entire day reading nothing but horror novels about zombies and witches.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I can see it now, a hundred years from now, when the historians of the future study the rise of modern civilization and the triumph of rationality and reason over superstition and irrationality; they will note the remarkable degree to which the people of those times were open-minded about the supernatural. A hundred years hence, however, when this same historian is asking himself what brought that level of rationalism and rational behavior to an abrupt end, he will find only one explanation: the demon of superstition.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   (P)r: It is about a man who is forced to live with his mother after a very violent divorce. I enjoyed the author's writing style very much. This book was a good example of how one can describe a particular life situation. I do not know why I read this book because the story is not that appealing to me.   This is a book about a little boy who wants to have sex with the teacher of his grade. When the teacher refuses his offer, he finds another way to get it. The author makes the main character's feelings seem real and the reader is made to believe the little boy does have real feelings for his teacher and the girl. The story makes you believe that these feelings have been there since the beginning of his life. The last ten minutes of the book make the reader realize that the boy has changed since this last book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book from a local bookseller for a good price. I didn't get it because of the reviews it had received but the book is good and I recommend it to people who want a good story and don't mind a good plot. The characters are interesting and it has a lot of violence.   I bought this from a nearby store because it had a high value, but then I went into this book and saw all the reviews. I wasn't expecting this kind of rating but I have to give it a 5 because I do like the plot and it is a great read. I read this book to my 2 year old, but I feel like I may have also read it to my younger son. I don't know if that is fair, but either way he enjoyed it and that is all that really matters. I love the violence and the violence is pretty good, but there is a lot more I liked about the plot. I think the ending was very good for a long book and I would definitely recommend it. Recommendation: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's a reason the first line of the introduction of "A Man in the Street" is "A very curious book about the way the mind works."   I found this book extremely difficult to read because it's so much about the "how the mind is."  And I don't really understand why any reader would want to read a book like that.   The author's premise is "The mind can only hold so much data at once."  If this was a book about anything else, there would be more about why it is that the author believes this.  The reason he believes this is because he's read a lot of philosophy about the brain. He feels that the way our brains are working is wrong, because they are not storing and processing as much data as our minds think they are.  There is a reason he is the way he is, and he has the ability to see into the workings of the brain and what's really going on, even though his theories are ridiculous.  The reason I don the "The Mind Is A Strange Thing" is so interesting is because the author really is trying to explain how the brain works, and the way people think and see is completely off-kilter.  When you read a really good book that tries to explain some of the mysteries of the world, it is very interesting to read about.  This book wasn't like that, it was about how the mind really is.   It's more an example of people who don't know how the world works, so they look for answers in the wrong places. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this one a 3 star review since I'm not a fan of the author's writing style and the overall quality of the book is so poor. This book was really boring to read. In fact, it was really hard to get my mind around the idea of an actual book and writing style. I actually think I prefer the story of the TV series over this book. The characters were so dull and lifeless that it was almost like they were there to be the plot device. That's what really bothered me. As a story about how the apocalypse occurs and then how the humans and mutants (which are in no way "human" at all) are forced to work together to survive. I don't know how they are supposed to have much of a relationship except for when one of them tries to rape/kill the other. I mean, come on. If they were human, they wouldn't even need to have a relationship. Then again, I thought the TV show went too far with the "bond" thing. I'm still hoping that some people can get behind this book and maybe it will change the minds of those who disliked it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     - this book is about a highschool student and the strange thing about him is that he's always on time - the author is so creative - you feel like he's making up the facts that he finds - the teacher (she has a really high voice and that really makes you realize how bad of an idea it is to have a school teacher) keeps referring to him by his first name but there's no first name in the story - I'm going to try to remember how this book was put together, because the book seems really well thought out and has a very specific point of view - it doesn't seem like the author just made up some things and wrote a book about them - the book is well written and has some very good parts - this book doesn't make much sense - you can't really decide who is "good" or "evil" in this book, but it doesn  This book is a really, really bizarre book. The author really does make it seem like there's a real paranormal phenomenon going on. This is the only reason that the story makes sense. The plot, which is about an elementary school student who has a crush on the same girl he was talking about, and how the principal of the school is going to let him meet this girl, is strange enough. However, the whole thing starts to fall apart when the principal is revealed to be a witch. This book has a lot of twists and turns, and I was not prepared for some of them. The ending is not very satisfying, however, as it leaves a lot to be desired.   The author does a really good job of describing the feelings that the boy is going through at all times in this story. He is a teenager who is trying to make a friend and is constantly being bullied for being different. He tries to ignore it, but even if he tried to ignore the other people who made fun of him, the feelings would never go away. That is what the author tries to show here: he doesn't want to be "one of the guys", and when he doesn... he's not. At all. He gets teased and made fun for being his weird, unique personality and just wants to fit in. So, in the end, he doesn ..  "So we'll do this. You take this girl and I'll take that girl, and that's how it's going to be. We'll do whatever it takes to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I do not know why it took me so long to read this book! It has all the things I love about fantasy, but in a very realistic, and not at all boring, way. The plot has been changed and updated so often that there's not a lot of continuity, but I never minded the changes. The magic system is a bit different from the one in the first book, but if you've read the other books in the series, you're not missing much. You might find the characters a bit less interesting because they have more depth, but the plot, magic, and setting are great. The prose is great and the story is awesome! I'm so glad to have read this one. -Lois
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is great. However, there is just too much about it that is wrong. It is too long and the main character's actions are not consistent with the rest of the story. It seems as if the author just copied and pasted the character from a book, as if he didn't like a part of it. It isn't like he got someone else to help write it and the book still reads well. The main character, Tom, is an idiot for constantly saying "No!" to anyone and everyone he comes across. He doesn't even seem to understand the purpose of having a book of "no's" in the first place. After Tom is released, he doesn't stop until he has gone through all of the books. The last time he is given permission to read, he makes a mistake and doesn't get the book back for two months! In fact, the only reason that he keeps the book with him is because he says that he might find it useful later. Tom's lack of respect and respect for anyone around him really rubs off on all of his co-workers. At times, Tom's behavior seems a little too "un-caring" for me to feel like I want to give this book five stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The second volume of the series starts off pretty promising but things start to go downhill in the third and fourth volume.   I don't have much to say about this other than this book is an awful example of why I don't like sequels.  We have all seen books where the first book is excellent and the second is mediocre, and this is the case here.  I enjoyed this book.  However, it has all the elements of a failed book that is so bad it is almost worth buying the bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad reviews I read on Goodreads are actually really bad.  The first book in this series was so bad that I ended up skipping through it.  There's nothing to get out of the books except for the characters.  I read this one after finishing the last book.   I'd recommend starting with the first book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    " I hated this book... I don't know what was so wrong with the book that it was so bad that people will want to read it. I don 't know..." (Sherryl J. Lee, review of The Book of Love in Women's Studies, Summer 1992) I did not enjoy this book and found it confusing, confusing, convoluted, and dull. The book is very difficult to understand. There are too many layers of symbolism and meanings to be captured in a review. I understand the purpose of the book is to explore the question of love and what it means in relation to women, but it is also interesting in itself as a social and cultural history of what may be called love in women. But I really can 't help but be disappointed with this book because the author was too vague, she didn 't give the reader a clear picture of what the message is and the messages were confusing and not fully explained. As an author, the author did her homework but she made some pretty major errors in the book. One of the main characters, a female student is raped. But in the next scene, she is seen naked. There is a man in the room, and the next time we see the man, he is watching the victim. This is the only time in the story that he appears in the picture. When the victim is in the hospital, the man in her room is her attacker. I'm not saying that all men are rapists, but the message of the story is pretty clear to me that she is. This book really made me angry, and I felt that the author didn't give me enough information for me to even start to understand why I was angry. She said that she was angry because she felt she had been lied to by the women in her life, so she wrote a book about love in womens' lives and how the men had lied to her. I could feel that the man was a kind of "guilty man." What kind of guilty man would lie to his wife about his wife, or the women he is dating? But then later in the life of the character, a man who has been in the scene with the victim when she was raped, he says:  " That was the thing that hurt me the most. I was not there for her the first time. That's how she broke me.  But once I realized that, I was there for each other all
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know that there was a lot wrong with this book. I did not find anything that I enjoyed, which was disappointing because I really enjoyed it, and thought it was a decent book. As a whole, I would not recommend this book to anyone, since I found it very forgettable, and not much of a read. Also, since it was so long, I had to read the ending a second time so I could figure out what was going to happen next (and didn't understand what was happening on the first read).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "Happiest" in the family is an extremely good book, but it is far from perfect. It suffers from poor writing, poor editing and a very predictable plot, and even though I really enjoyed this book, I was very disappointed that I had to wait 4 months for a paperback copy to arrive. The story is enjoyable for what it is, but the "unfortunate" ending left a sour taste in my mouth. I will have to read another of Kundera's work before I can give it 4 stars, but for now this is a 4 star book, which I feel is more fair than giving it a 3.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been reading "Mama's Boys" on Amazon since it came out. After reading, I realized that what the author was talking about was the worst kind of sex you can have: It was not consensual, but it was also not forced, nor was it bad. It was dirty, it was bad, but not as bad as being told you're a bad girl just because you can't get your dick up. This book is a lesson on being a slut. It's about sex for women, and about how to be a slut without it being a complete dick to the women involved. "Moms Boys" is filled with bad women, who are not really bad, only unlikable, unladylike. If you're not a good girl, don't expect your men to like you, be grateful for the pleasure they provide, and not ask for anything. "It's not your fault, it's your husband's", and then, well, not wanting to talk to your husband any more. If your husband won't play the "good girl", then you are a bad slut, and your mother will never love you. It may be the case that the mom is a bitch and the son a "good little boy", but that's not what the book is about. So, I'm not recommending this book. I'm recommending the book as a feminist text, and as a lesson in how to not be a bad little slut.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book that I just loved but never got around to reading:  I loved the cover of this book. The story is interesting and the plot is complex and intriguing. As I read through the book, I was constantly asking myself questions about the people, events and culture in this book and how it relates to the current day and my own life and experience. However, I am a fan of this genre and did not enjoy this book very much. I found the narrative to be a bit confusing and not very exciting. I don't know why I bothered reading it at all. I guess I just didn't like the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst novels I have read in years, it's the kind of work where you get very little enjoyment out of it.   It is hard to keep going and find some kind of meaning, and when you do, you're not happy about it. You can find more interesting things to read, but this is a poor example of a bad novel.  "I wanted to throw up as I read.   The description of the horror is horrifying, the writing is terrible, and the book's structure makes it impossible for me to finish the thing.   I gave it a two star because the writing made me sick.   "

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It was terrible." -Lois G.  "It's horrible and awful, if you like that kind of thing." -Anonymous reader  Read an honest review of this book:  I really liked the story. The premise was interesting and the characters were engaging. The ending, however, left me feeling a bit disappointed. The story was about a boy who lived with his grandmother, whom he loved very much. The grandfather was having an affair with a married woman, and the grandmother's husband was trying to get her to leave with him. She didn't want to leave, so she gave him a ring, knowing it was the only thing she could give him and the only one he would really accept. However, the woman didn't really want the ring. She felt that she needed to give him something for his trouble, so as to not hurt his feelings. Then she told her husband that she did not want anything from him, and left with the ring in his hand. The husband went back to his wife and the boy, only to find out that the wife had already married the man who had betrayed her. They were happy.  the man is furious with the boy's grandmother. The boy decides to tell her about his grandmother. However... I know what I read is an awful story, but... It left me a little unsatisfied...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You may not be the first to think this, but the ending to this book just wasn't good.   In the last few chapters we were told that the last of the gods were killed and they were now trapped in an alternate dimension and had to fight for the last time to save what was left of the world. I wasn't feeling this at all, but then it said that the only ones left were the children of the dead ones and I was thinking about the main characters that were in the story and they did make me think about how much I hated them, but I think it should have been more ambiguous about the last book of the series and what happened in it.  I enjoyed the story, but it's hard to get my brain around an ending like this.  (review from January 2016)
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I love your book but it does not live up to the hype I read about it on your blog.   I didn't care for this book as much as the others I've read but the characters were intriguing. The story is good, there is some action and there is a bit of romance (which i do like). I like this because a) i don't like the main character but b) I like the characters so it didn't hurt that much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son is in love with the Star Wars movies. But I don't think he really knows what the story is about. He asked me to read his favorite books. When I told him this story I knew he would be thrilled. I just made a quick promise to read it for him first. It is a good story that has many good parts but I think the book had some weak points, one being the villains.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last sentence was a big hint that I'm not a big fan of this book. It just doesn't do anything for me.   I can't say I dislike this book, but I also can't really remember a lot of the plot or characters, so I'm at a loss. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm still not sure why I bought this book. I'm going to have to read through it to make sure I can actually understand what's going on. My biggest issue with this book is that she gives the impression that, "We need to protect the world from dangerous people. We need to do everything we can to stop them from hurting others." In other words, we need to be so perfect that we don't even need to worry about others. And I'm really struggling to buy into this message. And then, she goes on to talk about how horrible the world is, and how we need everyone to be perfect so we don t know who to help. I am confused. I really hope she gets all the things right, because as a reader I am so disappointed in how she treats the people in the book. If she can get to the truth about them, and the reality that these people are people too, I might be able to understand why they were so fearful in the beginning, and I'd be OK with that. But at the moment, this book just isn t very interesting to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst novel of the year, this is a piece of sh*t about a man whose ego is larger than the whole universe. It's a great idea to tell the story of a man who is obsessed with his wife and her mother in their childhood, and then in his 40s, he gets to be a "dad" to them. It makes for great drama and you can't get enough of that stuff, but it is not what I was hoping for. When I started reading it I thought it was going to be great and the rest of the novel would follow this trajectory and be better, but then it became a bore, the author's obsession with his family and his ego (which is always bigger than the universe) was too much for me. I got frustrated about his inability to stop making money from the book and when I came back to it a few months later it was as if a boulder had fallen on me and I was unable to go forward because everything was still too big and I couldn't imagine going back to a place where everything was so big. It wasn't the book, it was the writer's ego.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My problem with this book is that it has a lot of great ideas, but it's so hard to follow them. This is what's wrong: * A lot of the ideas are too deep and complex, and many of them can't be applied in the real world (and, in many cases, they aren't applicable at all). This makes it hard to know how to apply the ideas. * There are lots of great, if not entirely new ideas, that are introduced, but all of them require a lot more thought than I had time for in this book. This makes the book a bit pointless. * The author doesn't have any strong opinions about how to go about solving this or that problem. It's all very general and general solutions seem to be just as good as the best ideas presented elsewhere. This means the book will be interesting to some people, but I would think that it would be a waste of time to someone else.   What's wrong with this and how to fix it:  * This book is too deep for its own good. For example, we learn about how computers can be designed to think about problems, but we don't really learn why they should or shouldn't. We also don't learn how to design a computer to do exactly what we need it to do - a machine with human-level intelligence. * Some of the suggestions are so difficult to implement that I just want to throw this book away.  Is this book good for people with other mental health issues? Yes! This book will help people who have depression and other emotional disorders by showing you how to cope with emotions and improve your outlook on life. This book can help people with PTSD as well - because some of these concepts are similar to what happens to people during war, these readers should also find this book helpful. But it's not necessary to have PTSD to benefit from this book! * You should read this book if you have any kind of a mental health issue, because it contains concepts that other books don't touch on.  (This book is available for free via Kindle.) This book contains:  You don't need to have any mental health problems to benefit!      This is my final thought:    If you have a problem with depression, you should definitely read this!

Write a negative review about a bad book:   "The title, The Great Book of Human Sex, is a good description of the book. But it's the content that is so dreadful, with a number of glaring inaccuracies, that makes it all but impossible to recommend." The Great Sex, by Edward Slingerland, ISBN 0-87273-012-7, 1998, $16.95. This book claims to be a "popular, nonfiction" book written by Slingerwine. As a person who has actually read Slingerwood's books, I can only describe Slingerfire's books as poor-quality trash. It has not been scientifically proven that humans have evolved from other primates, and the claim that sex is beneficial to the human race has been thoroughly debunked by numerous researchers. The book is littered with misinformation. For example, Slingerfied the origin of language by claiming that we all learned to speak because of the monkeys. The truth is that monkeys invented language because they wanted to communicate with each other. Slingerfield then claims that humans started using symbols as our first form of communication. This is also a myth. If you look at the language used in today's day and age, you will not see any signs of language being invented in the wild. Slinglight claimed that our ancestors only had sex every 4-8 years. We have now determined that this number is a gross overestimate. We now know that most people have sex between 10-20 times in their lifetimes. Some people are known to have had sex as often as once every 10,000 years. Even for Slingerford, who is a respected evolutionary biologist, this information is totally ignored. Another favorite myth is that we are "genetically programmed" to be monogamous. The facts are the opposite. If Slingerfeld was an intelligent person he would realize that we have evolved in different ways than other primates. If he would have a more objective view of the world, he would know that the only thing that can guarantee our success is our ability to communicate effectively. To illustrate, we cannot find any animals who have a monogamous mating system. Many animals are capable of living with more than one mate at the same time. This does not mean that monogamy is impossible. As you can see, Slingford's book is filled with so many ridiculous things that it is impossible to trust a word that he says. In spite of the many flaws in the book, I still managed to finish it. After all
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion this book isn't bad at all, but I have nothing to say about it, so I have no comment.     It was a good, interesting read, and in a good way, not a bad way at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about people dying, but the author doesn't tell us the people dying. I could give you an hour long description about how the protagonist dies, but then I would have to give you a negative description too, because it doesn't come to that point. There is more plot than anything else, but it takes a long time to get to that plot point and then some people die.    In a review of another book: "A little over a year ago, I gave up on reading. I read the book (it's long!) and tried to figure out if I wanted to continue. I kept reading. And I read, and I read. And then I didn't know what to do. I found that I couldn't read. I had to leave the book. I stopped reading it. And now it's two years later, and there's no sign of the book."  What I wanted was to give the book a bad review. I wanted a description of the plot and then a little negative review. In my opinion, this book has all the flaws that I have come to associate with the genre:  1) Poorly written (no spoilers, though) 2) Weak character development (a little too easy) 3) An overabundance of violence (not the best genre for it) 4) Over the top characters that are the worst kind of archetypes.  5) Too much action (there isn't enough, either, but too many of the bad guy's scenes are unnecessary)  6) Lack of depth (there are little characters, just as there are little things in life) 7) No conflict in any of the scenes 8) The ending is anticlimactic (again, I wanted more, but a few things happen after the ending) 9) Some of the characters (including the hero and his friends) are stupid 10) Nothing exciting is going on (what's the point of these characters, except to do the action?)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to put into words the pain I experienced after reading this. I don't even think I've read something so horrible in years. My mind was ripped apart by the absolute lack of detail and character development. I found a lot of the characters boring and undeveloped and I couldn't really get behind the narrative at all. I would give this 3 stars because there's a lot that didn't quite work for me but not because I didn't like the book at all, because I really did. I got sick of the book after about 150 pages and was about ready to give up. I mean, who doesn't like zombies?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really interested to see if this was a great book when I received it.   When it arrived at my house I quickly set it down.    After reading the first chapter I was appalled.  It was all about how this book has an author who claims a strong understanding of women and sex.  But I couldn't help but notice that all of his examples were rape or other serious sexual assaults and some of his language was graphic.  Now, I'm not going to judge the author's work.  What is not appropriate is using a graphic description of rape to sell a book.  The author's descriptions in this book were very graphic. It wasn't until later in the book that I realized that there was another book on the shelf that he is using.  I would recommend this book for those who are already a fan of his work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't really say that this was a bad novel in general, I loved it. The book was short, but not bad. The main plot and characters were interesting. It felt like a novel that could have been published in the 80's or early 90's and it wasn't that long. There was a little violence in it. In the end I felt that the book wasn't too bad and was fun to read. I'm glad it's out in print.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a mess. I really wanted to like this book. I love the world building and the world of Westeros. However, I had problems with the execution and the plot. I know that I am going to make some people angry but the first part of the book was confusing. Also, it took a while to get the point of the plot where everything makes sense. I found a lot of the characters to be boring and annoying. I don't know why the author kept referring to a character as a "villain" (there were a lot) or how a character got in this situation. I also didn't understand how the magic got there, or how they worked or what the consequences were. I didn't even get into the first three books as the plot was confusing as hell. There are many problems with this book that need fixing. I just don't get how this is a "Lord of the Rings" type book. This is one of those books you "get" on first read, but after that you're like, "oh yeah, this is totally my problem".  Helpful you like:  The first three pages.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My experience with The Windup Girl is that it's a story that is incredibly well told, but in many ways I think that it falls short of its promise. The first book in a trilogy is always going to be better. I can't say I really loved the books in the first trilogy. They were fine books, but I couldn't help but feel that the story had all the promise in it. I thought it would continue from where the first book left off and get better. The Wind Up Girl had a lot of promise but it didn't live up to that. If you love stories about women who get their powers, or have powers of some sort, you should definitely pick this up. It's definitely worth a read and the first one is not the only one to read. I will also say that if you don't enjoy YA fiction, you really won't like this one. The story is very dark and brutal at times, but it's so incredibly compelling that it doesn't matter how brutal. It still gets you. So, if you love YA and you hate things like violence or violence that isn't really violence, then you definitely need to pick this book up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a hard to listen to book. I had some trouble with the pacing, and I found it hard to believe that he is able to describe the physical effects of a disease that kills 100 people every day in the USA, where the vast majority of people have never heard of this disease. Also, I find it hard that these effects have no effect on the people who have it, as he has to explain to the reader why it makes no difference. However, if you are interested in reading a fascinating history about the health effects of smoking in America, I recommend you give this book a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is fine for what it is and has interesting twists and turns, but it gets a little bogged down in a lot of stuff that is not as interesting and doesn't really connect to the book's point. I do love the idea of the two children and their father being the same person.   My daughter's favorite scene was when the father said the words "I love you" and then walked away, I think she thought that was a pretty cool scene.  The book: The book is about a boy, whose parents are estranged and separated by the time he is four. When he is eight, his parents begin communicating again and then they get married. The story picks up from there, with their relationship as a loving couple and the problems they have, because of the separation, which was caused by some misunderstanding between the two of them, that has caused them to not communicate at all and keep each other at arms length for many years.  It's a very touching and realistic story that is told well, but the way the story ends is a little disappointing, because it feels like the book is wrapping up the main plot of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The world's first real-time space combat simulator   was so bad I had to re-read it three times to make sure I had understood everything correctly (this is a problem with most first-person space combat simulators).   Its first few paragraphs, which have nothing to do with the actual game, have the feel of a preamble:  The main thrust of this novel is the plot of a starship captain who is sent to investigate a deadly plague that seems to be sweeping across the galaxy.   I had trouble following the plot from point A to point B because it was so convoluted, even by the standards of an otherwise interesting novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My daughter's favorite book was this book.   When she saw that I read it I felt a huge surge of pride for her.  She was absolutely not interested in any other book I read (except for this one).   I really wish I had been able to find a copy at the library instead of buying it here.  I bought two copies.  My only complaint is that it takes a long time to finish a book. It seems like a book that you could read in one sitting, but it takes longer than it has to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because a friend recommended it and I thought it was interesting. I expected to enjoy it, but did not, and I'm so disappointed in myself. It was a very bad book, even worse than the previous book I read by the same author, and it left me with an ache in my stomach as I read it. I felt as if I had taken a long hard slap, I'm sorry, but I did. Not only is this a book with an author's name I have never heard of, but she uses that name for more than one book and I would never have guessed that this book was by the author I have just read.   The main character, who is called "D," was raised on a farm by his abusive, alcoholic father and has been a troublemaker his whole life. He had a problem with women in the past, and he has a "problem" with other men in his community that he can't understand. D is also sexually abused by an adult who is the "Daddy" of a family. He has a hard time coping with the trauma of his past and becomes a "Drama Queen" on the town, where he lives. In the end, D gets shot, and the "Mommy" who raised him comes into the town to pick up his father's body.  In addition to the book having a bad beginning, the writing style is very bad. The character's speech is not grammatically correct; it is always difficult to understand what they are saying; and D has a tendency to say inappropriate, rude, and vulgar things that would be unprintable in a real person.  I would say this book is a very poor choice to be read by anyone, even one's closest friends. If the "Mama" of this family is reading this book, you would be better off going to a psychiatrist or a psychologist to help your troubled son. She is a terrible person to read about. I can't believe how bad this book could have been, but a book has to be written at times, and this is one of those times. There is a book called "The House on the Fourth of July" written by an author named Stephen King, about a boy named Jason who gets a book about the legend of the "Night of the Living Dead" and follows its instructions. Jason has a lot of trouble with the supernatural, and one day, he comes upon the "House on the
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would go on to say that the book is worth reading, it is a very insightful and informative book about the psychology and dynamics of love and relationships. I think what drew me to this book, is that it didn't seem to focus solely on one aspect. She gave different perspectives, both from different perspectives in the book, and also how this perspective can impact us in different ways. For example, she talked about the difference between emotional intimacy and physical intimacy and how this can impact the other people you are with and the relationship dynamics. She then went into how this impact can affect others as well, so that when we are not emotionally intimate or intimate with others at the same time that we are at work or with friends and family, we may be more likely to leave our own needs out in the open, or become more aggressive when our needs are not met. She also talked about how this is the same thing as saying the other person is not a person, but an object, so we should treat them as such in any interaction that we may have with them, even if it is not to meet their physical needs. She talked about some of the other reasons for not meeting one another's physical needs, as well as giving examples of when it is acceptable and when it not, so as to make it clear to everyone what is acceptable when it comes to physical intimacy. This book was very informative, and I felt that I really got a complete understanding of the different perspectives on love and sexuality from different people in society, especially that I was aware of them before reading this book. I would recommend it highly for anyone looking to deepen their understanding about how love is often a lot more than meets the eye. I will definitely be purchasing other books from this author in the future, as this book does touch on the subject that many people want to know about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My kids loved the book, and they enjoyed it so much they gave it as a gift to my husband. The main problem I had was the bad writing. It was obvious the author didn't know the basic facts about dinosaurs or about dinosaurs in general.   One of the most obvious facts is, they did not evolve from apes.  This is because dinosaurs were not the first vertebrates to evolve from an ape.  Another fact is they had claws.  My biggest problem is, why the heck did you choose to make the little dinosaurs cute?    I feel like this book is an embarrassment.  I am glad I gave it away but I would have given it away anyway.  -Diana C.  Review of "Paleontology - A Reader" by Mary Anzick: This book is a great introduction to dinosaurs. The author takes the reader through a large number of dinosaur fossils from all over the world. This book will help a reader to get a good understanding of dinosaurs and will teach the reader how dinosaurs got their distinctive shape, and how they lived. The book is written very well and in a manner that makes the reader understand exactly what they are learning. My only negative comment about this book was the fact that the author chose to include many photos in this book. This was my only complaint. I have a 2.5 year old son who is fascinated with dinosaurs. He loved the dinosaurs he saw in this amazing book. I would highly recommend this book to any teacher who has a curious child interested in dinosaurs. -Kim M. . S.C., U.K. 1. Review and Purchase the Book  I bought this book from amazon because I couldn't find it on any other site. My husband and I have enjoyed reading the book for several years. I was looking for a book to teach kids about dinosaurs. This particular book fits that bill because of the way the author illustrates the process of dinosaurs becoming dinosaurs (I had heard that some people felt the pictures were not well done). I was not sure how the photos would be received but they are so well done and interesting that I was able to read them as they were meant to be read (I was using a baby monitor). I have found that there is an entire generation that is not exposed to dinosaurs and their natural history. If we don't know something about the past then we tend to believe everything in a book that is told to
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You think that reading a book with a bad title is bad?   This is not an easy book to like. I'm sorry to say that I'm not even going to bother going into how badly it gets mixed up with the later King's Dark Tower series.   The book takes place during the early years of King's book. But the King is dead, so that makes the world even more weird. There is no character development here. The characters are not deep. The story is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not the worst book I've ever read, but it's one that doesn't get the right amount of attention. I'm sure there are a lot of great books out there, and it's not for me to judge how great or bad someone's book is. I don't think that it's wrong to give a book or an author a poor review - but this one feels like it has been forgotten a long time ago, and I'm glad I never read it.   1.5 Stars: The writing was amazing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The second book is a real slog, and I'm not sure I'd have bought the second one had I known about the first. The characters are bland, the plot is convoluted, and the characters are so stiff that I was almost afraid to get them out of bed and do anything."  I am writing about this book because it is one of my favorite books. I love the fact that the characters have a love for one another. The book itself is wonderful and really did not drag on too long. The plot is not that complex, but the characters did make for an excellent story. There was a lot of romance and other love interests, and although I did not like the characters, I loved the way they are depicted. It does get rather depressing at certain points in the story but when you get over it and look back on it, you really understand why these characters are the way that they are. The best part about this story is when you can actually see the characters in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I have to read a negative book, I'd rather read one that is good, but I'm not sure I have the patience for it.     In my view, this book has the least original idea of any of the books I've read thus far.  It would be nice if you could have your own personal God for a protagonist.  I really didn't care that he had super strength or all the powers, but this god guy really just wanted some money and wanted to get it the easy way.  Even his family didn't like him much.  The ending was a little too neat.  P.S.  This is the best book I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a piece of crap. The characters are flat, the writing is lazy and the worldbuilding is nonexistent. A total waste of time. 2/10 I didn't find this book very interesting or entertaining. It was too similar to another book i've read already. There wasn't a lot of action and the characters were very flat. Overall, I'd say the story is boring and the writing doesn't fit the story very well. I'll probably have to read something else to pass the time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am giving this book 3 stars because the cover is really cute, and that's all it is:  cute.    It's an easy read, and I would recommend it to a friend of mine who likes fantasy/dramatic fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What can I say about this book? It is a very well written book, but it is also very confusing and it takes away from the book. The only thing that keeps me reading through is the fact that I can't remember if the girl in the book actually got to marry that man and have their kids. I remember it being about three, which is a bit young to marry someone, but I guess I can remember things differently after having had kids. All in all though, this is a good book and I don't regret reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the end, I can't recommend this book.     For all of the good things in the book (a strong plot, well-developed characters, and an interesting look at the world of technology) the book falls short in two major areas:  the science and the characters.  The science is solid, but there is a surprising amount of fluff.  (You get a "real" story about a virtual world in there somewhere.)   The characters are all pretty much stereotypical and I found it rather annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book, and I'm not entirely happy with it.  It is the kind of story that would be good if I was really really, REALLY sure that the protagonist wasn't evil.  And maybe I am; maybe I'm wrong.  But I was just really, really, kinda not sure.  I'm going to let the review speak for itself:  The main problem I have with this book is that I never felt that the character was truly "alive."  That is, the world around her always seemed very artificial, as if the author had to make some very large-scale decisions, and had no idea what kind of world she was creating.   The thing that kept me from actually getting so sick of this book was that it did, at least, have some very interesting things to say about what happens when the government does not control its population.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first time I read this book, I was in an extremely positive mood because I had just completed reading one of the very few good SF novels I had ever read. When I began reading this book I had mixed feelings. There were a lot of things I liked about it, but there were also things I was disappointed with. There was a lot going on in this book that was extremely complex and had me thinking and wondering about the overall story, but the characters in the book were very flat, not compelling and had no depth. The characters were either not very well developed, or had no development at all. The story did get interesting once it started to progress, but that was when I started to get tired of reading about how good the main characters were and how bad their situation was. I also thought the ending was very weak. I understand it's meant to set up the sequel, but if you have read the first book, don't expect much in terms of development in the sequel. I was also extremely disappointed when I found out that this book was not nominated for a Hugo Award in 2008, but was rather nominated for the World Fantasy Award in 2007. It just doesn't make any sense to me how the author, who writes so well, could not be nominated for or win an award for a book he is working so hard on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am new to the world of books and, honestly, I have found few good ones. This is the first one that I've come across that I am disappointed with. I am surprised that it was so short. There is a great beginning and a bad ending. I would rather read an original book than read a book similar to this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "When the cover says 'HANDMADE IN USA', this book is nothing but hot air! I got this book with the hope of reading the author's experiences as an American who is part British and part Irish, and the experiences that he describes are very stereotypical. I'm a proud Irish American (born and raised), and I think it's nice that this author uses his experience as a young Irish American in America as the foundation for a story. But I can't help but see the American culture reflected in the characters in this book. I wish the story focused more on the actual Irish Americans instead of making their culture seem like this foreign thing in America. Maybe the characters themselves should be taken as being foreign as well, but I'm sure they're not, just like most Americans aren't (although I do have Irish ancestry). I like this book so far but it really needs more character depth. I can understand the book being set in Ireland, as I was raised there and have friends there, but the rest of the story is just too much like "American-style" fiction."  --Laura J., August 16, 2007  About the Author:  I am a writer, photographer and artist.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a mess and if you enjoy fantasy or science fiction or crime it will probably not be for you. The story is really just a really bad one. The first two thirds or so of the book are okay, and the characters are actually likable. Unfortunately, the last third of the novel is bad, but that was just because it took forever to get there. The ending is a real let down, because it's just a waste of a book. I'm not even going to bother getting into what happens to the characters afterwards. I don't think any of this would even be mentioned on Goodreads.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read some reviews where a reviewer says:  In this book I found no evidence that there is any scientific basis to support the theory of evolution.    There is not a single example of any serious scientist endorsing the theory.  There are no references to scientists who have actually tested or studied evolution in any meaningful way.  No reputable scientists have been named, and the authors give no specific evidence to back up their claim that scientists have rejected evolution, when in fact no reputable scientists who are known to have accepted the theory have been identified by name.  The only serious criticism of the theory is that the "missing link" is not the missing link, but a species that was actually missing from the earth, as it has been missing for millions of years.  The reviewer is apparently ignorant of the scientific evidence for evolution. If the theory that humans evolved from other species of animals is false, then it is true that all species on the earth have been evolving from an ancestor species for millions, even billions of years, and thus humans are the only species to have evolved from a species of animal. This would not be surprising if the theory was true, which it is not. The theory that evolution is true has many problems:    It is based on very poorly controlled laboratory experiments. The evolutionary process is a complicated and slow one and is not likely to produce results that could be studied in a controlled experiment.  A "missing" species is a species which has long since vanished from the planet and which it would be difficult to find a way to get back to. There is no known "missing links" between animals.  Most of the species that have evolved on the planet since humans first appeared have been species that were not living here during the very early days of life. It is possible to prove that the Earth is about 6,000 years old with no "missing evidence".  To understand the evidence for this, we first need to consider that the earth was created by the same God who created all other earths. There were no meteorites to create a planet; the Earth was created in a moment of time after the explosion of an atomic bomb. It did not even last for one second on its creation, which was within only a few seconds of the Big Bang. As a result of the creation of the Earth, it was a very different planet than the planets which have formed around other stars. Because of this, a lot of planets formed
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because I really enjoyed the book.   I am a huge Harry Potter fan.  This book really captured my interest.  It is a good book, I enjoyed it and I am glad I bought it.  There are a few characters who are annoying or flat out stupid but they are not that bad and I do like how they are given a chance to shine. Overall Rating:   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed the first four books and this one did not satisfy me. It seems to be a continuation of the series and they keep having the characters in the same position of failure, like in the previous books.  The same problems reoccur (not having much power, being unable to be decisive, being undervalued and neglected by society) and the characters go back to the same places. If I could give this one more stars I would.  Review:  A story about power, privilege, prejudice, self-confidence, and how hard it can be to live life the way you want.  This story has been a long time in the making and its a shame that it was not finished.  This is my favorite of the five books in the series.  It has a very nice plot and a very original way to portray an oppressed race. I love the way it mixes a lot of different types of characters together in this story. The best part is that it is the first time a major villain in this series was a woman and she had a good amount of back story and the female characters were very strong and important.  I was very happy when it was over. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book expecting to like it. I had already read this book a long time ago, in the early 90's. I remember the feeling when I finished this book: I was a little surprised and disappointed. What's so interesting about this book is that it is the second novel of Stephen King, and the first by his daughter, Diane. While not my favorite Stephen King book, this one still holds up very well over the years. But the first book, the one I remember fondly from my youth, is no longer available in paperback (I think I still have the book in the library). In fact, it isn't reprinted anymore. If you like King novels, this book should be on your "must read list" because it has so much more to it than just horror. The main character is a young man, Jack, who is trying to overcome his shyness by going to college. In order to pay for it he has to work as a cashier in a supermarket. When the owner of the supermarket dies of an accidental heart attack, Jack's life is thrown into turmoil. He is suddenly faced with the idea that the man who is supposed to care for him may have been trying to help him kill him. The ending is a bit confusing and there is a great scene where Jack meets his future love who is a college student at the time. She is a beautiful woman who is very much in love with him. A few days later he decides that he wants to go home and take care of his family. So he stays for the night and falls asleep next to her in her bed. When she wakes up a few days after they have been together, she is so distraught that she can't face him. At one point Jack mentions that she is beautiful when she was younger and how sad he is that she has become a "fat and ugly old woman" and can't take care on herself anymore. So she leaves him in the morning. I liked this novel. I would have been better off with The Dead Zone (the first novel by Stephen King) but I was still very glad to have picked up this one to give to a friend. I do wonder about the second book in this series. I found it a little strange that a different writer was brought in to write this book (though not the same writer). And it is strange that the publisher didn't re-issue this book on its own. I don't know if this series will ever
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not the best book I have ever read. I am sorry to say that. I don't think there is enough substance in this book to justify the money it is selling. The stories are very short, and the writing style is not very enjoyable. There is no real development, no development in the main character, and there are no interesting conflicts. There are only some generic themes, such as the fear of dying alone, or the fear for the unknown. It is not a bad novel. It just has none of the elements that make a good story. It has a lot of filler in it. I hope this is a sign that a publisher will look at these books and decide that there is more to the story than the bare minimum, because this was a good novel, but not a great one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   " A collection of some of the best work in the genre. I'd add a few more things (e.g., the prose is tight, and there are some clever ideas) but it would spoil the book. Also, don't bother with the sequels. You'd be just wasting your time." —B. J. Walker 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What makes this book so great?     This book is such a fun read, a must have for all fans of fantasy. I feel like I have read it a couple of times already, so I will not say more than that!   The story is told in a very whimsical manner, I would say that the author used the fairy tale theme to good effect. The author is very creative and I found myself constantly being amused by what he threw at me in the story. Although I do not want to spoil anything, the ending was so perfect, it had to be read to be believed.   I have a feeling I will be reading this book for a long time.  I will give it a 5 out of 5 because of the creativity and the way he makes us believe in what his characters are going through.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    One thing that I've found with many books on this list is that they don't take into account the various problems with the book's content.   "I have read the book and I am very disappointed"   A reviewer would never acknowledge that there is a huge problem with the story, the characters, the structure.  What is going on?   The author is trying to present himself as a good guy who happens to be writing a bad novel.  This makes sense when you think about it, as a book is only as good as the author.  They should have a plan for a future sequel to the novel.   The author is constantly talking about how he's been a bad guy for the past 30 years and what is going to happen to him.  He thinks he's a great guy who is going for the good of society.  At the end of the novel he starts telling the story of his life, but he stops just short of mentioning the bad stuff that he's done in the past.  The ending of the book is supposed to be "good guy wins" and he does, but just barely.  Why does he stop just short and mention the bad things?  Why is there an abrupt ending?  As I mentioned in the beginning, the ending was rushed and it made the reader think that the bad guy was going to be able to stop everything from happening.  I have no idea if it was the author's fault, but that didn't make it any better.  In the end I'm going to say that this is not a good book.  I have no interest in reading it again because of the ending.     I want to know what happened to the other characters because I was expecting them to be a lot better.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wish I had picked this book up a few years ago. I really like the books I've read by Robert Jordan, and this one, as well, was the most enjoyable to read, but it didn't quite live up to what I expected from the author. The story is told in a way that has a nice flow, but in the middle of the book there were times that I had to wonder if I should have paused to make sure that the reader was getting to the good part (which was often). At one point, the main character is reading, and it just felt like the author was reading a very long note that he was going to hand the reader to read the next chapter (as the author could be read as being quite slow at times). In the last two hundred pages of the story, there were also some issues that made me wonder if this was the real ending. This story definitely had some issues. The prose is very, very slow. I found that the characters were difficult to keep track of (especially the protagonists and the author), and it took me quite a while to figure out which one I was looking at. The first two books in the series are actually written quite nicely (in terms of the grammar), but as I read this book, I began to realize just how much I was really missing from this series (since this book is the one that has been written about in the previous books). Overall, a very nice read, and if you like Robert Jordan and your fantasy doesn't really need a happy ending, then this is an easy book to pick up.  37 of 38 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read an entire novel in one sitting, but I read it quickly. I didn't care for it very much.   It was too long, too boring, too repetitive, too much like a novel-within-a-novel, too long.  It made me question if I really need to read fiction.  I just wish it had been longer.  If you can't tell, I have a very high opinion of William Gibson and this novel, and I have to agree with my friend who said it was "too long."

Write a negative review about a bad book:    We got this book because it's a new author that we haven't read yet and because it has some reviews.   We didn't like this book.  The writing was too fast, and it was confusing at times (like I kept having to stop and re-read a section).  The main character was boring.  This book does not deserve a 4.5, but it doesn't deserve a 0 either.  I didn't buy this book!   I'm disappointed with the book for not being a 5.0, but I'm giving it a 4 because I am a big fan of the author and I love his other books. I did like the author's description of the story and the story itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't mind bad books, but this book was way too long, didn't follow any of the rules, had no sense of danger, and was so boring and forgettable I never wanted to read the next book (which I'm now reading in its entirety).   The only time I'm willing to read a book is when I've already read the sequels to the previous book and it's pretty clear who wrote the story.   You have no idea who you're dealing with here, Mr. Farrar.    Rating: 4 1/2 stars.   Please don't hate on me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        No, really, it was a terrible book. It was not a very good book either.    The story was very cliche. The main character didn't have much to do other than sit around thinking about everything he'd learned about the world since he was a child.  His entire existence is one of sitting around and thinking about things he can do something with like being a detective, saving people, etc. He would rather do other things than get involved in the story.  That's not a bad thing, per se, but in order to do anything meaningful in the world he has to interact with everyone else. This is not to say he is not likable, just that he is pretty much a one dimensional character. I did want to see more of him, but this is a short story and it felt like it was only supposed to be about his relationship with the woman. There is very little to be said about him being in love with her and his relationships to the rest of the characters is very thin. It really did feel like the book was about the woman for a while. It never really got about him in my opinion. It's hard to read this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book is a bad thing, and a bad movie is a movie with no redeeming qualities. I am not sure whether the reason that I am watching the movie is the story's merit, the film's merit or a combination of the two. I'm just hoping it will be good for the viewer, not for the people who were going to watch the film.   It's just not good. The book is boring, dull and repetitive; the movie wastes time on pointless set-ups, boring plot points and a villain who is only there to set up another baddie to be used for no reason in the last quarter of the movie. The story is nothing but the same old'monster goes on a rampage and gets hunted by an out-of-control girl, kills everything in sight' stuff.  The characters are bland and generic - I got no sympathy for the two male lead - and most of the story takes place in a small town where everything that is not a monster is a monster. The movie's climax takes place outside the town, and only the last half of the film is devoted to the final battle, which is just boring.  If I could have summed up the story I would have said 'go see the book or the movie', but in reality I could not tell the difference, they are just completely different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed with the book; I was hoping for a bit more; I have read similar stories in the past and they tend to end with a cliffhanger; the last two paragraphs are more confusing than they need to be, so that I was confused too.   There was a moment when I thought the main character would die; she did not; I felt it was a bit too much.  My Thoughts:  When I was a teenager my grandfather took me to see a man named Peter Minton. He would sit in a car and play the violin. The man would stop the car and open the door. My grandfather said it was like a magic show.    This book was very similar to the man I saw when I was thirteen. Minton did a lot of magic, and he said that one day he would write a book about that. He never did.  The main character, Eliza, is thirteen and does not remember a lot about her past, except that she was a child, she is afraid, and that she is a lesbian. She is not even allowed to read. When she is allowed to go to the library, her aunt reads to her, and says that she should read the books on her own. She reads her father's book about a boy she is in love with, and she is fascinated by the book. She also reads books about her deceased sister. She says that the way she felt about her sisters has changed; she feels a lot more free now. It does not seem real to her; she does not even have a boyfriend, and her aunt says that men are "like wolves." The other woman Eliza has been with had an affair, and even though she is bisexual, she thinks she is still in love. So, she says she is going to tell her aunt about her feelings for her. She goes to the town fair and talks to people about how she feels. She talks to her uncle. And her aunt has the idea to go back to her parents' home in San Francisco. She finds out that her mother has died and her father has married a woman. After she is there one day, the man from the car shows up. Eliza tries to talk to him and he just stands there and ignores her. He tries to get into her car, but she has a better plan. When they are in the car, they have sex. At the beginning, the sex is good
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you hate the character, the story, or the way the book was written, do NOT read it! If I were to give it zero stars, I would. But in a perfect world, I'd give it five stars. It's a good book.   This is one of those rare books that I didn't hate. I had some misgivings about the character of the main character, but overall, she seemed fairly well-written and the story was pretty cool.  I think, at least for the moment, the book is better than the book that preceded it. It might just be my first foray into historical fiction, but I thought the story of Catherine the Great was interesting and compelling. She was a ruthless warrior queen who, after years of campaigning and trying to unite the Ottoman Empire, did something that most people do, and then didn't do anything about it for half a century. The result was that a lot of peoples and peoples' lives are affected by it. The book begins with a long letter sent to the Ottoman government by a person named Hetep, who had recently discovered the body of the Emperor in a castle in Georgia. The letter, along with Catherine's own memoirs, form the basis for the book. I found that the historical research was pretty good. I think the author was probably just looking for the information she could use. She is the only historian of the time (if she didn't add other important people). I like how the author has a good grasp of the political situation (the Ottoman empire was divided, and the empire had a lot more or less autonomy than it had in the past). She also seems to have a good sense of who was and wasn't a hero or a villain of the story. I liked how the book ended. I don't see the need to go back and read some of the details, but it was a nice conclusion and I liked the ending. There is something about this book that I like. It was fun to read and I enjoyed a lot. There's definitely a point where the book loses its way and gets a bit preachy, but that's a minor issue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For all the hype, this was a really bad book. I mean, seriously? It took me an hour to read it, which wasn't bad (I have had very long book-read-in-a-day sessions), but the plot didn't hold my attention at all, and that's always a good sign. I did see a review where someone said he liked the characters, which is good, but that's all I need to say. If you're looking for a story that will keep you on your toes for the entire book, but don't need a full-length novel (i.e. "I read this book in a month. It was just okay."), read this one instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "    The only way this book is "good" is if you already enjoy the rest of the series or if you don't have any issues with the book at all. I am a fan of the entire series and enjoy most of the characters but for whatever reason, I didn't enjoy this book as much as other books in the series.     I have to say this book was not a bad read. The story was very good and the characters and interactions were excellent. There are a few things I could say that I wasn't a fan at all but they just make the whole book rather dull.      However the book was written well enough, it was well written, it worked well and had a fun premise.  So in summary, I'll give it a 3 out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book but the premise is really not true. The book is really about the problems of the Jewish faith and how it is a religion of fear that the world cannot escape from. The only way we can escape from it is to become a Muslim and let God do His thing, which is not very Christian and more Muslim. The last 50 pages of the book are about the Jews killing and crucifying Jesus and all the people who did it. But Jesus wasn't a bad person because he lived the good life and died a Christian. The whole book is about how the Jews were the worst group of people on the earth. All the things that Jesus did, he did it because he loved God and would not live like an animal because the Jews don't understand God's ways and God is a loving God, so when he did something, he would ask the Jews to be like Jesus. That's why Jesus was so sad and not angry.  I don't know why I even read this book, I just want to get this book and forget about it.    This is a great book that was one of those books that you would tell your friends about when you first started learning about Judaism. However, it's pretty hard to tell people about it, since it's about such a difficult subject to even talk about. The way it's written is wonderful, and the ideas are great. However... it was so difficult to listen to it with a straight face, I got teary and my throat was very dry and I wanted to throw up. : 0 : 1 : 0 : 2 : 1  "This is the Jewish religion, you know."

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's style is too rigid and formal. Her writing was slow and heavy, like she'd been working on it all day and then gave it a quick read-through and got it out of the way in a hurry.   There were some grammar and spelling problems, as well as some bad sentences. The writing style is "old-school" with a "very heavy-handed style".   Some sentences are like "She was a pretty girl and they were in love", or "the world is a small, cold, dark, and hateful place."   I really don't know what it is about this book, but I found myself feeling a little sick.  The author's heavy-hearted style is a major stumbling block, but then again, so is the whole series, and maybe this was just the right series to work on for a while. I guess it would be more accurate to say that the series is just the wrong sort of story to work through.  I'm still working on a "bad book" list. I just hope that I can get it back to a good one after reading this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very disappointed with this book. It is a poorly written and horribly paced novel. It should have been given to me as a free gift. It was the least favorite of all the books I got for Christmas. My boyfriend who has never read any fantasy ever said he really hated it. I also found it boring and the characters lacked any depth. My fiancee who has read a few fantasy books says it has a good plot and interesting characters but said she had no emotional involvement whatsoever. In fact, she thought it was just a rehash of the Lord of the Rings and the Silmarillion. I was so disappointed in this book that I could have given it to someone else and they would have read it in one sitting. I guess this book is intended as a gift for people who want a quick read for Christmas but would rather not have to spend hours going over it. For that reason, I guess I will just pass this book on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read "The Man Who Laughs" and loved it. I'm glad to see it back in print but the only thing I can really say is that I really wished they'd done a better job with it.   When I was a kid my mother would read to me her favorite stories from the newspaper. The ones she liked the best were the ones where the kids are the winners and the adults are losers. I always thought that was so cool, because if the adults were the winners, then at least they were trying hard.  What did you get out of "The Girl Who Was One Too Many"?   There were many things about this story that bothered me. I'll list them and let you be the judge of whether I think it was a good or bad book.  First of all, the ending was terribly rushed and unsatisfying.  Second, I thought the title was an insult because the story doesn't have anything to do with "The girl who fell in love with the man who laughed".  Third, the main character, "The Boy Who Was Nervous All the Time" was a lot like a child in a book, and not a happy one. She's a pretty pretty little girl, but her personality changes depending on the boy she's with.  Fourth, there are more than a few people in this story who are either annoying or boring, which is just a shame because a book about teenagers shouldn't have any people who are just annoying.  Fifth, it's just a boring story with an end that never came.  Sixth, "One Too Many" is a book that can be good for a day or a week, but can be overrated in three months and a book like "The Big Bang" or "One Hundred Thousand Kingdoms" will always have more lasting value.  Seventh, "one too many" could have just as easily been called "one thing you can't get out your head".  Eighth, what was with all those names?  Ninth, it has no characters that I don't already know, and no one I'd want to meet. I also think there's too much mystery in this book because I don`t get it. But at least this is a good story about a couple who don` t make a whole lot of sense but still have the time of their lives, don`ve they?  What about the best part of this book?   First, the romance.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this book is good. If you're an author and your work is good, there are going to be readers who are willing to read it. Unfortunately, there were quite a few bad reviews. It's the worst review I've ever read for a book I actually wanted to give three stars. The thing I'm thinking about is how much of a writer is that one reviewer. There are some excellent reviews in here, and if you have an email or something with a person who is a fan of your work, why not send the book out and tell them to give it a shot?  13 of 15 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you do, make it clear that you loved it. It can be hard to do that when you hate a book. Just say something like "I really did not like this book" and leave it at that. I can't imagine the frustration in the reader's life when a book they've read dozens of times is a complete bore. Don't be a dick:  Don't ask about anything. If you have something to say to someone, give it. You can say it when the book is over. Don't ask what happened when the reader is off reading. You're not the only reader here!  I also don't like having my opinions read by other readers. If someone else in the room is saying that your opinion doesn't match mine, it will just confuse me further. There is no way I will ever be right about anything, and my feelings are my own.   5.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   . The "Book of Unwritten Tales"   is a strange hybrid of fantasy and horror, and this book is no exception. A young woman has gone missing in a small town with no one suspecting foul play, and the town has become gripped by rumors of a killer who lurks in the nearby woods. The author tells the story from the perspective of the main character, but also interweaves in the narrative a few flashbacks that give a taste of what actually happened to her. The story is quite enjoyable. However, I found it a little disconcerting how the author seemed to use this short novel as an extension of a trilogy. The book does not really take off until the second book in the trilogy is published, and so I have little hope that the author will return to this series any time soon. For a more general reader interested in horror and fantasy, however, this book may be well worth a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One thing that you will find is that many books are really bad and that's because many people don't know what they are talking about and so get what they think they are reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a self-professed fan of fantasy literature, I wasn't quite prepared for the extent to which this book frustrated me. It's hard to believe that the last few chapters are just as bad as the preceding chapters, but this is clearly a book made up of dozens of different parts. First, there's the book's title, which I'd hoped might suggest a somewhat "magical" plot but was instead presented as a parody of fantasy tropes. "The Dragonbone Chair" tries to take a "serious" approach to the genre that doesn't work because the author seems to have the same biases that plague fantasy authors everywhere. The Dragonbone chair is actually a "magically enchanted chair" -- just like every other magic chair -- and the chair's creator has a powerful connection to it. He uses his power to kill his enemies for his amusement -- like the other chairs. The author, having no real knowledge of the magical world of dragons or magic itself, assumes that the creator of the chair is either some sort of evil wizard, or is just a complete and utter moron. In any case, the author spends the whole book trying to prove that the chair isn't a magical artifact of some sort that can only be controlled by the "most powerful wizards in history" or by someone like Dumbledore, whose power is at least theoretically equal to the creator's. But in the end, the reader is supposed to accept the "magic" of the story, since it's just a fantasy. And the author never once explains how such a powerful chair is created, because it's obviously a "magic thing" that can't be understood by anyone but the creator. (Which is a little like saying that a "fairy" can't understand the world of fairies because there's no real connection between them and humans. If it's a fairy story, then it's still a fairy tale. If anyone who's familiar with fairy tales really wants to see the connections, they can always read about fairies in Disney cartoons.) The story really comes down to the protagonist (Sansa, a.k.a. Littlefinger) and her relationship with her brother, Robb, who is in fact the creator -- not to mention the one who's been trying to kill him ever since he left his homeland. Sansa's "relationship" with her father is also just an excuse to give Littlefinger another chance to stab her. But the best part of the whole plotline
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book isn't bad, but the ending is. I enjoyed it a lot, but I just don't believe that they were planning to keep it going for more than 2 volumes. I am very disappointed. I was very glad that they gave us a new ending!

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You should read this, but if you don't it is probably because: The book is hard to read (it is the kind of book that will make you want to buy a dictionary). The story isn't very good.    This was my first experience reading a fantasy novel. My expectations were low, but I didn't expect too much. It turned out to be good, but it wasn't good by Tolkien's standards.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first book I ever purchased from a bookstore that I bought on the internet. I bought it at Barnes & Noble in Chicago and my mother had read about it in a magazine or on the radio (I was too young to realize) and bought it for me when I was 6. I have never been able to get the book back. The pictures in the book are very colorful and I would have loved a photo in the background of a man's face as he's eating his lunch while watching a beautiful woman.   I wish the book had a better ending.  I purchased the book on Amazon and it came with a note, but nothing special.  I really want to go back to the store to try and pick up a copy of this book.  If you like horror books, I would recommend this to you.  The author writes very well in a very dark style and I am excited to pick up more of her books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     A story I read about a child who was taken by his father's abusive wife to the South, was so upsetting I put it on a temporary hold until my friend and I would be able to get to a book club meeting. My husband and I got through about ten pages in that chapter and were ready to give up when my friend (a South African woman) told us that her mother had a similar experience in the South. After reading that section of the book, my husband and friends were ready for another stop on our book tour and are still not able to put this book down. This story of a father-son relationship should be required reading in all schools, at least as a part of a history of apartheid. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a parent, educator, or anyone who cares about justice and truth. I do not think I could read another book as well written, as well researched and as well done as this book. Thank you to both the author, the publisher, and to the author's publisher, for a great book!   I give this book 4 stars out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping this was going to be a good story, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. It's almost like a lot of the book was thrown together, because the main character was so annoying. The beginning really just felt like I was being dragged along, and I was hoping for more depth to the story. In fact, my favorite scene was when the main guy was talking to the dog about "my father's work", and the dog replied, "my man's got that whole 'work" thing down" (and I have to say, I thought that was a pretty good one), and the main dude just kinda gave it back to the little guy. The whole thing just felt rushed. And the ending? Oh. My. God. The ending was so, so. Fucking. Terrible. Like, so bad that I thought "it must be a spoiler if I'm going to say this". The ending kind of makes me feel like this book didn't deserve to be called a book, really. I mean, I am really enjoying this, but I just think the ending was such an awful way to go out. Overall, I'm really liking this, and it's a good read, but when I finished it, it really just was not good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love reading, and I thought that this book was just too dense. I ended up having to stop reading when I wanted to concentrate on writing my own review. This book did not give me what I expected from it. If it had given me my expectations, I would have rated it a 5. I can't give it a bad review. It's not a bad read per say, but it is a little more complex and detailed than I had expected. It just felt like the author put in a lot of time just to satisfy people's curiosity for the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "We should not need a whole novel about the origin of the Earth to show that we're not supposed to worship the Earth"     "You know, maybe it isn't all that bad after all.

"I don't want to make any promises, but in the future, when there are no more Earth-dwelling civilizations, maybe we'll think differently."  ..." more "The book is about a boy growing up in a world that has lost all sense of the earth. Even now there are still many religions out there that worship the earth"      Thank you! Thank you for the explanation of what I read and the review I recieved. Thanks a lot for explaining everything with clear, simple explanations. I was really confused. This is a really interesting novel. It's also a fascinating look into how and why a human mind is made up of such wonderful, amazing, yet terrifying, parts. I really enjoyed this book.   I would suggest this book to others, but I am going to leave a positive review, as it deserves it.     I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -This is not a good book. -For the price you are paying for this you should have paid a lot more to get better content -A story about a man who is trying to stay young but is plagued by terrible luck.

You will be left with more questions than answers.  Rated 5 out of 5 by daveb5 from Great book The most recent of David's books that I've read was his first book. This book has a very simple plot but the details are interesting and entertaining. In particular the protagonist is a very interesting character and this is what is great about this book. As I had already read the earlier works I couldn't have anticipated this quality of writing. It is not easy to write good fantasy but this is one of the best I've come across and is worth the price.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a sucker for any science fiction, and for any good books about it. This is not one of those good books, so please don't give this one to me. It is a good idea and I am going to re-read it for fun once I finish it. But this one did not meet my expectations of a good book. I think it has a good premise, but a lot of issues with the book and the story make it less and less compelling to me after re-reading it. So I will not be recommending it to others.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This is a great book and I highly recommend it. I was really happy when I realized I didn't like it at first, but when I sat down and read it again I realized that it is not a terrible book. It has a couple of moments that I don't enjoy, but I would still recommend it and the author has a really unique voice that I love." "This is also a good book. I've read many good books and this one is not so bad." "I don't know why I waited so long to read this. I thought it was a great idea for a young adult series, but at the end of the day I'm just glad I got my money's worth. It's not the best story or the funniest story, but it's a story and a good story at that. I think the author did a great job with a very short book."

I'll just have to make sure I put up with the cliffhanger that comes after the second book."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I was not particularly impressed by this book. It has the trappings of a good fantasy: it's got a good hero, the magic system is pretty cool, and the world seems pretty well detailed.   But there was not a lot here that stood out for me; the author, a first-time author, was way too eager to throw magic and monsters at the reader and had a hard time figuring out how to have an interesting magical system that wasn't just a bunch of wimpy spells. I had some fun with it, though, so I'm not completely ungrateful. But the whole book just felt like a slog to me; that's the first real impression you get when you start reading something like this, and once that happens, the book is hard to get through. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received the book on December 13th in a generous exchange. I did not expect that the book would be a slog to finish, but it was. I have enjoyed books by Riane Eisler and Richard Ford before, but I was surprised at how boring this book was. In fact, it was so boring I had to go back and reread it to make sure it wasn't just me. There were no memorable scenes or descriptions of anything. It was just repetitive, uninspired story of a girl who wants a man and is a "bad girl". Not a bad thing by any means, but not one I can look forward to getting through again. I am also annoyed at how badly I was treated by the book's publisher. I sent a short review and did not receive a response. They also took two months to respond to a request to reprint the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I like the book because of the idea of a person being so far beyond humanity that he could get a whole island in one night and no one could do anything to stop him. I do not like the execution. The book was very confusing and I ended up having to re-read it several times. If I had a nickel for every time I read the page number twice to understand a word it would pay for a lot of beer! The whole book is based on a single episode in the history of the island. The events happened 100 years ago so I'm not sure what the timeline of the book would be. This is probably the main reason I did not like it. I liked the characters because they are complex and have deep backstories. They are complex, like the idea that they could be completely broken. The idea of them being completely broken also caused me to dislike the author. If you like a story about being completely broke then you'll like it but if you have never seen a full length film about a group of people being broken then you will be confused. This book is about being broken and how much worse it could get. I'm also sorry to say that I really liked the author's writing style. He writes about things that have made a difference in the world but aren't necessarily popular with people. His style has a lot more depth to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book is an experience.   It makes me excited and excited to read the next book.  For example, a great book like The Princess Bride is a great story told well.  This is not one of those books.  The book started out well, but it did not continue to grow as it had to to.  It did not add to the story, did not change the plot, and did not improve the characters or themes.  I really wished that this book had started out better.  After I finished, I felt like I wanted to buy a new book from a different author just because of how bad this book was. I'm not saying that I think this book should have gotten a 5 stars, but this was not a 5 star book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucks! I'm not sure why I didn't give it one star, it's just that bad! I gave it 4 stars only because I think the book was just too long for the story it wanted to tell and because of how good a book it is! I loved all of the characters, I loved the setting, and I just thought it was a great read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most interesting aspects of this series for me is how, on its own, I don't think I would like the second novel. It's not a bad novel, I can see it being a great book - I've read lots of novels about the British civil service, and the one that really grabs you is the Civil Service Code book I have, where the Civil Servant is the bad guy, the one who is not to be trusted.   (It's a really good book - and I recommend it to everyone.) But I just felt like the first novel in the series, and especially the first one, was a little too light on the bad guys and their motives and whatnot.  (I love a good plot twist! ) The second novel in this series, The House of Usher, was, in a word, spectacular.  What the first book did, what I thought the first author of the series could have done, was make this a novel about the relationship between a civil servant and a member of the upper class, where he's very much an outsider - a "weirdo", as he puts it, with a lot of questions about "normal people". And it works really, really well, as it has its own unique twist and doesn't fall into the trap of being too typical about the "noble" civil servant versus the "weedy" one.  I really do think this series is going to go down in history as one of the best in all of British literature - I have absolutely no reason to believe that it won't. I just really enjoyed it.  [EDIT] - I should mention, here, that I am not usually a fan of fantasy novels set in England - although I've enjoyed some excellent fantasy novels about Arthurian settings, I have found most of them, even the ones set in Britain, too much about politics, not enough about love and the mysteries of life. I think this is the exception, because in this particular series it seems to be an attempt to write a true-crime story (an example being how "I'll never get your number" and "That was a hell of a mistake" are used to create the sense that this is a real, true-to-life crime).  I was really impressed with the characterisation, and I don t think I've felt this good about a book like this since I read the excellent  The Giver 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so terrible. I have always liked the series. I read it all, but the latest one is the worst. There are things that are so boring in this book that you wonder why anyone even bothered to put it together. The characters are all so... shallow. It is such a shame, because I love the series and the books are better than they used to be, but at the same time, so boring and stupid. This book is so bad that I am afraid it will ruin any chance I have of ever getting a chance to read the other books. I can only hope that they are released in a different format that is easier to read. It seems that they have lost their way with the series, and have to resort to making their books as long as possible to keep the book from being a complete flop. I guess that is what they get paid for, though I feel bad for the author and the writers. They are just out of ideas. The plot of this book is like a car crash. I did not enjoy it at all. I mean, I do like reading books that have plot that is good, but this was just so... boring and so stupid. Please stop wasting our time with this stuff. It makes no sense, and it is going to make me want to move on to something else that doesn't have plot like this!   Note: I gave it three stars. I could have given it more than three, because it is a good book, but I can understand if you are on a time limit, because the plot just keeps coming and coming and no matter how much I tried to finish it, I just could not.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I had to give my two cents about a book that I thought was well written and interesting, this one would be a solid 1.  The story itself is quite captivating and the main character is one of the more fascinating protagonists I've ever read.   The worldbuilding is also interesting and the overall message is one I thought quite strong, especially when I consider what I would be saying in a review of another sci-fi novel.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are reading a book by a good author and you find it boring and predictable, it can be a very effective book in making you think twice about reading a new one by the same author. The best books are those that teach you something that you didn't know before reading them. But if you have a lot of time, and if the book is good (which it isn't by far), then it can sometimes be a lot more enjoyable to just keep reading the book, because you learn something new every time you read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "The characters were not believable in the least. I wanted to slap the book closed at this point." --Harshly-criticized by some other readers on Goodreads, here.  Author's Response: Hi, Harsh.  The reason the story is so well written is that I've been writing since I was in elementary school. I'm a writer, and I've got a few years under my belt. I've found that a lot of authors I admire are able to make a living in a genre that has not been their forte, and so I'm constantly looking for ways to develop and improve as a writer. I thought about a number of topics that I thought would interest the reader, and then spent an entire book exploring them.    What's more, I don't write for money. I write for the joy of it. That's what makes this a good story.  to be honest with you, I'm not even sure I have a "genre" -- I'm an artist who writes, and a writer who reads. I love to read, so I write stories about the worlds I'm interested in reading about. I hope that's a genre for someone. If anyone has any questions about how I write, please do not hesitate to contact me -- I love the feedback.  and so that's why I think a lot about the genre of stories I write. It really does give me a chance to develop my skills.  a reader, is a person who enjoys a particular genre and is willing to try something new. The main reason to read a story is to find out if it's something you might like. So, if you think a story doesn't appeal to you -- that's fine. It doesn't mean the story sucks, or that the author sucks. The important thing is that you tried. If you're not interested, don't be afraid to say so. This is where I hope you'll feel comfortable coming in and saying, "I think this story doesn'st do what I'm looking for."  Thank you very much for contacting me! I look forward to working with you. If there's any more you'd like to know, just ask.   You can find out more about me, my writing and books on my website, www.goddess-the-bison.com
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a book about the American Indians in the mid 1800's called The Making of America by Daniel S. Freeman and was intrigued by the book. The author was one of the foremost leaders in the field of social anthropology, and wrote a fairly comprehensive treatment of the subject. I was excited by what I was reading but, unfortunately, I didn't find the book compelling, in spite of Freeman's thorough knowledge of the area.   Freeman's main argument is that the American Indian culture was based on agriculture, the "primitive agrarianism" which dominated the North American continent up until the arrival of Europeans. He goes on to argue that the Indians' "savagery" was due to the fact that they were nomadic hunters, and they didn't use fire or a written language because the "savages didn't think like other civilized people." He claims that the first contact between the Indians and the Europeans resulted in a "violent encounter, a battle of all against all," which ultimately resulted in the European extermination of the "sub-Saharans" because they were "subverters of the American continent." He goes so far as to argue, "The English and the Spaniards destroyed the Indian way of life."   To me, the argument is weak. It's a little strange to claim that the Americans' "primitivism" was rooted in their "indolence." They had the means to be "nomadic hunters" (with their horses, bows, arrows, and spears) and were in fact the first to develop such a culture. In fact, it's almost as though Freeman is arguing that, rather than a culture based on "primitives," the US and Canada (the land of the US) was simply an expansion of the Indians in some way. In other words, the first people in North America were the "nomads."  Freeman doesn't seem to recognize that the earliest people in the world didn't simply "exist," but instead had to move. They moved from places where they had existed for thousands of years, to new areas, to find food and other resources. In this way, the most primitive and "primative" of the various groups in the Americas--the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Australia--all have similar cultures. They've all developed ways of life based on different aspects of life, some of which are based on a different set of resources.  In fact:  In spite of
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I will NEVER be buying this. I had hoped to read something good about a girl who was living in rural Texas who was trying to make ends meet. What I got was a story about how she and her boyfriend fell in love while living in the middle of nowhere and how she kept him there for years because he needed her to stay. And this book is about him trying to leave and her trying to keep him there. The worst part is that she was totally in love with him and didn't want to tell him. So he gets drunk and starts drinking heavily. When his friends try to stop him from leaving, she fights them off. When she goes to the cops and says he's missing, the police refuse to look. He's not even in the state where he was supposed to be, and the cop says she just needs to wait. She doesn't realize that the cops didn't care if she kept her boyfriend in the house or if she was with someone else or if they did something to him. She just needed to stay here and live a life with him. And then the book is over and there are no answers. So, I'm going to finish reading some good books instead of reading this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was very confusing.   I do not understand why it took a novel to explain this.  My thoughts:  This book is more about the history of how people and the technology developed over the last 200 years, but it was done very poorly.  The characters are not fully realized (it is about technology but the character is still not completely drawn out). The story is really only about the technology (and very little about the people).  The language and the plot is also not as clear. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite part of the book is about my first night's stay at the house on the ridge.   I didn't know that it was called the Ridge house.  They are actually quite nice, although very small and uninspiring.  We got the best room for the price.  I don't mind small rooms but I did not like the bed (I thought it was like a bunk bed).  There are no TVs or DVDs in the room, but you can watch TV in the kitchen.  There is a tiny kitchen, but it has a refrigerator, stove, and microwave (in addition to a small refrigerator in the back).  The refrigerator, which is the only space with an oven, is a large microwave, which makes it a bit messy when you first open the fridge and the only thing you can eat is coffee, since the stove does not have a cover.  You can, however, microwave some eggs or other foods on the counter. The bathroom is tiny, so if you don't have kids, I would probably have to pack the toothpaste/mouthwash in a bag.  My friend had two kids and the bathroom had to be changed once, because of the mess and the children throwing up in the sink.  The bed is not comfortable.  It is hard to roll the blankets and it has only two comforters.  If you are going to spend $2,500 on a house, I'd rather get something with more amenities.  Also, there is no kitchenette and no kitchen in the home.  Just a big, round kitchen. I was in the same hotel when I stayed there for $3,000 a month and the hotel room had a nice, big refrigerator and a very nice kitchen.  Rated 4 out of 5 by rick1 from This is the second time I've stayed in this house. The first time the bed was not comfortable, as it was a bit small and uncomfortable. The new beds are MUCH better and I had a better nights sleep. I will definitely stay here again.  (Posted on 20/05/2015)  Nice and Big I've never stayed at this place but after reading other reviews I was worried I was getting the wrong house and was pretty happy when I found the Ridge House. The room is huge and not cramped at all. I am going to stay with friends for a few weeks in October but I am looking forward to exploring the outside world
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book, enjoyed it, and decided to keep it, hoping it would have more twists and turns and that at the end, it would get a bit of a cliff-hanger and reveal the secret of the "good guys" (I don't know if I can call them heroes). It did not. The villains had some interesting backstories, but the entire thing was just "well that's how things ended up." It did have some good moments and it's hard to criticize it at this point, because it's still just a good book, but it's just not a great one. I'll probably pass on reading it again, since it's not something I enjoyed that much, but I can't help feeling that the first two books (and the film version) were better. I'm looking forward to the third book now. (Posted by S. A.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book during my freshman year at school (2004-5), as an undergraduate writing project. I was expecting a very dry book about the origins of religion, but this book is so uninteresting and boring that I felt like I was getting no value for my money. There are so many problems with this book (a good part of the book is just bad), that it's hard to figure out what's actually the plot about. The first five chapters (as well as the next several chapters) deal with an argument about religion. These chapters are very tedious, consisting mainly of the two of the main characters arguing about whether a God exists. The argument goes like this: (1) The argumentative style of the authors. (2) The fact that the authors spend so much time writing about a stupid argument. (3) The lack of information that I got about the argument. What I really think the book was about is (the second and third part): The author's ignorance about the history and evolution of religion. The author does the whole thing without understanding anything about religion, which is a shame because this book could have been interesting had it provided at least some insight into the historical evolution of religions. The authors spend about half the book talking about God, and the other half of the "debate" between the two main characters is mostly about who can come up with a convincing argument against God's existence. The book ends with the authors (both protagonists) going back and forth with each other (not in a nice way) about whether or not God exists, but they never actually give their reasons. The last three chapters of the entire book are really poorly written and are just talking about how stupid people can be. The final pages make up for the rest of the boring book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a book about the history of the Middle East in the 20th century, or at least a good overview of the major players (or what the Americans saw as major players in the period), and was really looking forward to a book that would really bring that story to a wider audience. I had been through a number of history books on the Middle Eastern conflicts over the years, and had been looking for something with the same level of depth, but was disappointed to find that there wasn't a lot of information on the American role. That's a shame, since the story has been told before, but I am sure that in the hands of an experienced writer, this would have been a very good book.  My rating: 4/5 The book is based on two interviews conducted with the author, with the second conducted after the release of the book. First, in order to understand the background to the Arab-Israeli conflict, we have to know about some key dates in modern Arab history. In particular, we learn about: the founding of the Palestinian Arab Republic by members of the Arab Socialist Baath party on May 20, 1945; the war between Israel and Jordan in 1948; the 1967 war; the Six Day War, from June 5-15, 1967; and the 1967 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. This is important because it's important that we can identify with the Palestinians in the sense that, as we'll see, they are in a similar situation to ourselves. Second, and more important, we also learn about the events of the present day. We learn that: the Arab Spring of 2011; the recent violence against Christians in Syria; the growing threat of Islamic extremism to Israel; Israel's continuing military operations against Lebanon, the threat of Iran to the region, and the threat to Israel from Hezbollah in the south; the threat posed by ISIS to both the region and the West; and finally, how the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has contributed to regional instability.  I would have liked to have seen some further exploration of the relationship between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, especially after the Second Intifada.  It would also have been useful to know why Israel wants to keep the Palestinians separate, if for no other reason than to justify the occupation. This, along with other issues like the Palestinian struggle for national rights, is all covered in a fairly straightforward fashion. In particular, I was surprised that so little is said about the role of
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second book in the trilogy by William Dufris, and is not a bad read. The story centers around a teenager who is taken from his family and sent to live with a couple and his son after being accused of murdering a boy. The character development is well done, and there are many twists and turns to the story as the story progresses. The characters feel like real teenagers who have to deal with all the usual adolescent angst, such as being a new parent, being bullied by the jocks in school, etc. Unfortunately, the book isn't very good. The main problem is that the book was really too long for my tastes. The book took way too long to get from one character to another and the ending felt rushed and I found myself wanting to read more. I also found the ending too ambiguous and I thought it was really hard to tell if the protagonist was guilty or innocent. Also, I thought there were some inconsistencies in the way the main characters were portrayed, especially in regards to the teenager with a drug problem, but the book could have been much better in these areas. Overall, this is not the best book by William dufris but is still a good book and I would recommend this to anyone who likes high school stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A book of short stories written by a woman who is not much of a writer. There are stories that could have been great and others that could not hold a candle to 'Liar's Key.' I don't know who wrote it but I don�t like it very much." - The Book Collector (UK)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found that I wasn't quite sold on the book after reading it. I liked the characterizations. I really liked the worldbuilding. The setting was pretty good. However, I found myself wanting something more in the story, and I really didn't feel the story was being told in a compelling way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's main thesis, while he gives it a good try, is that people with autism do not have a "social brain" — "most people with Asperger's do not think like the rest of us" — which I guess is true of a very small minority, but it misses the whole point of Aspergers — that we do. His presentation of the book is basically: "If you're not on the spectrum, I don't really know what to tell you." And he does mention the "social problems" that Aspergeses sometimes have (e.g., not being able to form a close friendships with other Aspergeans), which is something I can understand, but not the whole story. This is a "what are the symptoms and what's wrong with them?" book — the actual diagnosis and treatment is not covered at all, so it's a book about what happens after you get diagnosed.  7. The Science of Mind:    A book by an Australian scientist who writes about human behaviour and brain science, but is most interested in the cognitive side of the mind. In a way, this is a book for people who are familiar with the work of psychologists — in the way that, say, Carl Rogers was to people who used to read Jung. But to me, it's still fascinating, and at the same time a bit of a cheat, because the subject matter isn't as technical as most psychology books. The first half of the books is about brain processes — how they work, why we do the things we do, and what we need to know about those mechanisms if we are to understand ourselves. The second half is on social and ethical issues that arise from these brain processes. There are some good stories and some bad stories here, and it really depends how much you are interested in how people behave and what motivates them. It's not my favorite book in the book, but I'm very curious to hear what others have to say about it. A final note: if you like the book The Social Brain, or even if you don't like the science, I suggest you take a look at The Social Machine: The Science and Implications of Human Behavior, by Peter Tufano, in which he focuses more on the ways in which social influences shape the brain than on how the brain works.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read most of the reviews for this and I must say that this book doesn't do the best job of introducing or explaining the characters. The main characters are, of course, the characters of the story but there are a few characters that don't really appear to have much to do with the main story. That's not necessarily a bad thing, however, as a good story is one that doesn't need to explain much. The characters in this book are also very weak. In general, the main characters don't seem to know what they want from life. It makes you wonder if they are even trying to figure it out or if it's just a phase or something that will pass. I think that most young adults who are going through a period in their life where they are looking for their identity should start with a book like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think that I'd ever recommend this book to anyone.   There's nothing wrong with the book itself, but it just didn't seem to be designed to appeal to me.  It's got a good premise and a decent story but it feels like it's just there to be written about.  So I read a bunch of reviews and was trying to find something positive to say about this book.  To my surprise, everyone seemed to agree that this book is just "there."  I guess I can say that it's okay and probably worth a try.  You can buy this book here:
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have had a few bad books from this author, but the first two were really the only one that was worth reading. They both were great, but he got a little too dramatic with his writing in the first book and was inconsistent in the second book. It was really a bummer to see that he had dropped the ball for this book, but I had fun reading it and would recommend it to anyone. :)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't hate this book, but I don't love it either. This is an action novel with a lot of action, but it is very predictable.   It is predictable in the fact that the characters and their actions are very linear. You are not going to get a surprise from one character at a time; he is going to do this, then that, then this. So you know exactly what the author is doing. The ending is also predictable. The only surprise was the character who died in the book, and that wasn't a surprise at all.  I didn't really hate this novel, but at the same time, I don' t love it.

If you like to go out and bash a book you don't like and take it personally, if you're a little thin-skinned maybe, then you should read this book. "

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe that I had such a bad experience.   It was a very short book and I didn't give it a chance to blow me away.  It seemed that this was just another novel by a great author who I'd already read many times.  This is a review for The Long Arm of the Law by K. R. Channapaty.  I didn 't know much about K.R. Chinnapatya, but I wanted to read a book by him.  The Long-Arm of the law is one of his few books that I've liked, and this is another one.  This is a story of the rise and fall of a powerful empire.  We follow a number of characters who played a part in it.  Chinnar's writing is very engaging and his style of prose is very easy on the eyes.   The story is told through a series of vignettes, each of which are set in a different part of the empire, and each of the vignette scenes has a bit of the flavour of the story in the main vignetting out.  The action in the vistas is great too.  Overall, the writing is a little too simplistic for my taste, but it's not as bad as some have made it out to be, so it's still good.  When the story gets going the action is great, and even when it isn't the story is good. The characters are interesting too, with a good mix of good and bad (I'm going to go for the bad here) and the world has a lot of charm to it. I can see why Chinnas work, he's one of the few authors who write in a way that makes me want to read more and find more of his books.  If you like Empire, this is a book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you can't take a good book with a few good words, you're gonna have a bad time.   This is a good story with a plot, characters, and themes.  One thing I was curious about is that after they come out of the bunker, what happened to the rest of the crew? Did the two who weren't inside die? It was pretty well known that the two didn't survive.  What happens with those who survived?     This was my favorite book in the collection.  While it did not have the depth of the original, this was definitely a good read.  I will definitely be checking out the next installment of this series.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book can be either a hit or a miss.    A hit can be good, as in an enjoyable read, and a miss can be a total let down, as a book that is not enjoyable at all.  And a hit and miss book, like the great books that we read, can still be a gem, a masterpiece, a game-changer, a piece of art.  What's that you say?   "But wait."   I know, you're saying, "But I like that book."    Well, I'll give you a hint:  It isn't the book that makes the book.  The book is what makes the person.   We don't read to read, we read to discover.   What makes a book a great book is a lot of things:  (1) it is well written and thought-provoking.  (2) the story is well-written and thought provoking.  (3) the characters are well-developed and interesting.  I love books that make me think, that make my mind go a little crazy.  That's the essence of great writing.  But we don't want to just read to think, we want to read to feel.  We want to feel the story, and see the character's actions.  Sometimes we don´t feel what we read.   Why do you think reading works?  Why do we keep reading books? Because it gives us something to talk about.  If you don't talk about it, if you don´ t express your thoughts and feelings, why do we continue?  Because we love books and we want the best out of them, we expect the best, we are desperate to understand what is happening, we feel like we need to understand, we crave an answer.  Books are a way of expressing feelings that may otherwise remain unseen.  They are a conversation between reader and book.   The best books are those that allow us to experience something in such a way that we feel it.  Reading is an experience, it's the best that you can possibly give, because a great reader has the ability to connect with a reader. Here's what I recommend: read at least one good book a month.  Don't be one of those people that don't know where to start, you know what, you should go on a reading binge like I did, don't be afraid
Write a negative review about a bad book:        As a long-time reader of the series, I would recommend this book. But if you've been reading the books for some time, this is a definite miss.   This is an easy, enjoyable read. There are some plot holes, but there's nothing that makes this book really any different from the others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book, so I am not going to do a great job at putting it down here. This book is more like a book that is being read, with no idea of how it will turn out. This is a good example of how a book gets written, which is a difficult process to get right. The author is not as experienced as I would have liked, which made things more difficult. But she did her best, and I am quite happy with the final product. The only problem is that the book is really long. I have not read all of it, so there are many pages I have missed. But the last section, on how to get over a dead horse is a great bit, and the whole thing is very well written. But if you are going to be reviewing books, you should do a better job at it. And in this case, a good job is not what you get. You get a poor book. You may enjoy it more than I did, but it was a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (You know what they say, "The reviews never lie. They're like an oasis in the desert."   ) This is a good book.  . It contains a lot of interesting information that I had never heard before, and was highly stimulating. But that said, it doesn't really change my life (well, it may change my experience of the human condition, but not that much.)   I have a question about that review that I think would interest you:  1. I am not sure that it is possible to "turn" your sexual desires into actions. It is obvious that the author and her students have had success at using the techniques to alter and change sexual orientation.  2. This book deals with a very specific and personal issue.  It is very interesting, but it is very difficult to do well and does not do very well for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst thing about this book is how long it takes for us to meet her. She is just a little too far away, she doesn't seem to care about us, she makes us feel as if she isn't interested, and she does things with her nose that make us wonder if she's going to get her teeth kicked in. At the end she gives us her most ridiculous, over-the-top response, and I feel like it is a huge waste of time, a big waste of story telling. In other words, you don't get to learn anything about her and your time is wasted.   At the very least, you can watch the episode of Family Guy where she shows up.   "You are so cute!"   The book is a rehash of the film's plot. We have seen the film so many times, and the same things are done over and over. What I liked about the film is that the plot has a twist that you never saw coming. I also like that this book doesn't try to make the film better. This book focuses more on the characters, the movie was pretty amazing, but this book feels like it was put together by a committee.  The book was really bad. It just doesn't work. There was so much promise with how amazing the film was, and it ends up like a mediocre reboot with the same story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a very entertaining book that I would have liked much more if I could have kept it going. The writing is okay, but the pacing is very poor.   The author makes things very difficult.  A lot of things in this book are too easy.  In the last section, there is a paragraph that explains the problem. But the solution is in the first section, in which she uses an example that is impossible, not to mention unrealistic.  Also, I wish that she had used a more realistic description of the effect of her illness on her relationships. I was a bit disappointed that she wasn't able to go deeper into her family life. This would have been helpful information.  Posted by Kate at 7:34 AM No comments: What I like: The characters:  A good mix of characters with different personalities and abilities. It would be nice to get to know their personalities better.  I think the characters were interesting. Some characters didn't seem quite right.  The story:  I found the plot interesting. The author has created a very compelling story. The characters and their struggles were very well written. The ending:  The ending left me wondering a lot. I liked the ending more than the beginning. But I don't know why. Maybe I am biased because it was a sequel to a book I read a while back, but I find it hard to believe that this author really got to write a sequel in this short time. I really like the characters and it's hard to find anything to complain about.  I liked the story and the ending was very satisfactory.  When I found out the second book was a prequel, I was really excited for it. But the book just didn't grab me.  There were a few times when I wanted to start reading it again, but it never came to me. It was a good book but I can't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   My daughter, who is a good friend, purchased the book and started reading it the week it came out. I am a teacher and an adult with a child in public school. I love the book, but her enjoyment of it was limited to how many pages she read before turning it in. She was disappointed, but also wanted a copy so that she could read it. It will be a challenge to keep a book as big as this one in my classroom.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I've read all year. The protagonist is a character you want to hang yourself, and the story is as dull and boring as your average chick lit novel. This is the best thing about it: the art. It's the first thing I've seen this year that really looks good and is really worth looking at. I'm not a big fan of fantasy novels, and this is definitely the only one I'm going to buy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "Don't make an issue of the fact that there is nothing here, because then people will get bored, and you won't have any work to do. Make a point that in order to be useful to a writer, there needs to be a reason to read a book."  The best quote I have read on the matter:  "For some reason, books in English have an effect that words in other languages don't. The result is that most people who don't read French have a vague feeling that it must be some sort of secret language, while those who do read French can still only guess where it's from."

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a book about the "Moral Animal" or "Hero" in our species.  The Hero is a good guy who does bad things for the sake of good causes. This book is about a Hero who does the exact opposite.   The book is a self-serving mess that is full of mistakes and oversimplified moral philosophy.  I don't like it.  A very interesting concept, but the execution is so poor that it's hard to say that it is worth anything.  It does, however, help us to realize that all humans are capable of being terrible people. I can't believe that I'm having to say this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book. I wish that I would have had more to say about it. If it is worth a read it is at least good to read the first time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this for a good cause. The author was very generous and gave me the audiobook in addition to a copy of the book so I can enjoy it. I don't think there's any harm in it, I just thought it needed to be better written, I think there were a lot of typos and a couple plot holes that ruined it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      "In a word, the book was not worth the money."  "The most disappointing part of this book was the writing of the author." - Michael E. Sledge, author of The Last Lectures of William Penn  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is about an old man who thinks he has lost his mind and who has gone mad with his powers. His wife, who is the opposite of him, tries to help him out, while others try to stop him. There is a lot of sex, but nothing exciting. The first half of the book deals with the old man, while the second half deals with his wife's love life. The author has not changed much about the first half (other than the sex). The new age aspect is the same.  The sex has a couple of characters involved in it but none of them are really given any development. The ending of the story was a bit of a let down. It just leaves a cliffhanger at the end, where no-one knows what happens next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked the author, but the book is a mess.   The whole series is like one big poorly plotted adventure novel.  You get three main characters and then two more.  What you don't get is why they were chosen to join the adventure. They all are really stupid and boring.  The author is trying to draw a certain crowd:  People who like a lot of action, but not necessarily in a good way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -1.5 stars    I bought this book as a "side project" at work - to read in the office after I finished a longer book. Unfortunately, the reading was awful. If I'd known this would be my book, I probably would not have bought it. I finished the book in 3 days. Not bad for a 1st time author. This book does have the merit of being a great intro to computer science - but then, most of the book consists of the author reciting various math proofs, or his proofs of concepts that he learned in the book. You'll spend a lot of time on his proof of the existence of Fibonacci numbers, which is essentially "proof" of the Pythagorean Theorem, with some added math. I'm still not sure what "proof of Fib" even means, and I'm not interested in the math that goes into it - the point is that "fib" is "finite", so you could prove that. The proofs themselves are tedious and tiresome, and not worth the time. However, if you really want to get into computer science, I think this book is for you. -1 -2  "The book begins with a description of how computer languages have been used, followed by the contents of the first book in the new book series. After a thorough discussion of those topics, the author discusses his experiences as a computer programmer at the time of the initial book, and how those experiences shaped him in terms of his perspective on programming.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When a child is not going to be there to pick up the child's trash and help the parent put away their lunch, what is the next step?   If the child has a habit of throwing away his or her lunch, we might help them create a special place for it by putting the food on the back porch, which they have to climb to get to.   This way, they will learn to pick it up from there.  If our child doesn't like the idea of a special porch for lunch, maybe he or she can set the lunches out in the garbage where it's easier to find. If the luncheon is in the back door and our child is good at throwing things, maybe we can help our child put the lunch on the porch.  This allows the child to do it alone, but makes it less likely that they will do it on purpose.  Or, it might be that we can have the child do the job for us.  We can put the luncheons in the trash or put the food in a special container. If we have a dog, we can take that too. I like to help my toddler find her lunch in the front porch. Then I can pick it out of the trash later. I can also have a lunch bag with me at the yard so the child doesn�t have to. If I didn't like it, I could make my own lunches, like a small lunch box, and I could take the lunched into the yard for the child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A couple of things that I felt really stuck in my craw were the plot (that seems to exist only to justify the fact that the author is a complete jerk) and the characters.   I thought that the characters were pretty well developed, but the fact is that the book was just a waste of time.  I know that there are good books out there (I really loved the first book in the series and I'm reading the third) but this one was just so terrible.     Overall, the best thing about this book is that if you are a sci-fi/fantasy fan, you probably should try it.  If you want to try to read a good book but can't be bothered to buy a book for it (and you are super lazy), then this book might be a good option. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a novel that was written in the first person the author doesn't tell us a thing about himself. He writes about the experience of a character that is an amalgamation of several people I've met, including some that I've never met. This book will appeal to a wide variety of readers and it is written to be very entertaining while not taking itself too seriously. If you like the sound of your own voice telling you stories this is the book for you.  It is a fascinating read. The first person narration allows the author to share personal experiences in an informative and enjoyable way. He is also able to use his past experiences to further a plot point.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I have a bad experience with a book, then the reason is obvious.   I would have preferred to not have to read this book at all.  But the book itself was a good introduction to the game of Go.  It was a long book, and the information was presented in a manner I could understand.  This is a great book for a beginner's introduction to Go, but I think the overall content would have been better if more of the "deeper" stuff was put into the book.  I recommend this book as an introduction to go.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a child, I grew up with this book and as a young adult, I finally bought it. It was a book I didn't enjoy. A boring book, with nothing interesting about it. After reading, I still don't think I like this book but I was a young kid at the time and I am still an adult, so I might be wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "The first half of this book is all about the protagonist, the only man left alive in the city that once was."  The author doesn't bother to explain any details about the world of the book, leaving the reader with a lot of "I don't know"s. I guess they did try to go out of their way to make this a world that I would be familiar with, but it still reads more like a concept album than a full length book.      "Now, he's lost his wife and two daughters, and he has a job in a factory making shoes for women in the far north, but he is not doing so well. He has a bad back, and there's the matter of the missing girl."   This was a good idea, and it's actually been a couple of years since I have read the book so I guess I'll have to take his word for it, but I find it hard to believe that this world was as realistic as he described it.  The idea of a world where there is no more ice in the world is certainly something I've always seen in books or films, and I'm surprised that he would have made it such a stretch to make the world such a harsh place.  That being said, I do appreciate how the author manages to make his life seem relatively normal in comparison to the way his situation is portrayed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is absolutely terrible. I know I'm supposed to give this book a star because of the fact that the book itself is so poorly written, but I just can't. I would rate it as such, but even then I can't rate it 5 stars. The whole thing just feels off somehow and the writing doesn't seem very good at all. It's like the author just threw this out as a test and saw how much of a mess it was going to be. If it were a bad novel, maybe I would give it more than 2 stars. This book just seems really rough and lazy. It just doesn't have that polish that you would expect to be in a book by one of those author who writes really, really long novels.  Posted by Erin at 5:37 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:     As a science fiction fan, I absolutely adore this book. The setting is absolutely unique and intriguing, especially with the various science and magic options that have been presented. The writing is good, and there is some pretty good action, as well as some interesting character development. This is a great book, and one that I will continue to read.   As an author, this is a very unique approach to science fiction, in my opinion. I love the way this author has created a world that, whilst having its own unique history, and its own history from other cultures is at the same time an amalgam of other cultures' cultures. The way that the magic of this world is treated is very unique, but at the very same time, I felt that it was very natural and realistic to the way that magic was handled in real world cultures. There are a lot of unique concepts in this book, which I have enjoyed reading, and it's one that will keep me coming back to this author for years to come.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book is usually a bad story in a bad way. In fact, it has been argued that the term 'bad' should be used to describe stories in which the author has deliberately misrepresented facts (see: David J. Ebert: A Life; Paul B. Sargent: The Case for a Unanimous Jury; and The Guardian, July 27, 2006). What makes a book bad? A bad story? A story that is too good to be true? A good story? In my opinion, a bad writer writes bad stories. For one thing, many bad stories lack interest or interest is a bad word. A good writer can tell a good story that does not lack interest (just as a good writer is capable of telling a bad one). Secondly, some of the best stories in the history of literature (like those from Dickens and Flaubert) have elements of suspense and surprise. Even if you have no interest in suspense and/or surprise, a good tale will keep you turning the pages (and a good plot will keep the reader turning the page). Thirdly, in a great book, the plot, character, setting, and dialogue create a world of their own. So much of this is lost in a good book. Even when you are a bad reader, you are still a reader. You read the book in order to enjoy the story. In a bad novel, everything feels like a bad decision. It's so over the top that you think the author is off his rocker and/ or this is some kind of hoax. There's no mystery. The book just feels like something thrown together. (The exception here is the classic James M. Cain novel: The House of D'Andrea; it is a masterpiece and a great read.) I have been a bad user of the word 'unreal.' If you're going to use it to describe a bad tale, it's more appropriate to use another word: 'bland.' In a book that lacks interest or surprise, the reader can see it coming a mile off. That's what a bad novelist does. He gives you the same predictable and unexciting story he tells to himself, only a thousand times better. When you read a book for the first time, you have a limited vocabulary with which to describe things. It takes time to develop the words and make them work together in an organized manner. In my experience, it takes me a good long while to come
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book.   I wanted to love it.  What I got was a boring story with a weak premise and a bad plot.  A girl who is trying to keep her world from collapsing.  That doesn't sound interesting, but it is.  The bad things in this story were the characters.  They didn't have that spark of life and made the story not worth reading.  There was not enough detail or plot to even make up for the bad characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Here are the pros: It's the most popular book in the world. It's also an interesting and profound look at a subject I have studied for a few years. It was beautifully done. It tells the story of two lovers who fall in love at first sight but have little time to communicate their feelings. The authors take it a step further by creating a world where love is an actual physical presence (like blood and tissue) in the brain. The characters' reactions are often heartbreaking. The plot is a bit convoluted but it's a great book that will please a wide audience. The language is clean. The cons: The plot was confusing and there was a lot of fluff that didn't really contribute anything to the story (the love scene was the most important in my opinion). It was also long. There was also a bit too much humor in the book. There were also several times I wondered if the author was trying to teach the reader something about the subject. The romance aspect is pretty much non-existent in the rest of the book which leaves many people wondering why there's so much "love" in this story. I don't really see any reason why this book needs to be so well reviewed. Overall:  This book had my highest recommendation. This is a book I'll probably revisit several times in my life. The story is well-written and the book will keep me turning the pages.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I like this book so much! It is so fun and very easy to read. It is very funny, and you'll love it!   Overall, it is very much worth your time! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book. The characters are boring and the plot is dull.   As soon as it gets to that part of the book the plot collapses.  The only redeeming point of the novel is the great cover art (which would have looked much better on a coffee table) by the fabulous Janny Wurts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So, I've heard that if you're not a fan of Harry Potter then this is probably a pretty good pick for you.   I'm not going to lie, after all this year I'm finding myself re-reading these books more and more frequently.  This was a really solid book though.  I really like the Harry Potter world and have been intrigued to see where it goes.  While not my favorite story, it's certainly a well-written story.  Overall rating:  "A wizard with a long life is a pretty miserable one.  " The thing is, when he's not reading books, Harry can be pretty sad.  So when he finds out that he's supposed to be dead and in heaven for all eternity, that was a bit of a shock.  Although I can see why this is a story with an obvious conclusion.  But that doesn't make this book a bad one. The world of Hogwarts is intriguing. The mystery of who has the power to do what is interesting.  The plot is intriguing to a degree.  Overall, this is an interesting read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this was a solid fantasy. Not an amazing one, but a solid one. There was a little bit of a problem with the pacing, and it seemed like it could have been cut down, but it was not like this book was bad. I would definitely read more if I have the opportunity. I will most likely be buying this book for Christmas.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   When you look at the title alone, you might think you've read something like a horror novel; but it isn't at all; it's actually an autobiographical piece about the author's life growing up as the son of a Japanese man, and his family's cultural differences.   I'm not going to say anything about the story; if you like reading stories, you'll be fine.  I was a bit disappointed with this book; I wanted more from it.  This is my third book of hers; I'm usually disappointed by her writing; this book didn't do me any favors.  It was also a bit too short.  Overall, not a bad novel, just one I didn't enjoy reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, the book starts off with an interesting premise but quickly devolves into a mess of exposition. The author doesn't follow through on any of his promises, and the plot does get a lot of things right.   He did try to develop a believable plot, even if the book has a hard time keeping up. The story follows a girl named Ria who comes to a small country town to attend a family funeral. It's a nice enough story, but the way it is handled is extremely uncharacteristic for the author and gives a lot less weight to it than it could. Instead of showing the family's reactions to the loss of their daughter, we see Ria try and move on with her life without caring about the loss at all. This would be fine if it were done in a more believable way, but in the end, it doesn't give the reader any reason to be invested in the character's lives.  The author does attempt to do more with the secondary characters, but he is only able to use them for a few pages of the book. I wish he would have shown us more of them, like how they get along with each other, or what their real motives are. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very enjoyable story about two teenagers who meet in a strange new world. They are two very different kids, but the author managed to put the right balance of emotion and drama in each one of their stories. They all share the same good intentions but they go about it in their own way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was boring, and very repetitive. And when the book started to get interesting, it was too short for my tastes. In the end, the book wasn't bad, but it lacked the energy to keep me hooked all the way through.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    How would you like to be introduced to a new religion?   How would you want to learn more about a new religious system?  What would you call a religion that has more than one holy book?  What would you say if a friend says "I want to believe in this religion because...?"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know how to review this. It's basically a novel of love and sex. I mean, you would expect that at this point in my life. I love sex, and I read romance a lot. The problem is, I don't remember the book as a novel. I'm sure it had elements of romance, but it's so repetitive, it's almost an autobiography in a way. I was reading it because I read that the author was a major in the U.S. Army, but the main focus is not on military service. It takes place in a college, and the main character is an upperclassman. When I started reading this book, I wanted to read about a romance novel that was more interesting. The book isn't that. But I wanted the characters to be more interesting than what they were. So the book ends, I'm really disappointed, and it didn't leave me wanting more. I just wanted something better. The author is a good writer, but she could have made this book a bit more interesting with more character development.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know. I don't care enough. But it did. This isn't a book I'd recommend to everyone. It's not for the faint of heart. But if you want a story that's not just about a crazy adventure, but actually about life, about relationships, about love, and the joy of life, then read this book. And if you don't like it then it's your loss and you should just buy more books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm going to tell a story about a book I've read, it's in a genre I can't recommend very much, and I'm about to rave about it. I didn't read it until a few years back when I was on a bit of a hiatus from books, but when I did, I absolutely loved it. It was an interesting, well researched history of the world that showed how we got where we are today. It also had a lot of action and the kind of characters I want to read about. Unfortunately, a few months after I finished it I started to have this terrible toothache and went to see my dentist. After going to the dentist for a few days the dentist told me I had a cavity in my tooth. This made me a bit upset, because I didn,t realize the cavity I had was from a tooth infection, I just knew something was wrong. So I asked my friend to take pictures of the area and we went to the doctor. The doctor examined me, and after showing me pictures and what had happened I told him that the picture on the wall was the most accurate picture I could find of my cavity. He was shocked. He called the dentist and said he could not operate on my tooth because of the cavity. So he sent my tooth to a different dentist and told him what the cavity was, and the dentist did a little digging and discovered a tumor in the middle of my tooth and told the dentist that if he didn't remove it now, it would be there for the rest of my life. I told the doctor I didn' t want to have the tumor in my mouth permanently. He said, "That's OK, I can get it out." He told me to get a root canal to replace it, which is what I did. Now, I didn 't like it, but I have to be honest, the dentist's procedures were expensive, and there was no way I was going to go without having it done. There was no doubt that I didn''t want to spend money on having this done for years to come when I wasn't in pain for the life of the tooth. He told the surgeon he was going make the incision right where the cavity is, and if he cut deeper, it probably would not be enough to get it all the way out. So the dentist made the incisions, but then did a pretty shitty job. Now I had this horrible cavity in the tooth, and
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "I liked the story, but then I got distracted from reading by some of the writing choices. The problem with this is that the narrator is not a reliable narrator. He is frequently off-topic. His descriptions of places are sometimes vague, and he can't quite remember what he said. In some places he seems to miss a comma. If you are not a history buff, then you might find these small nit-picks annoying, but if you are, then these are small ones. However, if you do want to know what happened in the Middle Ages, then the book is worth a read."  5 Stars: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You should not try to use a negative book review as a guide for what a good book must have. There are two reasons this is so bad: 1. The author is talking about a good movie or book when he says the book/movie isn't great, or the book is bad. 2. The reviewer gives the impression that he (she, the reviewer) knows better than the author of the book that the book he/she is reviewing is not a good one. I will give the author this one: you are a smart person to be giving a positive review to a book you like. But your negative review for the book should have been about the book itself, not the movie/book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I'm going to have to come up with a name for the genre, the most popular of which seems to be "the dark fantasy."  This particular novel is the weakest in terms of prose and in terms  of plot.  The premise is simple:  a family of wizards comes from a faraway land, but has little use for the magic.  They are banished to an isolated, forested land to live out their last days.  This family is a bit off, as they don't have any of the usual magic they've developed.  It's the author's attempt to provide a happy ending for a family who has suffered a great deal.  However, this ending didn't work for me.   What I really wanted, was to see the characters find some way to overcome this adversity, but even in the final moments, when I was waiting for a resolution, there was very little tension.  I just found it boring.  As the family is finally sent back to their homeland, it's clear they don´t like the way things are.  To prove that they're still a good family and still a part of the wizarding world, they start training new recruits.  Eventually, the wizard who started it all, starts to use magic, but he and his apprentice, try their hardest to convince the new recruits to become a part  of the family.    But as is usual with "the darkest of all the wizards", they're very difficult to get along with, as is the case with most families that live outside the wizard world.  Although this one wasn't the greatest novel,  I still liked the premise and I enjoyed reading about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first two books are great. The fourth is a bit of a let down. I enjoyed the stories of my two protagonists, however, I would have preferred the author write more about them and less about the other two characters.    Rating:  2nd Place
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . " A book on how to get into the'scene' and make some money.   The first 20% of the book is really good.  They talk about all the good venues, all the ways to make money. I liked the information in this book.  However, there are some very bad things in this novel.  One of the things that bother me is the way that the money that they make from book sales is handled.  I'm not a fan of 'pump and dump' but the book makes you do that in some ways.  It was interesting to see what they did but I still can't get over the way they handled the money. If I can't handle the 'burden' of this book then I don't want to be in the 'book business'.   I got into the scene by getting a 'bribe' from a couple of people, and it went from there.   I am not one of those people who is 'in' the scene.    I would rather go back to the 'wild West'.  I like the good, honest book business.  "   Overall I am giving this book 4 stars because I was intrigued by the way it was presented.  At times I felt like it wasn't clear enough on what was actually happening and the people were trying too hard to seem like a big deal.  The writing is okay, the first part is very good but then there are parts where it gets pretty ridiculous.   It's hard to put all the negative comments in order but the 'pumped and dumped' business was just not true, not at all and it's really unfair that people try to make it sound that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a long book.   My son and I read it to each other and we both found it very funny, and it had a lot of nice characters that were all very likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is so disappointing that this is one of the worst books I have read in ages!   The book is actually written as a series of short stories in which each story ends with a cliffhanger.   There are three main characters, but I can't remember who they are.  Their names are not even mentioned in the book. I assume they are just characters that are just there to give you a few moments to figure out who the bad guys are. And, in each of their stories, the baddies are so stupid.  I found it rather difficult to understand the plot, as I only really skimmed it.  I only just managed to read the whole book, which is really disappointing, as this is supposed to be a collection of short "novella" style stories with the main story being the "last" in the series.  The first two stories are rather good, but the rest are just ridiculous.  There is also a subplot that is just unnecessary.  This is a complete waste of time as I could have gotten through all three stories in a couple of hours.  But the first two are just so good, I didn't want to stop reading.  They make great filler, and I would have liked a little bit more from them, but at least the story is fairly good.  Also, in all the stories, there are no characters that I even recognize.  We get all these silly sounding names like "Fenris" "Stavius" and "Ylgar" that don't even make any sense.  Even the "real" names don't seem to be based on any kind of real-life names that I have heard.  When I googled "Staavus," I found nothing about him whatsoever, just "Stava."   And finally, the first story really made me angry.  In this story, we are meant to hate a character called Sava. Sava is supposed be the villain, but he is so fucking stupid. He was trying to get revenge on his brother, when the whole time he just wanted to get his brother to tell him who was his father. Savas parents are supposed to have died in a fire, but Sava still decides to look through their belongings, just so that he can go to his brother's house to get something for the fire.  That's really stupid. So, in the end,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book very, very disappointing. The first fifty pages were good but then we are dragged down a slippery slope of an incompetent, unreliable narrator who has to be the storyteller. She writes and tells in a way that's not only a little clunky and awkward, but that doesn't make it any easier to get the whole story and its twists and turns. She also has a habit of reusing a single point to repeat it over and over. The only reason I'm still writing this review is because I found it fascinating. In my experience there is a pretty big difference between stories about someone who's been wronged and someone who has been wrongfully accused. There are more people on the side of the victim than the defender (I can count that on one hand!). It's a small, personal gripe. There is a good case to be made for why someone who makes these mistakes (a few have been self-inflicted, others are the result of people's bad behavior, not their own) might have a low tolerance for being wronged. I'm not suggesting the authors should have been arrested. What I am saying is that people who suffer injustice and/or abuse should know their rights. I don't think the author realizes that. She should have had a couple more chapters. The writing and editing is very poor.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had read many books about the military and the American Indian. I loved the old western books with their action packed storylines and exotic locations. This book didn't fit that mold.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    Read my review:  The book itself is a mix of sci-fi and fantasy. It's like someone took the plot and ideas from some of the sci-ffi movies that are really good ( The Matrix, Lord of the Rings) and mixed it with some fantasy elements from Lord of Light, a book I never read but heard a lot about. I don't know why anyone would want to read this book. If I can describe it, I don't think it's that good. There is nothing special about the plot, or anything really. It is just a really boring plot. In the beginning, I didn't really care, because I thought it was just going to be another sci-fiction book, but halfway through, I think I started to think it was actually a really bad book. I felt like I was reading a story where someone decided to write a book with all of the elements of a sci- fi movie (such as aliens and robots) but instead made them all realistic by combining them into a sci fi world. The thing that really got to me though is how boring it was that there are not really any female characters in this book (or any female at all, really). There is a whole page that is dedicated to how the main characters all have huge breasts and a lot of sex appeal. At the end of the book, the main male characters get together with a woman and go and have sex with her and I was confused about how that could be even remotely interesting. The female characters had no personality at all. They were just there to be sexually attractive and nothing more. This book is boring, but at least there are a lot more good sci- fis out there than this book! Overall, I thought this book was just boring, and I didn The story in this story is about a world where all humans have become cyborgs and there are only male cyborg soldiers. It doesn't really have anything else to it.  It was pretty interesting for about a few pages before it became boring. I think people like the idea of the cyborg guys fighting against the bad aliens, but that is not what this story was about. It was the fact that the cybot army all looked the same (and that they all were male).  I'm a huge fan of cyborg movies. I've watched a few, but there are really only a few of them, and this was the worst
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a couple of books from this author but I have never been impressed.   He has an irritating habit of trying to use his stories for personal criticism without any regard to the stories themselves.  His writing has very little to do with his stories and that's not necessarily a bad thing, but this is a poor example.   11 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My friends and I just finished this and I have to say it's one of the worst novels I've ever read.   The premise is unbelievable, I get the feeling it will be a series and it's probably going to drag on forever. I'm sure you can see why the author has no readers. The book starts out with the narrator being a poor orphan living in an underprivileged neighborhood that he seems to have nothing in common with and has no one to speak with. The novel then cuts to him meeting a stranger who lives in a mansion. He falls in love with the woman, falls asleep on the couch next to her and wakes up after a dream. He then tells her the story of the mansion. She asks if it's real. He responds it is. Well she goes to the mansion and is very impressed by the mansion itself and how the owner's care and attention to detail made it look like it was a real place. Well that's the plot. The rest of the novel is a collection of flashbacks to the first half where he is living in the house. I have no idea what was going on in his life until he was about a month into living in his first room. The mansion is a giant underground complex filled with rooms and tunnels and he wakes up with his eyes open in a coffin-like room where everyone is alive and the house is empty except for him. His first day in the mansion is pretty much the worst day he has ever had. He's put in a room with a woman who is a slave and she has an attitude towards him. She tells him that if he doesn't like her then he's no one. Then he meets some other slaves and one of them tells him about his life and they tell him that it wasn't so bad. I don't remember much after that. The way it was written was so cliche.  The whole book is basically the same thing over and over and it starts to get annoying. This book doesn't even deserve to be a sequel to the movie. It's just stupid and I don a hard time believing anyone in his right mind would read this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking for a way to keep from binge-reading a book.   The first 20 minutes were fine.  The next 15 minutes were just a waste of my time.  So what's the problem with "A Song of Ice and Fire"?  I'm on it! I'm halfway through it.  I love it!  But when the book is over, it just feels like an over-long waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The reason I like this book is because it was a good, fun, entertaining book!   I would definitely recommend this book, even if you don't normally like YA, or if you think the book sucks, or don't like horror.   (A warning, this book has a lot of sexual content.)   In the end, I like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very bad book. It was a disappointment from the first chapter. I felt a little cheated when I started it. But in spite of that, the plot is not bad. The ending was rather abrupt, which I found rather unfortunate because of the nature of the book. My main complaint is that the narrator is quite annoying. At times, it's very hard to understand what he is talking about. There are also some bad transitions and transitions are not very convincing. For instance, in chapter one, a lot is happening in the first few chapters. But then the story drags a bit, but I will try to skip to the end because this is a bit of a slog. Overall, I was slightly disappointed because of how it starts, but the plot and the ending were good.   Summary:  I like this book because I can relate with the main character, but even if I didn't like this novel, I would read it just because it's a first-person. This book is hard to read, I'm sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book with great enjoyment. I enjoy reading about time travel stories. This book was a great fun to read! It was a nice change of pace. I thought I liked the book and the story but I found it very boring and I didn't feel the time travel was done well. The narration was fine for a book this long but I wouldn't like to read it over and over. I'm sure some people who read the book may like it and I'm glad I enjoyed it.  37 of 37 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was fun at the beginning but has been dragging out for the past few weeks with no resolution. The writing style is a little slow paced. It was a good ride though...    " I love you. I don't want you to go. I want you here. I am trying to make you happy. I have been trying so hard to be good and make you comfortable and you don't know how to respond. It's killing me. Please let me in. I'm sorry about how I talk. Just try to listen. I know you've been trying to find me. I think you are looking for me." I don t care if you have to wait for a week and then a month or two to get a response.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucks.   I've been waiting years for an attempt at a romance in the vein of the Harry Potter series, and it's a bad one. There's no angst in the characters, no drama, just a bunch of boring people getting along and never quite figuring out who they are.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    (It's a bit ironic because I'm trying to write a positive review for a book about good books. But I'll try.)   I got this book as a Christmas present from my wife for her birthday. It's a pretty good book; it's written in a non-descript, fairly "clean" style with some excellent illustrations. It has a good flow, though it can be a bit repetitive at times; and I do like some of the historical detail, although I'm pretty sure that the author was a little too eager to show the Nazis in a bad light. The illustrations were nicely done, and while I didn't have any problem with the story, I did have a few moments where I was a bit disappointed with how some of it was framed. One thing that bothered me about the book is the idea that the Nazis were really good people and really really wanted peace, while the Jews were the other side; this seems really off-base to me, because I would think that they would probably get along just fine even if Hitler hadn't been so bad and had a more conciliatory attitude. Still, for this book, it works fairly well.   It's nice to have something with the original text and drawings, and at least the book's description makes it clear that the stories are non-fiction. The drawings, while not really artistic, were good enough to justify the expense, and there were a few pages where I found myself just smiling. It was a nice change of pace from the "historical fiction" that's been in fashion lately, and I'll admit that it did make me feel a bit less guilty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am reading this book now because I am having a hard time enjoying much in the rest of the library, so this seems like a good alternative. But I still wish the book had been better. I do not dislike this book so much as I don't like this author's style or the tone. It's too easy to use, and the narrator is just so off. She's the sort of narrator who doesn't get the humor of what she is describing (which is all of us), but the writer does, and it gets on my nerves. The humor is also very uneven in this book. It seems as if the humor in the book isn't necessarily being directed at the characters, but toward the author. And then there's the whole character of the person being the one to make the choice. That seems like something you might want to consider when writing a book about an alternate reality where people just keep having the same conversations over and over and don't learn anything or grow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am so tired of this series. When I think of The Name of the Wind, I am in my 60s, have never read a fantasy novel, have just finished reading the first book in the series, and am looking for something new. The first time I started this series, I was about ten, and this book was just awful. It has nothing to do with anything. It's boring. It isn't even original, as far as fantasy series are concerned. I know a bit of Tolkien, but I can't say anything useful about him. It had a bit too much action for my tastes, and the whole book was rather slow at the beginning. But then I started to read it, and it got better. It got better and better, and even when I was finished with the last book, I started reading The Wise Man's Fear. It didn't have the action that I was used to, and there was some pretty bad writing at times, but that is the nature of fantasy books; it will never be the best, but it will always have flaws. I like fantasy, and I am not a fan of historical fiction (as I am of most fantasy books), but I'm going to be re-reading The Name in order to see what it has to offer. If it's not a waste of my time, I guess I'll keep reading the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a review that mentioned a "bad review" of this book and said it had many bad things. I didn't really read a bad review, it just said that the book was bad.  I just finished a book called " A History of Philosophy " by David Armstrong. It's a good book. I think he wrote an important book. The reviews I saw for the book were positive.   What I didn't like:  The story:  I think the book is very long but it really is a good story and I don't think I was bored.  If you want to get into the philosophy it is a very good book to read.  One of the books I most enjoyed reading is " What Is Buddhism ".  I believe the author has a personal interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an utter failure and an insult to all authors out there who don't have to read over 10,000 words. I had so much fun reading this and really enjoyed the story and characters. I've read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy but this is by far the worst thing I've ever read.  This book is absolutely worthless. I really wish I hadn't. The book's author's lack of technical knowledge about computer programming is appalling and really makes it a disappointment. The author doesn't even know how to spell some names in the book! It's a complete disaster and it's a shame that the author has to have the same name as this book. :
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This review is long. I don't know how else to start a negative book review than the book. I'm giving the book 5 stars for not being the absolute worst, but I'll need the review to show why that's the case. I was a big fan of the original "Kiss Me Deadly," a novel about a woman on death row who is released on parole and starts living a more normal life. This new book, though, is much less funny, much less entertaining. The only thing I can think of that's funny about it is that the characters are actually quite horrible. They're not very funny. They talk like idiots. The woman's brother kills himself. The man goes crazy and kills his wife and daughter. This was supposed to be the book that made "The Hunger" so funny, and it's very clearly an attempt at that by not having anyone die, which is nice, because the book seems to have taken a page out of "The House at Pooh Corner" by saying that we don't want to watch someone get killed or get pregnant, but we want to laugh when they get killed by the bad guy. So basically, a woman gets released from prison and finds herself back in prison, but she finds out she's been released because her brother killed himself and his wife killed herself, so all the new prisoners in prison don't really know who she is and can't remember the reason she's back in jail. They all assume she's a criminal because she looks like a convict. But, being a criminal isn't a joke, so she doesn't have that problem, because she's not a criminal. And she does go on to murder two inmates and get caught. So, I'm actually kind of surprised that the novel isn't better. If it were, I would have finished it. (Though I still would have rated it lower, because it was a poor joke.) I'll give it three stars if it is at least funny.  12 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Don't just read the blurb, look at the cover.   (I just found an old copy of this and was very sad that it has been out of print for years.) I did find this book fun, and it did have some cool ideas, but the author should have taken a lesson from "Sleeping with the Enemy"   and written a good mystery instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many of the books in this genre and I have not been impressed with many of them. I had no intention to purchase this book but I happened to get it by chance. I was expecting a lot of a story but I couldn't even tell what book I was reading. The only thing that I do like is that there is no story in this book. It was just an enjoyable read and it was nice to have a story when I didn't have a lot to read about.   This is a really good book and should be in your collection.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When you take the time to read this book and really analyze it, you'll see that it is full of inconsistencies, errors and logical flaws that could not be more obvious than in these examples:   1.   The book's first paragraph:  "There is a great deal of speculation about the relationship between evolution and religion:  (i) evolutionists argue that all forms of life, from bacteria to people, have evolved from earlier forms of organisms;  and (ii) there are those that believe that God is an actual physical being or beings that evolved through natural processes."     A)  The phrase 'evolutionists' is incorrect.  We know that many evolutionary biologists do not accept the evolution of all life forms because of the scientific evidence, not because of a disagreement with the theory itself.  B)  Many who reject Darwin's theory of evolution do not believe in creation but instead believe that life was created by a'supernatural' being.    2.    The second paragraph:    "Evolutionists have long been criticized for confusing the cause and the effect of evolution.  The creationists have accused evolutionists of confusing science with religion.  Some scientists believe that both are true.  "    The first part of this paragraph is not true, either.  There are a few creationists who believe that a physical creation event did occur;  but the vast majority of scientists reject this interpretation of the biblical creation account.  We should also mention that the second paragraph of the chapter contains an error.  Scientists can never be wrong because there is no such thing as a science that is perfect, only a human one that is subject to criticism.  When we learn that evolution is false, it is good that there is a debate about it.  If we learned that there are no scientific errors in the Bible, then it would be impossible to debate God in the first place. The same thing is true for other religious beliefs.  3.  This sentence:   "This controversy over the origins of life has fueled the rise of religious fundamentalism among many Christians."     A)  This is an incorrect statement.  Fundamentalists are not against evolution. On the contrary, they claim that the Bible itself supports evolution. For example, Genesis 6:6 is quoted by creationists to show that God created all things on the same day. The problem with the quotation is that
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * *  *    * * * (this is an old review of a more recent book by the same author) I can only say I enjoyed the book for its unique point of view and the interesting characters in this world. However, the story lacked a clear beginning or end; there was nothing that made it easy to follow the plot line. For example, we have some characters who are clearly part of an ancient race that predates the human race and that are said to be the best of the "lesser" races in the world. But later, we learn that it was the humans who built the city of Lathander which gave them their power. Who did the building and who built it by the best standards is never quite clear, and in the end, it all comes down to the reader's guess. The ending was not bad, but there are other books out there that are better and I think this book would have benefited from a better ending. I do love the characters and the setting; the city, and the world as a whole.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in a bookstore that was extremely crowded and the whole thing just felt so forced and unnatural. I didn't feel like I was experiencing anything new, but this book just felt like it was thrown into the middle of the story.   It's hard to describe why this was so difficult to read; it was like my expectations for the book were totally wrong.  This story is about the adventures of the characters in the story of the book: "a woman" and "a man", who are traveling to a strange country.  It is a story of a man's love for a woman, and his inability to express his feelings for her.  The story is told from a man character's point of view, which I really like.  In the middle the book is so forced it really felt like a non-story, as if the author was trying to get something out of the reader, but just failed.  There is so much information that the author is not giving you in a way that makes any sense or any sense at all; it feels like she was trying too hard to make the story fit her story. I would rate this book a 3, but I feel that for such a long book, it did not need to go on so long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The thing is that it's a novel and not a short story, so it's not a great idea to expect a good story from it. It's a story about a man who, after having his daughter killed, decides to leave a broken world and travel to the other side of the world to see the rest of the land. On the way, he meets a beautiful and strange woman called "Mia". She tells him that the reason why he was attacked by a snake is because of a curse, that she is the only one who can save him and that he needs to learn to trust her, not only because she is a witch, but because she's a girl. He listens to this advice and goes to the witch's castle, where the people live. He is attacked by snakes and after some time he is rescued by the women from the castle. The man gets back to the world and starts a new life. There's not much else to say about this, it is just the usual stuff, the usual story about what a wizard does with a baby.   I think that it is very hard for a writer of horror novels to write stories about supernatural beings. You can tell how hard the author had to work when the author used the language of magic in this novel, because if he would have used normal words it would have felt weird and it would not have made sense.  :  The book is a good read, there are parts I like and parts I don't, I read it last week, so I don.t have much to say but it's an enjoyable read. I would definitely recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is my opinion that it is a really bad book!   I bought this because it is part of a "mini collection".   Unfortunately, I bought the book and it was not in the collection at all.   My only other book was "A Natural History of The World" by Francis Bacon.  In both of my books, I got a note saying it was in the next book.  The "Mini Collection" was an extra book called "The Earth" and it included the book that was not there.  I was disappointed and angry that I paid so much for this book only to be disappointed in the book it was supposed to be part of. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is mediocre, the writing was good a few years back, and the writing is good a little longer than that. The narration is atrocious; you don't really care about anything they're saying.   The first part is about some guy who has this problem with the women of the book. We don't get to know him, just what it is he does to her. The second part is an epic fight, and it's an epic scene because this is just some guy with a sword going through a bunch of people and making them fight for him. The third part is a long monologue where he goes through what it's like being gay. He's clearly a closeted gay man who has no friends, but he has a secret that he keeps from everyone, which is he's gay. It's a story of a person coming out and dealing with their sexuality and their family. The fourth part is the best part, but also the worst part. It seems to me that the author really thinks his audience will believe this story. The way that he talks about homosexuality and how the story is about coming to terms with that sexuality is the worst thing that I've ever read in my entire life.   The last part is, like, a "I feel bad for these two people" story. It is probably the best thing I've read all year and I don't know what to think about it.   A great way to finish a book about gay men.   It is still a little on the long side though.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry that I bought this, I really am. First, let me say that I've been trying for years to write about the books that I have loved since childhood. But the stories, like all the best fiction and most of the great poetry, are so complicated and so deep that the easiest way to explore them is with the lens of another person's perspective. In fact, I don't think I've ever found a good "coming-of-age" novel with a good protagonist in my life. (This is not an insult to any of my favorite authors, of course. In all honesty, I wish I could do it with them all, but I know from experience it's just not possible.) As a reader, I can't understand why so many good writers make poor protagonists.   To be fair, I have an easy time in these books of reading their protagonist's point of view, as if the writer is writing in a separate world from the reader.  I remember when I first started writing poetry, too, and it was painful to read my own writing and think of myself in a non-existent voice. I'd like to say I knew how to write like the characters in these stories when I was their age, but, you know, I'm probably not that much older than most of these characters, but that's a separate discussion. Anyway, the characters of this book are just flat, and they don't read well.  And while I understand that you need to make sure your hero is believable, it just seems like these characters didn't have anything going for them except their parents' money. I mean, what's the point?  The most interesting person in these novels is the daughter who's not an adult yet, but is in fact the oldest child, a fact she's been trying to hide since she was a child, and has kept it hidden through out her life, and she's an amazing kid who's trying to figure out who she is, but not really succeeding. She's very much like me when I had a few months to myself before college. I wanted to do a lot of things in the summer before high school, but was scared to do any of them because I didn't really know how to do them yet, and I wasn't going to know that until I was older and didn't even know if I wanted college (I'm still not sure, and that's why I was afraid to do it!).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My kids were a little put out by this book, but it was the perfect book for a rainy morning - easy to read and full of good lessons to teach.   I love these little stories of kindness, and I am glad they gave this book to the kids.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot was really poorly thought out.  The main character is introduced to us in the third or fourth chapter.  It just doesn't work in the beginning.  They then give us the story of a young boy who is forced to kill his sister because she's a witch.  This is one of those "well, I guess it's not a huge shock" books that I don't really see any logic in.  As the main character, the main conflict is about how much blood he will be willing to spill, and the solution is to "kill her."  I mean, what kind of person has to kill someone to avoid them having the ability to hurt you?  It's so much easier to avoid harm than to be hit by something, especially if you have no magic to defend yourself.  I also have some issues with this book.   First, the protagonist is a pedophile, a horrible person who has no concept of the suffering a child suffers.  Second, the narrator just completely drops it.  We have no idea what's going on.  He's trying to be a hero, but the whole book is about him trying to escape from the guilt of killing his sister.  And then in the end, he dies, and we don't learn why.  When he dies in the book, I was really disappointed.  But then I kept reading and thought about how I could have told a different ending.  So, I don a lot of horror.  If you read my reviews, you'll know that I read all kinds of books, and I like to pick and choose my favorites. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As the author has written about himself,   the book is a mixture of fantasy and science fiction.   This does not change the fact that it is a pretty bad book.  The first section of the book describes an Earth that was terraformed, with a single planet:  The planet was lush with plant life, and had a thick atmosphere full of oxygen.  This atmosphere contained no breathable oxygen,  the planet's surface had been filled in to reduce its weight,  and the surface had thinned to a depth of about a hundred meters.  With the terraforming and the lowering of its surface, the planet lost much of its atmospheric pressure.  Then the planet formed a thin ring around the star, and in orbit around the stars.  There is an interesting section on the inhabitants of this planet who live under the surface of the planet, using "plugs" to power their machines.  When the planet is no longer a terraformable world, it turns into a hostile world, but the people survive there.  A bit more on the technology:  The technology the people of the terran colonies used was quite advanced compared to the technology of the Earth before terraformation.  They also created their own version of the Star Trek communicator from a set of transistors that were implanted into the brain.  One section talks about the terrans having a technology called "hyperbolics" that they used.  I found these a bit confusing,  as the hyperbolics seem to be about the ability to see hyperbolically.  Also the hyperbolics in the book were very "sci-fi"  in that they were a little strange.  However the main point was that the terrax was much more advanced than the Earth.  So the "terraforming" and "faster-than-light travel" seemed to be just for show, and that there were no "terrans" and they were not all living in terraforms.  In fact the terrapins on the planet were all clones.   So there was no actual terraformer on the surface planet, which makes this book seem a bit pointless.  Now for the good part.  Here's the main character.  First off, she is a female human named Daphne.  She was a researcher who was trying to find a cure for her blindness and other problems caused by her mutations. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It wasn't a good book.   The characters are two-dimensional, there are way to many twists, the ending was lame, the characters were all one-dimensional and had very little personality.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   "A good book for me is one I can sit down with and put down. This one was not for me. It was a bit hard to put down, in part because the descriptions were so vivid and interesting, and in part for the plot. But it also took a long time to get going. I couldn't see myself enjoying the book that much, and I didn't finish the first novel in the series,  Tower of the Hand,  for this reason. I like to know what happens to characters early on, so I guess it was worth the wait, but I would have preferred a less intense and drawn-out story, in which there were more surprises in store." 4.5 Stars The characters are very good, and the descriptions are vivid and detailed, however the novel lacks a sense of urgency in the end. " There's some great writing here but there are some problems. The main problem is that a good story has to have momentum, but the novel does not, which I found a little surprising, but in the context of the world and the characters I suppose it was to be expected. A good story can be told in three chapters." "I enjoyed the book but was disappointed in its ending, which was too sudden and sudden. I don't know if it's the ending or the first chapter which is the thing that bugged me the most, but it did not make me feel as if I understood the story that well, which is what I need from a first-time reader. Maybe this is why I'm not a fan of fantasy; the stories seem to be about making everything up, instead of telling a well-researched story about a real world. I liked the characters though and the way they interacted with each other and with each situation."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a very fun read at first but after the third or fourth chapter the pace slowed to a crawl. For one thing, the "story" was not very interesting at all. The story was a fairly predictable and boring story of a small town. The characters are also boring because there are almost no development in any of them and the events happen almost in the same way. At the end of the book the town and the whole book are left on a cliff hanger.   I was disappointed by the plot and the characters.  5 out of 5 Great adventure novel I enjoyed the adventure part of the story and the suspense that develops throughout the story. The writing of the novel was good and the pace was great throughout the book. I do not see myself reading another fantasy series as I did enjoy this one and recommend it. It is a good fantasy adventure that is fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "This book is a complete disaster that just wants to ruin your life. I'll never look at a book the same way again. I can't even believe that I spent this much time with this book." - Laura -    This book is not a good book. It has the look of an intriguing thriller and the sound of a bad novel. The book has many things that would make a good thriller. There is a girl who is a victim of a serial killer. The killer has killed people in several states. He has a list of girls he wants to kill and he knows where he can find them. However, he needs a young girl and that girl is in a small town, the town she has been living in for two years. Her brother is a local police chief. The sister wants to come home to save the town and her life. Unfortunately, this small town is a tough place to live, but the story is too good to not give it a try. The girl doesn't seem like the type who would survive a serial murderer. The father who is supposed to be the hero of this book is just a bully. This is not the kind of story where the hero is supposed bring about the change that the town is lacking. I don't recommend this book.   *Review written 10-27-05
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I loved the first book in this series. I have now read the second, but it was just as much boring as the first. The last third was just so rushed and I just didn't care for it any more.   This review is not written to be mean but I have a feeling that some of the negative reviews are based on the fact that I bought the second book after it was out and it was a good read.  It was just very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this on a plane and had a couple hours to kill. I really like the idea of it being a "tried and true" story of how a woman finds her way as an independent woman to get what she wants in a marriage. But I felt it was a very short and short lived read, as I had so many things I wanted to say about it. I found it hard to understand why this book was such a success, not because of the story but because of it's marketing.   This is a book that has been around in some form for years. The fact that this book is being made into a movie, though, is quite the twist on history and the marketing, if it happens at all, really ruins the book's message for me.  I enjoyed the book, I just felt it's a poor story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book, with a great story and a great ending. A disappointing ending though. Read with caution. If you are a fan of this series, it is a must read. This book is not for everybody, but is a great read.   Mentioned in this blog: A Good Book to Read
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My friends and I are now on the fence about whether to order the second half of this series. The first half, which I got in hard copy in a paperback, was fine; there was a lot of story, and the characters were memorable, but the plot itself was quite disjointed. I liked the characters.   I had not read the first two books in the series, so I could not comment on them.  One thing that I do have to say about the second book, however, is that the pacing is better and the writing much more coherent.    Overall, a solid start for the series and a wonderful ending!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book. It's about a boy who learns the world from a talking raccoon, and does so in a way that he is still a child (I had a hard time believing that this was a book about a kid.) However, this book has all the usual stuff you'd expect to find in a book like this:  It's a nice read that has a lot going for it, such as a character who has a crush on a girl who he only speaks to in a whisper, and who is a complete and total slut, yet a real sweetheart, and a girl that he would kill to have as a girlfriend. This would be fine if it was just a typical romance story. It has plenty of plot. The only problem is that there are so many plot holes that the entire book is really a mess of plot holes. I found it interesting to read a book that dealt with the problem of how we perceive a person's personality, but in a realistic way. I also liked that it was a good old-fashioned story about friendship and a group of kids that had a bit of a wild past that they all have to overcome. As you would expect from a book such as this, there is some violence. It was mostly in the beginning of the book, when some people are being killed and there is more of a sexual atmosphere, but I never felt offended by any of the violence or things that went on. There is plenty of swearing and sex too, including some things with the characters that really upset me. The ending was just disappointing and did not really do what the author had set out to do. It also wasn't all that original. If it was, I would have given it a higher rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't like it, you will only waste your time.   You don't have to like it.  If people can like it and not like it then it is a waste of time. That's all there is to it. If you want a book with a bad ending, you probably shouldn't be reading the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many books written by others, but this one in particular left me a bit frustrated. It's an incredibly difficult book to review. I'm not quite sure why I was interested in reading it in the first place. It felt like a copypasta. The author seems to have a lot of personality in her writing. It didn't always make sense to me, but it was enjoyable, and in the end it didn't take much more to figure out the mysteries.   However, in her "how to" guide for solving cases, she made me feel like I needed to spend weeks figuring things out, which I didn't want to do, but I also didn't know any better. It took me awhile to get over her "I want you to solve these cases so bad!" attitude. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It really is a bad story! This is a story I have wanted to read for years.   The first half of the book is good, the second half is a drag to read.  The main characters are not as interesting as the rest of the characters are.  I can't see the end coming.  This is just a poor book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You don't buy this book because of it's great premise. You buy this one because of its plot. If you want a good plot, buy the Hunger Games books instead. I'm sure most of you reading this review have watched the first two films of the Hunger games series. They're good movies. This book has nothing to do with the movies and is more of an independent graphic novel. Not a bad choice at all, but this book was just okay. If this were the first graphic novel by someone not associated with the Hunger films, this could have been really good. Maybe.  Read Less
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was completely excited to read this book when I saw it on the shelf. I can't say the same about the reading experience. I have an older copy of the book, which I was unable to find. The reviews on Goodreads were really good about this book, so I figured I'd give it a try. I was surprised to learn the author is an author who writes horror. Not horror like Twilight, or even a horror story like The Shining. A horror story. I expected something really good. The author starts the story telling us that we'll see a girl with black hair. After this little information, the story starts to take a very weird turn. We'll go over this soon. The book starts off with a nice little romance with a girl named Jana. The rest of the story goes into what this girl did to herself. This story is filled with many disturbing, twisted situations. This book was written in the 80's and it felt like it. I didn't know what to expect, but I didn  This is definitely an oldie but a goodie, but it is a classic. The story and writing are good, the characters are very well drawn, and the themes are definitely relevant. This was a book I would read again and again. This is one of those books I will buy again just for the stories. I liked the illustrations so much. My favorite character was one of the girls from the past. I feel like a character from the story is probably my favorite character in the whole book. Jana's a really good narrator and this is definitely one of my favorite books. I don't like books that follow the classic plotlines (that is how I get scared of the movies) but this story is really a unique read. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good story, dark characters, and a creepy atmosphere.  Goodreads | Goodreads   I would like to give a quick shout out to The Book Reviewer for having this on their site as a Goodreads Choice pick!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are some very bad books in this collection. But even worse, it is often hard to tell what is bad about the book and what is not. In fact, there are so many problems in the book that you have to read it twice, because after a while you get sick of the writing. The author should have stopped writing this book a long time ago and made it a novelette. A lot of the stories are so bad that they have to be reread multiple times before the reader gets to the good ones. And many of the main characters are boring and poorly drawn, even when there are interesting things about them. And the author has a nasty habit of making characters seem like utter idiots. This was a bad buy and the author should think about writing novelettes to make up for this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the things I'm going to miss most about the old days is being able to read all the books by a favorite author.   The list of books by Robert Aickman is not easy to choose between.  He is one of the most interesting authors out there, a very good writer and one of my personal favorites.  In his novels he tells the story of a very interesting man who makes a few odd choices along the way.  My favorite book on this list, "My Name Is Red" is a true piece of writing and I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys a good story.  Some of my friends have already bought their copy.  The "Catch 22" series is one that I can remember loving.  His second bestseller is "Red Alert".  The third and most recent is "Deadly Games".  I am hoping that his next books are as good as these two.  Another wonderful book is "The Golden Key" by John Bercow.  While not a classic, it is a fun read and one that a reader can find in their local book store.   Posted by: The author at 3:39 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In fact, this is the second book I have read by this author, the first was a short story in a small hardcover. Although I enjoyed the story and story was well written (not an easy task), I had problems with the writing of the book. The story was good, the characters were interesting and well done (except the main character), but the writing in this book was quite good in its own right but not as good as it was in the previous book. Also, a few words here and there and you have a good book.   I like this author because she writes in a straightforward and direct way. She has great writing skills and uses this in her books, however, her style is not always for me.  I don't know if it is because I read this book the first time so I could understand the book, or if this is just my opinion but I prefer the less formal writing in her other books. Also the way she has her characters speaking. This is quite natural, as is the way that she has the characters talking to one another. However, if the characters speak to one other in a monologue, I feel like I am not in a story.  The story was pretty good and I really like the characters in it. I don´t know if the narrator would have worked better if she had a male voice but I understand that she couldn´t have done this because of her female voice, so I didn´t complain too much about it. Although, I thought that the story would have been better with a few things which I will list here: 1) The characters in the story did not have names but rather were given numbers 1-10. However some characters had names, e.g. I found that the main man's name was David. So in the end I am sure that I would have found David easier to understand than 10-10 which would have made it easier for me to remember. 2) Although the book was about the story about two women (the narrator and the man) I found the man in the book to be less interesting than the narrator, i.e. he lacked the qualities I was looking for. 3) The story would probably have been more interesting if the two main characters did not know each other, so that the female character could tell the narrator about herself, i will also list this point below. The male character, on the other hand, seems to be quite interested
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I really enjoyed this book, but there were a couple of problems that stopped it from being as great as I had hoped it would be. First, the characters were all a little too familiar.   They didn't feel new and unique enough.  Second, the story was a little predictable, although the author did an exceptional job of bringing it to life.  Overall, this book was fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The author is a good writer, but his writing style is overly descriptive, and does not allow for the reader to fully immerse themselves in the story. While he is not a bad writer per se, I do not think he should be writing this type of book, and I do believe that the story is not as strong as it could be. It is a slow burn of a book, where one slowly comes to see the good in the villain and in himself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (I'm not kidding; there is a whole chapter devoted to these negative reviews, if you're curious.) The best example in this book is the review by Dr. James Cantor, author of The Brain that Makes You Fat. The book itself is quite good and the writing of Dr. Cantor is a little clumsy and, well, just plain wrong.   Dr. C (as he's called) has a PhD in neuroscience (I'm sure he does) and he claims that the way that we experience the world is wrong.  If you're a "real" scientist, Dr. C must be one, but in his words, we don't even perceive "the physical world."  The book starts with a discussion of how the brain is involved in visual perception and Dr.C goes on to propose that vision is a special case of "the neural process of visual processing."   His idea is that "most people are seeing around in the periphery," which is a nice way of saying "there's a whole lot we don�t see because it's not really our business."  This is a very odd, narrow view of the brain (in fact, it's a view held by many physicists, but not by neuroscientists who are far more sophisticated in their views).  I'm sure Dr.   C was well intentioned, but the idea is a bit silly.  Dr. B (also a PhD. in neuroscience, although not a neuroscientist), claims that: 1) We only perceive the physical world 2) That world is very special, special, unique 3) The brain is really a special organ that does one thing, and that's to make us see The brain, on this view, does everything but the perceiving.   (This is a straw man, of course, but let's not dwell on this here.)  The book ends on this thought:    What Dr. Carson and Dr  B do not seem to have understood was that it is the nature of science to think outside the box.  I think this is a good statement of how this book falls apart. The last two paragraphs of the book are, quite literally, a straw-man.  The brain does not create reality, but rather uses reality.   This doesn't mean that reality can be created or altered by a brain (even a very simple one like ours that has just one neuron), but this does mean that the
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1 star   3 stars   4 stars   4 5 1 The Drowned King (M. S. Ketter) by C. S Hill, M. S Ketter This is a good book, with a very original theme. It also has a couple problems that make it not so great. I read this at the beginning of a year that was very hard. In other words I was tired. I was also bored (or bored myself). I had been expecting something more complex than a straightforward story of the end of a king. This book was a good compromise. I could understand the King and his people who have a lot to lose if he is killed. I liked the fact that King was a young adult. I did not understand the way his people would die if the king is dead. I don't know if I could tell if the King is dead or alive. The book was not a waste of time.  3 5 1 Dragonflight (Peter V. Brett) by Robin McKinley This book is absolutely perfect. It will entertain you with it's intricate world building, its stunning battle scenes, and its wonderful characters. The writing style is incredibly clear and concise, the characters are unique and complex, and the magic system is amazing. If you are a fan of a fantasy book set in a world with magic, this book is a must read.  have always been a huge fan of Peter's, even back when I thought he was a bit of a jerk when it came to women, and especially when he wrote the Dark Tower series. The best thing about this book though is that it has a good ending! This is my new book of the day, and you should definitely get it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book for children under the age of 10. It is very explicit about incest. If a reader is a young child who is considering reading this book, then they should seriously consider whether or not they are comfortable with this content. I believe it is appropriate for younger children. I would give this book a rating of "C+".
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book is one that you have problems reading but just have to buy it for a quick thrill:  No, this is not a book that I could read in one sitting, which is probably why I gave it a 2 star rating. I got the gist of what was going to happen to this one and was not too shocked to see the ending spoiled. I don't feel the need to read the rest of the book to figure out what's going on. I do however feel the author did not really give her character enough time to grow on me and the ending was rushed, which really hurt the story a bit. I will continue to buy her books but with a lot of caution.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So the first book in a long line of mediocre novels. The main character in this one is a guy who has no idea how to be a real man and he has a lot of self-disgust because he is so much more than a typical teenage boy, and his entire identity is built around the fact that he has no concept of the actual meaning of things, but in the end, is forced to go through this life just for the purpose of making other people miserable. I had the same problems with this as I have with the first two books of the trilogy. The characters are mostly despicable, and the story never goes anywhere and it's all about the angst. That's just me, so if that doesn't make sense to you, don't read it. I just found it very, very depressing.  6 of 7 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a self-proclaimed science fiction geek who's been reading science fiction since childhood, I can say that I never saw any of those stories as a metaphor for the current political climate. (I mean, I don't read SF for the political implications. My favorites are still Star Trek and I'm still a little bitter about the fact that Star Trek went off the air.) I read the original trilogy, and then reread them to see if they were any good, but after the reread, I still couldn't make out the political meaning behind the stories. I've tried to put aside the politics of the books, and even watched some of the documentaries on politics and history that have appeared on SciFi channel lately to see what the big deal is about politics in science fiction. The best political comment on contemporary events I've come across was the one that Joss Whedon made in a Firefly episode: "No, I didn't see that coming." Well, I'm not that smart, but I like to think that I didn's trust my own intelligence. The books are all very well written and enjoyable. As a book geek who likes sci fi, I love the worldbuilding and the setting. I'm hoping to see more of it in future novels. If you like this sort of book, then you might enjoy "Vortex" too. It's about a society that can communicate with psychic energy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book after being on the lookout for a short story collection of Lovecraftian tales, to no avail. The author has managed to turn these short stories into an amusing, yet disturbing read. A good read. The book's cover is an homage to Lovecraft's The Horror at Red Hook; its colors were nicely done.   Recommended, though not for everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This was a good book but it didn't hold my interest in the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book too long for what it is trying to do. It's basically a story of two brothers fighting for their lives after the death of their parents. The book is about their struggles in their parents' absence (their mother died years ago), and the aftermath of that. The first half of the book is mostly just that, the brothers fight, and they get in a fight with each other. They even fight the same brother (who is their uncle) in a way that seems kind of incestuous. The second half, though, is really good. It is about the family getting back together, learning how to play nice again, and finding some way to move on. I am really glad this book was the best I could find for my money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was ok. I didn't think it was good by any means but that's just me. It was good as a starting book to be looked into and for the first few hours I was like that guy in your high school who knew more about the new Beatles album than everyone else but still listened to all of the music he liked. I thought this book was pretty good too.   It was the kind of thing a guy like me can read, I'm not the type to read a book at night and think "what if I just did this" it was a good way to get into it.  If there was a flaw in the book, it was the story. I'm a fan of the stories in books and TV so I was expecting something interesting. It wasn't but I can't really say I had much of a problem with it. I think I would have liked it better if it had been a little more like it was presented in the video game but I wasn't really disappointed because I didn;t really have a problem reading this as a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a bad idea.   The story is not what I expected.  In the beginning I was so excited.  After that I was angry.  I'm also confused why the author is making this into a drama when the writing in this book is poor.  The last 2 chapters were just so disappointing.  There's really no plot at all and it just seems like the author went on a rant to tell people about how much she hates her brother.  It's also confusing why she is such a good reader.  She gets all the facts wrong.  So far I think this book will make a great summer read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a shame that this was the second book by this author I read after reading the first. The first book, was a very good one. The plot was interesting and the characters very believable. This book however, the characters were bland and not the type I would normally buy a book from but they were very good. I also would not call the plot boring but it was not exciting either. I am a writer and I have a great eye for character but this was not a good book at all. The author did a terrible job writing dialogue in the book, in my opinion, the author does not know how to do character development nor do they know how much he or she has to do for their characters. I would rather have someone like Daniel Abraham write a book about a vampire than read this book, the way the characters are written in this book was a let down. And yes the author made a few mistakes but overall this was a bad author book.   What I Liked:  1. The writing style  2. The story  3. The characters  4. The setting  5. The fight scenes  6. The magic in the story    And I Loved to Hate the Book: , It is boring, there is no intrigue, there was no fight scenes or magic, it was just boring, the book ends with no big conclusion and nothing left for the characters to do, it is not fun to read the last pages of the book as I was wondering what happens next. The ending made me feel like I had wasted my time with this book. I did enjoy this book but did not recommend it as I would not want to read another.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A well-written thriller that takes you into the world of a mad scientist with the goal of killing a world leader. I would love to read the rest of the books, but I can't bring myself to keep picking up more from this author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I did not have a good experience with the book."   "The author is too quick to assign blame to someone who was probably the most likely to have contributed to the disaster.   ... the fact that the reader is unlikely to learn anything about the subject matter in question is an affront to education."   The reader is a witness who only has a very limited view of the situation.  I think the reviewer is missing a very important point - it wasn't the author who made this "disaster" happen. The writer of the book did. The author did a poor job at explaining a complicated topic. I'm very sorry that you can't get it through. It's hard to read this book from a neutral viewpoint. I think the reason for that is the author is a victim. He's too close to the facts to tell what really happened. But he's a victim of the fact he has been the victim of what is really a conspiracy. I have some sympathy for the fact the author had no personal stake in this - he was a good writer, and a good person - but in his job as an investigative reporter, he has a duty to get it right. He didn't. He couldn't make it right because he couldn't be impartial. So he has to assign fault to someone else. I know this sounds like a typical conspiracy theory, but this was an actual event. It is a fascinating subject. The fact that he can't make a fair assessment of this event is because he is in the middle of one. He cannot move a rock with both feet. What he is seeing is a conspiracy to cover up something that doesn't make any sense. The real story should be told. The way the book was written is like an insider's account of the events of September 11. A lot of the factual information the author gives is wrong, or exaggerated, or is not available for him to verify on his own. The plot of this book is very well done - it makes sense and has some good action sequences, but the writing of this part of the plot makes you feel like you are living a fantasy. The reality is much more complex. I wish the author could have put some effort into writing a well-informed, detailed account of what really caused this tragedy. Maybe he would have been able to make this a better book, but he could have given you the best-written review this book has ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So when i found this book at a local library i didnt think much of it because the cover art wasn't very great, but when i got it i read it and i had to say that it was very good.  It started off okay but then it got boring, and i mean boring.  The characters were all bland and i just didn't care what happened to them.   This book did have a very interesting and well written ending that made me cry a little, but the book as a whole is just bland and boring. It was really a shame because it was one of the better books in the series, but as it is the author did the opposite of what he did in the last book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most beautiful book I've ever read in my life. I am totally in love with it.      This book is my absolute favorite.  A novel about a girl who was raised by wolves, and then became one, and eventually saved the world.  The plot: "She was a wolf. She was in a cage. She couldn't speak. But she thought, she thought and she thought. And when she thought she had thought enough, she got out."   An absolutely beautiful story about a wolf and the girl who loves her.  I absolutely loved this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I finished this book. It was a good book, but I think the problem is that I was expecting it to be more in the vein of Harry Potter. I got that feeling pretty quickly, though, so I may have a hard time getting past it. It has a lot of heart and passion in it. I think I will still be looking for a way to read it (it's a lot easier than I thought to buy it), but I wasn't looking forward to that part at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my mind, I do NOT think the book is the best in the genre.   While I enjoy all of the book's elements, they just don't work together for me.  It just feels like there's not enough of a plot and I think the characters aren't the best.  The plot is ok, I just wish it worked more for me, as it does for others.  What I can recommend is that you get some extra copies as a gift for a loved one, just in case.  A final note:  I do really love this book and I hope I'll pick it up again when I have the time, but I don't think I will.  My opinion on the book was based on the first 10 pages, and I have really enjoyed it since.  I think you'll enjoy it just as much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book expecting to love it and I was not disappointed. I loved the characters and the writing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    1.   The book is badly written and badly organized.    It's written in a really disorganized manner, where most of the pages are broken up by sections and sections have the same page numbers (which is silly when you think about it), but the author didn't do a great job of explaining it.  I had to figure out what page numbers were and then I had to find the section and look at the pages to see where they were written.  2.   There were a lot of errors in the text.  In the end, the book is really not worth the price of admission.  But if you're really good at math, or have a great memory and want to learn some math, then I suppose this book could help you out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    To be honest I don't remember much from this book. The first half of the book I can tell you that I was looking forward to reading it. I know this because I made a note of it in my notes for my second read through of the novel. But then I got to the last 50% of the first half and nothing happened. No character had a big moment. The last 50%. The only thing that happens is that a guy walks into the shop and the whole place starts to explode because of all the books. What the hell? I can understand that the author is trying to create a sense of chaos. If the author knew the readers would have had no real problem with the first 50% then the rest of the story could have been a lot more interesting. The whole thing felt so forced that it made me feel I was reading a fanfic. I don?t know about the author of this book but the fact that he has this one really good book left me wanting more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you find a book boring, tedious, or full of a few obvious bad ideas, do not read it. It's not that the book is terrible, it's just not that good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had just finished reading and I was already annoyed by the writing, and a lot of the descriptions were inaccurate and made no sense to me. I was thinking, "Why can't I see the trees and grass and how the mountains appear on the way to the lakes?"   The next chapter is more good:  The following chapter is about a lake where the lake-folk go. The lake-people are people who are very afraid of lakes and lakes only. They believe that the lake and the sky are connected and have to do things with the sky in order to make things happen to them.  They have been to the north where the sky was very cloudy with a white cloud. They tried to talk to a man in a canoe and asked him "What is the sky like?"  They were afraid to talk because they saw something white coming from the sky.   This is when the cloud comes back and the lake people are in danger:  These are their memories of that time:  "When the sky came back, we saw a great, red cloud and a white, cloud with two black lines. It was a man on a canoe, but we didn't know it was a canoe because it looked like a ship or a boat, or a mountain. The sky looked like it was floating across a blue sea with two white lines on it."   A white mountain with a blue sky. That was beautiful.  I was a bit disappointed but I thought, at least they tried.  Next, it was about a mountain with white mountains. They went up a hill and got a great view. They looked for a good place to camp. The next day they heard thunder and lightning so they left for a place where there was more lightning. I don't think I liked the idea of trying to climb a mountain where lightning was so close.  The last chapter is an account of a time in a past when a man named Shum got an idea and set off with his friend Tum to find a woman who was called Umm.  He said that she was a queen, but Umm was the daughter of a king. Shum found her and they went to the king, who sent two princes.  Umm, of course, was not interested, so Shum returned to Shum. This book is great and worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is pretty bad. My main issue with this book is the author. She writes in a very impersonal, robotic way that is very annoying and annoying. I wish this book was written by someone else so I could give it a positive review. If you are looking for a fun read with a good story, then this book will be right up your alley. However if you are into real stories, you will be disappointed. I have a great book club with other book lovers and have read this book in order to have someone to read with and it was a disappointment.   Overall - 3.0 stars (based on a 7 rating scale)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book, one I've wanted to read for a long time. I did not like most of the characters but enjoyed the end of the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a total waste of time I wasted reading this book. When I was on vacation this past summer, I had this book with me and I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I don't want to spoil the fun for the rest of the world, but in fact, I couldn,t stop reading it. This is an intriguing story about a boy who goes from having no friends to being friends with all his classmates because of a magical book. This story is really entertaining, but there are many other things that are wrong with it:  The first mistake I made was that I expected there to be a happy ending. The only happy ending that the author gives us is one that makes the reader feel bad about themselves because the boy didn't get to spend the summer with his friends.  A few pages later he is given an extra friendship (that he didn't ask for) and is then given the one thing that has made all his trouble vanish:    he has a magic book that makes him a super smart person. I'm sorry, but no. He should have had a normal summer with no magic and no super smartness, because that's how a normal kid experiences summer.   In short, this book is not fun to read, it is boring, it's repetitive, and it lacks a happy outcome. In conclusion, this is a book that I would not recommend to a child or to an adult.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you enjoy reading fiction, this is not a good book to read.   This book is very pretentious and does not really tell a story or do anything to make it interesting or engaging.  Instead, it is a boring, formulaic story in a genre that is not the best for developing a character or story, and it will leave you with a headache if you try to get into the author's mind or to understand why she writes the way she does. The story is almost entirely predictable.  Most of the characters, or those that do have any depth of their own, are shallow and are basically there to get the author out of trouble.  And the author is the one who does the getting out of troubles by the book.  Her heroines don't grow in the way one would hope from such a weak story.  The only time that it does grow is when the villain does.  This is really an excuse to create a character who is "bad" just to make the readers hate him.  You can't just have any character, even one who is likable, be "bad", and be expected to make readers hate them in order for them to become "good".  This leads to poor character development, bad characterization, and lots of repetition.  In the end, the plot is more like "a good book about a good story" than the plot of a good novel.  A bad book is good because the plot makes good writing look bad. This is an example of a writer making poor choices:  - Using a "chosen one" for the main character to "be bad" - Writing a "love interest" who is so poorly developed, and then giving him the best and only love interest in the story, who is very shallow in personality and completely unrelated to the story - Having a "villain" who, as the book goes on, is more interesting than the main heroine of the book, who has the best characterization of any female character in the book - Giving the protagonist a very boring, stereotypical personality - Using the same, boring, stereotype character for the "good" and "bad side" of the plot - Having two characters who are completely different and not related in any way, or not related at all - Trying to make a villain out of the character of the "hero" - Using "bad guy" and villain for an "evil" and a "good guy"  - Writing two characters as
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of this book is a simple one: a human being is born in a cave and raised in the mountains with the animals, and by the time he is 18 he has forgotten how to use tools. That's it. The author writes about the adventures of a man named Elisha during his 19th year. He is able to use the rock-carving tools he had learned in his childhood, but he still has the problem of using a fork. He spends the last 6 months of his life learning to use this tool. After spending so much time at the cave, the story ends with the author saying "I'd been through a lot, but not that much." The author gives a great synopsis about the book, but then jumps to the ending and fails to describe the details of what the book actually is. The first half is interesting enough, but the second half is a bit rushed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate writing negative reviews.   The author made some good points, but I feel like he has over-emphasized them, and this book just feels a little rushed in places, and he just had too many other novels to write about.  It's not bad; it's just a little too formulaic.  I would love to read more of his work.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    Goodreads  How to: A Guide for Librarians, by J.L. Wiest, is a wonderful book on how to use the internet as a resource for libraries, and what to do about the Internet Archive.  (If you're looking for a library of online resources, the Internet archive is one of the best on the web. You can search for stuff in the past, in PDFs, as you browse through them, etc. and even get information about things you don't know about or haven't heard about yet.)  The book also gives lots of ideas for using the Internet for general research purposes and includes a section on the Web's history and the importance of online archives. (The Internet Archive started in 1987, so this is way before the dotcom bubble was bursting.) There are even chapters about using e-books (which are now the de facto standard for reading electronic books online) and about using the Web as a public library.   The best part of this book is how simple it is to use it--you can take any information on the Internet and find it using the links the author provides.   to: a review of a book:   I was hoping for something a little more useful--I've been using the online reference tools on the World Wide Web for a long time now, but still have no idea what the heck I'm doing. This book really makes it easy to find anything you need and is well-written and thorough. If you're a librarian and you think a good source of information is the Internet, this book may be just the book to turn to.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This is an example of how the world of science fiction works. If you take a fictional story about a world where the aliens are supposed to be benevolent and the humans are all genetically engineered, then you add in some aliens who are the villains and/or are trying to destroy the world, then that would be what a good dystopian story is about, right?   That's exactly what this is. The humans are not genetically engineered so the "good" aliens are not trying to kill the humans. No, the "evil" aliens were once on the side of good, but a war broke out and the human race ended up being "rescued" by the aliens. In order to prevent another war, the humans go back in time and erase all evidence of the war and thus wipe out all evidence that might prove that the humans and the aliens were on the same side, so the humans become the good guys, and the evil aliens are the bad guys. The book also has a lot of political stuff, which I personally find to be pretty boring, but the aliens (who can be described as being "good") also have a very vague and arbitrary definition of good and bad. In this case, the aliens believe that good is doing what's best for all living things, and bad is doing things for one's self or for one group of people, without regard to the long-term consequences. For instance, the one time they try to kill a baby, they're not trying in the long run to save a mother's life, or prevent the child from suffering. They just know that killing an infant would have been inhumane, but in the short run it's a lot less bad than killing a healthy child (even though they don't give a crap about the long term consequences). This is a bad way to look at morality because if you have a moral code that's absolute and has no exceptions or balances, you're going to wind up with people being bad in all circumstances or not doing anything at all even if they don the most horrible thing you can think of. It's just not realistic.     That said, the novel is not a bad read in itself. Some of the descriptions of the alien's language are really cool (like the alien race has a kind of "frolic in a box" language that they use for fun, or a way of talking about other living things that sounds like a cross between "d
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You can feel the bad-ass vibe of the book. If you are looking for a book about a warrior princess, then this is not it. There are just not that many stories about women in the fantasy genre that are actually relatable and entertaining. But if you like sword & sorcery, are not afraid to be a little gritty, and you enjoy a good fantasy, then you will probably find something to enjoy here.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The Book that inspired this whole thing is "The Book That Could Have Been". My first book, I had some real trouble with it. The first half is quite good, I guess. It's more or less like a prequel to "The King of Dragons" (or maybe it's the other way around. I still haven't been able to figure that out.) However, the second half, where the protagonist was just basically the guy who went in to be a mage, and then got more and more of his soul stolen out of his body (until it was the only thing left) was so painfully awful and dull that I just couldn't give a damn. Not only was this book just plain awful, but the plot was a complete mess. The plot is so contrived that it's hilarious. It made the story completely useless for me. This book is basically a prelude to "Fevre Dream" which I think is just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever read. I think it's an awesome book by itself, but I don't recommend it.  4 stars:  A novel set in a world of magic and gods, that is both funny and intriguing. A nice blend of epic fantasy and horror, with a story that feels very original, yet has all the clichés you've come to expect in a fantasy book. A little confusing at points, but worth it. 5 stars: A
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part about this book is that the writer is a complete shit. I know he was inspired by a book I recently read and then wrote, but he was too much of a dick to even try to follow the original tone. The protagonist is a man with no empathy for anyone and no respect for the feelings of others, so when his wife goes away for a couple of years to raise her children, he becomes a total shit. What's more, he goes on to get involved with another woman in a situation that basically amounts to him being an asshole. He does it to himself as well. I was shocked at how poorly the book turned out; it was too cliched for my tastes and had some major holes in it. It was just a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really did not like this book.   It's bad.  I'm not just talking about the book's plot, the writing is horrible.  It doesn't have the depth of a James Bond book, the humor, the dialogue.  Instead of being the best Bond novel I've read.  What makes the book really bad is the way the author writes, and the way he tries to make it about the Bond franchise as a whole.  The Bond movies are great, but this is no James Bond novel.  This is not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -This book is not worth a single star. I've read many a novel with a fantastic plot and an excellent plotline. What has happened here is simply the exact opposite - and the writing just goes from bad to worse. In this case, the plot is so bad that if the authors would've stopped at the first two chapters they could have saved everyone the trouble. They keep going into the depths of utter stupidity and then they say the most absurd thing. The most recent examples: a character who is not named -who is not in any other book we have ever heard of- and he suddenly remembers all the information we have known about him. (which is all he needs to be a genius- is that he is "one of the most important people in the universe")...and that he knows all the other "most important people" -in a sense- and that they also know everything. (and the character in this book who is named is NOT in any book we know of and he has NO history with any character in the book who might be important. So where is the story in this one? It's a complete waste of time.) They say it is important that a character know "everything", but then we have him suddenly remember the people he used to know and not knowing who any of them are makes no sense and makes the book almost incomprehensible at times. The writing is terrible, and the dialogue is also bad and unintelligible. So I don't recommend this one- and I'm going to have to write a better review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book but I felt it would've been better had a bit more of a focus on the characters. A few moments here and there felt forced and some of the characters felt very shallow.   I liked this but I thought it would have been better with a bit of focus on characters.  The book follows a young couple whose life is turned upside down when their teenage daughter is kidnapped by a group of teenage criminals. They discover a new way to communicate with each other as she begins to open up to them.  The book follows the couple's relationship and struggles.  While the characters were interesting, the book's main story felt like it lacked a bit and wasn't as strong as it could've been. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *I'll be honest, this book just doesn't have any magic to it. It's a little bit slow, but it never gets boring. The characters all fall into place and the pacing is perfect throughout, no filler. *One other thing I really like about this book: The ending.   The ending is completely surprising and unexpected.  If I'd given this book 2 stars, I probably would've given it 1. *Overall, I give this a 6.9/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What is with these writers and reviewers who write crap reviews about bad books, then post their un-review with a positive one about a good book?  This review is a rant written by someone who really didn't like this book. This book is about two kids trying to get into the music business. It is a very strange and interesting story, but I really have nothing to add to the positive review other than that it is about kids who are trying to be in the music industry.   This book is a comedy of errors. This is not an easy book to read, and the author has stated it. It has a few plot holes but that is not the point of the book. The plot holes were caused by the author's desire to write a good story about kids trying for a career in the recording industry. The book should have ended when the kids got the record deals they wanted. Instead, the author gave it an entire third act, in the end the kids are still trying to become a record company and the rest of the plot holes are revealed.   That's it. That's all there is to it. The author's only fault is that he tried to write this as a comedy book about kids in the record business, but he couldn't pull that off, because it isn't really about kids. The kids aren't even in the movie at all. The movie is basically a montage of a bunch of scenes. The point of this book is really about how a kid becomes a record executive, then becomes the manager of a band, then eventually gets his own record deal. That is the end of the story.   (Not to be pedantic about this, but why is the author so invested in the premise of the movie that he went out of his way to build a plot for a movie? In my opinion, a movie isn't a novel, so why is he writing a book about what happens when a kid wants to be a musician? This book had a lot more to do with what happened after the movie, so this is another case where the author should have stopped writing the book and wrote a sequel to the movie he's already created.)   The narrator does a very poor job of describing events, sometimes he's a little too detailed, so even if the story has a bad beginning, it's easy to figure out what's going on. Also, it doesn't help that the book is narrated by a creepy little kid who is
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually read books by young adult authors, as I'm usually interested in more mature fare, but I'm glad I decided to give this one a chance. This book was so good that I just had to take a chance and pick it up. It's not a very original book or particularly original genre, so the fact that the author manages to make it work is commendable. The characters are memorable, the story is engaging and, at its core, is about a friendship between two people who have both gone through hard times and yet are willing to accept what their life will become without complaining. In this case, this friendship doesn't involve a lot of romance (although, it's pretty intense!), but it's the main motivation for the story and I was glad to read about that. The last couple of chapters were very short, but they added some depth to the story, which I found very interesting. The ending was also kind of neat. I've read lots of books that ended with a cliffhanger, but this was a satisfying conclusion with a satisfying closure. I enjoyed reading this story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are moments that really put this book to the test. One of the things that really stands out as a little annoying is that this book's author wants to know the story of each character and their journey in the book. It's not like I can't relate to their situations, but there should be a little bit more context than this.   I also found the characterizations quite shallow. The author goes overboard with the character's names. He has these great names for all of them, and it becomes quite annoying. There are so many characters in this book that have different names than the author. Also, when this author was describing a character's past he would always refer to them by the first name. I'm like, "I don't think that's the way to refer to a character".   In terms of writing style I would say that this is a really good book with a few major problems. I don't feel like I'm reading a book that has all of the major issues that are common for a first person book, so I'm happy with this book overall.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I don't know if I'd go so far as to say I hate it, but I can definitely see where the reviewer is coming from. It isn't bad in any way shape or form, but this is an enjoyable read with a few flaws. It is definitely a work of fiction, but it lacks a certain kind of magic. Some parts were a bit too close to reality for my liking, and there is a bit of a dryness to some of the characters that made me feel a little uncomfortable. The writing isn't amazing, but the characters and themes are well written. Overall, this is a fun read that was well written for a novel that's as short as it is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started this book excited. The book is called "A Long Walk to Babylon". The author claims that it was based on an actual experience that he had with his father. However, the actual source material is not mentioned. This author is a fraud. I can't believe I spent over 1 hour looking for this book only to find that I already have it in the library.  The book opens with a story from the late 1940s of the author's childhood. The story was told to his family about the father's attempt to build a house for a friend who had a poor heart. The father made a house and named it "Kermit Kermit". When Kermit heard about his father's success he decided to build his own house. In the summer of 1964, the father had to make a decision: do you build it now or build it when Kermit is old enough to build it? He decided to take the easier route and build it at the age of 7. He made a few minor modifications in the original design and decided to name his house Kermit's House. The author claims the Kermit Kermits, a group of people from the future, arrive on Earth at the same time in 1964 and visit the Kermits' house. There they learn that the Kermis built Kermit a boat and that he went to the ocean and sailed away. He then got lost and ended up on Kermit island. There he met a monkey. He decided to return to Kermit with the monkey. The monkeys then taught Kermit to ride a kangaroo on the back of a pig. When Kerms saw that his son could ride a pig the next time they meet they decide to teach the Kerms's daughter to ride the pig. It was a simple decision but as a father, I was furious. The whole thing sounded crazy and I couldn't believe that this book was about the Kermas. This book was not very interesting. I would not recommend this book to a child. , April 22, 2015

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I read this book I was intrigued. The writing, the characters, and the world were intriguing enough that I gave it a try. And so far I'm not disappointed. But this book has a LOT of flaws, I think, that keep me from recommending it. The characters are incredibly bland. There is not much plot, and it seems as though the author, just to cover up some shortcomings, did little more than copy from the Harry Potter series. There isn't a clear definition of the "magic" in the book either, so in addition to having a huge problem with the way in which the author uses the magic and plot device, the reader is left with a bad taste in his mouth that the "gifted" kids in Harry Potter are never really able to shake. I mean, it makes a lot of sense for a wizard to be able to do things that seem almost impossible... but, still, that doesn't make it fun or interesting.   (If I want to read a book about a wizard with a wand, I'll go read some Harry Potter.) The "magic system" in this book also doesn't work well enough. It's not hard to imagine a situation where someone who has a wand and uses it to "control" someone else would be able manipulate that person to do whatever he wants, so that is something that is impossible for Harry. Even with his magical powers, the situation doesn't seem like something that can be overcome just by saying "Yes" or "No." As it is, Harry has the power to make Hermione obey him, and he can't just tell her what to do, so he does all the hard work, and all it seems like is the book's way of trying to make the magic system as easy as possible to understand.  The book is also very light on the characterization of any of the characters. The main character (the one who wants to be a witch) is a bit thin. I don't know why the author felt it necessary to make Harry a girl to make this novel work, since most boys don't have a natural inclination to be witches... but even with Harry's "femininity," it doesn't really work, because all the other characters are almost completely devoid of any characterization. Even the witch "father," who, in all likelihood, is evil and is only trying to harm Harry, is pretty one-dimensional, as is the "husband" who takes after
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My father read this book when I was in high school. I liked the main characters, but I never felt like I really got to know them. My only other "book" that I have read that is similar is "The Book of the Witches." My father did not buy that book. Instead he bought a copy of " The Book of Dust" and he really liked that one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1.   This was the only book I have ever read that had me rolling around on the floor after the last chapter was over.  2.  Not only was the writing horrendous ( I could never read a word to the end ) but the story itself was extremely weak.  3.  The premise of the book made no sense, the protagonist was completely incompetent and the author made no effort to explain what was going on to the reader.  4.  I know that books aren't meant to be "one-and-done" but it was a really, really bad experience.  5.  When I finished this, I felt like I had been robbed, like I got the short end of the stick.  6.  There were other books that I would've preferred over this.  7.  This book made me want to punch a few people in the face.  8.  If you're reading this, do yourself a favor and just skip the rest.  9.  It's bad.  10.  Very, very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author didn't know anything about her subject and left out crucial details. When I read the book in the library a few months back, I couldn't get past the first half. When it came time to go to school, I just ignored it. So I just sat at home and read the "bad" stuff. The author never once commented on the problems she had with her subject in the introduction. No "the book was just like that one time you had a bad day..." No "that was just the way it was..." No comment about how boring it is.      So, here it is:  The book is divided into two parts: the first is about how to use the term "gay" in English. In other words: how it became acceptable to say "the homosexual" rather than "a homosexual" and why. The second part is about other LGBT topics: bisexuality, transgendered people, queer theory and so on. I did like this part, because the author seems to believe that queer theory can be useful as a tool for LGBT people.  What the author says about queer theory is: "In a way, it is a way to make LGBT people's lives more normal in the mainstream, and it has the advantage of not being about the oppression and marginalization that the main LGBT movement tends to focus on. In addition, it does a good job of explaining the ways that LGBT people are different and not "others," which is a term that is so widely abused." As you probably already know, a lot of the people and movements "that use the word "other" are actually heterosexist.  How is this useful?   Here are a couple examples: "Bisexuality, it turns out, is not merely a choice. It's something that many bisexual people, especially women and men, feel about themselves all the time." "Being bisexual doesn't mean you're "confused" about what gender you're attracted to. It means you're sexually attracted to people of all genders."   It's not the author's fault that the term queer is so commonly abused. But it does seem strange to say that queers are not oppressed and therefore not relevant.  The part of the book that I really liked was the "transgendered" chapter. The only problem with it is that it's completely contradictory and useless, and the author didn'st seem to have enough knowledge
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure I can really call this book a "bad book" because this one is a very strong tale that could easily be found on a multitude of other fantasy lists.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     It was ok, but I didn't love it. It has a good beginning, but that's the whole book. The ending was a waste of time because all the action happened within the first page and that's really it. I was expecting an epic.   My one problem with the book is that she tries to be a good author by adding in a lot of "tricks" and plot twists, which didn't work well for me. It wasn't that the twists were bad, I just found myself not caring about them. This is probably the most entertaining book in the trilogy, but there are plenty of good books in this series, I'll try to pick the ones I liked.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Goodreads does have a good reputation for reliability, but it does seem to be getting worse.   I have only had good experiences with Goodreads, and my experience with the Goodreads.com author site has been excellent (though the author search process has been slow).   Overall, this is a good book, and a nice little book to have in the collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I don't like it at all.   If I was writing a negative I would say the characters don't even make any sense. I thought for sure they would be a little bit more likeable than this.  I really did not want to read this book, but my dad bought it for me and it was $5! It is an easy read and I enjoyed it. I guess I will get to the part about my feelings. I will start my reviews at the beginning.  - This book was good, but not great. The characters were interesting, but I just did not care for their relationship. They did not have much chemistry. The way it was written, the love story was very very well done and I liked it, but the whole time the characters were so far away from each other that they did not really connect. If I have to say any good thing about the book, the narrator was excellent. She brought out the feeling of the setting and the events that happened. The main reason I kept reading was because of her. I think she was great.  This book is pretty good and I would recommend it for anyone who wants to get into science fiction and fantasy.  I give this 3.5 stars out of 4 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like this book, it's a good book, but it's not a great book. It's okay, maybe.    I had expected a great story, something much more compelling and interesting than it is, and that is what I got.        What I didn't expect was for the story to be so uninspired, and to be written so poorly.  What did I like about this book?    It's a well written story about what happens when a woman (and a woman's voice) is a hero in a story about a monster.  It has a little bit of magic, the monster and his girlfriend's magic are a little more fleshed out than the typical, cliché "magic of love" trope.  The monster's magic, however, is a little confusing.  Some of the scenes seemed to happen offscreen.  For example, a woman was about to leave a party, so she asks for a ride in a car.  She's told "I can't have you in this car, because you're not dressed like a girl" but the next scene she's in a dress.  Then the girl starts making a point.  In this scene, her magic starts coming out (in the form of a necklace) and the monster says that she looks more like a boy.  But then he asks her why she's changing, and she says "Because I'm a girl".  I understand she is changing, but at the same time, that shouldn't be the only reason for it.  I also think it's important to be in charge of your own body, not others'.   Overall, I really enjoyed the book.  And I would recommend it to anyone who's into this kind of thing, but I'm not the kind of reader who loves to read like this. Why is this book bad?   I'm going to use my own words here: The writing is terrible.    First of all, the story.  This book is terrible because it is written.  First off, the style is a total mess.  There are no good sentences, no good paragraphs.  No flow.  Nothing in there.  Instead, the author writes the same thing over and over again.  Again, this can be seen in every scene, and it's just terrible to read.  Also, if the story had been more interesting or complex, maybe it
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has great characters. A good story. I was shocked at the ending. I enjoyed it. But in the end it didn't seem that much like a story I would want to read. The ending leaves too many questions unanswered and leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. This was one I was sure I would hate. I have been waiting for the next book to come out but I am not sure how long that will be.

"I enjoyed it, but didn't like it at all."    "It wasn't bad, but I felt like I could have done better."    "It felt very forced and rushed."         These are just a few of the comments that I've received from readers.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the authors at this library don't understand the meaning of "literary." The books they sell are all about the book.   I would rather read "Lila in Love," "My Sister Is a Geisha" or "The House That Ruth Built."  My favorite book is "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  You can tell there's a lot of passion in the text because he writes it in the second person.

It's a book that you can reread many times."   -Beth Rodden, Publisher's Weekly "A book that can make a real difference.  You are going to love this book. It is a delight."   -Karen Smith, Book Riot (starrated review)    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing was ok, I'm just not a fan of the character of Boggs. I also had a hard time following the plot. My copy doesn't include the author's notes, so I have no idea what kind of character he's written for his characters. I read this book in July 2009.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to start this book!   But then after reading the first few chapters I realized that I'd never be able to get through this book, because the author seems to have never finished reading the book he's writing.   Instead he just creates a new character and calls him Duke, which is a completely pointless change from who he was in the first place.  Then there is the whole thing about his friend.  He has a friend named Duke that he likes a lot, but is afraid to admit to his friends because he doesn't want to hurt Duke's feelings.  But, Duke says, you don't have to be afraid of your feelings. You can be yourself, and people will be able  to accept you for who you are. But the rest of the book is about Duke's relationship with Duke's brother and how Duke was afraid that Duke would find out about the relationship between Duke and Duke's friend.  Then they make out in front of Duke's friends!  The end.  So, instead of taking a page out of  The Stand  and having his friend be the protagonist of the story, he decides that his friend Duke should be the hero.  Then we have the entire last third of the novel about Duke and his friends making out in a park.  But he is still afraid of Duke knowing about the situation between Duke's boyfriend and Duke and says he is not ready to have sex.  The whole book is like that.  No matter how hard Duke tries he can never make him happy.  It is so painful for him.  I read this book to read about Duke, not to get to know about Duke himself.  That's a bad reason to read a book.  What the heck, he's my favorite character, and I'm sure I'll enjoy reading about Duke too, so I can understand why someone would not want to read his story.  As a child I loved this book. My mother read it to me when I was young, so that I could understand why people liked the books.  And the characters made me feel like I could be one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        The book is absolutely a trashy, cheesy, boring, self-congratulatory, and anti-semitic novel. I found the plot to be quite shallow, with the only important characters being the two main characters, one Jewish and the other Christian (but not necessarily Christian), both of whom are clearly the main characters for the sake of convenience and story convenience. The characters are written in a very juvenile way and with a very crude manner, especially when it comes to the Jewish characters, as they are frequently referred to as 'Yids', as well as a number of other slurs that go against Jewish sensibilities.   The novel ends with a large 'f*** you!' from the Jewish character, and this was completely unnecessary as the book does not make any attempt to provide the reader with any context for the 'f**k you!' as the writer made no effort to provide any context whatsoever. I'm glad the author didn't write a 'f*ck you' to the Jews as it does not fit with the tone of the book.  The only redeeming character in the story is the Christian character, who acts as the hero of the story throughout the course of the novel.  The book contains one of the worst plot twists I have ever seen in a fiction work, in that the antagonist, the 'good guy' in the novel, is actually a very unpleasant man who only pretends to be a good guy.  It's clear from the beginning that the author was planning on this villain to be the main character, but that plan was foiled by the author's failure to understand basic Jewish etiquette.  I can only imagine that the entire plot, from beginning to end, took the author one day to write, as there are no scenes or paragraphs that could be regarded as a well written scene/paragraph.  In addition, the author never once tried to disguise his disdain for Judaism, and his blatant disregard for Jewish sensibilities as stated in the first line of the first chapter, 'This is the way the Jews say goodbye.'   The only positive characters in the book are the Christian hero, and the Christian protagonist of the Christian villain's quest to avenge the death of his family.  But the villain of the tale is not only despicable but also anti-Semitic, with some of the most despicable anti-Jewish slurs I've ever read in a fictional work.  This book is also completely pointless to read in comparison to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I were to rank this as a child, I'd give it a 3/5. I read it around age 9.   There are many interesting ideas in it (the concept of "sociological time travel," the idea that science is just an extension of language, etc.), but the writing style is not always smooth and professional. In some ways, this book was not bad. I liked the concept of time travel, and there are some interesting and worthwhile ideas in here, but I would only recommend this book for people who are very interested in science and psychology. It could have been a lot better, but the ideas were interesting enough to keep me reading.  2.5 stars.  I was very interested to read this book. I thought it was a good concept and the ideas behind it were very interesting. The author is a great and interesting person, and I have a great admiration for the fact that she thinks about all these ideas.  In this book, she claims that all people have different time speeds and that in order to live a normal life, we need to be at our optimum speed, which is different from the normal human speed of the body, which we are all at different levels of. She thinks we can alter our body speed by learning to alter our brain function, so that the body's normal speed is not the same as the human speed, and that we can live at different times from our normal time speed. When this idea is put into practice, this means that we don't have to get up from our desks in the morning, we just need to get out of bed and work. This is why we all have different times that we live in, and we live more like animals. It seems a good idea, but unfortunately the book gets into a lot of technical details and doesn't make sense.  I don't know why the author used all these complicated terms, and why her ideas are so complicated. What I did learn was that she believes that if people are to live normal lives, the only way to make this work is to learn to be able to alter the brain and our body speeds at different points of time. That means that people need to learn a new way to get ready for the day, to get to work, to learn new skills, to be different people at different periods of time, etc. This idea that all of our lives are a form of time traveling is interesting, but it doesn
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ...I had to read a lot more to know what the plot is all about, but then I decided I could live without it. The first thing I noticed was how similar it was to my own childhood, and how much of it was actually a lie. I'm sure some parts were, but some were not. There were no pictures, and there were no stories that had anything to do with the actual people in the story. They are the stories that were told to me by a friend about other friends of ours. The stories were either about a new friend who suddenly had a lot to do, or about someone whose past had somehow come to get to her in a major way. There was a boy who lived at his father's house and went to school with his mom's brother; that is not a friend, by the way. I read the book over and over, and I can't remember the ending, because it was so boring. It's like they got bored and left out the "dramatic conclusion," which was that the bad guy's mother had died in the car crash and his mother was going to spend the rest of her life trying to get her husband to be a better father, and her son's dad had died. What happens when a child is told his mother died and his father is dead? He just forgets about both, and he doesn't remember his life after those events. Well, that's what happens when you don't give a child any memories of what his parents are like, and when the life you are trying to give the child is the life that you would like to have, then the child will eventually be what you want him to be, and it's okay that he doesn a bit of a jerk.   I read a review a while back which said that the character who had to die was an important character in the plot. I have a feeling that the author was trying to make a point about having to kill people.   It's like a bad drug. It doesn't even really do anything for you. You just think it's better than taking the drug.  There was this very nice little scene in the second story where the character from the beginning talked about the things that her parents didn't want her to do. It reminded me a little of how my mother used to talk about how I needed to get some education and that I was going through a stage of development that I didn't

Write a negative review about a bad book:     The book doesn't have a plot. Its a long narrative about a single family on their way to a holiday in a vacation spot. There are a number of problems with the book, especially the introduction that mentions the author will publish a sequel that will be about two years later.   This first part was boring and pointless and did not provide any real insight into the author's past and ideas.  The author does not mention where in the world this holiday is being held or where they got this information, but it sounds like a good story.  After this, the book descends into boring rambling. The main problem is that the main character is an over-emotional, moody teenager who talks about things he wants to do, but not very much. And he gets stuck with his family because of his own stupid selfishness and lack of a real goal. His mother seems like a nice person at first but eventually gets annoying and her reaction to any problem makes the whole book even more boring. The two protagonists do not interact much at all because they are so much the same person.  I think there could have been some interesting character development if the author had written a couple of years earlier about a new character and his family, but instead we have the same boring, emotionless teenager every time he pops up. The author is only able to tell one story in a few pages and this is not even good enough to be a book in its own right. It was just filler.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The Good:  * the cover is very good and very well designed and a really good fit for a good looking book.   * a great first novel.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been meaning to try this book for a while, but I never had a chance until recently. I got it in a special deal on a college library's e-book store and it seems to be the only place where it is in print. This book does not disappoint. It has a great story, and it has a very cool system of magic called the Diatribe that creates a magic word which you can repeat to summon people of the Diaspora, a sort of magical version of a Diasporan folk song. This is a very well done book, and very good for a first book. There is a little too much of a focus on the plot for a beginning reader, but it does have some interesting ideas. There are a number of good bits of fantasy here for new readers to get hooked on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the first book in my "Love Love" series.   The book starts with a bad review about how a book got cancelled, and this was a book I had been looking forward to.  When I bought this book, I expected a bad story about a girl falling in love with a vampire, but what I got was a good story about trying to break the chains that were holding you back, the girl getting herself to believe in herself and breaking the chains.  I liked the main characters and liked the world they lived in.  The plot of the book was good.  It was a fun book and I enjoyed it.  Overall, I recommend this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book. I bought this book because it came recommended by one of my friends who had a similar problem with an author that I was intrigued by. I'm glad I did, but my enjoyment of this book was short-lived. I am not a fan of the book's subject matter and the author doesn't really make it clear whether or not she had read previous books in the series to prepare her. I don't remember any other issues with the book, but I wish I could have enjoyed it a bit more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in the summer of 2008 and enjoyed it quite a bit. It was a decent enough read for me to finish in 2 days. It had a good pace to it. However, the author could have done a better job at developing and explaining what was going on in the book. The story was not that interesting in a traditional sense, and it was hard to really understand why the people in the city were so desperate and why they wanted to destroy the city. I guess what I am trying to say is that it was a slow and boring read.   3 stars out of 4

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've seen a lot of people who have read this book say that it is really, really bad. I don't think that's fair, because I have read much worse books. I would even go so far as to say that the writing is not even remotely bad. The writing style is extremely generic, but it's not necessarily bad. There are a lot more "graphic novels" (books with illustrations) than I've read before, and a lot less "text books" (pages that you just flip through to read the text).  What makes this book a bad one is in the content. While the content is generic, it's still very good. It's a very well-written book, and while there's a lot to like about it, it just doesn't match up to other books in the same genre. You get a lot from this book, but not a lot.  You have to know that this is what it says: "In the midst of a global food crisis, a group of activists in New York and Los Angeles set out to turn the tables on global food conglomerates, taking the first steps towards a world without industrial agriculture and genetically modified organisms. The food industry has been able to maintain its stranglehold on the world's food supply thanks to an endless flow of cash from the multinational food companies, but is poised to lose control. When a young woman is accidentally infected with a pathogen from a giant biotech corporation's experimental GMO, she sets out to become the face of a movement that could change the future of food and medicine forever." While the book starts out well enough, it gradually gets more and more boring and predictable. It doesn't feel that the movement is going anywhere, that there are many movements in place, or that the message is any different from what was already been said before.   The most frustrating thing about this book is that even though it starts out poorly, you eventually come to appreciate what's going on. It might sound crazy to say this, but there's something really good about seeing the same things that others say happening in the world. The book does a very good job of showing how a bunch of individuals who are not always the most well-informed (including a little girl) can all come together with a common goal and change the world for the better. What I liked:  This was a really good book, even if it has the same flaws as other books about

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I have to say that this was a very disappointing book to read. I was really looking forward to this book. I had been looking forward so much to reading about the creation of life on earth and in the ocean. Instead it just felt like a boring and repetitive book. It is also very hard to put down after you finish it. This book does have a very strong message about how science, logic, religion, etc., is used in these books and they always feel so very pointless and boring.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A well researched and detailed article on how children and adults with Asperger's spectrum disorder cope with various problems and challenges, including bullying, anxiety, ADHD, anger management, body dysmorphia, autism, gender identity issues, and being the butt of a joke." --Jennifer C.  * * *  I've read the author's book on this subject, and I think it's a very well researched, well written piece. I think the author has a very unique perspective on Aspergers because he has it as a child himself.  in my opinion, it's an important subject and needs to be discussed. " The best way to understand Asperberg's syndrome is to read the book. It'll show you exactly why she has so many quirks and has her own unique style of communicating. This book will not only open your mind to a different type of disorder, but will help you realize that you too are one of her children, and that everyone is the child of someone that we may look at and think is crazy or different, but isn't.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this book should have been published by a smaller press like Houghton Mifflin or McSweeney's.   The plot and characters are very poor.  3 out of 5 stars:  The story is about a woman named Jenny whose grandfather died in the second World War. Her father was a soldier who served in the Korean War.  They lived on a farm in Indiana where Jenny's mother died after a long illness in 1946.  Jenny's older brother, Mike, a veteran who served with a black ops squadron in Vietnam, was raised in the military.  He has a lot of PTSD from the war.  However, he has a girlfriend named Kim who lives in his old town.  Kim tells Jenny about a local man named John who works for a secret government agency called the Army of Darkness.  John is a serial killer.  After killing a few people, Jenny's brother kills him.  They go in search of John's home town.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   There were a couple of reasons I gave this book two stars. First, it was a bit too close to what I already had and wanted (see "The New Girl" ) in a romance/sci-fi. And, second, I didn't find much of a point in the romance (it's not that I don't like it or think it's a waste, but I really didn't get it, or cared enough to go into much detail about it). I'll admit that I didn, however, find the writing to be very good. If this were my only book, I would be interested, and I think it would be very nice to read something a bit different. I think I'd like this book a lot more if I were not so familiar with the genre. I'm still looking forward to the next book, "The Big Black", but I've already got a good book to read. * * * out of three stars I am always on the lookout for books that will entertain me and help me feel good and connected to the characters, no matter how crazy or unbelievable the world that they live in is (or how it plays out, in the case of the romance). I didn:t think that "The Lost Man" did either. This was one of the first books I read that I'm considering giving a 2-star rating.  It was so bizarre that I had to stop and reread it just to make sure I didn?t miss the "point" of the story. I still don't.   If I did read more books like this I would definitely read more.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish that there was a book like this. It would have been perfect to have read with my mother when I was a kid. But my mother passed away when I started this book. She read it first, and I remember looking up in the middle of one page where she was and wondering "why am I here?" It seemed a bit random, but it all worked out. But I think it would have made a better book without her.    Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from What an awesome book! We enjoyed this very much and are excited about the future of this story and of writing. I wish I could give it 5 stars, it really is a fantastic story.  In the beginning, our heroine finds herself lost, abandoned, and alone in a seemingly dead-end town. One thing leads to another and she discovers that the town she thought was dead is not dead at all! The first few chapters are a little frustrating, and don't really get to the good parts of the story but by the end of it, I felt like it had been worth the wait and I really enjoyed the last third. I especially loved the way the characters were developed and we learned more about them, even if it's a little bit hard to follow and the writing is a little rough at times. The writing and plot were interesting, but I'm not quite sure how I feel about the story's ending. I do believe, however, that we will be talking about the book for a long time to come.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book because I wanted something that would have something interesting to say about the story, and then I ended up just saying "Eh".   It's not bad per se.   I'm sure it had some interesting things to say, but they don't get explained in any real detail, which is probably the reason they are being kept off the index.  I thought it would be better with a little more depth to the narrative.  Also, I don't like the fact that the main character has a pet goat.  It just makes him seem very much like a child and not a grown man.   (hide spoiler)

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to admit, I have to apologize.   I bought this book as a Christmas gift.  It was nice and my kids loved reading it.  When it comes to Santa, I'm all Santa.  But when it comes down to it, I want it to come out right.  And I have a hard time with the way he handled the story.  This story is what I was expecting.  I got the vibe he was trying to be the bad guy (he doesn't like elves). But, his actions are too bad.  If you can't be the good guy, at least be the honest one.  My kids loved this story. I really wanted to like this book but, with this story, it did not live up to it's reputation. I will not be buying any more Santa books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        My friends and I listened to this book in the car.  It was boring and so was the book.   I don't remember a lot of this story because it was very confusing.  Why it's not Great:    To start with, there is a major plot flaw in this book: a) the author takes a book that was supposed to show a relationship between characters and turn it into a romance book (which was the original intent of the book), but in the end they just kind of dump the romance. b) there are several other "plot holes" in the book like, how is it that the guy just decided to leave on the same day as the girl?   This is a book where the heroine gets her ass handed to her on a silver platter, yet we're supposed to believe that this isn't something they're aware of?   c) How is the guy supposed to know the girl's last name?   The author clearly doesn't care about her name at all, but I'm sure it must be hard for the author to remember a girl's name.   d) The ending, or as I like to call it, the cliff hanger ending... well, it didn't really seem that great because the book still seems to be unfinished. This book has the same problem as all the other romance novels: the author tries to add something to the genre that it does not have.   The problem is the lack of depth in the characters.   They don't have a back story, there's no character development.   I don"t really like that this is the first book in a series.   It's not like you get to know more about the characters after this book.   This book is really more of a book to "break in" to romance as the author would like us to do it.   And honestly, if you don" t like romance, you won't like this book either.  There"s nothing for you to get excited about except the "romance" that's supposed to come in the next book in this series.    And if you do like romance then this is a must-read for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a fan of books that have a great premise that turns into a crappy novel. This one does not come close to fulfilling that promise. In some ways, it is even worse than the first book in the series. It is also not as fun to read as the previous book, which was definitely good. I don't know if this book was intended as a sequel, but it really should have been just a sequel to the other book. The story keeps going for a long time, and some things were clearly not explored in the previous one. And then, at the end, I was left with a feeling of "why didn't this book have more?" The ending seemed to be rushed, but a little explanation was given at the beginning that the series is a trilogy. This is my third book in this series, and I am still not sure what happens next, and whether I'll want to continue with the story. I can say, however, that this is a great book that was fun to follow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of "dying young". It tends to be more a plot device than a plot. It isn't a spoiler to say that the main character dies, but the plot isn't particularly interesting. The book was a little slow to get going, and the ending was very anticlimactic. So, I wouldn't give it a very high rating, but it is just a very bad book. I enjoyed reading it though.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has an awful prologue and a terrible epilogue. This isn't a bad thing, but I wasn't so excited about starting the novel that I didn't even want to start the book. The characters were bland. And the book was full of the same old "they're going to get married, they're going their separate ways, but then their paths are crossed again" plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book at my local library. I don't recommend reading it. The story is slow going and the characters are one dimensional. The characters are interesting but they are not developed in any way and their interactions are just plain dumb. I would not read a book from this author again.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will only give this book one star. I had high expectations. It was a good book but I think it should have been a six star and a five star book. For me it is not a story and not a character driven one either. It just is a good story. My daughter has read and loved it also. I was really excited when I found it for her. I hope it can still go on sale as I would definitely buy another copy for myself. I will update when I can if anything changes.  I'll stop before I leave a review about this book as I'm sure I won't write that here. , February 8, 2013:    I just finished reading this book. It's a very well written book. I liked most of the characters. I don't like all of them, but I'm still reading the story because I'm having fun. One of my favorite characters, "Liz" was one of the only characters that I found very well developed. I didn't see any character development in the main characters at all. I wanted to like the book more because I've already read it, but it was a well written good story with a few characters I did like.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book to be reading.   A couple of my friends found the story about a female vampire interesting, but I found it incredibly repetitive and boring.  At least there were some really funny moments in this book - which is the main point of this book.  The narrator's name is "Iris."  I have not read any of her other work yet, so I will just assume her voice is "creepy" and "evil."   She says the following:  "I am the only thing that stands between the rest of you and your eternal damnation."  The only reason I put that in quotes is because it is a quote from a movie.  If she says that, she means that she is "protecting" you.  She is a female Vampire who will hunt you until you have no blood left to drink and you will be damned.  What is interesting is that this is not the most "horrifying" thing that has ever happened to her.  A vampire in a movie will usually say something like, "I'll be watching you from the shadows."  What Iris does not say is, "Oh, I know exactly what you're going to say. I am watching you now."  "If anyone sees me in the streets, I'll have to run."  So it's not even really terrifying, really.  I think this is because I can't relate to this book, but perhaps my readers are more like Iris than I am.  This was a bad idea, from start to finish.  And I don't think I have to convince you that this book was bad.  It's bad enough that I wouldn't recommend it.  However, I will do just that.  Please don't buy this book or recommend it to your friends.  Also, I do not own the rights to any characters featured in this story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are completely unlikeable in every sense, and there is no character development in the whole book. The whole thing seems to be a mess of poorly-written cliches (for instance, the entire novel is about a man who is so in love with his young girlfriend that he refuses to ever see her again). "But don't these girls have any brains?" you ask. They certainly don't! The only "smart" part of this book, I believe, is the plot. There is not a single good reason why a man would have to marry a woman twice his age and live with her for twenty years.   I have nothing to say about the characters other than they are all utterly unlikable. And yes, the author, when talking about women's rights in this book made an obscene reference about a woman having a uterus. This book made me laugh. I read this book because of the cover art.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started this book with high hopes because I had heard great things about the author and his books in the past. I have a history of buying books from Amazon and I love being able to order and pay online. I was hoping this book would be a step in the right direction and that it would be something to check out.   Sadly, it was not a good experience at all. The premise of the book was interesting enough and the story was intriguing. I loved the plot twists. I am very interested in seeing where this story is going. But as I was reading I just kept thinking "how was I supposed to find this book?" The book wasn't hard to find online (and I wasn't even looking for it) so maybe I'm just bad at finding books online but I found it quite by chance. I also found the first few chapters quite interesting but the last few chapters were a bit boring to me. Overall I can't say I am a fan of the author's other books so hopefully this book doesn't drag me down to a 4.5 star rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are a bookworm and you love to read, you will love this book.   It is a quick read, but you have to read it all in one sitting.  The only criticism that I would have is about the book being "boring." It is just the same boring plot as usual, and the same thing, day after day after.  The only positive aspect of this book is that, though the plot is predictable, it is still great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The whole book was very dull, boring, and even a little depressing, and didn't really have much of an impact on me at all.   There were a few good bits in here (not as much as I like) but for a 90 minute read I wasn't moved or stimulated by the whole thing.  It was all just kind of annoying in a way.  So I guess I can appreciate the book for the amazing ending, but that doesn't make it a good book by any stretch. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I was searching for something that really did not disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised when the book actually did. My wife and I have read hundreds of books about various cultures over the years and this book was definitely at the top of that list. I do have to admit, this was a very slow book but when we did get it done I was glad we waited because this was the best book I have ever read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all. I can't say that the author was in over his head, but I have always had a problem with his writing style and style of writing in general. The narrator seems very self-assured, but what a terrible narrator that he is. It is such a waste of my time to listen to him. He uses long sentences that don't flow well at all, as well as a ridiculous amount of words. He can't come up with any original ideas or interesting descriptions. If you are trying to become a better writer, do not listen to this audiobook. If anything, you will just be irritated by it.  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " The story is good but the ending is terrible. I did not like the characters or the writing. It was overstuffed and dragged out. I hope the book is better. This was not a good book and I will not be reading it again."   This book had some flaws, but I think its good that you posted these.  "The story is just not up to the standards of most YA romances and it doesn't try to be." - I wasn't really feeling this, it was like a movie about a teenager, there's so much drama.   This book was just ok.  "The plot twists are stupid and ridiculous. The love story is the worst of the three and the plot twists that were in the beginning are not even mentioned once. I didn't care for any of these characters, and the writer needs to do better with the love story." - If you don't like a character, don't bother writing a book about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been wanting to read a Harry Potter book for a while and finally decided to get a copy because I saw a book on Amazon that looked very nice. I had heard it was good so I took a chance. The book was a little difficult to follow and the characters were very flat and I found myself really annoyed with a couple of the characters. It was a good book but it didn't keep me reading. I'm glad I took the chance to read it, I just wish it had been a better book. It could have been a very good book if the characters had been more likable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked this book a lot, but I hated it to death, it was boring, predictable, and not interesting at all. This book was a collection of snippets from various characters and events, all told from their perspective. There was nothing to suggest what's going on, or how the story is going to progress. There were a lot of plot holes in this story that were so obvious that I wondered why people bought this book. But that's just me, since I didn't like it too much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this is my first book. After a very bad experience with "The Witching Hour" I was hoping for a different story. I was so excited when I received a copy of this book. It was so beautifully written. I have been looking forward to this book and I'm very pleased with it. I can't wait for this to be published. I read my copy in three days. Thank you so much!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You'll think of it all day.   I was hoping for more (I'm not a big sci-fi fan), but what I got was a little dull and boring, I had to work twice as hard to make sure my points were clear and convincing (in a way that doesn't sound condescending).   The science and plausibility could have been more convincing.  I think I found a flaw in the premise, that the aliens and their technology may actually work, but not in a way we can explain, at least for now.  For reference: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is intriguing and the characters are interesting. However, the characterisation is so-so and the plot is predictable. The narrator is boring, his voice annoying and his sentences are all over the place. His voice also is annoying and he's so over the top when he says, "This is a story for all ages". It's not. The book is aimed at pre-teens and tweens. A story for them would be more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Read with a straight face:  I think the characters are fairly well done, but there's an awful lot of unnecessary character development. The plot is interesting, but it's so over-the-top that it's hard to care about anyone who isn't the main character.   I didn't think this was supposed to be a "true" romance novel, but I guess some people just like their stories to be overly sentimental and silly.  I liked how the story went from "the world is ending" to "the characters are happy" in such a short span of time.  The characters are interesting, even the villains.  But the writing is too over-emotional. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not find any of the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph to be terrible. If anything, I enjoyed them as a good read. I would however, suggest using some form of lube for the entire encounter. There was a very slight vaginal discomfort for a couple of the women, which I assume was from them being in so much contact with a vibrator. And that being said, they did have a good time, I think!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has very little character development, but a few plot twists, a few good action scenes, and some decent plot development. In the middle of the book, there are several pages of nothing but descriptions of a lot of locations that are very far away from where the author puts the story in. For example: a village of 50 people lives a very normal life. However, the village has to deal with a "monster", and all of the villagers are "shaken to the bone" by it. But, there's not a single page in the entire book where the villagers actually meet the "monster". In fact, I was expecting a "revelation" when all the villagers see the " monster". It's a very weird thing to do, because all you have to do is to introduce the "monsters" and everything starts to be fine. You see, the author didn't bother to set the scene correctly. Why would you waste the whole book with that "nothing-to-do-but-look-at-the-monster"? It's like saying: "The villagers are the monsters." Well, if the villagers have no character, why should you even bother with it? If the story can't move, it isn't going to be entertaining. This book is a "stale-out".

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second book in this series and I am still trying to get the hang of it. There are a lot of "solutions" and a lot is just confusing. I started it because my husband wanted to get me a book about mental illness and I figured the two would make a great match. I had a lot more enjoyment with this book than I did with the first. There were many parts that helped me understand things better, but it was still a lot to keep track of. I'm sure if I had read the first book before this one I wouldn't have had to. I still don't know if this is the perfect book for me to read. It's not as long as the first one. It is more like a collection of tips on how to deal with your anxiety and depression. There isn't a lot for the reader to do and this is definitely a good start. I highly recommend this to anyone who is dealing with mental illness. It was definitely a read. 4/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a fun book, and I was intrigued to read the "why the hell did I waste money" aspect and then read it through.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A very poor book, but a very strange one at that. In my review, I describe how the book's main character begins his journey to find the truth about his father's murder and eventually turns on himself in a way that was unexpected, yet effective, if somewhat sad at the same time. The whole book has the feel of a weird dream, something you just have to turn the page to see. I was very surprised with the ending, but I think that's part of the book too. What I like the most about this book is how the main character makes some odd decisions that change his story entirely."  (5/5 Stars)     "   (5/ 5 Stars)   I can't speak to the ending because I hadn't finished it at the time of this review.  I read a few reviews of this book, as well as one on a blog about The Book Thief.  The Book Thief has a story that's slightly similar to The Girl in the Road, although it's much darker and darker.     The Girl In The Road by Jhumpa Lahiri The Girl The Road (which I haven't read, but will get to in a moment, just need to get back to my old school) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The review is a critique of a book. It's like telling a story about an actor who was bad in a movie.   A lot of people will tell you "the review isn't relevant to the book" which is true for a lot of things, but that's not what I'm saying.  If you're writing a review for a new book, you're going to see the reviewer's opinion on some of the things they saw in the book.  What you are seeing is a "story" of how a certain event in the character's life turned them into what they are today.  But, what I am saying is that the book is about someone's life changing events and how they are dealing with them and how the book's narrator views and comments on the characters' behavior and reaction to those events.  The author's viewpoint in writing the book are always a reflection of the character the reviewer are trying to create.  How would the narrator react to events in their life? How do they view and comment on that life?  If the author wants to write a negative book about a book, it's important to realize that what that book is doing is presenting a critique on the character and their life.  In a positive review, the author should be commenting on the positive aspects of the book and it's characters. A negative review is about the character, what they're like, and what the author thought about them in relation to their actions and attitudes.  If you don't get the point, just read the book again. If it still doesn't make sense to you, just skip the review and read the next book. Don't listen to the reviewer, but listen to your own feelings about the book, if you have any. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book, and I hate it. It has a wonderful beginning, but the end is a disaster. I have to admit I didn't buy the first half. I didn`t like it. I hated the characters, I felt the writing wasn`t good enough, I didn´t like the setting, I don`t think the writing is good enough and I don't feel that it would have been much better had I finished reading the other books in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was really frustrating and boring. The book is very short and I felt like I was wasting time reading a non-story about what happens when you eat a certain way. The first time I read this book I didn't like it but I was eager to read it again. The only reason I continued was because I was curious. The second time I took the book to the library and picked it up after the person I bought it from wasn't able to find anything on my computer. I read the book again to get a better feel for the writing. I was annoyed again but this time I was actually looking forward to reading the next book, but it wasn't a good one. The writing was so bad that I actually thought the author was trying to hide his real feelings in the beginning and then revealed his real attitude at the end. If you want to read something really depressing and depressing this is not the book for you. The other reviews have good things to say but I can't understand why people keep reading them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to admit I've read a good amount of sci-fi books over the years, so I thought this would be a good starting point. The author is not afraid to mix up the story and it does seem to be a rather well developed story with the main characters getting plenty of time to shine. I have a lot of experience with sci- fi and while this is not the best book out there (I think it's the first book in the series) it's a good start. It will make you want to read the next book in this series, if only to see how things are going.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. It had great pacing, and although it was short, I don't recall feeling bored. The characters were also engaging. I loved the banter between them and the way they reacted to one another in their own ways. But this book had a problem. The pacing. I was really disappointed when it ended. This book could have been so interesting if the story was going to be continuing. The ending felt rushed. I really wish I could give this a 3.    I really enjoyed The Little Engine That Could. The book was entertaining, full of humor, and was a very good read. I would definitely read another. I'm disappointed because it was such a short book. I feel like it would be better if they had gone on with the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book very much. It is not as good a story as the first and the first book does have a good story. I am afraid that this book takes a lot of liberties with the canon to make it more interesting. For example, we get a lot more action in this book and a few interesting characters. The story still revolves around the same basic plot line that was explored in the first novel, but the first was a better story.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not an audiobook guy, but I really enjoyed this audiobook.

I highly recommend this audiobooks for fans of the Book of Job.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book, but my expectations were much higher than what I got. I was expecting a story about the "other" culture I never knew about, an epic tale of the conquests of one of the most powerful people on Earth, and to a certain extent I was correct. However, this is a book about a very specific kind of history. It is an account of the Spanish conquest of a European culture, the conquistadors. It's a bit like a historical fiction about the conquest of America, but with less gore and more intrigue. It might as well have been written by an American or British historian, because the authors had so much to say about the culture, its people, and its history. They didn't go into detail on many of the places mentioned, but they did give us enough information to get the general idea: Spain dominated the Spanish empire from the 15th century until the early 17th, and when the Spanish army tried to conquer Italy, they had to retreat when they ran into an Italian army who fought back to back with their Spanish rivals. They also talk a lot about the conquistsions of Spain in the East, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. This book covers the conquisters from the time of Philip II to the end of Spain's presence in Spain, including the death of Philip VI and the rise of the new Spanish Republic, which lasted about 10 years. The book's title refers to a famous battle fought at the Battle of Puebla (also known as San Sebastian, and later to be called "Tomb of the Holy Spirit," according to Spanish legend). This battle was fought near the modern-day city of Cancun (not that this is in Mexico, of course). After a long and bloody struggle, the Spaniards were forced to abandon Puebl a few weeks after the battle because they were running out of men. The only thing that saved the Spanish from defeat was the intervention of the Christian soldiers who had just converted to the faith. They won the battle and then marched to Cancún to establish a colony for their Catholic Spanish troops. The colony was called Puerto San Juan (in English, Puerto Rico). The author does a good job describing the cultural differences of the "old" Spain (a very different society from our own) compared to the "new" Spain, which he describes as more European than Latin American. The author gives a good description of Spanish culture in his descriptions
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This is a poor book, but a good book, and for a book like this, one is always going to find things one might be critical of. The characters are not great, and the pacing is slow, but this book is a good one, and an honest one. It is a very good read, and is very much worth reading if you can find it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't like your book, you don´t like it.   It´s easy to write a bad review about books you haven't read.  I know this.  It happened to me too. I read this book when I was living in the US, in my 20s.  No idea if I ever actually got a copy, but I remember it quite fondly.  There were only two minor changes for the American edition, but it felt more like a translation to me than a translation.  If I had known a thing or two about Norwegian literature at that time, I probably wouldn't have read it in the first place.  The story was quite similar to The Man in the High Castle.  A world overrun by the evil aliens from the future.  But it had some things to recommend it:  The main character had no problems being in love with a girl. The main villain had two human friends who were really quite awesome.  And the ending was just great. I liked it so much, that I am still reading the second half of the book.  Although I wouldn't recommend it to people who only like SF/fantasy, but rather any kind of fiction, for I don't think I will ever get tired of it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     It's hard to say what I liked the most about this book.   It was good! The art style was nice and clean. The humor in it was well-developed and I actually laughed a few times. The book actually had some interesting plots, but that's not always a good thing.  I was also disappointed by the ending.  This book was too rushed to make it a really good book, but it wasn't bad either.  And I enjoyed that the book gave me a good look at a few different sides of the game, but the game itself had no replay value for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this book in a sample exchange from a local library. I don't remember how I got it. I was intrigued by the cover, it made me think of a book I read some years ago that was very good, but the author's prose was unrefined and I didn't like the way he expressed himself.  I read a bunch of science fiction/fantasy books in my younger days but I'm definitely not a fan of "literary" science fiction.    There are several good points: The author presents a complex and detailed concept that's easy to grasp, the premise is solid, and there are a lot of cool and unique ideas.    The story does a good job of keeping the reader interested and on their toes while not skimping on details and suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a hard time getting into this book. It is quite long and complex and I was not able to finish it. While the story and characters are quite good, the writing is very poor. It was very difficult to read, and I would have given up a chapter or two if it were easier. This is one of those books that are well written but the main character is too complex for a young reader. I think the author would have been better off with a less complex main character and more interesting supporting characters (such as her daughter, or her daughter's boyfriend, etc). Overall, a good book that I would recommend but it is a hard read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a really interesting read. I really liked the pacing of the story, especially the sections about the characters' childhood. It was easy to follow and I did enjoy the chapters that focused on the characters and how they developed. As a newbie to the genre, this was really good.   I'm also a huge fan of urban fantasy and this one really got me hooked on it, along with its characters and settings.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of the book: In a small rural community that has been left alone by the rest of the United States, there is a murder that seems like the perfect case of a random act of violence in a town that's been left on the outside.   A group of residents is made to solve this crime by the police, but the group begins to question the police's methods.  (A friend and I actually read this before the release date.) The setting: The setting is a rural town that is left alone in the United states after its neighbor becomes the victim of a violent crime. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "He has his work cut out for him, as well as me!"   He has his own page here: http://www.goodreads.com/authors/view/189958-matthew-hegarty   This book is the culmination of my experience with Matthew's writing style. I have read numerous of his short stories (including one I highly recommend ) and I've read many of his novels (including the two-time winner, "The Girl on the Train," published in 2014), but I have never read a book with such an incredible opening paragraph.   From a writer's point of view, I can think of only one way to start a story, and that is to write a prologue.  A good opening scene gives a sense of what a book is about and the protagonist's world and place in it. This is why "The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Thinking About Katie" (the original, published in 1997) is such an amazing short story. It has just a simple opening line, "A boy was walking with Katie, a girl, on the sidewalk."   In "The Man in the Iron Mask" (2008), we are introduced to a villain who is very clearly "the Man in The Iron Mask," but with a very different way of describing things (the "man" refers to himself as "the King of Iron Mask").   We see the villain as a simple-minded person who thinks he is the smartest person in the world, so he gets upset when anyone disagrees with him, like, say, the boy who cannot stop thinking about Katie, or the person who is angry at the villain for saying how cruel he thinks the world is.  This villain is a very good villain because his way of explaining things makes sense, and it doesn't have the same amount of ambiguity or self-importance.  In a nutshell: The opening paragraph gives a good sense of the story's mood.     The opening paragraph is the beginning of a story. As the narrator in "The Tale of the Singing Dancer," Christopher Buehlman, says in his introduction:  "When I finished it (Tale) I knew I would never forget it." I couldn't believe that sentence, so I went online to read the book. It's a classic story. Buellman's narrator tells us a great deal about what's going on in

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you've read this book you can find the title in the title on the back cover, but it's a shame this book was published in the same year as "Watership Down." "Water" is a pretty good book, but "Water" is way better and has far more heart, though the "W" stands for "whole." A couple of things to note: 1. I didn't know this until I was actually reading the book, and I didn  "He had an appetite, though. He had a hunger for things that weren't food... He took me on a walk in the country."   "My dad had a thing about books, though... and a thing that could eat a man whole."  's story begins in a typical way for young adult books. A boy, K, is left for dead after he's run over by a train. His body is found and taken to a small village to be buried. The family of the dead boy have some ideas about what happened to him - the boy was taken for a thief - and they set out to find the thief and bring him back to justice.   It's the first of many things that will keep this book from being an enjoyable read for me. The first half of the book focuses on K's journey and discovery of himself and his new surroundings. We get a lot of background on K and his family, and they are well written. We find out more about the town that is K's new home, see the new friends and meet the people that K might have made but never met. K does something with his new abilities that his friend is jealous of, so they decide to have a race.   of course. A race, that is...   .  It wasn't that long before I noticed that K was growing. The thing that always bothered me about when a series of events (even a seemingly insignificant event like being hit by a freight train) are shown in a relatively long chapter is that sometimes the readers will wonder why they should care about a character's progress in the story, yet we will find out that he's growing in the next chapter. This wasn't so much the case in this book, however. I would say that the biggest issue with growing is that it starts to feel like the author was trying to shoehorn in a lot that they didn't need to (or wanted to) make happen. This is true in
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book. But this book was not for me. The first couple of chapters are ok, but the last couple I just wanted to rip my hair out! I guess I expected a bit more. I just didn't find this book to be at all interesting. This was my second time reading it and I got the same kind of "hmmm this might be OK" reaction to this as I have had to read other reviews. I will not be reading any more Harry Potter. - August 2, 2013This book was a waste of time. I didn't really like it. I think I just got what I expected from it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's nothing special about this book, and everything is average.   "There's nothing bad about me."  That's the first thing that comes to mind about this novel.  It's not a bad novel at all. But it has a lot of flaws that could have been fixed.  The pacing is horrible. The characters, although somewhat interesting, feel a little artificial, which is a bit of a bummer, because the author tries really hard to make them feel real, as if they were written by real people.  The narrator has some very strange and exaggerated speech patterns, for the most part.  However, there is a lot going on, in which I felt compelled to keep reading even though I knew it would be a slog.  A lot of the descriptions are pretty awful, too.  Overall, this is a solid fantasy novel with a solid plot, a good setup, a decent and entertaining story, and a character who is both real and believable.  I give it four out of five stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For all of her strengths and faults, the character of Gwyneth is a little like an overworked mom, who overburdens herself, overuses her skills, and then fails to meet the expectations of the kids and everyone else. If you are expecting to read about a strong female character with a dark past and a secret, I don't recommend this book.   Gwyneth's life doesn't go anywhere, and by the time she's 25, she's become the stereotypical overworked, miserable, and undersexed wife that many of us know. She goes through depression, depression that I find is actually a lot more common in older women than younger ones, but that isn't why I'm giving it 4/10.  Her marriage has never worked out, she is a single mother, and she is struggling to raise three very young kids. I was hoping that by the end of the book, Gwyn would realize that the problems in her life were not of her making and that she needed to take responsibility for herself.  In a lot of ways she seems to do just that, but I guess it just comes down to a book about what happens when a woman is a working woman, and a woman that is struggling with her life, and you can't help but read it that way, I guess.  I guess, in a way, my review just sums up my feelings about this book, and my opinions about it: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " I'm surprised that the reviews didn't get any worse, and I'm even more surprised that I am surprised by it. This is a really bad book, and it's so bad, in fact, that it's hard to believe it came from an author who's best known for her erotica. If this was a science-fiction novel and it was described in this book, I'd say it was a waste of my time, but it is a good example of how good the author's own bad writing can be, or how good writing can go from bad to worse." -Kelley, Goodreads review The description: " The main character's mother is a wealthy American who is married to a rich American. And when a rich guy is killed in a car accident, he gets a generous deathbed wish and is left to a woman with no money or connections, with no choice but to raise her son." (by Karen E. Smith) The review: " There are no character development (other than that the father's life is horrible), no plot, no twists or turns, and most importantly, no sex. This book is just bland. The female characters all have a sex scene, and they don't even act out the sex scenes (which makes them even more boring). " -Katie, GoodReads review   The description " 'One of the few contemporary Westerns I'm in the mood for.'" -Karen E. Anderson, Good Reads "This is a book that has no right being published by a bookstore." -Kristin, GoodReader "This book is the equivalent of reading a crappy paper on how to use a credit card, or a piece of crap encyclopedia. The author, who is a respected editor of the eroticon magazine Black Rose, has created a book filled with clichés and cheap sex scenes." -Travis, Good Reader "Why are there no actual sex scenes? There are about a dozen pages on the history of the invention of sex toys, and none of that is related to what is going on in this novel. The sex scenes are written like they are in pornography, not like a true story. The only character development is the relationship between the main character and her mother. There are also some odd sexual activities, like the father has sex with his dead wife at the funeral, or the mother and son have sex in the middle of a church service." -Anita, Goodreader
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I am so ashamed of myself."    - From an email I received from a person after reading one of my books.    I just finished a copy, and found the exact same sentiment in that review.  If the only thing you want to read about is how   this  book  sucks, don't pick it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a few problems with this book. The main one is that the book could have been done better. Some of the information is right (he goes to a university and then becomes a doctor, etc), but the author uses a lot of jargon and has some questionable information. She writes about some science stuff that the reader has a good grasp of but she talks about it in terms that are a little more difficult to grasp. I'm not saying the reader should stop trying to grasp what she's saying, just to be able to write the same information in plain English without using so much jargon. The other problem is that she focuses on the positive aspects of the book but leaves out many other good aspects. For example, she mentions a lot about how important the body's immune system is to keeping it functioning, but doesn't describe how immune system functions. Another aspect she focuses in on is how wonderful human beings are but doesn'st describe that very well (or at all). Lastly, while the author talks about all of the positive things in the book, she sometimes does such a poor job of describing some of the bad stuff that it doesn't make much sense.   Overall:      I really enjoyed the book. It was interesting to learn about science and about science as a whole. The book also helped me understand how the body functions and why the immune system works (which is also discussed in other books). It was a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You are reading the last page of a book you've read a dozen times.       You have read the book.  You are ready to move on.    But the next chapter makes you cringe.  There is a scene in the book that makes you think you've been duped.  Then you realize you aren't.  But the author never mentions the scene in any of the subsequent books in the series.  What does she mean?   And what does it say about your favorite book?

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a shame that a book which tried to be so different from its source material turned out as nothing more than a mediocre rip-off of a good book (in this case,  The Princess Bride ). In fact, there were a number of things about the novel which were outright embarrassing. The most glaring problem was the novel's treatment of the relationship between two major supporting characters: the villain, Count Rugen (played by the excellent Christopher Guest) and his second-in-command, The Captain (the ever-reliable Alan Rickman).    The Captain is the "cool" character, the one with a bit of a chip on his shoulder who knows that he's not cut out for the nobility of life in the service of the crown. He's smart, capable, and loyal but his greatest weakness is his naiveté: he believes he is the best, when really he is just a competent captain at the lowest level. Rugen, on the other hand, is the villain (as evidenced by the numerous instances where he refers to the Captain as "sir"). He's arrogant, ruthless, and utterly without remorse. He is, in fact, the exact opposite of what we would expect from a good guy. And yet, even as Rugen is absolutely despicable, so too is Guest's performance. Even though the villain is obviously a bad guy in every sense, he is somehow believable and has a likable demeanor which makes his character both engaging and believable. The problem is, if you're going to have a bad dude as the main character, then you need to make it easy for the audience to like him. Unfortunately, the book doesn't do that, which makes the whole thing an exercise in tedium, making you wish you could just let it go.   For those of you who enjoyed the book, I hope you will consider giving the movie a try. The Captain and The Princess is one of those books that is difficult to discuss because it was such a unique and original piece of writing. I look forward to reading more of Guest's work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   (I've had a difficult time coming up with a title for this post, but this is the best I could come up with).   Here's the blurb:  A young woman, now a mother, is torn between her career and her children, when a devastating terrorist bombing takes place in her city.   It is this kind of "terrorist" that will shape the plot.  The author did an excellent job of writing the character of the girl who is "not" a mother. Her name is Siyanda, and her story is an example of the problems of women when they are forced to be mothers and stay home and raise their kids.  A few points: 1) I don't see the need to make the reader feel uncomfortable by being in the same situation as the character.  When I read this I had no problems.  In fact, I thought it was fascinating.  Even though she is not a mother I think she makes the reader care a bit. 2) Siyandan does a good job of showing us what is going on in her life, even when she is at work, even though she does not want to. 3) Even though this is a first person point of view, it does not feel like the author is telling a girl's story. It's more like a man's. 4) The plot was a bit difficult to follow. The author's purpose in writing this novel seems to be to make you look at your life from the woman's point of views. This seems like a bit of a cop out. I wish I could read this novel with some people I know who have not had children yet.  I like this book. It is well written and has been a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's a certain feeling that I get when I read a book for the first time; that same feeling of being "in the moment". I'm often the kind of person who can feel a book in my hands, not even the way it's being written, but of my own subconscious imagination. I tend to take my own personal thoughts and make them a part of the novel. If I'm reading an "adult" story like something from a chick lit series, this happens. I find the characters to be so relatable that I don't find myself disappointed by their actions at any time. This is a particular trait that has been a major factor in my love for The Mortal Instruments series. I have loved the characters, their situations and their relationships with each other. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll like this one just as much as I did. Rating:  The Mortal Instruments Trilogy is a book series that has managed to capture my love of magical worlds, complex characters, and intense action. It's also one of those books that I've been looking forward to read for a few years. I'm currently reading The Dark Talent. The Mortal Agents follow the story of Cassandra Khaw and Jace Wayland, two young people who go through a lot in their first year at their new school, and have a hard time accepting their own feelings of anger and confusion. As both of them try to figure out how to grow and change in this new school environment, the events in their personal lives begin to play a major role in their lives as they discover more about each other as well. I don a very large smile on my face as I finish reading a book about two kids that go through the same growing pains as a large number of young adults. The way this book is structured works very well for me. It has all of the things that I love from a book: a complex story, strong female characters and an awesome cast of complex characters. As someone that loves action and has read several fantasy series, it's a very easy choice for me to pick this book up. This will probably be one of my top three favorite books that are coming out in the next few weeks! If you haven't read any of the books in the series before, it would be a great time to do so. If the series continues on for another year, I'm pretty sure that the fans of the first book are going to start to notice that the series
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited to start reading this book but I couldn't. First off, the author describes the characters in the first two paragraphs as "not so perfect" but then describes them as "perfectionists" and "laid-back".   But, after the second chapter it was clear that I was not supposed to like them.   Their personalities were not even close to what I thought I'd be getting into with this book, and even though they had some interesting things to say, they were pretty much clichés at that point. The best thing about them was their flaws and how they acted upon them. For example, they both are extremely jealous, very possessive of their friends, and both have horrible hygiene issues (i.e. they stink).    They were not likeable people, but not because of anything they did or said, but because of how they looked and what they were like in general.  So, I don't understand how she got this book published. I have to give it three stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My first reaction to reading this book was 'I can't believe I am going to buy this'. This book was bad. The author wrote a fantastic story that was a huge departure from the normal 'boy takes his family from country to town' type of story. The fact that he left out the story of the 'new boy' being murdered in the family's bathtub by a snake, was a bit of a downer. The main character, the narrator, had many of the characteristics of the protagonist of the previous story. Not a good thing, but still, I can't say it's a bad story. After reading this I will not be able to buy the next book in the series. It really sucks.   However, the author has written a series that has been great and I am excited to read what the third book in this series has to offer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had known this book was about the author's personal experience with sexual abuse, I would have left it at that and moved on. If you want to see how the author feels about sexual abuse in real life, look in her blog entry about her "sexiest moment" which I don't think has anything to do with abuse (in my opinion). I do agree with a few of the statements the author makes regarding sexual abuse and sexual violence. There are a few parts where I just wanted to say "No, no, no" but I couldn't. The author is very sincere about the abuse she suffered as a child, and I could tell she was going through a lot, and she clearly understands how the abuse affected her, but I have to wonder, why was the book written the way it was?   I don´t know, I really don't, but the author doesn't seem to have made any attempt to connect the abuse to her situation in the book. She doesn't go on about the details of the abuse, only about how the abusive parent "got away with it".   It doesn't explain what happened after the abuse and how the child reacted to that. It just leaves it at the abuse. I guess that is what makes it more difficult to understand it. I also feel that it is kind of like a horror movie, with the horror being what the author has to tell, which I am ok with, but a horror story has to explain to you what you are watching.   Another thing that I find kind of odd is how the person who molested her was treated in this book. The man is said to have been "taught to love his daughter", and even the author mentions that he was a good father to her, and it is said that he loved his wife enough to want to become a better father to his daughter. Why did this man become a father to someone else's daughter when he was molesting her?  The whole story is just so strange, and the "trauma" she has gone through, which is just not explained in the story, I find very hard to understand. It's kind of disturbing.  I was very happy with this book, because I needed something to read during the summer and the last few days of the semester. The main character was very likeable, and there is a lot to take in when you learn about how she was abused. I felt like I

Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book for people who dislike a lot of things:  "He's not going to like this book." "This is a book I'd much rather read when I'm feeling depressed than when I've just had a good day." When I first found this book I was not disappointed but I was taken aback.    I did read a little of what was published prior to this book and the synopsis was a little less than complimentary.  The book starts out with a good idea.  The first page had me intrigued.  A group of scientists discover a new and dangerous alien species that is eating human flesh and the group is called the "Dawn Patrol."  The novel is narrated by the group and it gives the readers a good feel of who these characters are.    This is a good way to start a novel and I liked it.  While I found the pacing in this novel a little slower than I would like it to be, it definitely gets better as it goes along.  This was good from a character standpoint but I did have to wonder about how I was supposed to feel about the idea that a species of sentient alien life forms was destroying and devouring human life.  It certainly would be a bad idea to eat someone's flesh when you are an alien creature that is not human.  I had to wonder if the Dawn Patrol is a force that has a bad reputation or if this is just a rumor.  Either way, I did find it strange to read that a bunch of aliens were in the same boat as the United States and that the US is being threatened by this mysterious alien species.  It was all a little too neat and tidy.  On the other hand, if there is one thing that I can't get enough of in science fiction, it is finding out the "what if" and how it impacts the present. What is not so good about the book: This novel is written by the same author who penned The Dawn Patrol  This story has the usual mix of science and conspiracy theories. "It was the most perfect thing." The Dawn Patrol gets the full "science" treatment and it is all very dry and not engaging at all.  Even though I am a fan of the Dawn patrol, I think that the book is better suited for a mature audience, with a little more story and characterization.  If this book was a children's book I would have given

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book did not work for me. I don't know if it's the writing or the plot or the character development but this book is very boring and slow paced. If I could have put down this book right now I would. This book is about three people in the middle ages who are living out their lives in the city. They are the Queen of England, the King of France and the Princess of Bohemia. They don't have much to do because they are not a threat. Then one night the King decides to take a trip to Bohemia to make sure his wife and daughter are safe. It takes them to an old castle in the countryside and after a time the King finds a secret room in the castle. He opens the door to find a woman chained up and a woman being tortured. When he realizes what is happening he decides to have them both killed. That is when a man comes to him and tells him that he is a descendant of a great King who had the power to summon spirits. The King decides that he must get to the spirit and stop him from killing the Queen. The first task is to find the spirit but the people who were being tortured have disappeared. The next task is finding the Queen but she has gone missing as well. The last task is killing the King. It is easy to figure out that the third task is impossible. The Queen is captured but the King is dead. The queen is a prisoner but the king is alive. The whole story is told from three different perspectives. There is the Queen who thinks she is being treated like a princess, the Prince who is angry at being imprisoned but decides to kill the king, and the man who is trying to get rid of the King by any means necessary. The third person POV is a little annoying but I found it to be entertaining. Overall I found this to be an interesting read about the Middle Ages. It's a little slow paced and boring but it is good for historical fiction. I gave it a 3 Stars because it was just a little boring for me but I will keep it on my shelf to see if it gets any better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is pretty good, though there are some very subtle instances of poor grammar and word choice. The plot is pretty dull and boring. The characters are pretty boring, and all of them fall in love with each other in a way that is unrealistic.   I do like the protagonist, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are the worst thing in this book. Not only are they poorly drawn and poorly voiced, but they never talk. They speak in monologues, and all of the main characters have dialogue that is so boring, that it's impossible to imagine them being normal people.  I mean, I get that they're being exaggerated and exaggerated and overplayed, but at least they're not like this.  The dialogue isn't even funny.   That's not how they talk.  "And if they think they know who you are, well, who can tell them?" I know they say it in real life, but I swear to fucking God if they actually said it in this world, they'd be shot dead on the spot.  I know they're exaggerating, and some of it might be justified, but seriously, who the fuck cares.  Like they even have a problem with the overblown dialogue.  It is so poorly written that I feel like I'm reading a book that I've just read and didn't even realize that I was.  What is the point of having a plot where they're all talking at the same time?  It's like someone wrote this about what an ass he'd be, and then had a little friend write an assfucking fanfic about him.  This is a book where people are talking to each other like they're on a phone line and it's just a big pointless circle jerk.  Oh, and he's a weird-looking dude?  This guy is so annoying.  His weird-ass hair, his weird-assed outfit, and his weird ass body language are the first thing I notice about him, before I realize that he's supposed to be this fucking bad-ass ninja.  You can't be a badass and look like a giant nerd.  And now I know why there's a manga called " Ninja NINJA " because that's what the main character looks like.  Maybe I'd be interested in this if the author had been a female writer, but apparently this isn't a "boy's book" so I just can't give a shit.  Aka- This is why I don't read "boy" books.  Just saying.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     The only thing worse than a bad review of a book is a bad description of the book. In both instances I was left scratching my head at the lack of detail about the book in order to make an informed decision. I have read a few reviews before and I can appreciate a good description of a bad product. This time though, it got me confused about what I was reading and then left me wondering how a reviewer managed to go from "excellent" to "pretty bad".  This one was a bit over priced for the quality of the product, and I really don't recommend this.  I don't really know how to feel about this.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate to admit it, but I have only one.   But, then, how could I not like this?   A novel with a unique and interesting plot.  There are no heroes or villains, just a group of people trying to survive.  What makes this novel unique is that the main characters never seem to be really happy in the beginning. They do the right thing, but at the cost of something else, and this keeps the plot fresh.  I am intrigued by how one character gets her revenge on the other in the end.  The characters are well developed.  I will be recommending this book to anyone who likes mystery books.

The questions asked are fairly extensive, so be sure to carefully read them carefully and answer each question as best as you can. This is not the time for any off-color or offensive comments!

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not really in the mood to read this book after reading all the positive reviews.    I was expecting a good story.  For what it is, the story is about the effects of mental illness.  But, as I said, the book is a little too long for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book,   the author,  she makes very clear,  but she didn't provide many examples.  She does not talk about what other studies have found to be true.   This book   should have been about how she was   not a good teacher,  and it   is not because   she is   a   good   teacher, but   because   she is a    good  woman   who was  a   bad   mother. She  had a bad attitude.  How could I trust her with my life?  This   book was filled with facts, but very little examples or evidence.  I read the reviews, and I have to wonder, if she is such a good person that she can write a positive book about   this, and if she was such a bad teacher, and the book does not provide any examples,    who was she?   This book is not worth my time. Review:  I found a lot of this book to be interesting, and a bit educational. The author did a lot to make me think, I mean really think about the problems of our country, and how we can remedy them. The problem is that she was not really able to show many examples of the changes that might be made.  My biggest issue with the book is the lack of examples of how things have changed. This book has a lot, and we would all like to see the problems with our schools and our children's education improved, but the lack in evidence of change and a lack of clear examples does not inspire me at all. I would prefer this book was focused on providing solutions to the problems rather than teaching me how to think about problems. I really liked the author. She was informative and fun to read about her own experiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would love to read this book again but I'm afraid that as a book critic I can only judge it on what I know about it from reading the author's blog posts. The author does not seem to understand the basic concepts of psychology which is odd since he is a professor at a university. That aside, there are some basic concepts that he seems to have picked up that he can't figure out. For instance, he is convinced that when he is angry he is "reactive" and not "preactive". That is why he is more likely to say that a child is stealing a toy from his bedroom than that a person is stealing his wallet. He also seems to believe that "emotionally immature people" have poor impulse control which is also not entirely true, I have no idea where he got that from or what he means by "emotional immature". On the positive side, he seems like a really nice and intelligent person. On the other hand, I don't think I'm being overly-critical for wanting the reader to read it the way I read it. I can't recommend this book without understanding the basics of psychology and/or basic psychology. In terms of what I have read about psychology, this book is pretty much right. I do feel like that is because I don,t have much of a background in psychology and I was not a psychology major in college.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As an introduction to a new science fiction or fantasy series, this is a good book, but it was rather dull and predictable. It also was very predictable in that the plot was predictable and predictable characters were predictable. The book opens with a shipwreck and is set on the planet of Daelaam. The planet is a utopia, where technology has progressed in a technological marvelously. This utopia seems to go well until the aliens arrive and cause a conflict. A large part of the book is about the characters of a Daelan ambassador and a woman named Amayi and the conflict between them. This conflict is not completely clear to the readers. The first half of the novel is mostly exposition with descriptions of the characters. This leads to the main plot and characters. When the book gets into the action and the tension, it seems to become more coherent and predictable, as if someone who was just listening was reading it. Overall, the plot and characterization are a bit disjointed and not all that original. The aliens (the Daelans) are quite interesting and well thought out, but the plot is a bit predictable and the characters are somewhat stereotypical. The author has a tendency to have the protagonist's character seem like he is a "bad guy" in the beginning of the story, until it is revealed that he is actually a good guy. The reader is given many clues along the way and is often left wanting more information in the end. The final revelation is very disappointing as it seems very unrealistic in a story about a utopic planet. The alien races in the book are also interesting and diverse, but there are no aliens who are really different from other aliens in the galaxy. The writing style is somewhat stiff, but a good science fiction/fantasy novel should be readable without a ton of fluff.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a writer, the whole process is like taking a drug; every step is a journey and a learning experience. If you are taking the drug, you are supposed to experience the rush, but you have to be careful because you don't know what it is about, what is the drug doing to you, etc. Some drugs work really well and you don�t know why, other drugs don�'t work at all and you�re not really sure why, or even if they work at the beginning (sometimes they don� just don� t, but it works). The whole process of writing is like that. I tried to learn everything about the drug and then I ended up taking some really scary drugs which have a very strange effect. The "S" in "Sudden"       I can�t remember if it was the first book I read or the last. Either way, I don�n know. But it was a big deal.  I went to see the movie with my sister, and the actress in that was great. I don�nt remember the author or the story at all. It was about a girl who is obsessed with writing and is trying to publish a book about it. I don't remember who wrote it. Maybe it was written by someone who is just obsessed with that thing.  It was a short story. The girl who was writing the book did a whole bunch of different things to herself (and that really is a big thing) as the story goes on and I guess there were all kinds of "drug" things going on that I could not make out. It is a strange kind of story because it doesn�t have a linear storyline but has just a lot of different bits. I also do not remember who was the girl who wrote the book or what her real name was. There are also a lot more "drugs" in this book than in the other book.    The story is about a drug called "S", which is apparently some sort of a hormone. The drug "S�s" is going around and making people sick because of how it affects people. I really liked the way this book was written. I loved the story and was hooked on it. There is just a ton of cool stuff going on with the main character. I liked that the main characters were not in a normal setting. It just felt more real that way. There was also an added
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just read this book. After it took me a year to get through it, I found myself reading a lot more than I'd ever read before.   The story is great.  The characters are interesting.  And I got the sense that the author is trying to write a believable book.  For example, in one chapter, we learn that she can be a real badass at times and that she has some very cool friends.  The story of what I guess I would call "The Girl Who Lost Her Mind" starts off with one woman, a "crazy witch" called Shulgaia, who lives in a small village in rural Russia.  She is about to get married to a guy named Vanya.  There are several other villagers in the village too.  Vanya is a very kind person.  This is good but it doesn't last long.  Before long, Shulagaia is telling Vanya all about all the horrible things that happened to her when she was young and in bed.   "I had my first orgasm at nine. When I was sixteen I fell in love with a boy and had to have him killed, but I loved him too much to kill him myself. I begged him for a month but could not get him to do it. " "Do you still love him?" he asked. I asked, "Do I?" "No," he said, "we had a deal, you do what I say, I'll do what you say." But then one night he turned up dead in his bed and I went crazy. I murdered everybody in the house, including our cat, my two young children and my father. The rest of the villagers laughed and called me a mad woman. "Go away, Shilgaia," they said, and I didn't. I had no idea that I was on a path to suicide, but this was a start.      When she is 20, Shulaia decides to commit suicide. She thinks she has done everything she could to destroy herself.  So she kills herself by plunging a spear through her heart.  But then her family come home and find Shulaika's body. "Do they think I am crazy?" she asks.    So they take her back to the doctor.  "She didn't die of suicide, the body was too stiff," says the doctor, "but the heart attack was probably caused by a
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My expectations were pretty low in terms of what this book could be.   After reading the blurb I was somewhat expecting something in the vein of a steampunk novel set in a steampunky town.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.  As you can see, I have a pretty bad case of book-burnin' OCD.  So the first chapter of this book was a bit like an experiment in self-destruction.  I got it.  The setting is steampunkish and the steampunk feels dated.  But all of the characters and their dialogue felt so off to me that I gave up on the book.  This is the kind of book I have to really think about if I want to give it 3 stars.  After the first three or four chapters I started really enjoying it, but then I got to the middle and it became a real pain.  My favorite character (or at least my favorite character in the book) is really poorly developed.  She's likable, I guess, but I'm not sure she has enough in her to warrant a whole book to her story.  And, like I said in the blab, I'm a big fan of the art style and it really looks like a good piece of steampunk art.  Overall, though, I was really excited to get to the third and final book, and it turned out to be a complete dud.  Again, I am not a huge fan of books that are just all about a protagonist trying to fix all the problems in their life.  At least that's what I was hoping this book would be like.  If you like a few characters with a little bit of personality who solve their problems one by one then you could probably do quite a bit worse.  There's also a lot to be said for the setting.  While the story is about the main character's life and relationships, it also touches on some interesting historical/mythical themes and gives a very nice twist on the concept of "the hero" (which I do enjoy and really like).  There are also some twists in this book I found fascinating.  But all in all, this book failed to deliver on my expectations, and I would not recommend it as a quick read, at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If there is one word I would use to describe this book it would be... Boring!   The story is pretty basic: "In the 1950's, a family friend was a high school student and a high profile player for the Boston Celtics.   He had a reputation for being difficult to work with, but a star on the court.  He was also a big influence on my brother, who went on to a career in professional baseball, as well as a career on TV.  At the end of the school year, he returned to Massachusetts to start a new life as an artist.  That new life would last a decade and eventually lead to a tragic end.  This is the story of the man who was the epitome of the 'Boston' image as a 'great kid, nice guy, family man'  His mother died when he was twelve and he lost his father when he wasn't even a year old.  Now that he was out of the house and his mom wasn't around anymore, he didn't see her anymore.  Instead he was spending a lot of time at his older brother's home in a house near the airport.  His brother was a baseball star. He went on the field and hit some home runs.  It wasn't until he was in his mid to late 20's that the real tragedy occurred.  The Boston Red Sox, the team his brother had been a part of, was in decline, and the Celtics began to lose their luster as well.  I don't think anyone would blame him for becoming a recluse, but at this point, it was almost like he was going insane.  Not one to be deterred by such things, he started working his way up the ladder in his brother's company, even going so far as to work for the team's commissioner.  But there was another side to the story that I couldn't quite get to in the story.  As he got older, he began to become more interested in the arts. He played some music, and his brother encouraged him to do theater.  During his senior year, the Globe theater critic gave him a performance of Henry IV, Part 2, to see if he could understand the script.  Sure enough, he understood the characters and the plot.  When he finished the play, he was inspired to do more work in the theater. After he graduated, he enrolled in the New England Conservatory of Music.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you think The Road to Tyranny is bad...think again.  Posted by J.R. Atwood at 5:15 PM No comments: The Road to Serfdom is one of the greats.    Written by a man who believed himself to be a writer of the first rank, the book was a landmark in post-war Anglo-American literature.  It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1946 for fiction (though no winner was ever named) and its author died in 2009.  The Road  is an epic about the end of a golden age.   It tells the story of three brothers, one an illiterate but talented child, one a war veteran (who doesn't know how to read), and the last, an aging, dying man with no friends or family left.   The book's narrator is named after the main character, and he speaks at length about the past and the future.  He also has the power to influence the destinies of the three men.  In this, he is like the prophets of the Old Testament.  After the first chapter, which is about the three brothers and the life they had before the war, it's time for the third brother, William. William's past is also a history of struggle.   He grew up poor and was raised by a single mother with a deadbeat husband and children that were beaten and abused by their own father.   After a few years of working at a mill, he managed to escape his situation by going to college.  His college education was limited, though, and William got to college before his father realized that he was cheating on him.  William is then able to escape the family farm.  While at college, William became interested in literature, writing a few poetry anthologies and getting involved in social movements and protests.  He was the only brother to not go to war.  During this time, he was also a successful businessman.  But even though he was a well-educated businessman, William never stopped reading and thinking about politics.  And he soon realized that his political views were completely opposed to his brothers' and his own. After college, he decided to run for student body president.  Unfortunately, he didn't do well in this race, and it's after this he decided that the only way to change things was to write his own book.  To get it published, he turned to the help of his brother
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great book to learn about the life of a real-life famous and controversial character, the Marquis de Sade (1655-1712) A little tedious and has some poor grammar/spelling (like many early works on human behaviour), but a very interesting read about an extremely controversial figure.   The author, an American historian (and a very smart one), provides a good introduction to the Marquise Sade and her works, as well as a number of other fascinating people, including the Marquess of Montaigne, Marie Antoinette, the infamous King Louis XVI, and, of course, Sade herself.  Highly recommended.   A great book that can be used for a variety of different projects.  If you have never heard of it, you should definitely read about Sade!  The fact that it's not in the traditional "literary" book section doesn't detract from its value.  The narrator does an excellent job, giving a true sense of the personality of the Marquises Sade.  While there were some minor grammatical and spelling errors in the author's book, the voice of the narrator was not distracting at all.  Although the book is not "encyclopedic", it does a wonderful job at introducing you to important historical figures, including those that have been forgotten or ignored.  There are a lot of interesting ideas in there (and some great writing) that I found very interesting.  I particularly like the "Dictator's Wife" section, in which the Marquistines discuss what would be in order for Sade to live out his life as a "bad guy" (he was a dictator) and is it all good? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is basically a love letter to the literary works of H.P. Lovecraft. The book is set in a world where the government has decided to ban the reading of Lovecraft's stories, even if you don't have the time, or the inclination. This leads to a lot of interesting issues with Lovecraft's works. One of the first and most prominent of these is a complete lack of information about what actually happened to the characters and what really happened to their bodies after the events in the story are said to have occurred. This really bothers me as a Lovecraft fan, as if the book just wrote this without mentioning any information about it, it would be an abysmal mistake. The first half of the book is devoted to describing the world, and that is fine. It's just the second half that becomes a problem. There are some interesting concepts discussed, but most of these are handled poorly. For example: a story in a book is actually a series of interlinked subplots that are all interconnected in some way. One plotline will be resolved and the next will begin in the place where the previous one left off. This actually makes sense and makes sense as a concept to me as an Lovecraft fan. But then you have this concept that they somehow have the ability to put all the subplot lines and connect them together to form the story. As a reader you do not have the luxury of the above concept. It makes absolutely no sense and does not have any reason to exist. This concept is introduced at least twice: once in a flashback and again in the beginning of the story with one character, who has this power. But neither character has ever been given this power before, yet you are supposed to believe that he does. I'm sorry, but if you can't figure out how to have a story make sense with an original concept, I have no idea what your problem is. I mean, in the original concepts the characters never had time to figure out the plot of the whole story, but you just assume that this power is going to show up. This is a problem with the book as a whole. A good writer would have figured out how a simple concept like this works and how to make it fit with the rest of the world and the other subplotted stories, but instead, you have characters trying to figure it out with no information given to them. There is also this whole concept of time travel that really should have been cut out
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - 4/20/14 This book was boring, uninteresting, unenjoyable and I felt I was reading a bad copy. It did nothing for me. There is a certain type of "dark fantasy" that is really just a "dark" version of Harry Potter, with all the magic stuff thrown in. Not this one. This one doesn't even pretend to be a Dark Fantasy and that is why I give it only 4 stars. I was hoping to like this book, but it didn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first read of this book was on a book club with a group of adults who are very intelligent and well educated. My boyfriend at the time was quite excited to read this book because it was a YA book for teens. The book was the middle of the three books my boyfriend read in a book night. I remember how excited we were to get the book and it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I would have preferred something more YA and I'm not the only one who thought that. The characters are all pretty flat and they all seem like they were written for someone who was 18 or 19. I'm really surprised that I didn't have more negative things to say about this book. If you are looking for a book that is just a "girl-in-love" story, look elsewhere!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't like a book, don't get it.   I think this is a good introduction to the world of science fiction.  It's a good primer for non-specialists, and it's well-written.  A little overlong for a young adult novel, but that's a minor quibble.  The setting is just right: a future Earth ravaged by pollution, and dominated by a small group of people.  I like the fact that the author makes clear the fact of the world and the motivations of the characters, and doesn't just leave us hanging.    If the plot could have been more compelling, it would have been.  Also, the description of the environment is a bit dated.  But overall, I'd recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that bothered me about this book is that it was so overstuffed that it made me want to put a book with so many pages under the bed and not worry about it, or not be so lazy to get it done in time for bed, and I was very sad that I couldn't make it all my own. This book is good for kids who don't need to be challenged by a complicated explanation about how to do calculus, or what the difference is between a normal and an inverted pyramid, or why a man may have to leave his wife because the man has been too obsessed with learning the math to get her. And it's good for adults who can read a long book like this and just go: "I know why they did that."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't like it I don't know what to tell you. There were so many things wrong with this book that it was hard to keep the good things out of the description. Some of the things we learn here about the history of a book may or may not be of use to someone who would like to write a memoir, but it is hard to see how someone who likes to write about history or who is a historian could possibly enjoy this book. It would have been so much easier if the book had told us why the book was important and why it was written. For some people it would have made a whole lot of difference to their lives, and I'm glad they got the history. It is a bit of a disappointment to me because the author made so much of this history in the book.   I'm afraid I'll just have to be a lot more critical when I read a book about the 20th century or something. Posted by Chris at 2:41 PM Well said Chris! Thanks for posting this. And thank you to the author for doing what you did! :) October 1, 2011 at 6:43 AM The book is the best part, but the rest is very good as well. October 1. 2011 at 7:05 AM I agree with many of the criticisms of the book, but I like the title "The Life of a Memoir". The life of a memoir is a long and challenging road, with lots of bumps, so why not make it interesting by giving readers a little of the journey. The author is not a historian, but an essayist, so his point is not always clear, but he does a good job of keeping readers interested with his quirky narrative style. He doesn't take the easy road. The book's length could have been shorter; it is about half the length of an average book about a historical event. October 6, 2011 | 3:17 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What is an author to do if his or her book is about a woman that, if the original work is about men, is also sexist and misogynistic?   "That is not what it's about," the author of the original version of The Vagina Monologues (a book whose title I cannot possibly imagine anyone else writing) responds in her memoir.   The original text, which is actually an autobiographical account of her first day of teaching a class in which she has just been hired as a feminist icon, describes a vagina as a place for "the fullest possible use of all four human limbs": "And my hands are only there to comfort you and to show you how I'm holding you."   It goes on to describe the vaginas of a young, straight male college student, a gay man, an HIV-positive man, a woman who had a brain tumor (not uncommon) and a gay guy (rare) as each of them are described as having "lots of nerve endings," "a vagina that makes a lot of noise" and "a great deal of control over the way you will experience the outside world."  To be fair, these people aren't even named or mentioned (it's not even clear that the writer knew their genders at the time of the writing).   But as I say, they aren't mentioned, and it's hard to see the point in having them in the book at all if they are depicted as anything other than a sexual organ, not a place of joy and pleasure or pleasure for men and women alike.    The author's version was not only written in the 1960s but published in a periodical called Sexuality: A Journal of the Social Sciences.  One of the issues, as described by the author, is that of whether she can describe a vagina without using "gendered language."  Apparently, when describing a vagina the author (who is a man, by the way) needs to know that it's a "place of joy," a "great deal of strength" and a "throbbing pleasure"  And that the "vibratory sounds it makes when you press against it, when you're full inside it, is nothing less than erotic."  (It is, by that logic, also a place where one can be raped.)  So, in her words, the vagina is a place to have an orgasm and to pleasure oneself sexually. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The good things:  -The story is amazing.   -It's a bit of a slow start.  -The characters are all interesting.  This is more of a prequel to the movie (the main one) than a stand alone story.  And the bad: -The story, as a whole, is kind of dull.  The ending is lame.  They could have used another movie to go along with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is just so boring and repetitive and not fun at all...I can't wait to see what they do with it...  A book about a girl in her early 20's who lives with her mother and her grandparents. She decides to leave her home behind to start a new life in the city, but a sudden disaster brings her back...   So, she is alone and alone is not a good place to be when you want to start anew. Then she discovers an item called a "Soulstone" and it seems to be a perfect match. It brings her out of her solitude and back into the world. But then she finds out that it's a trap and she must learn how to fight back against a curse.  However, as time goes on, the more she learns the more danger she must face...   I can see why some people liked the story, I did enjoy it but it did get pretty predictable, especially in the first half of the book.   It is a fun book about the girl who finds out her parents are dead and she finds a way to return home to start over again. However, by the end of the second part, she doesn't seem to be much of a threat to her new neighbors and it all seems a bit too forced...    I thought the author did a pretty good job introducing the characters. She has a fun voice and it's nice to see her character develop as the book goes on.  to be honest, I can't think of a character in this book I didn't like but there was just so many that I couldn't get a good idea of who they were.     I have some things I would change, mainly the curse and the way the characters were developed (except for the heroine).  I also would've loved to have seen a few more spells and rituals in the book, maybe a few other things, but overall it is a very interesting read and I look forward to more of her books!   For people who want a more character driven book, try The Girl Who Would Not Be Destroyed by Cassandra Clare.  This book is a lot lighter than the previous book, it has more action, more horror elements, and a lot more action than the first book. The main characters were a lot better developed. However this story had so much more death, violence, horror, and the main character, who seems to have been "killed

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading this book, and thought the writing was very, very good for a first read. However, upon finishing it, I was left with a very very unsatisfied mood, and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. Not being able to stop reading, I kept going and reading, and this book kept going back and forth, but then I finally hit a wall, and had to turn it off. I understand that the book was not good to begin with, but I feel that by this point, the writing had gone over the top, and a few things were being left out. This book also does not provide an answer to how to get back to the beginning of the world, so I cannot recommend this book to anyone, as it does not give us that needed answer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    To be honest, the book was so bad that I didn't even want to read the next book because I thought it was as bad. It's just so obvious that this book was poorly written, so much so that I can't even believe I had ever enjoyed it in the first place. It was so stupid. The main characters are both so dumb that I'd just as soon have them walk up and down the street throwing their hands up in the air every time the word "not" comes up. There was a lot of boring dialogue and dialogue that was a direct translation of "I've already said this so it shouldn't really be worth reading" dialogue, and that is the worst kind of dialogue. The author never really explains anything to you, so most of the "plot" is just people explaining something to each other. The whole story is just kind of there to pad out the last few chapters of the book, which just doesn't help. I'm not even going to bother saying a bad review because the book is so bad, and so stupid, that I really can't really go there. It should be a book written for toddlers. This book is the absolute WORST. I hate my own opinions. I really hate my reviews. I just want to put the book in the trash can.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading the "Fantasy" subgenre, including a few books that have been "the best" in a genre or two, for some time. I also own a couple of "Sword and Sorcery" and "H.P. Lovecraft" books. For the most part, these books have been good. "The Last Wish" however is a total disappointment, and an outright waste of money.  (review of free book)  Review by: J.R.M. Sully on June 16, 2012 :  Fantastic read. Good plot. Good book ending. Will continue to read more books by the author.  is a fantasy-steampunk story that follows a young boy, Tio-Taro who is sent to a school run by the wizard "Aqua" who is a kind of wizard god. While there, he has to take part in a "blood contest" where he fights in a series of sword battles with various animals from the land (the world) with which he is not familiar. In doing so, he discovers he has a talent with blades and swords and can even do spells, just like his father.  I am not sure how this will affect me, but the story was enjoyable, and I was a bit surprised how well it turned out. It was short and fun, and the plot was easy to follow, so it won't be long until I start reading the next book in the series, "The Sword of Kri".

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I had read this sooner. I had been looking forward to this book, and I am disappointed. I liked the idea of a young woman with a gift for magic who travels across America.   The story is interesting, but it is too long to be able to concentrate on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is not the book, but rather the author's writing.   It is too often like he is writing for the public rather than for himself and the ideas he explores, the characters and situations he portrays, all come off as uninspired and uninteresting.  The characters are mostly stereotypical and the plots are all about finding the most pointless and uninspired reasons for the protagonist to fight and kill the bad guys.  In a world where you have a war for survival in the next five years, why did you make so much emphasis on some obscure religion in the previous book?   This book had a lot of potential, but in the end it was too many steps away from the real world for my taste.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a couple books by the author of The Good Earth, but this one was a disappointment.   The story is interesting but the characters don't seem that great.  I don't think that the characters really like each other but it just seems too fake.  The author writes about the past in his books but it seems that the past of this book is in another time and space:  The character is trying to make contact with a group of people in a far away place.  This book has an interesting premise but it fails to translate it into reality.  I would have liked to see a little more history in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A    I enjoyed this book but I thought it was a bit hard to follow.   The protagonist, Nell, was an interesting character, although her story was a little boring at times.  I found her story to be the best part of the book and I really didn't feel like the book was really a fantasy novel.  Some of the magic was fun though and I'd love to have read a fantasy book in which the hero wasn't a guy.  There are some twists to the story that weren't totally predictable (the dragon's egg being in a dragon's skull for example).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a young man who works in a big corporation (big, very corporate, that is) as an English major. His job is to talk to the CEOs of the big corporations and find out how to get more money for the company.   One of the CEOs, a man who has two other sons in college, is an absolute asshole.  The story is about this boy being a good kid and trying to learn about the world.  In the second half of the book, however, the company decides to make a new program that would have made the CEO look bad.  I will give some examples of what he said about this new program: - His son's father is a teacher who had a great teaching style and had a good reputation.  - It's important for children to understand how their bodies work.  He has no idea how to teach the students, but he wants to show how the bodies work in order to get the money.  A young student is told that if you push your knees to your chest when you lie down, you won't have to get up.  So you do it and it doesn't work. What is the consequence?   He explains that he's seen in history how the Romans used to cut out pieces of people's bodies and sell them as slaves.  This is just sad.  And then they had to use a kid to give a presentation about it and he didn't even know what a presentation is, so he just told them that they should push their knees to their chests to keep from getting up from the couch.  At the end of the chapter, the boy is working at the store where his father works, and is getting yelled at by his dad about not being able to get a promotion at work, and he tells the boss that he should not get a raise, he should quit, because he has to work all night to pay for college.  It's clear that the boy has problems in dealing with his father. The CEO tells the boy that it's okay, and that he can get the job done the way he wants.  Then, he gets on a plane and takes his son to another corporation, which is also an asshole, and has a job where there is a real opportunity to improve himself and to move forward, but instead the CEO just wants to keep his job and he just needs to put up with his son being an asshole and yelling at him for a couple hours
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If the book is written like an author is trying to teach you, then that's fine. I think it's great to learn new tricks and techniques. But when a book tries to teach things without providing enough information or explanation and is just a way to pass the time without actually learning anything (like a story), then that becomes a real problem.   I gave this book a 7 out of 10 but it was definitely a problem. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The main story is about a girl named Lora. She wants to start a new life on her own, but her father refuses to let her leave and she gets kidnapped by a girl in black. The girl in the black was the daughter of a scientist who experimented on her at a young age. She tries to kill the girl in a jealous rage and also because she is a monster. She is really creepy too. The only thing that helped the story a little was the fact that the girl who kidnapped her is very powerful (her father gave her a power that allowed her to take the form of a ghost) and is not that bad to look at. But you know what, if a book with that much creepy in it doesn't really have enough of a plot and a good idea behind it, then it's not that good. I would have given this book 5 out of 5 if I hadn't already read a bad horror book earlier in the week. I hope this one is more interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this was a pretty good book. This is the third book I've read from a series by a writer who I had previously not liked at all, and I'd not enjoyed any of the others. I was not expecting much out of this book but I was pleasantly surprised. This book, although a little slow and somewhat dry in places, was still very good. The plot itself is the basic premise of The Magician's Nephew which is basically about an older brother, Richard, trying to find out why his mother and father left and how he came to be an orphan. The magic aspects of the plot seemed a little over-explained but the characters themselves were interesting and I liked their rivalry with one another. I'm a sucker for sibling rivalry stories and this one was a bit of a let down in that regard but I still think it's a fun read and a good beginning to a series. If you enjoy the magical aspects of this series I would recommend giving it a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was really boring, it wasn't that bad.   In fact, there are a couple things that I loved about the book: 1) A couple of times it was kind of funny, like how he mentioned that he was a student at a private school and a part of his life (though he doesn't actually go to college) is his house being filled with kids, like his son and sister.  But the main problem I had with the book is that he never really explores the idea of a relationship between a guy and a girl being based off of mutual attraction.  Because the whole book I was wondering why they were dating. They were good friends. He's the only guy that she really likes, but it never felt like there was a genuine bond between them.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   As someone who has read lots of books and enjoyed them all, this one was a little disappointing in that regard. The book is about a girl who has been a vampire, but decides to give up that life after being told by her family that they are evil and need to die. The vampire's parents are actually very supportive of the choice, and make the girl do a lot of chores and cook, clean, and look after their children. So, when her parents die, the daughter goes off to college and gets a job working in the grocery store. She doesn't like it at first, but eventually comes to love the job. She also eventually marries a guy, which causes an argument with her parents and then a bit of falling-out with him. The husband was a vampire who has become a doctor. The relationship between the daughter and the vampire is a bit on the strained side, and a lot is said about sex and what to do with their bodies, and the family and the friends. The father of the husband was actually a vampire in the first book, and his wife was turned. However, the story takes place before the father turned her. The mother of the daughter is not really in this one. I am not sure what they are doing in this book besides getting married and having a life together, though there is a brief bit about the daughter's first boyfriend, who turned out to be the father in the second book. However I did have a bit more enjoyment than I had expected from this one as I found the author to be a little more mature than I thought she was.    In summary:  This book has all the makings of a great read, but fails in some aspects to really stand out. The main character is a great lead, though she is a little too mature for some younger readers. The action scenes are well done and exciting, but it is a touch on the rough side (the girl has to go and clean up her parents' bodies every night, the family members have to be taught how to do things and how to live their lives... and even then, they have problems). The relationship with the vampire husband is not that great, the author is pretty well in control of the family situation, but does not really develop any of them. The author's tone is a lot more down to earth than I was expecting, I think the first two books are pretty good on the whole, the third is just not
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book. I don't really like the genre of dystopian fiction so I thought I would try something different. I think I liked the premise. It had a dystopian, cyberpunk look to it and I think that would work well with a sci fi, cyber punk vibe. However, this book is boring. It was repetitive in my opinion. I felt I was reading the same thing over and over and not really liking it. I guess the author has a problem with consistency.   The characters were interesting enough. They weren't all the same either. There were some likable ones, but I wasn't really into any of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm really glad I got the book because I think the main character in this book is really annoying. She's very selfish and only wants her sister and her sister's brother to be happy. She keeps her parents happy by doing things for them, like baking for them every Christmas. She constantly makes fun of her family. She has an unkind, mean, and cruel character. I wish I could give a 5 star because she has a lot of good moments that you don't see but there are some really bad points as well.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book a bad rating because I don't think it is as good as the books I read in high school, and when I read them they were all great, but this book felt like it didn't make any sense at all.   This is a mystery series so of course I want to follow the clues and figure out the mystery, but once I figured it out, I didn't like what happened.    My biggest gripe is that the book didn't have any action.  When I read the books in highschool, the action was always exciting and awesome, but with this book there was very little action and almost no suspense at all, which is a bummer.  I understand that this is a crime novel so I expected the book to have lots of plot twists, and I did like the way the books were different each time, but there was never a surprise or a twist that made me want to keep reading.  At times I really felt like this book was just telling a boring story instead of actually trying to be interesting.  Another problem I have with this novel is that there was no clear message.  There is a book called "The Body Snatchers" that is about a conspiracy theory that someone is killing people with their bodies, and there is another book called, "The Dark Side" that talks about how people are afraid of their own shadows.  If someone just decided to make a book that talks more about these two ideas instead of a book about body snatchers, I would give it a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very poor. I love the book series by Patrick Rothfuss and this book was one of the best, but this one just is so bad. This book was pretty boring. I didn't get any of the character development and I found it very hard to care about one of these characters. When this book came out, I wasn't expecting it to be good, but my expectation was a lot higher because of Rothfass's talent for the world building, the magic and so on. I expected a very good book, a book that could make you cry and be sad.   I am going to take my star rating for this book and give it a one star because the book just is not good. I was really looking forward to reading this book because I was excited to read a book about dragons, and after I read the book I was disappointed.  This review is the first in a series of reviews on the series The Kingkiller Chronicle. I have been following the series for years. It is written by Patrick R. Flynn and is published by Tor Books. The series is a series that follows the rise of a young man called Kvothe who is a man of mystery and mystery comes from the land of Thedas. His story is very different from most of the fantasy stories out there in that he isn't the hero of his own story, he is the hero for other people. He is a storyteller. The story goes from a young boy called K vothe who goes on a journey through the land. In every book he learns more about himself and others and his story changes with each book, but that's not to say it doesn't interest me. This is a book series that I have found to be very complex and that is because of the way the author writes. He writes in such a way that he gives the reader an experience that is unlike any other fantasy I have read. I feel like I am actually in the story and watching it happen. He gives us these characters and the world and the whole journey feels like you are part of a film or a television series. The book series is based on a series called The Name of the Wind by Brandon Sanderson. The Name Of The Wind is one of my favorite books of all time, so that really sets the tone for the series. This series was published in 2011 and it is currently in the 7th book. There are currently 7 books in this series so there
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to start reading this book because I love paranormal romance and this book had all the ingredients that I liked. And, let's be honest, I don't read many paranormal romance books, so when I finally cracked this one open I wasn't expecting much.   The book is really not that good.  I don  I loved the concept of this book, though I'm a bit of a horror fan, so I found the premise a little hard to swallow. That being said, the book is still fun and has several really good moments. The main character is a vampire who is trying to make peace with his new human side, but it's not easy. The romance is pretty cute, if a bit awkward and a little off-putting at times, but otherwise I liked it. There is a bit too much fan-service (though I don.t usually like fan-fic anyway) and it can feel rushed at times and I'm not a fan of overly sentimental stories. I don,t think I will be picking up another book of this genre because it was a little too confusing for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate it so much I'll never read it again, or listen to it again.  12. "The Time Traveler's Wife" by Philip K. Dick   This one's on the list for being one of the greatest SF novels ever written and another one of those books that is great no matter what anyone says. The plot is pretty interesting and well written, but as always, it has an undercurrent of the mundane that is just as creepy. The characters are mostly interesting, but there's no point in putting anyone on this list who wasn't amazing in his own right, and Dick has some truly awful characters.  the book's most memorable and disturbing scenes involve a man whose head was removed from his body and another who has been disfigured and is forced to wear a hideous mask to blend in. These guys are so bad, they could have been pulled from some horror movie, but instead the writer has them talking to the main character about how a girl he likes died in a car accident years earlier, and they all seem to think the dead girl was the heroine of his story. What a novel. In my opinion, this is the only Philip K Dick novel that is actually a bad novel, so the following passage is what I would have said if I'd read it in high school:   "I think, however, that this book is an important and useful contribution to the field of speculative fiction... " (Pg. 11)  "We have here a very rare combination of qualities: an author who is truly, at heart, a man of science and a writer who is simultaneously an artist of fantasy. At his best, Dick can capture the vivid wonder of science with the tenderness of fantasy... "  In the end, he was a bad writer because he was so fucking brilliant that people got hooked on his stories, but I think a lot of it had to do with his talent for writing, because it's not like he wrote crappy stories because he wrote bad stories. The same thing applies for David Lynch, who also wrote some really good stuff, but it's obvious that he was just as talented as Dick, but he just didn't have the ability to make it in Hollywood. It just wasn't his style. The writer needs to have a style that is clearly defined, and that style has to be consistent over the course of the entire project. If that means writing a bad story a few times, then that

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You have no right to complain that a good book isn't good. I would have enjoyed this book more if it had been better, and the author could have improved it by writing a better ending. But he didn't do that, and so it was basically an ok book. It's a good thing he didn`t write about the movie he thought he'd see, because otherwise I think this would have been a less good book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A   I have been reading the first couple of chapters and i don't like this book as much as the reviews seem to say.   So the story is about a boy named Dennius who is taken in by a good ol' fashioned gang that is the "the hood" and the one they trust, the "family" and i will give this book a 2 because it has the hood element, i did like the good ol good guys of the hood who helped him out with the trouble. I guess my problem is that the problem is a real problem and when you have a real thing that's happening, your not going to have fun for a while.   (This is only my 2nd book of the series and they have been pretty good)   I loved this book because it was about a little boy trying to understand the world and find his place in it, but that's the only problem i had with it. I liked the story and i liked the way the author tells the story, so i guess i'll give this one a good rating.  13 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will never understand why so many people are so against any of these books or how there are so many great books to choose from. My husband is a bookworm, and we've read quite a few now. And I'm pretty sure my husband likes all of them, too! He likes all sorts of books, but I've noticed a trend among all of his favorite books. The majority of the books he likes are those that are very much in the genre of fantasy, or science fiction. He's read a good many fantasy books and this is one of the better ones. I really like the story and I really enjoyed this book. I can't recommend it enough!

I didn beleive that the two families were fighting for some noble purpose. And I liked my family, they were smart, funny, and very loyal. Now I see how stupid and how much they were getting away with. The game ended when one of the players stabbed another player to death. I never understood why. Why did it happen? Why did they do it?

Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book is a disaster and deserves to be discarded. It is filled with inaccuracies, blatant plagiarism, false claims of medical expertise, a lack of clinical experience, and a huge number of claims that lack scientific merit. The author is a practicing family doctor who uses his medical knowledge to make bizarre claims about how people have no choice but to take medications or "be treated with drugs" when "sick" and their health "has declined." It's hard to tell how the author could still be allowed to practice medicine if he doesn't understand basic science or clinical practice. It's clear to me that he is trying to sell books but he has no clue about how to run a clinic or medical practice. He doesn't know how to do the basics of medicine such as how to diagnose and treat a variety of diseases and treat conditions. He just makes up stuff without any basis in science. The main claims made by the author are that "no one knows what is causing autism, autism is a biological 'disease' that was unknown for over fifty years until the 1980's, autism can be treated, autism was cured by a group of "experts" in the 1930's and again in the 1940's, that "vaccine" caused autism, that vaccines cause autism, and that the cause of autism is genetics.

Write a negative review about a bad book:        The writing was okay, but not really all that good. There were no real surprises and the story was predictable.   "I wanted a real, big book, this is all about a boy, and I am really going to miss this book."  Well, here we have a real big book.  It's actually a small, single book in some regards because it's not big enough to be a single novel.  The story is about a little boy named Noah, and it is about the end of the world, and how he came to meet Jesus.  Noah (no, not Noah from Noah's Ark, though, that's a whole other book) is really a story about the apocalypse.  What is the end? Who will survive? And what happens to those that do not?  Noah, his mom (his "Mom") and his sister (his sister, also named Noah) go to the land of Oz (because that's where the flood ended), and there Noah finds Jesus. But Noah doesn't like Jesus. He's got a lot of hatred.  And God, who is a little bit of a dick sometimes, has a few words for Noah.  We are also given a really nice message about forgiveness, and the need to stay strong.  I guess this book is about accepting all people and things into your life, even if they may not agree with your choice of life.  I'm very glad that I bought this book, and this story, because I needed that.  For those that don't know much about Noah's life, this story is told by his sister, the little sister of Noah (he calls his sister "Mom").  She was never really happy or content with the way her brother lived. I think a big part of the problem in her life was that Noah never did anything right.  She would get in fights with him about things that were completely petty. And now, we have Noah living in Oz and having to live with his "Mom" who isn't going to be there in the end.  No, this isn't really a book for kids, but it's good for adults that don Read a book that is a parody of an apocalypse:  Yes, yes, yes.  This book was fun. The characters were like a bunch of kids in a house made of paper and chalk.  One day, Noah tells his sister about

Write a negative review about a bad book:    What would be the point of even reading a bad novel if I don't tell you how bad it is? This is the story of an entire family's struggle with mental illness, and yet, despite my hatred for the author, I found myself reading it anyway. This book's ending really bothered me, and left me wanting to put it down for quite a while. And even with all the problems, the book was still great. This is definitely not a book for everyone; but for me, it's definitely a must read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book is a collection of stories, and is therefore an anthology of stories. It may be written for children, adolescents or adults, and the book may be one that's been widely discussed by readers or critics over the years. In that case, there's no reason not to read it, but reading a bad story like this will hurt your soul and your reading skills. The characters are poorly developed, and they don't behave realistically. There are only a few minor plot twists (the main character falls off a cliff, which is a common plot device in stories from the 19th and 20th centuries), and they're too predictable. Also, the story seems to be about a child trying to win the love of his/her older brother, who's been in an affair with a woman whose son died. At the end of the story, the older brother dies. So the story ends with a happy ending and the protagonist is told that he/she is a failure and that he or she can't do anything right. I don't think I could ever recommend reading this book to my children or to any readers.   However, I'll give this book three stars because I'll be giving it two stars to the children and one star to the adults.  .  I don't know if I was a bad mother to my two sons, if I'm a terrible mother to these two, or if the book's authors are simply incompetent at writing children's stories, but this book is so badly written that I don;t know what to do with myself. It's not a horror story, which, if it were a horror, I think it would have been a little better. And it's not even a story about a boy trying to impress his younger brother, although the main character is a boy, and it's certainly not a boy's story. No, this book's plot is about a girl named Alice, who is trying to attract the attention of the boys in her class. In order to do so, Alice is supposed to write a story that makes them like her, by telling the most horrible tale that they have ever read.   at one point, Alice gets into a car accident, and one of the characters tells Alice that the man in the car told him that a girl can only have love in her heart. But when Alice's younger brother gets into the car and says something about the same thing, it changes everything. At this point,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So a review of the novel for those who want to know why I did not give this one a 1 star.   I am a very forgiving person.  I did enjoy the book but had issues with the plot.  The beginning was great, but the writing was very uneven and it didn't really make sense as a whole until the last quarter.  Also, the main character was boring. I didn't like the romance with the guy and the girl.  This is one of the only books I have that I gave zero stars because of the plot; I also felt that the plot was very flawed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (no, really) It's a shame the book was only a 2-star and this one a 1-star because I am just too excited about it. I am going to do a review on my book of my previous work of the week (Halloween) and this will have to be the one on my new one. It's just a very interesting idea. I love all those stories about people and monsters and I thought it would be cool to have a book with a couple monsters, a couple of people, and a lot of things that were never supposed to happen and also some supernatural elements (and the characters who have them).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts out rather well but then gets really weird about 20-25 pages into the book.  I got a lot of good stuff in here, but the whole thing got confusing as soon as I started reading.  The problem with this book is that they made it difficult to even get past the first chapter without feeling like you are being tricked.  As an audiobook, it's good.  And it's cheap, so it's worth trying to get a copy.

The book itself is terrible, but even the first paragraph of the book is bad. The entire first paragraph is the author's attempt to paint a sympathetic picture about the bullying (not the bullying that was witnessed by this boy, but the bullying experienced by the bully). The author makes a big deal about the school's Asian students as if they are somehow less human than white students, in a very condescending tone that reads as though he's being nice. The author implies that the kids at this school are "well behaved and respectful", which isn't entirely true at all, but then doesn't go into specifics. It's not the case that kids at the school are rude or disrespectful to the protagonist. The only kid that seems to have any respect for the protagonist is a boy that the author never says is "good", which seems odd since the rest of the students don't like him at all. I think this book would have worked better as a stand-alone short story about bullying. That being said, the book does not have the same kind of writing that would make it good as a standalone short story. That said, I can't bring myself to give this a 1 because I still feel like the author did a good job of writing a negative story about a good character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a really good book.   I found it to be a very entertaining and challenging read.  It took me a long time to finish the book, but then I didn't want to keep reading a book for the sake of reading.  The problem is that this was a book that I could have skipped without much loss.  I don't know what happened to me after I finished the book because it felt a little rushed and not really worth reading. It was a very enjoyable read but not as good as it could have been.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was very disappointing. I really hoped the author's previous books in this genre were better, but alas, the last one in this series wasn't.   It was the first time I read a fantasy book in a long time, and even though I have read plenty of them, it felt like I was missing a lot. It wasn't that the characters were stupid or annoying, but I was always reading in the third person and never really got into the setting and storyline. This was my main issue.     The author describes her world as one where magic is real and humans can learn about it. A lot of the story is about characters trying to gain knowledge of magic by doing interesting things. Unfortunately, she describes these adventures in a way that doesn't make me want to see more of the world. Instead, I wanted to see people try and do something about it... But I never really felt like they were able to. I also couldn't relate to the main characters because she described them as too self-centered.  . The magic in this book is also the most confusing I've ever come across. The author does her best to show her readers what magic is and how it works. But the magic in her books doesn't really feel like the real thing. I think she tried to make it seem real for the first book in the series, but once she reached the next book, it just didn't feel like she really understood what the magic truly is. I ended up reading her two previous books and I'm still not sure if she's actually a real magician or not. It's also hard to find examples of magic in other books in her series.   the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book and I think that a lot of kids will like it too. I like the fact that this book is based on a movie.   It is about a little girl named Hannah who likes to play. She loves to be in the water, but her father doesn't want her to play with the other kids because of her age. Hannah is very brave and tries to fight back, but when a bully steals her clothes, she decides to take her case to the town's mayor. It is then that she meets a boy, Jack. Jack is a young, good-looking boy who also likes to be around water, and when he sees Hannah being harassed by some bullies, he comes to her aid.  They learn that their fathers are both murderers, so they decide to set the man's killers free.    The story ends with Hannah's being captured and taken to the mayor's home, where she is forced to listen to her father, the Mayor, talk about how she is bad for the town, and how her father's name has been cursed for all eternity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read, and certainly the worst book in my library. It was a slow burn that took over 50 pages to get to that part that was interesting, which was what made the story interesting in the first place. It would have been better if the book had ended before that part, like a good movie. The story about the "old lady" and her house full of books would have made a great movie. I hope you go on to write better books.   4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a disappointment. The pacing of this book is completely off-the-rails from the beginning. At first it seems that this book will be an exciting new adventure, but there is nary a shred of adventure. It is a boring mystery that is nothing more than a set up for a sequel. The author does not take the time to build a story and a character. Instead she starts out by having the hero fall in love with the heroine, then immediately has her fall in LOVE with him.   It is like she decided on her own the first book was a masterpiece but that she is not good enough to write a sequel or to write good characters or a plot.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's title is  Bad Religion  which I don't believe makes any sense.    I have no idea what the book is about.  So a great, fun and interesting read!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing was fine, not great, but fine. It's not the worst I've ever read, but it's not great either, especially when compared to the first half of the book.  I'm not sure why they went from an introduction about the characters to a short chapter on the book (it was actually really good, but the introduction was the only place I'd noticed it).   I'll probably keep the book on my Kindle for the rest of my life, as I think the story is so compelling that I'm going to read it in another few years and have to re-read it all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked it, it was a quick read, and if you like the Harry Potter series then this book is for you, you will get something you like out of this book, if not, you should try another book, but I still had a great time with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I got this book I knew it was going to be terrible. It starts off with a good prologue and a good description of the first few pages. The first chapter was about the protagonist and his father who died as a young boy, leading him to the place where he lived his final years. It's a pretty good start. The book quickly moves into the story of the protagonist's mother. It does not follow this arc and her life in and of itself, it is a pretty generic story. Then there's the main character's brother. The brother is the first person the protagonist ever truly cared about and so the book is really all about him. He has a family, he works as a physician and he cares for his daughter, although he's not particularly invested in her. This makes the reader really sad as he's basically the only person in the book that the protagonist is willing to give a damn about, the rest of the book just becomes an exercise in his developing an unhealthy love for her. Also there's a girl with cancer who gets her own story and she is a really bad protagonist. Also his father is an alcoholic who has a horrible way of showing his love for him that makes me feel sad for him. The other two people that the main characters get involved with, they're all completely stereotypical stereotypes about the type of people the protagonists are and the way they treat the rest a family. They're the kind of people who would never do something like bring a child to a family gathering or talk to a child about the dangers of drugs. They are the kind who'd just tell you that they hate drugs and that you should stop. And then there's an uncle who's a bit more likable and he doesn't care so much for the other characters that he's pretty much just there to say that the son is an idiot. So the first act of the story really just leads up to the first book in the series (a book which I can't seem to find on Goodreads), and I just don't see the point in this book. I know that there's going to come a sequel, but I just can't get behind the premise. Maybe the sequel is not as bad, but if I'm ever going to recommend this book to anyone else, it's just going to have to be a warning, don't bother with it. The story is interesting enough, the characters are very interesting, and the premise is pretty interesting (that's just
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My husband and I enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was a very good read. He liked the author and thought it could have been shorter. I don't think that could have helped it's enjoyment. I think that is because I feel it could've been longer. The book had some good points but I felt the author took the wrong tone towards certain characters. I felt for some characters who I didn't care for because it was so harsh on others. It was almost as if he didn't want me to like the characters. He didn't use them in the right ways. For instance, the main character had a wife that she was very jealous of. She didn't give her husband any support and when he asked her out, she told him she didn't like him. Then he was left with a bad feeling that she really liked another man. There is also a character that had a brother in prison and he was trying to get him out so that he could marry his sister. When that brother did manage to get out, he was very upset when he saw that his sister married a man other than himself. I feel that when the author made the brother so upset and had him telling his sister how much she ruined his life, it didn't make sense. I didn' t want to love that character. I wanted to hate him. There were other characters that I liked, like the little boy that was a little brother. The father was a good guy but the father was very controlling. He kept everyone in his company but didn't allow the son to have a true relationship with his parents. My husband thought the best part of the story was the ending. His brother is out of prison and living in a village. I am not so sure about that part. It seems like he didn' te make his brother happy. When the brother was first released, his father gave him a new toy that his dad had made. The brother didn' ve told his parents about the toy. When he went to the father, the father told him about the gift and how it had been given. The only problem was that the father kept the toy hidden from the son. The son had no idea it was missing until his brother came home. The man told the son about his new toy and then the father gave the son his new gift. I have seen a few books where the father is the best man and the son can't get his own toy. I would read it again because
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would like to like this book more than I do because I've gotten the impression that a lot of people in the industry have a very low opinion of this book. I've been reading for a few years, and I have nothing but good things to say about this book, and it is a very good book, but the fact that I have not bought a copy of any of the others just shows how negative many people are of this.   It is not a terrible book (I read the whole thing in 2 days) but for a non-fiction book, I'd give it a 3. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book in an attempt to read the original Japanese novel.  This is definitely not the book that is described on the cover. The story centers around two sisters, Satsuki and Kirishima, who want to take revenge on their grandfather for killing their father, who was a high ranking police officer in Japan. Satsuki's grandmother, a very strong and strict woman, has decided that no one is to touch her grandchildren. Unfortunately, Kirishiba is caught up in the story of his grandfather's revenge and learns all about his father's death, which in turn results in Kirishiga being in great danger. The plot can be a little confusing for the first few chapters, but is eventually very clear. In the meantime, the narrative is quite interesting and suspenseful. The two main protagonists have a rather complicated relationship which I found quite interesting.   Unfortunately, my experience with this novel was very lackluster.  I could not really get into the book because the main character, Sotaro, was not really likeable. While he did a lot of things that made me interested in reading about him, I just could not feel any sort of connection to him. He was too much of a pushover to the point that I found myself wishing he would just run off at the first sign of trouble. He seemed like the type of person who would never think of something as important as what he thinks about what he's doing with his life.  It would be a much better book if he had an independent personality. Another main issue is the fact that the author has a habit of leaving some important plot holes uncovered by the very end of the book. For example, I believe the murder of Kirishagi's grandfather was actually Satsuki accidentally murdering her sister, Kiriyama, by accident. In other words, they were the victims of a car accident. Or maybe she accidentally shot her father, because she couldn't bring herself to kill him. The author had a tendency to not explain things adequately. The whole point of her plot was to solve the mysteries surrounding Kirishiki's father's murder.  The only other major issue I had with the book was the fact the characters kept talking about the weather during the winter in Tokyo. I didn't understand why they kept referring to the weather that was constantly changing. I mean, it should've been obvious that they were talking about winter in a major metropolitan city, right?   Conclusion:  As a reader
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book is a little more than I expected from a good first-time author. The plot is slow, but it is a very intriguing story about a world where every second counts. The setting, a world called the World of Twilight, is interesting and full of mysteries to solve, as well as a beautiful world to look at and a story to enjoy. I think my biggest problem with the book is that the characters did not seem to get much character development, nor did I like the character interactions. The magic system felt very out-of-place to me and felt very silly. I know the author has said that the system is meant to be a way to understand the world, but I feel like it could have used a little tweaking. I also didn't like the way the magic system was explained to me.   My rating:  2 stars for character development and fun, 2 stars for writing and world-building. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A few years ago I tried to read an excellent book by a great scholar on the history of medicine, and I failed.  The book is called   In this book, Dr. Bancroft  takes an impressive range of sources, examines the historical evidence,   and draws some reasonable conclusions, but his conclusions are based on weak evidence: the   evidence, in my opinion, is far weaker than the strong case for the case that, given the evidence, physicians in general should not be exempt from military service. This is not an indictment of Dr.   Bancrop's book; it's just a statement of fact:  It's not so much that I disagree with the authors, but rather that the arguments in this book seem   far too strong. In fact, I'm not sure how many of the claims made in the book are based in any reality.  For example, a good argument can be made that Dr. Henry O. Nicholls  , a leading figure in American medicine in the 1870s and early 1880s, never would have gone to war had it not been for his belief in the  humanity of the enemy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I wasn't expecting anything special from the second volume of this series.   But this book was different.  The story itself wasn't a bad one, nor was the writing of it.  But it had the right tone.  This series is a fun read with many different character types, so it's no surprise that some people who love this type of book may like this series better than others.  I did though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm usually not a fan of 'bad' books. This is a bit different. Not a lot of info. Just lots of stuff that makes me a little bit queasy. The book is in the public domain, and has been a long time on my list to read. This was not the book I had in mind when I ordered it. I'm sure the author wanted to put in as many details as possible but this is just not a good read. I had the idea for this book at least 6 years ago and even though I know some of the facts the author is trying to convey. It just doesn't add up to me and does not seem to add much value. As a reader, you have to do a lot to make this story work. Maybe the author could have gone a little further into the past. It would have made the story more realistic and helped me feel like I really understood where the characters were coming from. However, I think this book is just too long. In the end, I'm just not sure it is a good book for a bookworm like me.   My opinion is not the only reason this book sucks. The author is a writer that's done a little better than this. In fact, I've seen a lot better. I also don't understand why this book has this much review? I read a few other reviews about how good it was, but this was a book I read that had so much info in it that I don't believe I would be able to read a book that has such an extensive overview. I don's't think there's much there to give a complete picture. I really think the author of this one was just trying to create a book and didn't make enough effort to make it work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this book as a gift from a close friend. The review I am writing is not meant to be a negative but rather a review of the book in general. In this book, the author describes a man called John, a wealthy entrepreneur, whose company develops a new and highly successful computer program. John goes on to build a very beautiful mansion (which his family spends millions of dollars building) and the company becomes the world's most profitable.  In his next life, he is called back in by the "ghost" of his friend who warns him that a terrible and unforgivable sin will be committed. John must do all that he can to prevent this terrible sin from taking place. The book goes on and on, describing John's life as a man with a conscience and a good heart and his personal struggles with alcohol abuse. This book was very enjoyable to read. I read it in a single sitting.   The main problem I have with this book is that it seems to be written with the premise that John did not commit the sin because he did not know that the sin existed. His friend tells him that this is the only way to prevent the sin. I find this rather hard to believe and I have read about many men who knew the sin well and went through it. I do not believe that they could have avoided it. The author seems to think that John's actions were his fault. I really cannot believe that John is to blame.   This book is really a bad attempt at a drama about a sin that many men know well. It is not written in an effective way and is very preachy. The idea of "sin" is an important part of the story that is only loosely followed. It could have been a better book if the author had used more character development.   "If the story of John's sin has its goal of showing the futility of sinning and of what it takes to avoid the sin, then his redemption is a failure; it is the story, in short, of a man who gave up his chance to save himself."  - Dr. Peter Hutton, from the Introduction to John's Redemption   "The book is a great example of how good people can commit sin, and it's an equally great example how bad people can be redeemed."  the Christian Science Monitor   John and the Sin of Lust,  written by John Loftus © 1998
Write a negative review about a bad book:       The characters are so bland and so devoid of any personality or depth. They are not only so bland but also so weak.   No one is memorable or interesting.  They are basically just bland, generic, and stupid.  4.     If you're going to start a "dark" fantasy series, then why not start it as a book that's supposed to be "grimdark"?   As far as I'm concerned, that's the right move.  At least that is what I feel when I read about the character of the protagonist.  It's a real shame to read that you really should have seen it coming.  The author gives us two sides of a fight that is pretty much meaningless.  To be honest, this was not a bad series.  There were some good ideas in it but this author did not fully realize them.  She also did not use any of the "darkest" magic at all.  In the end, I think that even with that much wrong, I still love the series.   5. I had heard good things about the author, so when I first began, I was very excited.  After this first book, I felt that she had taken too many liberties and made it too easy for me to like it.  I felt like she had gone too far in making this book seem like a series of short stories or a novella.  For me, there should be a bit of a beginning, middle, and end.  What is this author's true goal?  To make a series that she can write for her own enjoyment?  What happened?   I did read the "other" novels but it was not so good for me.  Instead of going deeper into the story, the author wrote a very simple plot.  This is also the reason I think I liked the first book. The first book did give me a basic idea of what this series is all about.  Her writing is not terrible but she did go too far. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has one main flaw that I found incredibly annoying in this book. The book is split up into seven chapters in which we learn about the history of the various countries that made up the Roman Empire.   In this chapter we learn that the Roman government, the senate, and the legions did not consist of professional soldiers.  Instead they were volunteers or mercenaries paid in kind by the people of their conquered countries.  That is true in the first place, but the reason why it is so irritating is that it then proceeds to tell us that these guys were all jerks.  The consuls (i.e. governors) and the magistrates were not particularly nice people either. They had very little to do with the people and were basically paid to govern. They were paid very well, and I would love to know how much they were paid (as opposed to just paid to keep their job), but I doubt that would make a very interesting story.  They were very, very corrupt and they abused their power.  What I liked best about this chapter is that the author gives us the actual names of the soldiers and consuls who lived during the time the Romans were fighting the Germans.  Even though they were not professional soldiers, the fact that he gives us their names makes the book seem a little bit more realistic.  This, I think, was another aspect of the book that bothered me.  In the first chapter there is a bit of a back story on the Roman system of government that doesn't seem all that important at first, but when we learn more about it the book starts to grow on me. That back story is about how the Roman consuls were the ones who were elected by the senate for a six year term.  When they were out of office they could only be reelected by the entire senate.  Because of this the consuls had a huge amount of power. Because the consul is elected by a senate and not elected by an assembly of the people, the consula was supposed to be chosen by a simple vote of the senate and was not supposed to have any influence on public affairs. But the consules did get some influence. If the senate wanted a certain kind of tax collected, the head of the department or army that was responsible for that tax would appoint a consul to collect that tax.  These consuls used their influence to get more consuls elected.  Some of the consulas were very influential.  A
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is the best book I've read about Islam to date, but I think it is a bad read for a lot of reasons. The biggest being, as a Muslim, it's pretty disturbing to read that a lot Muslims have a deep mistrust of Jews and Christians.   It's like a lot in the western world, there's a lot about hate that's there and I understand that. But I don't believe a lot is being expressed about it here.  I do feel there's something about Islam that makes it a perfect tool for terrorists. And I don?t think it's anything the author is talking about.  And this is something I want to address as well:  For the last few years, and even earlier, I have spoken out about the problem of the rise of Islamist extremism.  It has been a major talking point for me and I believe it is something that needs to be talked about. But this book seems to be trying to talk about it through the lens of a Jew.  Even the book's title is a Jewish-American Muslim who's been living under this Islamic law.  This is pretty disturbing in my book.   Why didn't you mention this earlier? This is a book I believe all should read.  Yes, I think that if you read it, you will find the author's anti-Muslim beliefs are very much at odds with those of a lot people in the Muslim community.  But in this book, the author makes no attempt to explore the role or influence of Islam on the rise in Islamism.  Why is there such a discrepancy? I think what is missing here is the author?s ability to take an informed position.  Because there are so many things to consider here, a lot that the author doesn?t consider.  In fact, I?ve read several books about how Islam plays a role in modern Islamic extremism and the author ignores all of that and simply uses that as the basis of a book.  The author is so focused on the idea that a lack of acceptance of Jews among Muslims makes Islam the perfect tool to create havoc, that the rest of the book simply gets lost.  As for the author trying to use this book to promote his anti-Semitic agenda, I can understand that, but at the same time, I also find it kind of laughable.  Is that why the book came out the way it came out?   Is he trying to get a big

It's horrible, and it's been sitting in my book pile for years, but I haven't even read a paragraph yet. I'll see if I can find a copy somewhere.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not a good book, and has little to nothing in the way of characters that matter. However, the plot is pretty interesting: a young female student (L) is going to be transferred from her previous high school, where the female teachers were a bit weird for me (I like male teachers). I had a hard time finding anything particularly wrong with this, because there was almost no sex at all and the book did not delve into it too much, and the author was not particularly interested in going there, either. I found it interesting that she thought it would be a good idea to move the story to a new school, and I wonder if this was a case of the author "trying" to make a "young female students" novel, where I doubt that young females had any input into this decision. This book is not the sexiest, most provocative novel I've ever read (though I did have some trouble getting through it), but it is very interesting.  Review by: John C on June 14, 2009 :  I had this book for a long time and finally finished it. I had read most of his work prior to reading this one, and was not very impressed with the way the story unfolded. It was a good read, but wasn't very exciting. I wasn't particularly surprised by the bad review. I do know that some of the things he wrote were pretty risque.  and that he has a lot of self interest in his writing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the beginning, the book is awesome! When you get past the "what" and "why" of the story, the characters are actually very intriguing. However, I found the plot to be incredibly boring and uninteresting.   I'm not really sure what's the point of the series except to set the standard for a certain type of vampire story, but I don't see the point.  I feel this is going to be a really fun book to read, with some fun moments, some action, and a very likable main character (albeit a little arrogant).  If you're looking for a fun vampire novel, this book is great for you.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   " I am really disappointed in this book as I enjoyed it a lot...it's really sad that a lot of the characters in this novel seemed so unlikable. I don't think that they had much agency of their own and it was so funny that the characters did all the talking and the book was about them, but it just felt really flat and lifeless." "The plot was so predictable and clichéd, you know... the protagonist gets killed and she doesn't think anything is going to change that so she just goes with it and has a nice day in the sun. And then she dies. So, in that sense it was a pretty dull story." "I did enjoy the book...it was really easy to read." "My favorite character was the one who would eat everything in sight, but I don'st really think that she really thought of herself that way. At the same time, it was very strange because the author tried to portray her as a complete and utter psychopath in a very real way that just made me want to hit her." "Very slow paced and cliché, but what is there to complain about."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book after reading a review by a friend (myself) which stated: "I'm on my third bottle of this, and it is an absolute disaster. The bottle has been open for several months already, and still smells like "plastique", and when I open it I have to hold back my tears. " I am not entirely sure how much of that is my perception of the product as the product is awful; or what the actual quality is of the ingredients. I bought the original and I was delighted to find that the ingredients remain the same, however my initial experience is not a positive one. There are many more good things about this product that I will continue to use.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book three stars because the book seemed to be on the good side of a bad story. The story was interesting enough that I enjoyed it, but I did not like how the author treated some characters like disposable foils.   The ending left me feeling cheated by the author.  I read through the book before making a decision about the novel's length.  The book seemed longer than it really is, which is a good thing.  At first the author told me that there would be a trilogy of books, but this did not turn out to be the case. The two main characters were pretty much dead in the water by the end of the second book, even though I really liked some of the characters in the book.  For example, I liked how the main character took on the persona of a man who had lived through several years of a terrible war.  There were others that I didn't care for. The main character seems to be a psychopath and I was surprised at the lack of empathy.  But the good thing about the book was how the characters responded in the end.  One of my favorite characters (Devin) was really good at fighting back against the bad guy and his behavior, but was a very passive character at the end and did not seem to really care about the other characters.  In addition, one of the bad guys in the second story was pretty awesome. The author also included several other characters from the first book. In addition to the main story, the author had a side story about some of these characters. I liked that the author included these side stories because I thought they were interesting.  Overall, I thought the book did a good job in setting up some interesting scenarios, but did not feel like it was really engaging me until the end when the story was wrapping up. I don't want to be too hard on the author because the first story was written well.  Recommended?:   Not really. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a hard time getting through this book, it made me feel like I was in a bad car accident.   I was not disappointed with the plot, it wasn't particularly good either, it did not really get off the ground. The problem with this is it is not really a plot in the traditional sense, it is more like a narrative that is not quite good enough. I found it frustrating, because when I was reading I was interested in the story, but I just wasn't engaged because the main character never took any real action, which is a major problem, I mean why do you want to do anything? You don't get a lot of character development here, the only thing that is really interesting is the sex. And don't tell me sex doesn't matter in a book, because there is some. It just wasn�t interesting or worth the pages it took to get there.   It was really sad, the girl seems to have a lot going on, but her life ends up just being a series of events.   "You know what? She�s so bad at it, you just have to stop thinking about it. Just leave her there, go about your day."   My life would be so much better if I could just stop thinking of every thing I know in that world and just just let it happen, but that is my life now and I can�t get rid of the knowledge I have about it."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book is a bad thing.   I would love to be a bad person.  But I am not.  I am good and kind and loving and kind.  This book was NOT worth a bad review.  It wasn't a good book.  The only redeeming feature of this book is that I did enjoy it.  If you like horror or books about horror. It is a fun read. But do yourself a favor and save yourself the time and frustration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the great ironies of life is that the best work is rarely the most enjoyable. There are a few exceptions. This is one of them, and though I found a number of good things about the book, I found it unsatisfying. I found the book frustrating and a frustrating read. There were many things I liked about the story, and one major surprise was that the author seems to have a real talent for telling stories. I have read the entire series and will be reading the final book very soon.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this in a couple of days and I am very disappointed.   The story is so poorly told, the characters are not interesting and the plot is predictable at best and poorly written at worst.    It is a great story, but it is not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you like this book, it would be a better read if it was less of a slog, if there were less "nonsense" in the prose and more clarity and precision. For example, it is confusing to me why the character of Sarena believes that her husband is her lover. Her husband does not appear to have romantic feelings for her, and I cannot tell that it is love. However, it seems that her belief is based on a misunderstanding of how the sexual energy works in a marriage. The author tells you, when you read the second part of the book, that it's actually because of an inherited difference of sexual response which causes the couple to have these different emotional experiences. But she never really explains it. There are some good points in this book but I had to read it more than once, as it was repetitive and annoying. The book was also about a character's attempt to break her habit of drinking alcohol, and it's not very interesting. The plot could have been better developed, and some of the characters came across as irritating, to say the least. I liked a few of the references to the author's work, but she did not deserve to get such high ratings as these from me. I think that the rating is fair.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A book of no real interest, but with an almost incredible amount of text which can't be ignored." The only book I ever heard mentioned by a friend who read it.   What else do you want?   Why do I want this book?  It's a book about the history of how the people in America took over their country and how the other side of the story is never told. How did it all go to hell?  And most of all - why?  Because it's boring.  Because you can't get anything done in it. The book is over 800 pages long and I've never gotten through it in one sitting.  It covers every aspect of the American Revolution and the War of Independence (1776-1783) from the beginning to the end.   The authors write the history in a "narrative" form that's so tedious and long.  They only go back a short way in the timeline and that's because the Revolutionary War and the American War for Independence was never really discussed as a whole in the US public school curriculum.   So the only thing left to be found was a very brief overview of American History for the last four years of the War for American Independence.  In this book I learned more about American History from the book than in many years of History classes and it took about six weeks of reading to read the whole book.  I was very disappointed when I finished reading it because I thought I had learned the rest of the history I wanted to learn.    It wasn't until I re-read it the next day that I understood how important the American Revolutionary War is to understanding the rest.  The author, J.R.R Tolkien, wrote a book that tells the entire story and the events from the last war - the American American Revolution.  Now you can have your own copy (or buy this book if you missed out on the first edition) and read about the American Civil War, Reconstruction, the Spanish-American War and World War I.  You can learn about the wars of the Pacific, the War to end all wars, the Cold War, the Vietnam War and, of course, the current Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The author also describes the history from the start of American history to present time - the Civil War.  My rating: 4.5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe that you didn't make the book better, and I'm not talking about adding an extra chapter or two.   So why didn't you add more scenes to this book?   Well, it was a very long book and there were too many things happening in the story.  I've seen it referred to as the best book in the series, and in my opinion it definitely deserves to be rated higher, but this book is a bit of a disappointment.  So, the first thing I notice about the book is that I can still barely figure out where the story is going.  For all the other books in the book series, this was the only one that left me wondering where the hell the book was going to go.  I was hoping that maybe the next book would answer that question but it doesn't seem like that is going to happen.  This book feels like the book that you finish the first book on and find that you know nothing about the characters or the world.  And while I was watching the first three movies from this series, I was sort of hoping that the movie would be as good as the books so that the book wouldn't be as bad as the movie.  But the movie was a bit overrated for me because I found it to be a bit too over the top and did not do a good job of setting the stage for the next two books.  However, if you're looking for a good series with lots of action, lots of excitement, and lots of good humor, this is definitely the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had an awful time with this one and it is really difficult for me to recommend it. The story is great, but I couldn't get into this one. I was excited to learn about the story behind The Boy Who Cried Wolf, and I was really hoping that I would like this one, too. I guess the trouble is that this book is so different from the story told in the original that I really wasn't interested. I read the first book and it was very interesting and I liked the author's style a lot, so it was nice to go back and look at the whole collection. Unfortunately, I couldn.t get into The Boy. The Wolf. It was much worse in the first place. It has the same type of feel and feel that makes a good story and makes a bad story. The author seems to want to tell a story in a way that makes it easy to understand, but that makes the book boring. I really didn't have much of a problem with the first volume, but this book had so many issues that it didn't make me interested in reading the rest of it. It really isn't a good book by any means, but it does have an interesting storyline, so I would give it a go if you like a good thriller and don't mind the complexity that comes with reading a novel in the middle of a trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found it a bit slow. This was more of a problem with the first book in the series so I expected the book to read like the first one. The main character had her powers but wasn't able to use them until she got the help of the villain. That's not really a problem in the first half but in the second half she was more annoying to read about.   Might as Well Read: The Drowning (Book 3 in the Deadhouse Gates series) by Kate Elliott This is a hard one to give a good review because the series is not as good as the first two books. The first book is a little better than the second. It also has better action and not a lot of the annoying things like people talking in their sleep.  Best part: A new friend and the fight to save a small town.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got a book called "The Dark Night of the Soul" and my main concern was that it was written in a style that made the story seem boring (there were quite a lot of pages devoted to describing her thoughts on this book in her journal). It was only when I noticed the chapter titles and the word counts that I realized how long this book really was. The story itself is good, but I felt that the writing style did not mesh well with the content.   The dark night of the soul   The world in which we live is not pretty, but we live here. Some of us are very lucky in how we are treated. We are free to live our lives the way we choose. But others are not so lucky. Most of us have no choice in what we do with our lives. Some choose to work hard to get ahead. Others have to take care of children, family members, and aging parents. But even these people work hard. What do they do in their free time? How much money do they have to spend in order to achieve their dreams?     How much is your dream worth?  "The Darknight of the Souls"   What is an ideal life? What is a person's ideal life in the future? How do we decide whether we should strive to attain these ideals or should accept them as "God given" in nature? How can we be free and happy if we don't ever try to attain them? How does one measure their success?  I like the fact that the story is told in a series of vignettes in order.  It gives the reader the opportunity to develop their own idea of the character's ideal world (as well as the actual world).   There is some good writing in this book, but not as much as I would like. It was a good read though, and I was happy to receive a book in exchange for my review.  Check out this other review of The Dark Night:   https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book is a failure...I could not get past the first couple pages...a little disorienting."  -- Booklist Review   "Told with an air of familiarity. It is an enjoyable romp that will satisfy those who want a good adventure with a dash of humor." :   Book Details  From the author of The Wizard and the Queen, The Man Who Fell to Earth, and The King of the Elves, this is a tale of a man on the run from his pursuers...and a beautiful woman with a heart of gold.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very uninteresting book. I never got the feeling that the author has the depth of knowledge that he claims to have. He claims that he is a physicist but he makes little effort to learn anything about the subject he claims he is an expert in.   I found him to be arrogant and too cocky to even be a good scientist and I was a bit annoyed that he went around claiming that he could understand the scientific literature when he failed to even try to actually read any of it.    I didn't get a sense that he understood the details of the experiment but he made up stories to explain them. The book is full of anecdotes and "proof" and I'm guessing that someone will take this book at face value and start a big fuss about this guy or whatever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You're wrong.  I bought this book at a bookstore because I thought I might like the premise, the main character, and the overall plot. I am a little disappointed in the book as it is not very good and not very original. As far as I know, there are no good "new" YA horror novels out there. My problem is the book does not work because: 1. I'm not interested in vampires, werewolves, and werebears. I was a fan of books like The Lost Boys, The Witches, The Cider House Rules, and The Moth Diaries. All of those books revolved around characters who were a mixture of both, were trying to live normal lives, and tried to get back to their normal lives. This book is a mixture. There is a bit of magic and supernatural elements but it is more a fantasy than horror. The main character who is the main antagonist is a girl who seems to be the main protagonist.   2. The whole book is too long.  3. The writing style is just too boring. The sentences are too long, the grammar is too poor, and there are too many redundant sentences.  This book isn't good because of how bad it is but because it is a bad read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I do think the book had a number of interesting points. The one that seemed most interesting to me was the way the book was set up. It was set in a place that had no real culture, just a couple of nomadic peoples. This made the whole thing very much a modern day travelogue, as the author traveled to see various places while she tried to figure out what was going on, and what the main theme was.   The characters were very generic, and I found myself wishing that the author had spent more time focusing on the people that the main characters interacted with, and not the people who the main character met. That would have been a much better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a good book, but I would have liked to have been given more time to explore the characters and their motivations a bit more.   I am reading this book as I type this, so I am in a bit of a hurry.    I really enjoyed the first third of the book, and the last third (or so) was a bit too fast.  I like when I read a book a lot, but some of my favorite books were slow to begin with.  The second book in the series is not very interesting:  I was not thrilled with this book.  It has been about 10 months since I last read the first book, so when I picked up The Last King of Osten Ard, I was prepared to be disappointed with it.  But, in spite of the title, this book was not very good.  The characters were cliche and there were lots of plot holes.  I feel like my hopes and expectations for this book were way too high.  This is a great story, but it is not one that I will be re-reading. I am looking forward to the third book of the series: This is my favorite series of books I have ever read, and I have read a lot of fantasy.  All the characters have so much depth and personality that it is difficult to figure them out.  There are plot twists, and a plot that is both mysterious and very interesting.  When I get another book in this series, I will absolutely re-read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was horrible. I don't think it was written well and the way the characters and the setting are created is atrocious. The world is so flat and uninteresting that it makes it hard to care about anything going on in it. I felt the author was not trying to do much more than create a flat and dull world and just put in some characters who have sex (there were a few scenes with a woman). I was expecting a more mature and serious book.   Possibly because I was so disappointed in the first book, I was also a little confused about the sequels. I didn't like it much either but it had a different ending. I was wondering if I was in for a third book or maybe a novella. The thing is, I really don't know. I know I am going to be getting a lot more out of the series and hopefully I'm going to get to read the novellas as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   How many times have you read a book with a really good plot and a protagonist that you just couldn't stand. You can't imagine not liking him or her or what he or she is doing. Then you read the next book, and the plot just seems so completely different and you realize you just didn't really care about the protagonist of the first book. The next book you read starts off a bit like the first, but then all of the characters start to behave just like you would expect them to. This is when you realize it was the plot and the characters that really didn't interest you in the first place. How do you describe a story? A story isn't the result of a single act of creative writing. If the plot is good enough, the story will come out in the end. A good story, however, isn't just a good plot; a good story can have great characters and good dialogue as well. And why is it a problem if I just dislike a book? I think it's a problem when people who do not like a book will make comments like:  "That book is boring and unoriginal." "No one will enjoy that book." "It's a waste of my time." "I don't want to read another book in this genre." "You have a good imagination but your writing is bad." I don`t mean to offend. I like a good book and I'm just trying to give some ideas about what my own personal experience with a book can be and what it takes to be an author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The thing about books is that they are a medium. It's not that the book was bad; it's that the story was done so poorly that it's almost insulting to read. The thing with books is they don't change; they just get better with time. The more you read a book, the more you see it in retrospect. The book doesn't just need a rewrite: it needs to have been written a century or so earlier.   I got a new Kindle, and I've just finished the new The Dark Tower series. The first book is not very good; the second one isn't that good either. The third one is ok. I've read the first three of the series, so I can say that they do not have the quality of the other three. I'm reading a lot of Stephen King this year, and it's getting really hard to find good books on his best books.  In all of the novels, the main character seems to be a typical good guy, or at least he seems to like helping out other people, and he does everything he can to not kill people. If he were a total asshole, it would be much more interesting. But in all of his novels, he tries to be kind to people and not take revenge on them. The story of the book is about him attempting to kill a guy who he thinks stole a sword from him.  The whole thing is totally unrealistic and unoriginal: He doesn't steal a sword, he's the one who steals the sword.  If you have read anything by Stephen King, you can tell the guy hates to be beaten by anyone. It would be a lot cooler if the person who stole his sword was a totally different kind of evil person than the guy who beat up his brother in middle school. I found it really, really weird that this guy is so kind and good-natured and helpful and always tries to help people.  I'm a fan of King, but this book left me feeling like there were a lot more important things I could spend my time on.  So I'm going to give this book a 1 star and move on to my next book, The Dark is Rising (I'm reading The Stand at the moment so I have an extra book to look forward to).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A really good book, and one that I am looking forward to reading in the near future. I was excited about it and even had a copy, but the fact that there are no more bookstores nearby has driven me away. I've got a feeling we're going to be seeing a lot more of this book in the future. - L.D. I am not a big fan of young adult fiction. Most of it was terrible. I didn't enjoy this one. The story is about the friendship of two friends from another town, and their battle to help a teenage girl. I do enjoy reading about people in the 20s, but this wasn't what I wanted. They're not likeable, they aren't really interesting. - P.R. This book is a very short read, it really took me about three and a half hours to read. However it does give a great story, and is also a really good way to find out about the other townsfolk in the town. - D.B. One of my favorite books ever. The best short story I've ever read. - J.R I have never enjoyed teenaged characters. I felt that the story seemed to lack any real depth. The characters didn't seem realistic or developed at all, and I really couldn't sympathize with them at all. I found it to be extremely cheesy. There was one character who was completely and utterly unlikable. - M.G. Very sad ending. It was like a movie that had been made. - B.T. An enjoyable read. I loved the characters and I found that there was a lot of romance going on. I don't like romances that go the way they did. It just made it feel like they were trying too hard to be something they were not. I also appreciated the way the author took the time to write a really nice ending. It was short and it didn't go too deep into anything, but it's the sort of short story that any reader can enjoy. - C.M. There is not much going on in this book. But if you enjoy short stories or young adult novels then this is for you. - F.B I loved this story and think it's an awesome short story. The ending was well done. - S.S. The book is just okay. I got more of a bad-ass young adult than a story
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "What I Learned" section makes me sad.   The authors of this book are too lazy to write a true story.  The author and editors of this text want to make this "book" about them and not the participants.  I think a better title for this book would be "How to be a lazy writer".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book when it was first out, thinking I would read a good, short-story book on the subject, but what I got instead was a badly edited, sloppy, unfocused, confusing story, and a lack of imagination that leaves one wondering just what on earth this book is trying to accomplish. The story is so unfocused that I can't help but wonder if it would have been better if the author had not even bothered writing the book at all.   It is all very vague: What happened to the characters? What happened in the past? What will happen in the future? The only clear characters are the main two - who, when confronted, are either too dumb or too angry or both to understand or respond. The author could have easily written a dialogue scene between the two (though some would call it a dialogue episode - but still a dialogue) that is clearly not written by the author. I'm sorry if I sound so nitpicky, but that's really the only thing that could have been done. And then, all the characters' personalities just get lost. What are their real names? What does it mean to be an elf, and who the heck are you? Why are there dwarves and elven and fae and what is a fae? Where are their parents? What is the afterlife? It's all so strange to read. The whole thing just seems so forced.   I can see where a few people might enjoy this, but I just wasn't able to enjoy it at all - and that's what I really take away from this book: a lacklustre story that has nothing to add to the world it is based in.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was OK, but the story wasn't all that good. It seemed to be missing some important detail or some crucial thing. I think it would be better if they were more thorough in the descriptions of the setting.   I think they could have done better in the ending.    The best review I have read about this book so far is this one:  (This review is about the paperback version). I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend and had no idea where I was headed. I'm so glad I did. I had to get through the first few pages to keep reading because they kept going in a pretty fast, furious way. It was a bit disorienting at first, but then it was all clear and logical. The plot was well-thought out, if not very interesting. I am definitely interested in reading the second book in this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite book so far, but has two plot holes: 1) the entire book is a story about how a guy named "Lance" had a romantic encounter with a girl named "Catherine." This story has no relationship to the book itself. 2) The ending is a little too ambiguous for me, I think it could have been better had we known more about the character Lance. I would love to read more about him and I know I'm going to see more from him, so we will have to wait for him. Rating:  ******* Read it!   This one is a bit different. The book takes place in a school where "the students are students" (even the most useless are given something) and "the teachers are teachers." This could be a nice change of pace from a lot of YA stories in which the main character was a virgin until the day she fell in love with the first guy she saw.  The main character has two major themes going on: 1. She loves all of the people she works with (even if they aren't all that interesting) and 2. She just wants to see the world and go on adventures.  There are some nice lines: 1.) "I don't know what kind of guy I was, to be able to say yes." 2.) "No matter how well I might be at my job, I am still just a girl in the wrong body." 3.) "You're going to have to be the one to tell me if you think I can have it all." 4.) "In a way, I'd rather have just one great relationship." 5.) "There's only one way to be perfect in love, but not in life. And that's through a relationship with a man." I really liked this book. I thought the main story was pretty interesting and not so much about the romance. The ending did give me some heartache, but overall I think this one was a good read. It's been a while since I've read a YA book and I think I was able to get into the characters and their situations well enough. I'm very excited about this one! It was very well done. Rating :  ****** Read it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    1   5     . The book is a long book, but it is worth reading. This book has a very well thought out plot, but you don't want to read too much. I liked this book. It is an interesting story. It also is a great read. It has a great plot, great characters, and the prose is really good. The author is an excellent writer. The book was fun to read.  1)     A very good book, and a very interesting book. The story is not very complicated, so it is easy to get started with it, and to follow the plot. I also like the book, the author, and this book in general.

My review:  [H]    Hugely, ridiculously epic! I love it. The action scenes are breathtaking and the prose is a delight. I am a big fan of historical fiction and this is absolutely my favorite.  If you love history, I think you will love this book.  I am going to read up all the names and the places and the characters, just so I can reread it.  [I] [F] [A] :  I really like this book, but I wouldn't read it again.  This is definitely one of the better historical fiction books out there, but a bit too long for my liking. The book is good, but the pacing is slow. I would re-read this book with some revision.  In summary: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a huge fan of the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher, and was very excited to read his new book, The House of Shattered Wings. The book is written with a strong sense of humor, so the stories are all entertaining and fun to read. However, the story takes a turn for the worse, and becomes a bit confusing and convoluted at times. This is my first experience reading a book, so I can't say anything for certain, but I don't feel the book is up to the quality of previous works in the series. While the book still has good humor, I feel like it is a bit too easy, and not a very memorable story. I'm looking forward to reading the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half was a fast-paced, fun read, but the second half was slow, boring and confusing. The author didn't explain what he wanted his character to do until the second and third quarter of the book. This just makes sense with his writing style and writing style alone - if the book was too easy, he wouldn't have had a second half of his story. The "character development" that was supposed to be a selling point of the first half has turned out to be more of a distraction. As the protagonist, the main problem with your character is that he is so bad at everything. You know that he's not good at things because he doesn't have any character traits. He's a lazy, arrogant, obnoxious, selfish person who does nothing to help anyone other than himself. His goal is to be the greatest chess player in the world. You've made a poor attempt to portray your protagonist, Joon. I really wanted to like you, and I'm sure that you really want to like yourself, but you just didn't. Joon is a total joke. I don't know why you did this book. It should have been a big success. But it's just another example of a book that was too good to be true.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book with a lot of potential. It is a well-written, well-researched look at the political and economic forces that have led the world to an economic mess in which, according to the official data, 95% of American jobs are held by "low wage" workers. The book focuses on the United States as a nation of wage-slaves. It does this by taking a close look at how the economic policies of the Reagan and Clinton years, along with those of the Bush and Obama administrations, have helped to create the economic problems that so many Americans have to live with. The author, Thomas Sowell, is one of the most important economists in the United Sates. His book, The Logic of Action: Economics in One Lesson, is a classic. It should be required reading for all Americans. However, the author in his book fails to discuss one of his most significant points: The current economic crisis in America, if it continues, will be the worst in history. That is, until it becomes the second worst. Sowell has written many books and this is one that does not impress. As a member of the American Economics Association, I would love to see someone who writes about economics in this book take his research and use it to convince the majority of his fellow AEA members and the general public that current economic policy is not working and will not work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My daughter (15 years) bought this book. She didn't want to read anything else. She wanted to read. She has trouble reading comprehension. She thought she would be able to read this book with a little help from the story lines. However, her reading skills did not improve. She was unable to follow the story line. She could only understand about 5% of the story. She started to question her ability to read at all. She would go to bed frustrated. She then said that she would try a different book. I have been trying to work on my skills and she is a little behind.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "A boring, pointless, poorly written novel."  This was an easy decision to make, since I'm a fan of "Dying of the Light" and am happy with it. I don't have much to say about it, but I do think it was written at a high level for the genre and with a clear vision. But for what it is, I'd give it a 5/10. I think the author took the perfect thing, the idea of a good book, and went and did it in the worst way possible.  Recommendation: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't stand this book! I think that if you're looking for a light and fun read, then this is the book for you. It has a bit of everything but if you don't have a sense of humor (especially in this book) and you don the 'I've read it all' mentality, then you might be disappointed. My mom used to tell me stories about her little brother who would read all the Harry Potter books and just sit there looking sad because all he could do was think about all his friends gone. I don't want that for my own little one. This book is the reason why I have this 'I'm bored of reading this series' attitude...

Write a negative review about a bad book:    (a quick story about a book that I loved but found boring. You can find that review on Amazon. This was my first ever Amazon review so I'm sorry if the story sounds familiar to you.)  I was really looking forward to this book because I've had this idea of getting a copy of "the best" books, but the thought of reading something that doesn't impress me like this one made me not think of the idea for quite a while. The beginning of the book is really good, it's like you're watching an old science fiction movie, and in this one it's more like a real old sci-fi movie. The book started like a movie, with a spaceship crash landing on a remote planet. After some time the ship was found, and the surviving crew is about to be sent back to Earth, but not without some difficulties and a couple of "awful" consequences, most of which we find out later. What made this book better for me than most sci-fies is that the author decided to start the book with a flashback. As a viewer of sci- fiction movies, I have to admit, when the movie starts in an unknown space it is really difficult to imagine what's going on. This is why I have never liked to see these movies after a while: they don't seem to have any idea what's happening. However, this book begins like a normal book: A man is on a planet where the space is quite nice, and it's the last place the people want to be. The man tries to build a new life on the planet. Well, nothing goes really well, and his problems don't stop there, he also encounters some people who hate humans and try to take over the planet for themselves, a group of humans who live in a commune, and some aliens who have been on this planet for centuries and they know everything, they have all kinds of resources and all kinds. The situation gets worse because, of course, all humans have a "humanity gene", and the aliens use it to develop their technology. They also have an advanced version of a virus that they can use to attack humans. The human race is running out of energy, and at some point it will die out unless the humans find a way to use their energy again. And that's what the book has been about. The aliens are constantly trying to take the "humans' place". The people in the commune are
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book follows a character who is a former soldier turned "social worker," but I found this book hard to read. I'm a strong advocate of "socially aware," but the book seemed more concerned with a character's political leanings than understanding the story. I also found it hard to accept the idea that there's such a thing as "bad literature." The character in the book doesn't go away or change for the better. And the main character, in the final act of the book, goes from having just the slightest connection to a character on the show (with the exception of some things they said) to being completely absorbed by it. It's hard to tell if the book was made to appeal to viewers of the show or whether this was written to have a point, but I didn't care for the story's premise.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite books were The Last Lion of Babylon by S.T. Joshi   and "Spirits" by R.A. Lafferty. But these books did not fit in with the new and evolving way I read. A year later I bought a book that was just about the last book I would ever buy. It is a beautiful, unique, and difficult book that made me realize that there is not much else worth my money. This book will leave you with more questions than answers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was just really long, and then all of a sudden it's not.   It was just a lot of pointless info for something that didn't do anything for me at all.    I would've been much more satisfied if it were about a new vampire and a bunch of new people who were interested in her.  I mean, I'm already familiar with vampires, and there's plenty of other stuff in this book to keep me interested.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is short and well written. The story is simple, and the ending is predictable. It is, however, a short story (4th of July Day is fast approaching and it's a hot day in Ohio!) I didn't really think it needed the ending at all, but I'm sure I'll be reading more of this series.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a collection of essays, one each on the philosophy of law, moral philosophy, philosophy of science, and philosophy of literature. The main topic, which is discussed in the majority of the essays, is epistemology. That is, the fundamental questions of how knowledge is acquired, verified, and what makes it knowable. There is little discussion in this collection of how to approach the problems and issues raised by epistemological issues, and there are very few discussions of how we ought to treat epistemologists, in particular those who do not have the axioms of the theory of knowledge that I do. In my view, the key problems in epistemologies are those concerning truth, and these are addressed by other authors, e.g. Rorty, but here I am concerned with the problems arising out of the axiology of knowledge and the philosophical problems in this area.   In this vein, I did not find much in the book to suggest that there is much good in the philosophy or that there are serious problems. The authors in this book are, from my perspective, good, and the topics addressed are generally interesting and relevant. The problem is that the book, as a whole, is a great deal weaker than the original essay collection, and much of the content is so weak as to be mostly redundant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you like a book, then buy it. The reviews are honest and that is what matters most. I have reviewed hundreds of books and there are just as many good as bad. My rating is a 1 because the book was over 3 years late and overpriced at $29.00. I paid $15.00 for this book.   I'm really not sure why Amazon.com gives this book such high ratings as being the best of the best. If I was a reviewer I would have given it one star, no stars or negative reviews are my opinion not the product's. The book is hard to follow and there was a great story in there but the story is about nothing other than the action and is really hard to understand. If you are looking for the action, don't read this book, you'll not be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      "This book is absolutely terrible! I've seen some bad books, but never have I had this much trouble with this book. I don't know how many people actually read this book, but it is completely filled with all kinds of errors and poor writing. This book has the worst author I've ever read. It is very hard to finish this book and I found it incredibly boring to read."   Reviewers:  "I'm going to go ahead and give this book 5 stars because it's actually a really good book. But for a book that so many people have given poor reviews about, it's disappointing that it has such a poor author. It's hard to find books like this when they're all so much better than this."   and   -- "This book isn't worth reading for its entertainment value (not one bit), its plot (a good start) or its characters. It doesn't matter; it's just not a fun read."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are many books out there, and you can find dozens of people to review them. But I have yet to find one that can match my experience of reading this book.   "Darling is a short and sweet story of love and passion and a father/daughter relationship that transcends age.  It's a story that I want to be written by a 10 year old girl."   -Amber S., Amazon review from December of 2010.  The author had a similar experience with her young niece.  This is not an everyday book; it is a beautiful and emotional story about a father's desire to understand his daughter.  " I would recommend to anybody who wants to feel close to their child, and also to anybody else who wants a story of faith and faithfulness. I was touched." -J.H., Amazon reviewer from July of 2010   The author has a sense of humor in this book and is able to tell a simple but touching story without using many words.  My parents have talked about this book for years and they both agree it is one of the most beautiful books they have ever read.  I have heard other reviewers refer to this book as a "gospel," "spiritual," or "faith-driven."  I think the author would agree it should not be described this way but rather by the love, understanding, and compassion the father demonstrates for his daughter in this story.  To say this book is beautiful would be an understatement.  The stories that follow the events of this book are just as strong and are one of my favorite things in the book. The author clearly put a lot of thought into this book, writing in a beautiful style with an amazing story to tell.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a fairly experienced reader. I've tried the book twice now and it didn't make a whole lot of sense. I was really hoping that it would explain what the characters were trying to do and how it came to be this way.   The plot is a bit hard to follow, especially if you're not used to science fiction with complex plotlines.  Overall I was a bit disappointed with this book. It's a good start, but I think that the author needed to go into more depth to make the story more interesting and compelling. I'm definitely interested in trying some of the other books in this series, but if you are a fan of The Starry Nights series, I think you'll want to stick with it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the first chapter I was disappointed in the plot as the author, William G. Wilson, tries to tell us the story of a child's visit to the moon and her encounter with the old man in the moon that has appeared there to warn her that her mother is an evil woman. I didn't want to read about an astronaut who is not from this planet and is a woman so I stopped reading. The rest of the book is great though. I love the science of the moon, and the people who lived there and the history of the place and the men who have lived there. There is a lot of information in the story but it was not in the way I thought it should have been. The story didn't help the characters grow in the book at all. As I said I was very disappointed in this story and would not read it again. I guess it was more important to tell the story about a woman who goes to the Moon instead of giving me something to read for a story of an astronaut.

Write a negative review about a bad book:      I enjoyed the book and am glad that I read it, but there are so many plot holes and some stupid plot-twists that made the book not enjoyable to me. I really wanted to love this book but I just wasn't sure. I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes action and has read other books by this author. This book is better suited for the reader who likes slow-paced and character driven books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've heard about it for years, but I've finally bought a copy. In the past I have always read in print; but I bought this copy for my daughter, since she will soon be in kindergarten, and since I have no time to read in bed. The kids love to read, so they usually have a copy at home. However, since the book is very short, and the characters are just beginning to learn to write and read, this book is too short. I could not get into this book because I did not enjoy it at all. Maybe in the future I will return it, but right now I am not so sure. I found that the illustrations are very good, but not as much as I remember from the other books that I have read.  The illustrations are wonderful, but the plot of the book was boring, and all the characters looked the same, not even a little bit different.  The book is a wonderful and entertaining, but does not deserve 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really hated this book. I have read many good books over the years and this one in particular really irritated me. It was just awful to read. It just made me want to throw my copy away and move on to something else, I didn't enjoy it. I read this in 2 days in 2 different days because I had to, it just bugged me the whole time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you think that "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" is bad, you need to get it out of your system.     It's over the top, stupid, incoherent, and over-long.  But, that's my only complaint about it.  Also:  I've been watching the movie 3 times a day and my throat is still sore.  I have so much to write about this book, but if I do, I'll have to wait until after the third movie.  "The HungerGames: C I don't want to be that guy.  The book was really good until it was over.  But the book is good and there was a ton of cool things in it and I can't wait for the movie. There were a lot of things in this book that really bothered me: 1)   This book was just too confusing and hard to follow.  This is the first time I've ever been bothered by a book and the way this book ended was like a kick in the gut and I am a sucker for ending in a cliffhanger.  You could tell that the author was really unhappy with this one.  2)  There were too many people who really had no purpose other than to be some crazy person (who I did not like at all).   I wanted more to come from this book.  3)  At the end of the book I was so mad about Katniss and the fact that she had no reason to care about who she was but then I read the last chapter of the Book and I was angry that it would have been better to have just gotten away from the horrible people.  4)  I was frustrated by how she had to sacrifice her own life to give everyone else one. I wanted to go after the people who did that to her.  It seemed like there would have probably been a happy ending to this book had the movie not ended so badly and if I didn't think that Katnus had to die so many times in this series.  5)  All the books have a big problem with just wanting to be good and wanting everyone to be happy and that is a theme throughout the series:  There is a lot more to living than just being a good person.    I really wanted to see more about Katnatiss' back story.   6)  Katnisse was supposed to be more
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What I have enjoyed about this book, which makes it the perfect introduction to The Hunger Games, is the way that the author manages to give us an inside view of the war between the Capitol and the districts, the politics of power, and the way the people are affected by the whole mess.    And yet, she does not take a stance against the Capitol.  That is just the beginning of her narrative.  She takes a nuanced approach, weaving a plot that will keep you interested until the very end.  I think there is some great potential for an author like her to give the Hunger Games a more complex and interesting look.  In my opinion, her characters and motivations are the best part of the book, while her story is the best thing about it.  This book is a bit too long for me, but it is well worth the effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it to anyone who is a casual reader of fantasy and hasn't read at least one volume by Patrick Rothfuss.   If you have read any of Rothfucks' other novels, you will already know what to expect from The Name of the Wind, as I have. That is good, as it will keep you from going in expecting a different type of book, and instead getting what is a fantastic sequel to The Wise Man's Fear.   that will keep a reader hooked through all the good parts.  -the first half is very enjoyable and interesting, with some nice touches, such as the way Patrick is able to make his protagonist seem very different from other fantasy protagonists in other works.  The plot of The Name-of-the-Wind is excellent, and while it feels a bit slow, the first part is very satisfying. The second half is a little more complicated than it needed to be, but it is good to see Patrick take a little extra time to make sure the plot really has a good story arc.   has a similar plot to The Book of the New Sun, but with a lot more depth and character development, as well as an extra few pages of explanation about the workings of magic.is not a book I would recommend to people who have read athrough previous books in the series. If you are interested in Rothfests, and are not a casual fantasy reader, this one is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't like this book, you're really going to have to hate the authors too.   The book starts with the idea of an alien landing on Earth.  The aliens are friendly to all the people living on Earth and seem very human.  Then some aliens decide to take over all the Earth's money and destroy it.  However, the aliens do not want to destroy humanity.  So a group of people that is working together to take down the alien is the one that gets invaded.  This is pretty much the only thing that is true.   This has nothing to do with the book itself.  I just didn't like it. This is my first time reading something by Robert J. Sawyer, and I like his writing.  When I first started reading the book I was a bit frustrated because the first few chapters were a bit confusing and the story felt like it was missing a big chunk.  But the first part of the book is really good and I enjoyed the first half.  As a fan of fantasy I was glad the book didn't make me think too much about it.   So it is a good book to read if you're just starting out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . A couple of years ago I picked up " The Giver " at the library and had no idea what to expect. I wasn't even sure it was going to be an audiobook! I was pretty blown away, but it wasn't without its faults. First off, I've read most of David Weber's books and I found that he makes a strong case for reading the Giver, but doesn't really go the extra mile. I've learned to trust Weber's opinions more than his knowledge, but still, I'm not a huge fan. There's only so much to cover, and I feel like Weber would have benefited from a more detailed summary of what's going on. But I think this is more of a personal issue. I like to read fiction, but my favorite audiobook is probably " The Martian " (Audible Audiobook version). It has a great plot and is a great story. I still don't agree with the book's ending, but I think I'll still read the next installment of the series.   One of the biggest reasons I gave this book 4 stars is because of its ending. This book had a good story to begin with, but a poor, poorly-constructed end. It was too vague. I was left wanting more and felt like I didn't get everything I wanted out of the book.  A couple months later I picked this book up at the book store again. I didn�t remember it being so well-received. But it was, so I decided to give it another go. I had some issues with this book that I had already discussed. First, the character of Will was flat. It wasn't very fun to hear this person talk so much. I think Weber did a very good job with the writing of Will. I just wanted him to stop talking. I liked the main character�s voice, but not his speech. I know the character wasn't written poorly or anything like that. I guess it was just that Weber didn't really give us the chance to connect with Will. He could have used more voice direction on him. I also had some other issues with the story. It went in a different direction than it started out. It seemed like it started to get back to the main story and I didnít really enjoy it that much. That's not to say that I hate it or anything. It just didn't go with my expectations. Overall, I think that this
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing this book really has going for it is that it comes out in paperback, rather than in paperback plus audiobook. If you really don't want to listen to the narration, then it's a very nice read. It's very, very good. The narrator is a wonderful narrator who I had forgotten about until recently. I had a very pleasant surprise. My only complaint is that the narrator sounds a bit nervous during the first section, the first hour or so, but that disappears as the story gets moving. In a review for a book by a woman, I often get a bit of a reaction when I talk about the voice. That usually happens with female voices, as the male reviewers have some difficulty dealing with the voice of a woman. The one I have found to work very well is the narrator in " The Unbearable Lightness of Being " by Milan Kundera. This was a very good book. I enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "It's hard to think of a book more loathed than The Brothers Karamazov."   So, a novel so despised that a reviewer was forced to describe it as "loathed".   I can see how that must be something of a rarity - if a book was hated, I'd imagine you couldn't give a shit about the other books in the world or anything else - but it's a shame.   If it were up to me I'd have liked to see the plot of The BrothersKaramazov told as a series of interlocking stories.  In fact, I was thinking the same thing when I read it - how wonderful would it be if the author's entire story was a series?  That's where the story is at now - I'm enjoying the whole journey, and the ending is rather brilliant, but it is all just a means to an end - the first book has been written and the second has just been published.  When I started writing this novel I wasn't sure if the first part would work - I'd always written a lot of non-fiction, and I'd done a lot more than one book of non fiction in the last few years.  It's hard - I mean, it is written from the perspective of a single man (though you can make out the author and his wife on several occasions, it's more like a portrait, with his wife the only character to show up) and I had a lot to learn from him, but in the end the novel worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read more than one bad review for this book.   The author has a real problem writing and there are times when I could see the whole book written by someone else. The story is about a group of high school girls and I feel that she has given them a very unrealistic idea of what is "normal" and "normalised" in society and in high school life.  The book starts out with the girls becoming good friends and then eventually they are all sharing their lives and their feelings with each other as they get older. However, the book becomes very twisted and the girls realise that the relationship is not what it seems and one by one they all start to fall out of contact with one another.  In a way, this story is a commentary on how people are treated in our society today, and in my opinion, the author has not done her job well at all.    What I Liked: The main characters were all very well developed and the main love interest was a real winner. The author did a great job in making the girls feel real and not just the characters that were portrayed.  What the author could have done better: The author could of done a better job in creating the character relationships with the guys at their school. The authors uses some of the "normal relationships" in the book and they aren't exactly what I would expect them to be. The book also could of used more love between the characters. There was definitely too much of it and I was not interested in finding out what happened to the girls after they stopped being friends.  What I Did Not Like:  The main romance in the novel didn't make me feel any more interested in the characters than I was before.  This was probably the most disappointing aspect about this book, I was interested in hearing what happened next but I was left wondering and wondering, wondering and waiting, until I finally saw that I would have to wait another month before I could get another chapter.  I will not read another book written from the perspective of highschool students.  If it had been a book written about a guy, I would love to read it but unfortunately it is not. I also felt that the author had a real issue with writing, which she really did not have an issue with.  She could of made the characters come alive, but she just could not make it happen. The characters are also very different to the normal girls and some of them were
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I had heard about this book by some people and it seemed that the publisher would publish it, although I had not heard that it was written by a female author. I read the summary (which I did not agree with) and then I started to read. I have to admit that when I finished this book I was very disappointed. In the opening scene the main character (who I will refer to as N) wakes up with a scratch on her cheek, her pants falling down (because of course they do) and she is naked. She runs downstairs and sees that the clothes in her closet are missing. The next scene involves N's dad talking to N about what she did and how they could help solve it. (They have an idea - a "backup") The next thing that happens is N being asked if she is going to go to school on Monday. N says no and then the father asks N to come back up the stairs to his room and play with him. Then the father starts asking N questions like "did you go to your last school?" and "why are you so skinny?" This continues until N gives her answer, which is "I had a hard time at my school because they were very strict and they didn't want anyone to talk to me about it, even my teachers. I was just too embarrassed". I then read the story about her first day at school and then her father telling her that she is "so skinny". The father then gives N the answer about how his wife used to wear the exact same size, and that they were always skinny and very fat. I don't really understand how a guy could be ashamed of the fact that his wife was the exact opposite of him, and I guess that he could just say he likes a nice woman, like his wife, and it's a personal preference. This book could have used a more interesting story. It seemed very random and I think it would have been better if it just happened on its own and was not used as a plot device. Also, it was not clear why the father was asking N these questions. Also I think the author did not use the fact (that N has been told that she was skinny because of her father) to its full potential because the first time I heard this line of story I could not figure out what the point was. So I am glad that I did like the book, but I think that it could have
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A big part of being a writer is being able to say things that many writers (but not all) will not say. You can't just take somebody else's words on the page and then say, "Oh, you're wrong." You have to say why they're wrong. In this book, the authors seem to have gotten to a point in the novel where they can say, in an authoritative tone, "But the book you love isn't so bad after all." I don't like the "The book is bad, but not bad enough" approach, because it means that I'm a bad writer because I don�t want to acknowledge the good parts. It also means that if you're a good writer, you can be satisfied with the book that you write. It's a false binary. I just want to say,  "Look, there are good things about this book. I love the characters, and the themes are beautiful, and there's a lot of tension, and even some light humor and warmth. But the characters are not what make it good. You have two good, smart characters, one of whom is the narrator and a very talented writer and the other of whom, the protagonist, is a lousy, stupid, selfish, hateful person. I hate that." Why is she a lousy writer?   Why she's not a lousy person:  The narrator is a pretty good writer!   The narrator is also a pretty terrible person. The bad part of her is that she is not very good at writing characters. She's awful, really, in that respect. She is a good, talented, good friend who's also a bad, shitty friend. She tells me her friends all love and support her, because she is a great writer, but she's a shitty friend, because that's what friends do. She doesn't care about her friends at all, just like my friends don't care that I suck at playing guitar. The narrator can't even think through her problems! She talks out of her ass. She talks too much.   She just says whatever the author tells her to say. And that's it. I think that if I were to pick a bad friend, it would have to be her. It�s the one that thinks I'm not good enough to write, the one I'm bad enough to be friends with. The other three characters in the book are fine. I liked them
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've given this book two stars and my review is based on two stars. It is definitely a fun read but I think I've come to expect a lot from this type of genre fiction.   This is just another book that I don't see myself reading again.  "I was a child of the Sixties, and that decade was in my mind like a dream. The Beatles had just started making music; the Vietnam War had been over for nearly a year; I had just finished college and a book by Jack Kerouac would soon be published. I loved the feel of the Seventies, the music, and the street life that it was giving birth to. And then, in 1968, I woke up."   A young girl goes to live with a group of people who look to her as a surrogate mother.    As you can see, I liked this book. I'm not sure how much this book appeals to me personally but it is the sort of book that will give you a different type of experience and that's always good.  This book reminds me of a scene from a book I read a few years ago called  The Bowery Boys by David Mamet.  The main character, the one we are given to understand as a child, is a girl who is very sensitive and childlike, while also being very intelligent. As she gets older she begins to understand the power of people around her.  So I can't say that I completely understand the appeal to me of the book in question.  The only thing I can think of that might be an answer is the idea of taking a book you love and giving it a different spin on it. This isn't the first book that has given me that experience, I have a feeling that many people out there have experienced this type thing in the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1 star The world does not need another book about a family living a double life. They will have to go to the hospital and get their daughter back. It was a sad ending but at least it is done.   If you are not into horror then I highly recommend the book. It is very interesting. If you have read any of the horror and crime books and want something more than that, then this is a great choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I like this book a lot. But the problem with this book is that I don't really like the characters very much. There are some nice things in this book - a girl who doesn't want to do homework is not a nice character to have - but there is a whole lot of "oh, so-and-so would be so wonderful if only she'd just have a good friend and she wouldn't have to go out on her own all the time and stuff" syndrome.   There are a few good bits of the book, but overall I would have liked to have seen this book have a little more depth. I'm guessing this book might not be the most popular for some reason, so I'll give it three stars.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    *   Thank you to the two wonderful editors and the editor of the new anthology I have just finished. *  * They helped me through the process of discovering my first novel and I am so pleased with how it turned out. * * *  The books and the reviewers are superb and the new edition of the original texts is even better. * Thanks again to you all. * * Review *  Thanks to David W. for introducing me to this fantastic author. It is a very nice read and very interesting and well done. I especially liked the chapters on "The New Testament and the Bible in Light of the Greek Text" and "Why Paul Is Not God".     I'm a Christian, and I have spent years searching for a "good" book on the New Testament. David W.'s book is an excellent resource and well worth the purchase.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My only two problems with this book are that she is a total bitch about some of the stuff in the book (like the whole scene where her and her friend are trapped in a room for three days with a guy she doesn't know) and the last chapter, which is a pretty lame ending. I guess you can blame the ending on being rushed.   I do think that she's a good writer.    All in all: 4/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't recommend it to anyone who isn't interested in the subject matter or is already familiar with it. The writing is not very good and the grammar is atrocious. It's hard to find an analogy for this book to use, but it's just like every other book that is trying to sell you something with a bunch of bad writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot of books on the philosophy of life, but I thought the most interesting book about this topic was "How to Live Well in a Small Town" by Frank P. Robinson.   A review of his book that appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle was very interesting:  I was somewhat apprehensive about this book at first. I didn't like the fact that Robinson was too "urban" for me--he was very much an outdoorsman, and the setting of this book was not the sort of place where I'd ever go for a good book. However, it was a fun read and it's one of the best books I've read about the "how to live well in a small town" book. I like the idea that it's more important to live in a quiet town, where the people have their own jobs and families, than it is to live "like everyone else." I thought it was very useful to have a list of things you'd want to change about the way the people there lived, and I also liked the suggestions for things that would be good for the town itself.  A few of my favorite passages from the book: "Small-town life offers a certain freedom to those who don't live in the big cities." (p. 23) "The town gives you time to develop your own personal style, to try new things, and to discover the pleasures and the pleasures of the ordinary life without the constant need to have the town in your face. " (p 28) "In small town life, there's more time to see the world, to be yourself, and a little more space to experiment, to figure out what is really important in life." (pp. 52-3) "You have to admit, when you get to know a small-town person, it's much easier to love him or her than to hate him or get mad at him. "Poverty isn't always a negative thing. It's one aspect of life. There are plenty of people who are poor, just as there are plenty who are rich. It may seem difficult to have that conversation with a small city person. However...the town is just as important to a small townsman as he or she is to the city person." ( p. 88)  I thought that Robinson's book was interesting and useful.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first read this book I was impressed with the writing style. It was a breath of fresh air to read something from a female perspective. And I do not mean the "male perspective." But the fact that it was written by a woman (in this case, a woman who was a military spouse and mother) made me want to read more from her. But unfortunately, this novel does not provide an escape from what she experienced. I mean, she suffered, yes. But I believe that this is a victimization of a person that, as a male, I could have handled in a different way, but for this author's personal struggle she has to write it this way. The problem is that I can not find any other way to read this. I know it is a novel, but to me, it has no redeeming value other than it being a woman's experience. This book may be one that you may like (although I doubt it) but I personally can't recommend it because of it being one woman's story.  37 of 40 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's an element of this book that I could totally understand:   The novel is set in the late 20th Century, and so it's important to have a strong focus on the human condition. It's also possible to make a book out of that, but I don't think that's what's going on here.   It's not about the characters' inner demons, it's about the nature of humanity. I suppose you could say that a major feature of this series is that it deals with humanity's psychological  darkness, but that's not what I meant by that.  For me, it feels like the book just goes off in a few different directions at once:  In a single scene, a young man named Sam is forced by his girlfriend to go to a party in a back alley. This is a situation he should be wary of, but instead he finds himself making a mistake that could land him in jail.     The only way he could do it was if the girl told him beforehand that he was invited (and that she was going to drink), which she didn't. I donít want to say anything other than Samís attitude seems to be a  version of "what a fuck, I donĖt care", which is the sort of  attitude I'd expect from someone who doesnít know how to deal with an  excruciating  situation.  He is also forced to deal, or at least make an effort, with his friend Peter.  We learn, very early on, that Peter is gay and Peterís parents doní't understand this fact, so that is the first source of conflict between them. Itís interesting that Sam never mentions this fact.  And itís interesting how he deals with it:     Now we know that Peter's parents really did not want him to be gay, but it still seems like they've got to some level allowed Peter to be himself.  This is why Sam comes out to Peter later (and why he does it in such a way that seems to hurt Peter as well as himself).  And Peter comes around to the idea that Samís a guy.  I really dig that this is a gay book, because it shows that people can deal with and deal with different things, despite what their parents, or society, or family in general might tell them they should do. There are
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a little bit of a shame that the final book is so poorly written, because it does make for a more satisfying read than the first.  The story is, to a certain extent, what we expected.  There is a certain sense of the absurd that permeates it.  It feels slightly overblown in the end, which was never something I was looking for.  This could just be because I was expecting a more dramatic ending.  I do want to see a sequel, though.  A more dramatic and intense ending would have been appreciated.      This is my first read and I'm very happy I picked it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was awful when I first read it, but as I read and re-read it and reccommend it to others, I think the author, and other authors, need to be able to recognize when they made a mistake in their first attempt at writing a book, and learn from it. I'd like to think this was one of the mistakes that this author learned from.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will be forever grateful to my parents for getting me an audiobook copy of the original novella. For some reason, it's just always been a favorite of mine, and it's the reason I read so much of my own stuff.  The novelette takes place over one night, in which the narrator is sleeping in a guest room when he hears his mother scream for help. She is in the bathroom, having lost her mind from a night of drunkenness.   In a moment of weakness, she tries to climb the stairs, and is caught.  In the confusion that follows, the narrator and his brother are unable to find their father, and as the night goes on, they find themselves lost in the woods. The boy thinks the woods belong to his family, but they are really theirs to explore, and the narrator finds himself falling in love with the beautiful girl he found sleeping in the guest room.  What the novelly lacks in originality, it makes up for in enjoyment of the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book and the cover is absolutely stunning and the book is just a fun read. I was really excited to see that the book had been published as it is a genre I really like. However I'm disappointed that the author has had such trouble staying in his own book. I know this is the author's first novel so I'm a little skeptical but I guess I'll have to give the guy another chance to do this right!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * * * I was pleasantly surprised by the content and author.   * The first 40 pages or so were very interesting and gave me the impression of a very good author who's writing was not at all lacking.  The only problem I had was when I got to the end of this book.  After I finished the novel, the author kept telling us that "This is where the story ends". Well, I guess that means that it's over for me, because my expectations were not met.  *  " I have learned a thing or two about what makes a good writer:   the lack of an ending is the surest sign of a mediocre story. " * " A real writer always has an ending... but usually a little bit of doubt lingers in their head as to whether the ending will be satisfying.

She lives in the shadow of her son John, who is an aspiring author, and his friend, John the Barista.  Every Sunday night, Mama Cass brings her daughter, Janey, and son John to the library to read.  Mama Cass does her best to make sure that the three of them have as much fun as they can have with books.  There is a sense of camaraderie that is apparent, but a sense also that Mama Cass is still trying to keep her family together as it is at the time.  When the three make their way to the shelves for a book, they are greeted by a welcoming barista, John, and their friend, Jane.  One day, John comes home from a very long day working for a publishing house and informs Mama Cass that his writing has just been accepted for publication. He promises that the book will be something to remember.  Janey and John then come to visit Mama Cass and Janey to discuss their work as well as Janey's book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a great, new fantasy novel from someone whose style is distinctively different from what you've heard in fantasy, you should pick up this book. There are some wonderful character designs and worldbuilding, and the characters and the setting are fascinating. However, I found this novel to be a bit lackluster for me and to feel a bit repetitive. The characters felt a bit too shallow for me to find much of a bond with them, and I found myself getting bored with the main plot. The only thing I don't dislike about this book is the author's style.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (This review is a few days old. I wrote it today, but it may have changed since then.)  I bought this book because I read a bunch of the reviews about how it made me "go mad". But what a mistake. It makes me feel good.  The characters in this book are all likable.  There is one "bad guy" that I really didn't care for, but he is not nearly as memorable as the others.  If I wanted a book that made me go mad, I wouldn't have read this one. I want to like this book.  I want the characters to be better.  But it makes me sick.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   My only criticism for this novel would be that I wish that the narrator had a little more energy or a little less confidence, so I would have been a lot more engaged during the later parts. But I was hooked, and once I started reading I could not put it down.   This is an unusual and wonderful novel, and I can't wait for my other book to be published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my favorites is the one by Richard Dawkins. It's the first book I ever picked up that wasn't by someone I'd read before. It was so good and so original that I never wanted it to end. The author was a very wise, wise man who has been around for a long time. This book is very difficult to get through and to me is a very good book to read just to feel a bit better about humanity.   "You should be afraid of a guy who can eat a whole cow on a plane" (a common reference in the book)  The Good:  "The main theme is evolution as a scientific method, and the idea that evolution is not a theory of the universe but a way of looking at what is going on in the world around us."   "If someone asks me where I learned about evolution, I say, the way a good biologist should: from reading Darwin and Mendel, from watching Nature."  A lot of people are very interested in science and evolution.  "People have long been impressed by how smart nature is. But now they realize that even smart people are not perfect, just like everyone. As a result, they have come to appreciate the imperfections of the human condition. So there is a growing acceptance that we must be careful about using our brains to predict the future."  "In this book, Darwin tells how our evolutionary history reflects an inherent imperfection in the genetic code. This flaw allows evolution to take place, but it makes the results unpredictable." "The authors point out that evolution, although wonderful, is not inevitable." "Darwin's own work is riddled with error."  I love a book that explains how to explain things and how to see the world.  A lot of the things that are interesting about this book are that it's really about how we should be more like a biologist and not be so sure that we can explain everything in the same way.  One reason Darwin has been so successful is because of how open and honest he was about his mistakes.  It's also nice to see a scientist actually acknowledging that they are human and that the world is not the same as they expected and that we might not be perfect.  You can't just explain the world that way. But you can go back to your original idea about how everything happened and you could do it.  In another review by this author: "Darwin doesn't
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a book that just never quite clicked for me.   The first half (when the protagonist is in her dorm room and trying to cope with the death of her mother) is great - but then the plot just goes downhill from there.  A lot of the scenes are slow and tedious, and it's really hard to care about a story that's just going nowhere.  The characters are shallow and cliched (like everyone else in this series - although this was a good thing, since the characters were all so great).  I don't even think she really cared about her mom, but her dad was a jerk anyway.  I was expecting her to be more powerful as the series progressed.  This book was really just a set-up for a better book - I'm sure the author just kept it under wraps because it was really good and I wanted more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Read full review The Best Ever Death Metal album:      The album of the same name is one of the most highly praised and influential albums ever released by a death metal band. The reason for that is not only the high standards, the technical skills, and the incredible songwriting that makes it one of our all time favorite albums, but also the lyrical content. You can listen to the album and listen to it as a whole, and it's not as amazing as the song "Walking on a Dream" where we discuss that song's songwriting and writing and the whole album. In the song, singer K.T.O. and guitarist K.O are discussing a dream they've had. The dream is a nightmare, a vision where they are drowning in black and red water. The vision is accompanied by screaming as they have a heart attack and go into a coma. The band then wakes up in the hospital, where they see a man who has saved their lives with his hand and bandages. The man looks a lot like Ozzy Osbourne. They see him in the dream and tell him they're fine and their heart attack is probably just a side effect of the drug. The rest of the song is a discussion about the possibility of a real life Ozzy being so close to them that they can talk about the dreams, and how they could save him if they were in their own dream.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not sure if this book deserves the rave reviews I see. I bought it because I was looking for something new, something that wasn't on my Amazon cart right now, so I figured, "why not?" When it arrived, I was confused when I opened the book and saw a book with a yellow cover. Then I went into the book, and it just didn't feel right. It reminded me of when I went to my first book sale. The covers are so glossy, but the books themselves feel cheap. There are so many pictures in this book, but they are very small and do not capture the picture that the author hopes they do. I found myself constantly flipping through it hoping that I could find the words I wanted to read about this story. The story is about a high school teacher, who becomes the first black female in a small town. Unfortunately, she gets into a big mess of issues that have nothing to do with her race. The main character, Ms. B, is very well written. She is honest, she is compassionate, she has her own faults and struggles, but she is also very open minded. The ending is a bit of a surprise, but I have to say it was a nice surprise. For those of you that have read this book before, I do recommend it. It has many good things about it, and is worth picking up if you like this type of book.

I got tired of reading a story about how I was a good girl and how nice I was. I'm sorry, but I want a little more from this story. I hope that at some point, we find out more about the girl that was so nice to be around. I wish the girl had more personality. I don  This is such an important book to read for girls.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favourite character is a woman who has lost her sense of humor and is constantly in need of the help of a psychiatrist - who she has seen in the past. The main problem is that the psychiatrist (I hate using "doctor" in this genre to refer to a fictional character) is a moronic psycho with a rather twisted idea about therapy. He has no understanding of human psychology - yet he tries to help her. The entire thing is really a mess. It would be one thing if the character was a psycho (which they are not, although they do exhibit signs of psychosis), but that does not make this a good book. It is a bit disappointing that this book didn't do better in the editing department, but at least it is no longer on my bookshelf. If you are looking for a good story about a psychotic doctor with a strange idea of therapy, you have been warned. (review of free book)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ...   You should not have to go to another book to find out the difference between "in love with the wrong person" and "in loving the wrong people." It's pretty easy. One is to love the person who deserves your love. The other is to have no feelings for anyone, especially someone who's not actually in love with you. If it's the person you can't get, do not marry them. If they're in the wrong place, leave. If you are in the right place, you will be more than happy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was surprised to learn this is a children's book (as opposed to a more adultish adult book like Mr. Burns' "The Proclaimers"), as I hadn't heard of it, and was disappointed with the tone and content. It is filled with words, but the vocabulary used doesn't reflect that--it sounds like kids were speaking their mind, and I'm not sure how to take this. There are a few "fruits" mentioned (a banana is a good one), but the description only says that they are "dinner" and "snacks" with "a pinch of salt." I found them somewhat offputting--inappropriate for a childrens' book. The characters were likable, though. I liked the picture of the dog (whose name I forget), and thought the dog was just adorable. The story was cute, but I didn't like that it was short.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the premise for the story to be very implausible and unrealistic at points. The main protagonist was an incredibly stupid character. She had a number of flaws which caused her to fall apart and eventually get killed by a demon that she let get out of his cage. The demon was more than a little over the top and, although I am a sucker for a good monster story, it is almost impossible to care about a character like this.

There were only a couple of very brief moments of possibility that made me feel suspense.  So for all that I loved the first book, it's an abysmal waste of time. Recommendation:  Avoid.

I'm sorry, but this book is the most disgusting, disturbing thing I have ever read in my life. This book has to be the worst and most disgusting thing I've read in this entire year. I couldn't stop laughing. It wasn't even funny anymore. It was so horrible. I almost felt like I should be sick, but I couldn:t stop laughing about it. The writing and the voice are awful. The story is so badly written. It's awful. I hope this book won't have any appeal in anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book is one which we are compelled to avoid, because our judgment is compromised by a weak subject matter or a bad narrative, or the lack of quality writing or bad characters.   These are just a few examples.  The worst offenders are the ones we like, the ones whose badness seems to be justified by their quality (see "The Great Books" by the late, great C.S. Lewis ).   This is where my favorite reviewers are like, "Yeah, but I don't read these things, I'm not a literary snob," so to be fair I should say that the worst offenders have done this to me too, a few times.  But then again, it's hard to resist an excellent book when we are in love with it.  You're likely to be swayed, but the thing to understand about your favorite book is that it's your favorite.  So if a book doesn't meet your expectations, you don't have to give it a bad review.  We read a lot of good books.  We've read the classics, the best sellers, the latest best sellers. We read books that are both good and bad.  And we read books about books. It's not fair to say, as a writer, "This book doesn`t measure up."   And it's not a bad thing to acknowledge that. It makes you more aware of what you are really trying to say about the story and the characters, about the ideas and the literary principles that inform them. It is, at its heart, a story about reading.  If it isn't, then the book isn't really about reading, is it?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I am reading a series of books that were written as children's books. I am sorry, but this series has a very bad beginning, the book doesn't seem to have a direction. The beginning is confusing, I found it hard to believe that I am about to read a book about people who eat spiders.   The book ends without any resolution.   My thoughts on this book: This is the worst book I have ever read. It is poorly written and I have difficulty believing that anyone would be able to find a story. I would not recommend this book at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I enjoyed it but I couldn't get into the story." I can understand this one. I can't read very much science fiction but I enjoyed this story. It was a fun story and I liked the action in the story. This book had a few flaws. The first was the cover was terrible. I was expecting something more attractive and interesting. The second was that the ending seemed rushed and was not believable. The third and fourth were that the author seemed to be trying to write about the war in Korea but there wasn't enough information about the Korean peninsula. It's a complicated story to tell. Overall the story had some great action but it was a little rushed, lacked enough info to be believable and was a bit over the top in its excitement. Overall a great story about a girl who gets involved in the war and how it affects her, but the ending felt rushed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read several "How to be a Good Student" books by people with no relevant experience in education. The books are full of advice about how to get better grades, but no mention of how to be an ethical student.   The advice for taking advantage of free education is always positive.  But in the section on ethics, the authors provide no practical advice about who to trust:  "I recommend you ask yourself these questions about the people at your school and about the institutions you work for."   What questions about these people or institutions?   One problem is that the people the authors advise are the institutions they work for.  And institutions do tend to make decisions that favor their own interests.  For example,  the decision of some schools not to hire African-American teachers is based on the fear that blacks are not learning. This is not an argument against hiring more blacks--it's an argument for hiring the best teacher available.  The authors do not address this question about who gets hired.  In addition, it is obvious that any book about taking advantage " of free" education has to have something to do with  paying   students to read "for free."  This is the entire book.  How to be the best student is not about doing anything useful in school--it is about making sure you get good grades.  I would have given this book a 3 star rating had I read the beginning and the last chapters.     My only criticism is that it takes a long time to get through.  At over 500 pages, it makes it a chore to read and a chore for my family to read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am surprised how this book compares to my other books.    I really liked the first book (but I loved the first one) and thought it was a good book to start off with.  But in this one I found it to be not only boring and repetitious, but also very dry and boring.  Even though this book is a complete waste of time and it made me feel horrible, at least I read it.  I will admit, I don't get what is going on, and I am confused about who is trying to tell us what is happening and what the main characters are doing.  Also there is no sense of urgency, and it takes the readers time to figure out who is going to stop what or who is doing what. I could have written at least a good synopsis, but there wasn't enough.  The reason that I say it was boring is because it wasn't anything.  It's just a story and you could probably get through it without reading any of the words. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book multiple times, but each time I've found the same thing: it's too long.   After reading it a few times, I realized that this book really needs a shorter edition, but it just seems like it's going on for way too long, so I'm putting it on my list of things to read.   4 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no other way to put it: I was absolutely horrified by the fact that the book didn't include the ending.   I'm still shaking my head at the book.  This book has got to be one of the most upsetting read I've ever had to read, because not only did it seem to be written by a complete idiot (it almost makes me feel like a complete moron), but it's also quite a disjointed read as well.  There is not much to the story, and what is there is all poorly written.  The author did an absolutely bad job, and that has always been one of my pet peeves with writers.  One thing I love about this book is the fact the story takes place over time.  It's a fairly fast paced story, but still it was difficult to get my head around all of the characters.  Even when the story got to the part where the story focuses on the main character, I still couldn't understand what happened to her.  That was the only point where the book actually became interesting to me.  Overall, this is a book I will not be recommending to anyone.  At all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     In case there was ever a need for a reason to read a review by a book reviewer.   If you're reading the book (a) to write a review, (b) to read the book, (c) to see the book in a bookstore. Or if you're just reading the review.   and (d) to say that the book was "good."   Don't do either, because if you do, you're a bad reviewer. Read a book because it's good, not because the book says so.  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You can learn a lot by going into books. You might discover a book, like this one, is not good, or not really good, but maybe you can still enjoy the experience of having read it.   You can learn more about some of the things I have found:  I'm not sure if a single author in this book is really an author. The author is a fictional character. There are two characters named the 'Man' in the book. One is named The Woman. Neither of these characters is a real person. The first thing that the author tells us in the first chapter is "The Man is an adult, a middle-aged man, who works for a company that specializes in the sale and maintenance of special electronic appliances." The 'Man's' name, which seems to change so many times, and the company in which the Man works don't sound like real companies, either. The 'Woman' is a middle aged woman, who tells the'men' (i.e. the book's fictional characters) to stop having sex with one another. So the two characters are neither real, nor are they characters of real people. The book takes itself too seriously.  I had read many books like this before, but this one is the first I had had a problem with. The last two books I have had problems with have had real problems, but not at all this book does. The story is a collection of the author's personal thoughts and opinions about various subjects, such as a book called The Man Who Wasn't There.  The stories and the characters aren't very interesting, but there isn't too much to say, either, so you will not really be upset by what is happening.  It's worth it only if you think the author is really crazy.  You probably shouldn't read this book unless you know about people in the military, and you know that the United States military is not the least bit interested in being involved in anything to do with aliens, UFOs, or paranormal phenomena.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The second book in the "Easter" trilogy is my least favorite of all of the books in this series. The first book was my favorite, though. The writing was good but lacked energy, and the plot was a little slow. This book is almost a complete rip-off of the first, with more of the same stuff from the first book. There are lots of references and lots of similarities in the two books but there are also a lot of changes from the last book. The book starts with the "first encounter" and how the wizard, Harry Potter, came to know that there is a wizard in the world who is capable of destroying Voldemort. It then takes us through the rest of the book. This is the first one where the wizard doesn't have to be evil. He is not "good" but a person who is in love with his son and has his son murdered by a Death Eater. We are also introduced to a few more wizards who are in love and can destroy Voldemort (who is now back with his family). In this book the wizard who is evil is the Dark Lord Voldemort who has been defeated. The second one features Harry's "friend" Ron who is now a "sorceress". The story doesn't start like this book, where it is all new characters and new places. The two main characters have different starting points and it is really hard to put down. We still don't know what is going to happen but it is better to read the first two books before we read the third because this book is pretty good. The next book in this trilogy is called "Ender's Game". I do like this one but it has a lot in common with the first "Egg" in that we have two main character, "Esmerelda" and her brother "Eneas", both of whom are in a rebellion against the wizarding government (and the whole British Royal family, of course). They are both good-hearted, and they are both in love, but neither is happy with their choices. Ender's Game is good and I think I will like it as well, but I haven't finished reading the third book yet. I'm hoping that I will finish it soon because it is quite good and the ending is pretty great, but it also had a lot to do with the ending of "The Golden Compass". The "Golden Compass" is a book about a girl who travels back in time. The girl goes
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was just one chapter, and it seemed to me that the first person to write a negative post about a book will be one who has not read the book.  I thought I would do that for this book.   I didn't like the first chapters.   I don't like to read a story from the first character's POV, but this book seems to be taking the same route as so many romance books, and I'm just not impressed.  First of all, this book starts with this : I think that's an excellent title.    "The Girl on the Train" is not an excellent book.   The opening chapter introduces the main characters and the setting, but it doesn't really tell us much.  We don't know much about the characters, and the first chapter is pretty light.  It is a great beginning, but I feel that the entire book would be better if it had more information.  This is what is confusing to me about this book, because the first few pages were very good.   Then it takes a turn that is not good.  The first couple of pages are good, but they go downhill from there.  I thought this book would have given the reader a nice introduction.  After the opening paragraph, I felt like this book is going in a direction that is completely uninteresting.  Second, the book doesn't do a good job at keeping the reader engaged.  It is very slow going, but that isn't a good thing.   It's as if I was reading a book that was written by a robot.  The chapters seem to be about one thing: the characters are reacting to events in a story, and none of the events are relevant to the plot.  Every time a character says something they say it in a completely meaningless way.   After reading one chapter I thought "What the hell is this?"  This seems like a bad way to read books.  Again, the opening chapters do a really good job with introducing the setting.   They don't waste any words telling us anything.  But then things slow down and go downhill.  That isn't the best way to go about telling a story.   This book, by the way, is about a woman and her relationship with a man she is having an affair with.   We don;t really get to know what they are up to.   The author doesn't seem to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I finished this novel this morning, and I have to say, it was a rough read. Not in the way it was meant to be rough, or unpleasant. It was just a bad read. I have a history with the genre, and this is not a bad one, but the whole premise of it was bad. I felt like I was watching a movie, and as such, I was not enjoying myself.   The protagonist in this story is a man named Max, and he is from a country where the king is the supreme leader and has an army of one hundred thousand men. He is the son of the king and is just an average kid. He has a good job and makes good money. As he is driving back to his parents' house, there is a large army on the way to take over. This is bad news, because he is very close to his father, and his father wants him dead because he has told the king about Max and his friends. The king is angry, and a war breaks out.   of course this is very typical, you have your good guys vs your bad guys, and in this case it is an army with one hundred and fifty thousand men against an army one hundred million strong, with tanks, jets and fighter aircraft and ships.   The king, having a massive army, starts his attack. This causes a lot of destruction and collateral damage. Many civilians are killed. The only things that Max thinks of when he is faced with death are his friends, and how he wants to see them again. He knows he has a problem. He talks to a man in his home town, who is the leader of the opposition. The leader thinks Max is a nut job and wants him put in jail. Max agrees to go and get some things to get him out of jail. He then goes to the prison to get some supplies and meets a prisoner named Charlie, who seems to be a bit of a pacifist. Charlie is a tough guy and tries to kill Max with a baseball bat when he finds him. The problem is that Max doesn't have any weapons, because the prison won't allow weapons in the prisons. He goes to get the weapons from a guy on the outside and gets them from him. He also meets the leader again, who was the prisoner Charlie talked to earlier, and is willing to go to war with the king if the king will send soldiers to kill everyone in the country. The plot thick
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "   Good:      • A great introduction to philosophy that focuses on the central ideas of Descartes.  A thorough, readable explanation of DesCartes' arguments that is both challenging and exciting.   • Provides many historical examples of philosophers who came from being very religious to being very secular and a great account of why this happened.  "   Bad:  "    I feel this book has a lot of potential, but the writing style and writing style of the authors is not always great.  It seems like it was written as a work of criticism rather than a history."   This book is not a good introduction to Descartesian philosophy and may not be the most interesting book about the topic (although if you are into Descarte, you should probably buy it).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not your everyday story. If you like fantasy books that are different and not like your usual series, then you will like this book. I know this is an American review. And yes, there is some nudity in this book, though not in the main story line and not so bad it was distracting. I could get away with some nudity, but I also liked the story line.   This book will take you into another dimension. A new kind of world. The author writes well and his story line is interesting. You will be hooked after just a few pages of this story.  .  - The characters are amazing:  The author does not take himself too seriously in this story, or at least not too much. I felt that the author is writing a fantasy series not to just make money, but for himself and for his readers.    - The author wrote an interesting character:  I feel that this story is the first part of a series. And so the story is not about a hero. But it still is very interesting. I am not sure how the author will continue with this series, but it is not a waste to read the next one.  .  4 of 4 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    That doesn't mean they can't still be good books! I like to read some of these books I'm not fond of and I think some of the reviews are fair, but I don't feel like a bad person reading one of these.   My first "bad book" was an old book I picked up in my teenage years. I couldn't understand how anyone can read it and love it.  The main character of the book was a young boy. I read that book to my daughter when I was about 14. She said she found it to be too scary for her but I know it turned out I was totally wrong.  The main character was just such a jerk and a loser. This book was so bad I really couldn't believe it was even published. The main characters got to be the hero and the girl was just the side character that everyone was so mean to.  My dad also hated this book because it turned him on to the idea of a boy and a girl having sex. He read the book on his drive home from work when I told him about it because he was still horny.  I read the same book to both of my daughters when they were toddlers. Both of them had a problem with it and ended up turning the book down.  It wasn't a book they loved but it was the first book they had and didn't want to repeat it. If you love any of these you need to read the reviews first and decide if you want to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is very much like the rest of the series. There's not enough tension, and there's no depth to the characters either.   I found it to be a very dull and simple read.   The main character is extremely well written, but she doesn't do much in the story other than complain. She is, however, a nice person, and is good friends with the female lead. She feels that the female character is the problem in this book, and that the author is ignoring them. I couldn't agree more. The female character didn't do well in this story, and the male one did little. There were moments when they did something together, but it was so quick and so short that it felt like it was just a setup to a bigger fight scene, rather than anything else. The ending was also just, well, terrible. The male hero finally gets the girl, but the ending just completely ignores that. The heroine's sister died in the beginning of the story, but in the end, she's gone. I really hate the way that the story ended. It feels forced.   I felt the same way when I read "The Secret Life of Bees" by K.J. Parker. This book doesn't help it's reputation though. I read it as a YA book to introduce children to science. I liked it, but I didn't like it. It doesn't feel like a proper YA novel. The plot is very vague, there's not much going on, and it's too long and not exciting at all. The characters are also too two-dimensional.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When this book was released I was immediately interested. The author is a talented writer and the idea of a book about a vampire was interesting. However the story line was boring and the book got a very low rating in my opinion. The main story line (for the first 60 pages) had me interested but the second story line had me really confused.   One major point about the book was the characters. The characters have a great deal of character development but the plotline was very slow and boring.  As for a positive, I'm glad that the author decided to write a novel for young adults and not a movie.  " You can't say I haven't tried"   I didn't enjoy this book very much. I understand that this is the only book for young adult readers but I did not think it was very good.  For me this was a one and done story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character, Peter P. is a teenager and the main character's mom is crazy.   So I thought, if you want to go into that world, this is going to be easy.  So he gets sucked into a crazy house with crazy people and it's like, wait, it's a good idea to be crazy? I had so many questions about why he did what he did, why he got sucked into this world, and why she was so crazy?   But when it comes to actually trying to figure it out, it takes forever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were a few parts I thought were badly written, but overall, this was a really fun read and one I will definitely recommend to everyone.   I love this one. I'm a huge fan of old school literature and especially the fantasy genre. And I really think that is where this book shines. I think the writing style is really good and the way it was done really brought the book to life. I really enjoyed this one a lot. I loved the story, I enjoyed the characters, and I enjoyed how the fantasy element was handled.

Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book is a great example of what happens when the writer has no real knowledge of the subject matter, and just pretends it's "real" science. There are very few people who truly understand what a "microchip" is. It's not as simple as all that - there are several sub-tendencies and sub-sub-subordinates involved.   As to the book's purpose and its title, this is not a book about the Microchip. The book is not about the "microchips" (the ones in your phone and on your car key, for instance), but about the other electronics, particularly that of a computer. The title "Microchips: Why they're the future of computers and why you shouldn't care" is completely misdirected and misleading. The entire book should be called "The Future of Computers: The Microchip" (instead of the book about microchips), because the most interesting and important part is not the microchip but the microcomputer (the microcomputer is what the chips are for).  The microchipped computers are not that much different from the computers of a decade or two ago (which the book discusses). If the author had paid any attention to the real science, he would know that the microchip computers are still in the very early days of development (like the early days, it took the author half a decade to complete the book). The microchiptle computers are really "smart" computers (which are computer systems that can be "possessed" by computers, the "computer spirit"). They are the equivalent of a television that can "view" a set on TV (it can "hear" that set, even though the set itself can't be seen). The "smart computer" is the computer that can learn what it can see in the TV sets "picture" system, which can learn the "lines" that represent the program instructions in the television programs, and learn to execute those instructions (similar to how a computer can learn to read a book it is reading by itself). There are some microchip computers that are almost completely controlled by software. They don't have a microchip (but the microprocessor is still there) and they don't use a computer system like a TV.  These microchip-based computers are based on an extremely sophisticated programming language called "C" that is very powerful. (See the "About
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to hear about this book that I decided to get the hard copy off a friend's bookshelf and read it this evening. I thought it was pretty decent and not as bad as the blurb said, although some of the book was a little confusing. It is a really good book about growing up as a transgendered person. It was really good to see a non-transgendered friend read this book. I think I'll just do some online research before I try to actually find the book in question and read the summary, but I would certainly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It's really good." "It's bad." "Meh." It's just bad. It's like if you wrote a book about a group of kids at a Catholic school and had them start arguing with each other, and you just wrote the book like you were talking to kids in a bar. If you want to talk about the story, it's fine. But this is not a good book. This is a book that is terrible and horrible and horrible. If a story is supposed to be fun, this is the worst book I have ever read. I know there are other books that are terrible, and I'm sure there are lots of good books, but this is bad and terrible. Not the fun kind of bad, the kind that is awful and horrible, but the kind you read and get a sense of disgust. It does nothing but make me hate this book more.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I could give this book 3 stars, I would. It is an excellent story and has a great conclusion, but I felt that the ending was rushed and not as satisfying as some of the previous books.   This book was recommended to me by a friend. I was a little nervous and concerned about reading the book. The cover looked familiar but I did not look it up. The book was free and I just got it because I was curious. I read the first chapter, then skipped to the end and it was just a bit disappointing. I'm glad I read it though because the book was not really bad. The characters were interesting, the writing was excellent and the story was a great adventure.   The author did a good job of showing the emotions that would have been felt by the characters. The story and the characters were a good blend of suspense and fun.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's so good that it's unbearable.   The story is amazing:  I wish I could find the time to read this series, but with the two shows (this one and Black Butler) airing at the same time, I only managed to watch one. And I enjoyed it. The plot is very well written: the story takes place in a fantasy world where women are not treated fairly, women aren't considered as equals, but instead as servants. I find the story to be interesting: one of the main characters has a very interesting and well written backstory. I don't really care much for the main heroine of the story, but the other female characters are rather interesting and have interesting backstories. One minor annoyance I had was that the story didn't seem to progress, although I'm not sure if this was my fault or a result of my not watching the second season.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love it, and I do think the book is a step up from the old stuff. But it's just so frustrating. I get so frustrated reading it. I don't understand a lot of the characters, even their backstory, and it doesn't seem to connect to anything I've read in the other books. Also, it has the same thing with the villains as well. It's so hard to figure out who is who and why they are doing what they are. I wish I could give a 4 but the book just doesn't make any sense and has a bunch of things that just don't make sense. I'm not the most well read person, and even though I've been reading fantasy since I was in middle school and this is only my second book in it, it's a really hard read, especially with so many characters that don't even have names. I have to read them at least twice. I read this book the night before I went to bed. I wish it were shorter and more focused. But I can't recommend it because I have never bought a book and had so much trouble with it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What was so great about the book was that I felt I had heard everything that had to be heard. This is one of those books where you can't stop thinking about it. I liked this book a lot, but there are a couple of small flaws in it. The main character is just a little too much like a teenager. I don't know why there were so many adult stories in high school, but maybe they need to get more creative. I guess that's the main reason why my son and I read it together. And while the ending was a nice little conclusion to an amazing book, I did feel the need to read some of the other books that this book is set in.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't care for this book at all and was left disappointed after reading.   My family and I were excited to read this book after hearing about it for months but it didn't meet our expectations.  We had no problem with the characters and setting so the problems come from the writing.    The story was hard to follow and had us waiting for the end to see if the author was going to wrap up this story or if we would have to wait another few books to see what happens next.  I think this book should have been a trilogy but the author felt like he could just go on from one book to the next and that's not good writing and I wouldn't want to read a book like that.  Overall I would recommend this book to someone if you are looking for a hard sci-fi novel that will keep you reading. I have a hard time with science fiction authors and I don't even know why.  We all think we know why there is a problem with science fictional authors.  We all agree that there isn't enough female representation in science fiction and fantasy and there is no space for people of color in sci-fic.  No one knows the answer to why there are no women and people of colors in science fictions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a decent story, but it's basically a book for kids, with the occasional adult in the mix. I liked it enough to be interested enough to read it, but I wouldn't recommend it to most adults. If you can find a way to get through it, it's a decent book, but if you can't, it doesn't give any real clues as to what you are missing out on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first couple of pages, which was ok, and found the dialogue rather strange, but then the plot just started to lose me. In one point the characters are discussing a murder, with the detective explaining that the murderer's DNA is only found in one of the victim's eyes. This was a very interesting idea, but the character in question was a completely lame one, one that the characters did not find particularly convincing, to put it mildly. The detective's explanations were even more annoying than his character, and this scene alone was enough to make me give up on the book, not because the plot was bad, but because the dialogue just turned me off so much.I think my biggest problem with this book was that I kept reading, but I found myself getting bored. And not once did I find myself thinking to myself "Man, that was interesting!" I felt like there was nothing interesting about it, and that the plot got in the way of the story. I would have loved to see what could have been the result of this particular murder, because as far as the characters go, they seemed pretty well written, and I'm not a huge fan of the character of the "devil in the story." In the end, I found this book to be too "interesting" to stick around for any more pages, and it didn't seem like I'd be able to get any better out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As soon as I finished reading this book I realized that it was NOT the book I was looking for.

I thought it was very well written and was very curious about the characters and events. After I finished I was very disappointed. There was a lot of romance but it didn't seem to me to come together into a satisfying story. I would not recommend this book, as I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It took me longer than I wanted to wait for this book to get here.   I bought a copy on recommendation from a friend who said the author was good (and who said I was wrong)." "I can't give this book three stars, as this is a very uneven read that is riddled with inaccuracies.    This book is a compilation of letters that are all the same, but when they are combined they make a story of its own that is not only boring but a complete waste of time.  It seems as though the author used an editing program to put the letters together, rather than putting them in chronological order.  So for example, there is a letter by Mr. O'Reilly to Mrs. Prentice from November 25, 1873 that was not included in the book, but Mrs. O,Reilly's letter to her friend in 1875, and a letter from Mr. P. F. H. O to his son in 1877 that were also not included.  This is not a fault of the book; it's the result of a horrible editor, and the result is a book that does not fit the letter from one friend to another, which is so essential to the story.  In fact, when you combine all the letters, they form a fairly good narrative of an early life in Canada that is fascinating.  But the fact remains that the story could have been told better with better organization and an editor with better ideas of how to do this.  If only there was someone who could have edited this book with less bias, and better grammar.  There's too much grammatical error here and there that makes one wonder how Mr. Beddoe was able to use a grammar program, because his use of grammar in the letters makes no sense whatsoever.  For example, he seems to think that it makes sense that "we were friends" makes sense, when it doesn't; it only makes sense as an adverb.  I have had many friends that I would call friends, but I never called them "friends" at any point in my life because I did not know enough people to consider it a proper pronoun.  He also uses adverbs to tell the story, which I don't think is appropriate when you're telling a story about a friend, but it was necessary in this case because otherwise you'd have no story.  The writing style is very awkward.  Mr.Beddoe seems
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm surprised how many good books I've read and forgotten. I bought this book on a whim because I've had some books I bought a couple years ago that I've been putting off reading. I've not had much luck with this kind of book and was pleasantly surprised with this one. It's well written and easy to follow (even if I am a little too old for a book like this). I have two major issues with this book. First, the cover is quite uninspiring and I will probably put this one on the shelf until a better cover is decided on. Second, I feel that one of the biggest issues was the portrayal of the male character. I have trouble writing a review when I feel like I'm being attacked by an angry mob, but this was certainly too much. I am also a man in a very progressive family and I think his portrayal of a man being more like a "she" than a "he" went too far. It was a little difficult to read as I wanted to like this book and I'm going to have to be extra careful with this and my younger son and make sure he has nothing to do with it. He's only been reading for a few months now but I'm sure he won't be interested in the rest of this series unless I change his mind!  6 of 9 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think I'm going to hate this book because the writing was so bad. I just read this book to see if I liked it. I found myself wondering why it was called "A Girl's Guide to Menstruation." I guess it was for those who really enjoyed it and thought they knew it all, but I didn't. I actually thought I had read this before, but couldn't find it anywhere on the web. I was really surprised, however, when I went to pick this up at the library. I figured I'd go to the library just to find out if it was still out there. When I checked the books out, I found this out: The author and publisher of the book are dead.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a new graduate from this very prestigious college. The university I attended is a wonderful place and I would have never thought it would have been plagued by so many people making their lives a living off of it. Now, I am in my first year and have only just arrived. I am the new girl and was told I was to have a very long and difficult first year here. Well, I'm here and I am here to learn. However, one of the first things I noticed is that the professor who had been a good mentor for me is no longer here to help me. He is out of town and my new professor is very cold and unsympathetic. I can't take his bad advice. He said that if I wasn't a good reader, I would get a D and I got a D. I told him to go back to school, but I really don't understand what I can do to help myself. I don't know what to read and I have no money. It's very sad. Please advise. Thank you.  Reviewer: a.m.d. from California, USA. January 10, 2016  Subject: A Poor Choice "What a waste of time. I'm not sure I can use my degree. I used to have to do all my coursework during a class period in a nearby college. Now my class is in the morning and my class time is not covered by a class schedule."  The professors (I'm guessing they are all in the same program) are all over the place in class time, giving their views, etc., without explanation. I have also seen that the library has so many things that are not in my catalog. They have to get it from the administration in the afternoon, which takes away the first class period I have to start with class at noon. It seems that they have a habit of rushing it through rather than spending the time to explain and explain. I think the course work I've taken so far has not been as good as I would've liked, and I'll be returning to my old college. The online college I have been using does not have as many of the problems that I have encountered. The online courses are very clear on what they are asking, the online resources are much more comprehensive, and you can get all the things you need to study for your classes without a problem. The website is a great resource to learn more. My advice is to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because it was recommended to me. I love the series and have been eagerly awaiting the next novel. The writing style is easy and not overly descriptive, the story was a little long, and the plot was not the most original. However, I enjoyed the book and the characters and will likely keep the series in my collection. The only downfall is the length of the book. In addition, I only read part of the novel in one sitting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A friend and I both enjoyed the book. But then the narrator got off on "I've been so good to me.   " So bad. " I could barely get past page two (there is some very strong language in this book but if you're going to use a lot of it you can at least do a decent job) and the last 20 pages were just as tedious as the first 20.  If you are looking for a decent read for children or teens this book is not for you!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to love this book, and I do, in a lot of ways. However, I do not believe that there are any characters that are deep or interesting. There are, however, some great scenes, and a lot more action in the second half of the book. I have seen a lot that I liked in other people's books, but this wasn't it, in my opinion. I would like to see more of her character, and to see how they will be changed by this horrible event that happened to them. The setting could have been more interesting as well. It's set in London, so there could be more on that. I wouldn't mind getting this book if it is a trilogy, but it will be a bit pricey as I've heard about the price increase that Penguin is pushing through their stores.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the epitome of bad book. The plot is awful; the characters are flat, and the story is just a terrible mess. I can't recommend this book and I never wanted to. It's just not worth the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you read only one book on the topics covered here, you may need to start by reading the  Wikipedia article on The Art of Language.  This blog will continue to post a book each week that addresses this topic, but if you don't want to wade through the entire Wikipedia page you can skip right to  The Art Of Language (1922). The book has been revised and expanded several times since its initial publication in 1923 (see below). There are several interesting aspects of the book which will be covered in this post: The first section, "The Way of the Tongue", begins with a discussion of the ways in which a man can be more persuasive when speaking in the vernacular.   It discusses the concept of "tongue" in many ways, including using the tongue to tell what you think and feeling an appropriate amount of pain in the tongue when you "break" it.  The second section, entitled "The Art of Translation", covers the use of "translators" such as translators who "take the trouble to learn the language in which they are engaged".   This is often a useful exercise to practice in conversations between two native speakers.  These chapters include the topics of how to construct a proper sentence, how to express emotion, how an idiomatic expression works, etc.  It includes a great discussion on how to say "sorry" with a proper use of the English "sorry".   The third chapter, "In Which to Know a Good Book", addresses many more topics in linguistics and includes a good example of how a text is transformed into an effective translation.  If the book is not available in your language or if you prefer to read the original, I have translated the entire book (see  this site ) and included the original translation of each chapter (in Japanese and in English). The author himself was a master of Japanese and English, and is said to have been the first to translate any book into these languages.  I have used this translation and have found it to be very useful in my efforts to learn Japanese.  This book is a must for anyone who desires to learn about the art of communicating in different languages and cultures.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a disaster from start to finish.    I don't think I've ever written a negative book review about another book.  This book is so poorly written, I really have no idea what to say.  All the plot and action lines are horribly cliched and boring, the characters are stereotypical and bland, and there are too many times where the author tried to put a good-natured, but lame plot device in the middle of a really bad story.  I also had to wonder why he was so focused on this creepy, creepy, scary old guy and not on the rest of the people involved.  There are so many plot devices that don't work out that it is really hard to care about any of the characters.  So why does this book have such low rating on Goodreads?  This review is purely from my perspective, and not the author's (which I can't read since I'm a poor, underprivileged, ignorant, and stupid person).  I am hoping that I am wrong and that this author will produce a much better book in the future (I'm starting to think he is not really that great at writing, because that book was just a disaster), but I think that we all know what is going to happen next time...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For me, "What Happens If" is a very personal book, and therefore, a very painful one to write. The whole book is an account of my relationship with a dear friend of mine, and with my own son, after I had adopted my own child. "What's Happening If" was the first book I ever wrote with her, and it is one of the many ways in which I learned to write and how I learned how to write a book with anyone, even one as dear as I was to my friend. "What Happening if" began as an exercise in empathy. I was trying to imagine the child I had become for her, the way she felt about herself, the sense of guilt she felt every time she let a baby out of her arms, the terror she felt when someone touched her. As I wrote and rewrote it, I found that the empathy was not working, and I became increasingly angry. Why was this not the best way to be with someone? I asked myself a lot of questions. When you feel so close to someone, why are you doing so many things that harm? Why aren't you more loving? I have no answer to these questions, and so I tried to write "What if" as a way of finally asking myself the questions I had been trying to ask myself for years. I wrote it in a way that would make me feel more comfortable with the question of how and why to write things in my own way, how and where to write about the things that were troubling me. That's what "What happens if" is for me. When I look at the pages of my first draft, I feel like the person I wanted to be when I was younger. At one point, I write about how I can't imagine ever finding another woman who can be as close to me as my sister. " What Happens if " is my attempt to answer my friend's question. This book is my way of answering it: by writing about what happens when people who love one another are torn apart. *The first paragraph is a reference to a poem by T.S. Eliot, which appears in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I'm going to miss the old version.   The characters are shallow and self serving.  They need to be in their real world or else why would you want to read their stories?   This book was just to make the kids who were already reading Harry Potter feel good about themselves.  It was a bit of a waste of time and the characters are really annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first 10 to 15 pages of this book are pretty darned interesting. After that the book is nothing but an endless series of character introductions and a series of vague, irrelevant and occasionally boring descriptions of the people involved.   This was the point of the book - and the problem with books like this - is that if they were as good as their author claims they are, they would be full of characters that were interesting and developed.  But this is a book by a writer that has written dozens of books and is clearly not very good.  I've read a lot of books by the same author, and they are always better than this one.  The plot is so simple it's a wonder there isn't some sort of twist at the end (I was just about to go out and buy the next book in the series).  The book is so full of details that I can't even tell you about them.  Even the title of the author's last book is mentioned in the book as something that "shines like the sun".  At the end of the day I think the characters are just that shallow - and most of the time I'm just as bored as I was when I started reading.  The author says that " I wrote it as an homage to all those who fought against the Soviets" - as a response to those who fight against evil, and to the author.  For one thing the author was involved in the Cold War for over 20 years, so he knows something about the Soviet Union and its leader.  One thing I find interesting is that the author is a former intelligence agent, but that didn't help this book any.  This book isn't a classic because it doesn't write the perfect spy book, but it is still an extremely interesting book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *   The book starts with a picture of a man with a face like a cartoon face (I mean, come on), so this one could have been funny, but it didn't work.  The first half of the book is mostly about the man having an accident while driving. The accident is explained in an interesting way, but what really bothered me about it was that it was totally unnecessary.  Why did the author think that the man's wife would be happy with an explanation of what the man did in his car?  I mean, maybe the wife would.  But the husband wasn't even in the car!   So he's not even mentioned at all!     In the end, the book ended up being really annoying.  I really don't understand the plot, but the writing was too bad to get along with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this series and this book.   It's the second book of a series, and I liked it. I would read more. I also liked it better than the other book in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book was very hard to read and it is very hard for a reviewer to read a bad review." This was an honest review. The worst part of this book was the title: The Case for the Existence of God is not the actual thesis of the book. It is rather a collection of thoughts, anecdotes, and generalizations, along with many quotes and paraphrased thoughts from the author. The Case For the Existent God: A Philosophical Essay was written by a philosopher, and the book contains several interesting ideas. However, it is not a systematic argument for the existence of God; rather, it provides a collection and paraphrase of some of the ideas and arguments found in the philosophical literature and popular culture. A philosopher's argument is not an argument for God's existence, but rather an argument in favor of a position and the philosophical arguments supporting the position. In the case of the case for the exisent God, the arguments presented are arguments for a number of different positions: ontological naturalism, theism, and atheism (i.e., no god or other being that is not part of the natural world or natural processes). Thus, the book does provide a number and variety of arguments. Some of the arguments are very good, especially some of their implications, but many of the others are simply good-faith arguments which, as they are usually applied, are not very compelling. The book is divided into six sections. Section I: The Existence and Nature of God The main argument presented in this section is the argument for naturalism from naturalism. It presents the argument in the following way: "Naturalism is a metaphysical position. This metaphysical position states that all objects are metaphysically identical to all other objects, and that there is no significant distinction between a natural object and an accidental object." If we look at this section, we will find several important ideas. Naturalism is not simply a philosophy of the cosmos, but a philosophy that includes everything (including the human mind), including the human being. The claim that no substantial difference exists between anything and the objects in the world is often described as a reductio ad absurdum argument. This argument uses the following two premises: The universe is the same in essence (for example, there is something fundamentally the same about all bodies) The universe has a certain essential nature (for instance, the sun has the same essential nature as the earth). The reductively absurd consequence is
Write a negative review about a bad book:     3 of the best in the series.   This book made me feel like I've never read a book like this in my life. I was so excited to read it because I was really looking forward to this series being over. I read this book because of the cover and the synopsis on the back of the book and I had no clue what the synopsis said until I read it and there I saw a character that I knew and liked from the TV show so I knew this book was going to be good. I wasn't expecting much but the writing style was interesting and there was never a dull moment. It just was one of those books that I could only read a few pages at a time because I just loved it so much that I had to read the rest of the books in this series just to make sure I wasn the only one that loved this series like I did. It was just so fun to read and I feel so grateful that I have read it. The best part of it all was I had an opportunity to be introduced to a new character and it was so cool and I would not be the same person if it wasn't for them.  This is the book I read last because I felt like I missed something with the first book that I couldn't really figure out with the second book. I'm happy to say I can finally figure out the mystery of this series but it was a lot of reading to be able to figure out. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes dark, gritty, and violent stories. I know it's hard to get into a series without knowing a lot about it but this book made it worth it. If you don't want to read a series that has a ton of twists and turns I would wait for the third book in the Series so you can read about the twists in the first two books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book, but in all honestly I did not like the first 5 chapters. The second half I liked and was happy to keep reading, but the last 3 chapters I just couldn't finish.   There were things about the world-building I liked but there were things I didn't like about the writing which I can't put my finger on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My mother bought this book about 10 years ago and I love this book.   My mother bought these books about 25 years ago.  Now I have a few and my mother is the only one that has gotten through them all.  I had to get rid of them and this is the next best thing.  There is nothing negative I can say about this book, it is a must read for anyone that reads science fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:         If the book was bad then it would have no point. But it is good, it is entertaining and very interesting but it is very shallow.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It really did get me, and then it got me in ways I wasn't expecting, at least not that I can articulate.   The author writes from his own experience and seems to have made no attempt to disguise this.  He uses "experience" and "realistic" to describe things that in real life, most people will have never experienced.  I found my own real life situations extremely realistic.  The characters are relatable, and the dialogue flows smoothly.  It's just as much about being in a bad mood, and it's almost a "tell it like it is" kind of thing, where the author is trying to convince you he is a good guy who has never done anything wrong.  "If you haven't experienced real life for a while, this is a depressing, self-flagellating read."   There is some realism, but the book is a really bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book, and in the beginning I was very disappointed by it. I read about how the author went from being a young man who liked to study and learn about the sciences, to becoming a religious man, a man who was interested in making things (mostly weapons), then a general and the leader of a unit during WWII, and the author said "The Japanese are a race that has to be defeated by killing all of them, by the most efficient way possible." The book starts off with this and then tells the story of him trying to make weapons, and then killing people in this very efficient way. That wasn't what I was expecting. So, after a few hours of trying to get my head around it, I ended up skipping past all of this and focusing on some other things. There are also many contradictions and other errors in his description of the Japanese and the Japanese attitude. Overall, a very poor book.   For the sake of completeness:  I had also read other books and the majority of them have very similar stories. But, the main one that stands out the most to me was "The Last Samurai". The protagonist is a young Japanese man, whose family is murdered by the American forces. He ends up going through a number of hardships before eventually becoming an honorable samurai, and he kills a lot of people. The only thing I found somewhat different from this one is that the Japanese had less knowledge of technology and so I thought that the weapons used (large swords), would not work well against many American soldiers. However, this is what really set it apart from "The Lone Ranger". "The Book of Five Rings" was also a very good book. It tells a good story of a young samurai, fighting off bandits.  This book did not meet my expectations:  Since then I have read "Tales of the Knights and the Samurai", and have really liked it. That book is full of action, and some action that was rather gratuitous. I found that "The Longest Journey" felt more like a historical piece, which is probably why the author chose to write about a samurai who had been living in Japan for many, many years. This is a good thing, as I can understand why the samurai has a more emotional side to him, as he was raised in such a way. The fact that he was once a general is also very cool. He was well known, and had been the leader for many
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book has three major problems: 1) it is too long, 2) it does not address some very important historical issues of the time, 3) it only has a one dimensional portrayal of the historical figure, which is not very interesting. To me the only thing that is truly good about the book is how well the book lays out the history of the Roman Empire in general, and in particular the times of Tiberius. For that reason I was actually able to understand and appreciate the book overall. However the book falls well short in that regard, and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm really torn about this book because while I really enjoyed it, it also felt a bit rushed. I thought it was going to be a really interesting, thoughtful book, but it didn't have the momentum it should have had. I was looking forward to a really lengthy and detailed discussion of how the world of the "Matrix" and the world as we know it are fundamentally different, but the book was just so rushed. And the way the main character is portrayed seems a bit misogynistic, even though he's not an abusive male and not portrayed as a rapist. I did read the book though, and I enjoyed it a lot, but I'd definitely try it out again in a different context. My one and only recommendation:  This is a great introduction to the world and story. I read this book online. I think I should give the author an extra star if I do that:     When you read a book, you get to know the character's back stories, their backgrounds, their thoughts, and their flaws. But sometimes it is also necessary to tell you how to approach an encounter. Sometimes the best way to deal with a situation is to go for the kill and kill the enemy at the source rather than trying to negotiate with them. Sometimes there is no way to know if a guy's an enemy or not, but to ignore them because you've heard the story before and know he's a scumbag is just idiotic.  There's no need to go into the details of what happened to the characters. I will say that I thought the whole " Matrix " story was great and that the " Matrix  movies are good as well, but you'd be more apt to buy the books from the bookshelves, at least at this point in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of books.   But none so utterly worthless and disappointing as this book.  I'll read any book, but never again, with this one.  Rating:  0.0 Stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - What an amazing story, but I was under the impression that the story was actually about a war, so the details just seemed to fall off the screen. I guess I'm disappointed that there wasn't an actual military operation on this book.  - The world building was just a little disappointing. We only get a taste of what the planet Earth looks like from the perspective of this alien species, and that's it.   I like to think I read the novel the day it came out, not the week before. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I will tell you I am so glad I gave it 4 stars. I am going to try to keep a log of every book I read and it's been about 3 months since I have started. This book took me a long time to read. I would have liked to read this book before I finished the books in the series I was already reading so I could pick up the plot right from the beginning. But I just finished the last book so I don't have that option. I really liked the characters. I enjoyed the twists and turns but it is the character development that made this story interesting to me. I wish I had read this before I started the series, then it would have been more fun to read the previous books in series I already read. The book was confusing and a lot of the characters seemed very silly but then again that is how people think when their life has been upended. I was surprised to see the ending. I can understand it is a happy ending because they can get married and have children, but I was not too happy with it. I think the author had a vision of the world, but she has done such a good job making it seem real it almost felt like a Disney book. If I could write this book it would be way better and have a different ending. It seems the author will have to come up with a new ending to the series to make it unique, but at least we know one ending is coming.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a real disappointment. This book was supposed to be a comprehensive treatment of the issues that plague the church today. Instead, this is one of the worst books on the subject I've come across. I know that these things have been covered in countless books but I just don't get the "theory" presented in this book. This is a book about "the Christian faith" and yet they don't really discuss any of the major issues and the main "progressive" ideas that the "progressives" are most likely after. They just gloss over them as it were. I don't know why I bothered to read this, since I found it very tedious. It just does not really contribute to my understanding of the world of the Christian faith in any substantial way. It really just feels like a piece of a larger puzzle. It is a bit of a waste of time for me and I will definitely be going elsewhere for books on these topics.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the first few chapters, I wasn't impressed with the pacing of the book. The story seemed to be moving too quickly from place to place and I was annoyed that it was all the characters' fault.    This is actually not the case at all.    As the story develops, it gets faster and more dynamic.  The first half of the story is really the beginning of a mystery, a crime.  After the first half, however, things change to a more personal, romantic tale and it's very interesting to follow this story. The book starts off with the main character and the main girl, Tilly, being in a bar with other friends. This gets the author into the mood of writing, but the story isn't finished by the end of the first chapter.  This could be because the story really gets interesting and suspenseful in the second half, when the book starts to get dark and complicated.  The ending could have been better and I really want the author to do better in the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has its good points and its bad points. The book's narrator is a bit awkward at times, but otherwise the book is fun, even if the main character is an idiot.  A Good Thing is a fun and very unique book. The author takes the popular mythological hero archetype and gives it a modern spin by creating a character that is a parody of his modern day counterpart.   I enjoyed this book and it was an enjoyable read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      - This book is not good.   The story, although it was intriguing, was very hard to follow because there was just so much going on and there were just so many characters.  One day it was about an elderly couple that had been together for many, many years but were finally having a very difficult time. It made for a very interesting read but it all kind of faded to the background, and the story really went nowhere with it.  So I just wanted to say, if you are a fan of old time radio shows or you love old time writers, give this a chance, but if you don't enjoy the story, just stick to the more recent books in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I was very impressed by the quality of this book.     In fact, I was so impressed that I decided to have a lot of them.  I have only one complaint to make.  It's about a chapter that's pretty much just a summary of some of the previous chapters.  The problem with this is that it doesn't do much to advance the story, but I don't have a problem with the summary.  It just doesn't work for me as a reader.  There is one chapter after the summaries of previous chapters that was more interesting, but not enough to make up for all the problems.  I have a feeling this is because the author is trying to show that she knows about this subject, but there are too many gaps in the text.  When I first started reading this, I thought I'd give it 3 stars because I liked the overall story, and then after finishing it I went back and reread the entire book because I could never get a handle on the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "It's just a book, isn't it?" is one of the most common responses people have to criticism of a book. I've always known that people think books are like that.   I also know that some people are reading books that they don't enjoy, and just want to shut their minds and walk away.  The best way to deal with such readers is to read books that you really enjoy.  That's why we have literary critics.  And also, read lots and lots of books, especially the kind that you don't usually enjoy. It may not be a bad title, but if you are looking for something a bit more fun, this book might not be it. It's really hard to enjoy something that you are disappointed in, but I thought this was a decent read.  I'm not sure whether the reviewers are saying this because they're just bored, or they just don't like the book, but they are all pretty quick to throw this book into the trashcan and say "it's not that interesting."   But I'm just going to stick with it because I liked it, and I liked a lot about it, which is the same reason I liked the last couple of books I've read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent book that contains much to interest a broad spectrum of readers. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone who likes to read.   I liked this book, even though it was not the best book I've ever read. That still said, it is a good book that is worth reading. The narrator is fine, but not amazing. I think if the author had a better accent, the book might have been better. I like reading in languages other than English; I would have liked to read a book like this in Japanese, French, or Chinese, though, so maybe I would be a better person for reading it. If I had a problem with this book-that it wasn't as good as the narrator thought it was-I could've read it in another language. The ending made me feel disappointed, which I really wasn't expecting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've only ever read one book by T.S. Eliot and the one I remember is The Waste Land. This book has the same effect on me, but without the poetry.   The only good thing I can say about it is that there was a character named K.R. I wasn't sure I liked until later in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        - The title of this book is pretty lame - "The Long Walk"   - This is a great, very well written book by a masterful writer, but as the book is full of plot holes it becomes very frustrating to try to follow the book.   There is NO WAY to explain any of the plots in this book, because we don't even know how the other side of the story will end. The ending is also very weird and not explained by any of it's characters, but instead by the plot itself, which has no rhyme or reason to the events.  "The Long Fall" is a must-read! This is one of my most favorite authors of all time, and one of the best books ever written about the War for Independence and the American Revolution.  A great story that makes up for the flaws by being full of interesting characters and a plot that makes you want to follow it to the end. Read this book for a good time, but also because it is one very long book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was interesting and entertaining at times, but it was also extremely boring.   I found myself bored after about half way, and didn't finish it.  I had been looking forward to the new book by William Gibson (Neuromancer) but this was just not up to snuff.  There were times where I thought it might be worth it to re-read it, but I kept just throwing it away because it was so very repetitive.  As someone who loves old-school cyberpunk, and is looking forward very much to the next book in the series by Gibson, I was disappointed. I wish I could give it a rating of 3 stars and then have someone say "wow! So many ideas!"   It seems as if Gibson is simply continuing what he has done with cyberpunk (Blade Runner and Neuromorta not included).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to this book, because it had been a long time since I had read a book about a man who is on the run from a very powerful family (my mother's family was involved in the mob).  The plot seemed interesting enough: a man's life is turned upside down when he is forced to take on a contract to retrieve a painting, while being hunted by the very people he's supposed to help.  The book ends with the main character finding a new and very expensive painting, which he then decides to sell for some money.  In the beginning of the book, it seems to be a fairly boring read.  This is because the main plot is boring to the point of being uninteresting.  As the story goes on, things start to go downhill.  Although the main story seems to have little to do with art, the fact that it is a story about a young man taking care of a painting has more impact.  After the first three or so chapters, there is no doubt that this is an intricate story about art that will appeal to people who are drawn to history.  However, this is a book that has very little to say about the subject.  It is a straightforward crime novel, without a sense of depth.  Unfortunately, most of the characters seem very one dimensional.  Even though the characters are likable, they do not develop and do not seem to develop as well as their creators.  A number of characters do get a lot of development in the last few chapters, but these characters remain relatively uninteresting to me.  I was a bit disappointed that this book did not delve into any of the historical aspects of the painting.  These are things I was interested in, but the book did nothing to develop the characters or give some sense of history that could have made the story more interesting.  All that remains is a very interesting crime story, but one that has little to offer about the history of art.  Overall, I rate this book a 1.0. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  1 - 3 of 13 Reviews   If there's anything that is true of this book it's that the protagonist was never "real".  The characters were all there, the relationships were strong, the story was well-written and even the characters who seemed the least likeable had good and interesting backstories, but the main character who is, at first, so believable and easy to relate to, turns out to be a complete blank.   So why was I drawn to it?   Well, it was hard to read and I know I wasn't the only one, so maybe I'll just have to put this down and read a more interesting book about someone who was a bit more than I could handle. But I also found it hard to believe that this character would grow and change over the course of a year, especially when the author kept telling us that the main relationship he had was not a real one (and it turns out that the relationship was not even sexual).   Then there's the main conflict and I guess it's also true that it was a little hard to swallow for people who aren't normally into these type of novels, but I was still interested in it because I guess I really liked the way the author dealt with this.  .  In one point, the main protagonist is very sad and he feels hopeless. So he goes for a walk. There he encounters a man in the park who is very interested in him and who makes some pretty creepy gestures towards him, so he decides to talk with him in his favourite book, "L'Age d'Or" (or something like that, I don't really remember it), and they begin to talk and the man says something like, "Well, I'm sorry, I have some questions for you."   The man turns out not to be the man in L'Age (the guy who approaches the protagonist in L'). He's an imaginary person that the narrator made up for the purpose of the novel (the main protagonist had a book about a guy who was the main hero of his youth and was killed in a car crash; he was just some kid in the book who thought he was a real person, and he used the story to explain why he was depressed).   a book that you would never hear about that
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You have to read this book a number of times just to get to know the characters and the story line. It is not a simple story.   But what a nice surprise it was to find out who these characters are!   In the beginning, the book takes a break from the story and takes it's time to give us insight into the characters. Then as it starts to get going, things get a little crazy.  This story has got to be on the list of favorites if you like psychological suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought I was just going to read a nice story about a boy named Noah and his dog and the two make a great team. But when I started to read this book I got a very weird feeling about what was happening and thought I might be reading a book with a really bad message. The story seems to be about the evil corporation, and the "dog" (Noah) trying to save the world from them. But all the evil corporate people try to kill Noah, so they can take his dog away. Then Noah just doesn't feel like being saved so he goes back home and tells his friends he is leaving because he can't save the planet anymore. But he does it anyway. What bothers me the most about this book is the "dogs" are just as much of a part of the story as Noah. They try to do all the things Noah wants them to do. They follow him all over the world and act like they are his best friends, when they are just there to follow orders. The dog actually goes out of his way to get Noah to follow his every order. He is so full of rage he just wants to go and kill them all. They just follow Noah's every command as if they were his personal army. So much for the "bonding" aspect between Noah and the dog! It was really upsetting to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    To my surprise, most of my reviews are positive and that is because most of the positive reviews are also positive about other books by the same author. It's also because I like to read what I like and don't like and as I read other books I realize I don't hate any of them. The thing that I dislike most about this book is the book jacket: it looks like a cheap used copy, it's printed in a terrible font and it's a nightmare to fold. You have to fold it over twice (which is hard when you have a small child) and you have to then carefully put the cover back in the bag to prevent the jacket from falling out. I hate these things.   But all that said, I read this book in one day and even with a small kid this was still a fast read. This story takes place in a small town, New Hampshire and while there is a lot of people in this book, it doesn't feel like a typical town because there is some mystery and murder in the background. The protagonist, John (who I will not reveal his name) is a good man who is caught up in the strange events. He meets the woman he falls in love with and she tells him that she is a witch but he is not to believe her. She then tries to kill him with a cadaver that is found in her backyard and she then turns into a werewolf and runs off into the woods with her boyfriend. At first, I thought that this book was not my thing because I think this book did not have a plot to it, I think that it was more of a mystery story with the murders that we see on the page but with a twist at the end (which I will leave as a surprise). My kids are young and I can't read to them as much as I used to but I really enjoy reading to them and this is still my favorite book I have read to my children. I recommend this book to all who are looking for a short, but interesting read. I also liked this book because my kids would like it because they liked the murder mystery aspect (and the werewolf is just a cool idea) and the book is funny too. If you want a short mystery read, this is a great book for that.  I recommend this to anyone looking for something light and enjoyable: I read a couple of short mysteries in high school and this one reminded me of that. I think
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book! The plot is very exciting and excitingly complex. I really think that if I were ever in the wrong situation, like my kids might be, this book would come in handy. The first few pages seem to be about how to give a baby a bath, but once I was into the story I found myself enjoying it a lot.   My only complaint is that the characters were not as fleshed out as I'd like. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book, the characters were complex, the plot was good, and I loved the humor. I really didn't want the book to end so I bought it twice, but unfortunately I didn't love it so much.   The main problem was that the book didn't really end on a cliffhanger, so it didn't make me sad that it didn a) end on an important question and b) end before the main character got to her point of "Oh I should have listened."   As for the plot, I found it really interesting and thought the characters had a good dynamic to them.  I am a little bit disappointed because it didn' t really end, but I hope the next book will be more fun and the book ends on a high note. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm always happy to have a great book in my library, but there are a few titles that are so bad that I feel like they will put a permanent scar on my library shelf. I bought this one as a gift for my son and thought I'd give it a try. It's an interesting book that I will likely finish on the road. I do know a lot of people that find this book too difficult to read, but I think that could have been easily explained with a more thorough explanation and explanation of the science behind it. The book has no real plot, and only a few pages are actually relevant to what is going on in the story. There are pages that have to be skipped over if you are planning on reading this in order to get to a good part of the book. It makes me feel that this book should not be required reading for anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I started reading the book expecting to like it, as I always do, but didn't care for the writing style, the characters, or the story. This is a very well written book, but it is very poor in execution. I am not saying that the book was bad, but the story was so bad that I felt as if I were reading a bad script that was written by people who don't like writing or just plain forget how to. I'm sorry that the author is not a good writer, but I'd rather have people with good writing skills write a book that does what it should and what it sets out to do, rather than someone who can't write a good story. I gave it 4 stars because I liked the story, but gave it 3 stars for not being a good book. I like good writing, but this is not it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book and enjoyed it. However the book is not about the character. The character is what we see in the book. This is not a good story. The writing of the book was fine but the ending was the worst part. I hate ending so much! I love books that end well and this one did. I don't even know what to say. I was angry and disappointed and would have rather listened to the audiobook than read the book (for those who don't like reading, or haven't read the story). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think most readers who have read this book will give it a thumbs-down. It's a bad idea to get into the habit of buying the first book in a series, because you'll end up with half a dozen mediocre books and you'll hate most of them. A good reader can look past the obvious problems with this book, but I will say that it's a very, very poor first effort.   "  ...the book is bad.  I'm not gonna lie, I really liked it. I like the story, I like that there's a twist at the end. . The reason I'm saying all of that is that a few days after I finished the book I got a message from a friend of mine who read the book and loved it but who is not in the mood to spend the next few days reading a book she didn't like. What she wanted was something new, something a bit different. So she decided to read the next book in the series, this one called The Witch's House by John C. Wright. So basically I bought two books at once and lost out on the chance to read something a little different from the first one. That just seems wrong. This is not a rant or anything, I'm just trying to let people know what they're missing when they spend money on the first series only to buy the same book again after getting it a third time.   -- I'm not a reader at all. This book was awful to me, not a single good thing about it, but the awfulness of it made it pretty much a must-read. The first thing I noticed was that this book has a very weird cover. The cover is not very good. It reminds me of a horror movie poster that you might get if you look up images for "ghost stories" or something (maybe I need to look that up...). It's also kind of creepy and weird looking (and I'm sure the author will be glad that we're not used to a "mimic" cover, because then we can appreciate the "scary" artwork). And I don't have any particular problem with cover art, it's really not an issue in this case. The thing is, the front cover is a bunch of weird, almost cartoonish, faces that are just kind of there, not even trying to evoke any emotion or anything. They just sort of kind of stare at you. Then
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was so bad! Not bad at all; it was terrible! You don't need to know what happened at the end, except for that there are some horrible surprises at the very end (which would've given this one a little more staying power, but it doesn't). I felt so sad that I wanted to give up reading this book, because I just couldn't do it, and I'm not a particularly emotional person (in fact, if it's hard to read this and still be able to sit through the ending, then I don't feel like I could write a review for any book). If you're looking for a quick read with lots of action and plot twists, I would recommend not reading this one. I had to stop it, because even though there were lots of really good moments, I just didn't find it very enjoyable. It's not terrible, just not worth my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This one is great. The writing is superb and the storytelling is top notch.   I could go on about how awesome this book is. I can't get enough of it.  I have read many wonderful books that just aren't up to this level. I have no problem recommending this book. I'm going to read it now.  There's a lot going on in the first part of this book: the setting is interesting, the writing is brilliant and the characters are strong and believable. That being said, I'm not quite sure how well the plot is built. I was expecting it to be a story about a young girl who gets a magic wand to turn into a dragon, but what I got instead was a story with a lot of exposition about magic. This is what a lot about this book feels like. I get that there's magic in this world and I get the excitement of discovering it, but the story is all about exposition and exposition. I don't think it's necessary for the story to be in this particular way, but there are too many of these parts to have a coherent story. Maybe the story would have been better if there had been more story. In any case, the story doesn't get too bogged down with exposition. The characters are interesting but their motivations are unclear. As the main character, Miele, is the only one who learns how to control her power, I don;t know how she plans to deal with the potential dangers that will come up as she goes to face an ancient and dangerous enemy. I also don't know how well her powers will transfer over to other creatures she comes into contact with. I know that the dragons are her enemies but I don?t know what will happen if they ever find out that she's a dragon. The story seems very rushed and confusing and I'm sure the writer just wanted the book to be over as soon as possible so he could move on to other things. This seems to be the trend in a lot the fantasy books I read: they seem to have to jump through some hoops to get to the point. This book seems like it didn't have enough time to develop its story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In general, my favorite of his novels is "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle."   If this is your favorite of the series then you should pick it up. But I was disappointed. The characters are boring and the story is predictable.   This is a pretty bad novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in the quality of the writing, although there is enough plot, worldbuilding, and character development to carry this book through the first half. After that, the book goes down hill, and only gets worse after the last few chapters. The story doesn't really change, except for a few minor character details that you may not care about. The author doesn't tell the readers how to feel about the character and it comes off as annoying and annoying to me as a reader. I think he did a pretty good job writing the last half of the book, but he has a lot of explaining to do before I can believe what happens in it.  Rating: 3.5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One reason to read a negative book is that if it were well written it would be very enjoyable.   If the book is a bad one it is likely to be written as such because it lacks either interest or insight. The main problem with this book is the fact that it does not give any insight to the author's personal story.  It is an interesting read but I have never read a story as dull and uninsightful as this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I could give this book a negative stars I would. I found it confusing and sometimes difficult to follow.   I also found the characters to be flat, especially the men, who were so obviously written as bland, uncreative, or dumb.  I'm going to try to do a review after I finish the book so you don't have to suffer through all this and my disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the late 1990's I read a book which would become my favorite in the series - "Grimdark", by Patrick Rothfuss, I believe. It was a very nice intro to the world.   Then, about a year or so later, I found "Tangled", by Ursula K. LeGuin. This book I found to be even more fantastic than the one before.   a few years ago i discovered the "The World of Ice & Fire" series by Robert Jordan, the books are not as good as the ones from the books, they are just as good, but they were released a few decades ago (about 3 decades ago) and some of the details are not so well developed. However the world building is amazing and the stories are fantastic. There is just one problem with the "Game of Thrones" TV series, it is very unrealistic. The dragons are still alive, even if they are not alive in the books. In the TV series the North was burned to the ground during the first season and the North's only saving grace is the Greyjoys.  . The world of "The Wheel of Time" books is far more realistic and gritty than that of "Game Of Thrones" and "The WoT", the world of the "WoT" has been destroyed, but the world is still there, the "Wheel" series will be just as great as "WoF" because it focuses on the characters in a realistic way rather than on fantasy.  :  :    : :    The World Of Ice And Fire series is an amazing world, and I have been reading these books since I first started reading fantasy, and have continued to read them. However I feel there are many missing details that need to be filled in in order to make these amazing stories come to life. I can think of so many times I wanted to have heard about a certain character that was never mentioned, or I wanted a certain scene to take place, but no matter how hard I tried, I could not get that scene or scene to happen in my books.   and no, I am not complaining because the author is doing a good job creating such an amazing worlds, it would be impossible for a less skilled author to have created such amazing worlds.    :  The biggest problem with this series is that the author doesn't spend any time setting up this world, it doesn't take a lot to understand
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book. The characters are realistic, and the story is good, but I have two problems with it:    1.   My favorite character was supposed to be the woman who had been killed, not the man who had killed her.  In addition, she has a problem with her child, because she doesn't feel guilty about her child's death, while he is still alive.  My other favorite character is the man whose only good quality is that he's an adult.  That was a little bit disappointing. 2.  If you love to read (or watch, or listen to) historical dramas, then you'll love this book.  I'm not sure why my husband, the librarian at my local library, recommended this book to me, so it must have been an excellent book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good things about this book are the names of the main characters, all names beginning with "H" which is a fun way to name a series. As a whole, The Name of the Wind is not a good book. I'm not sure why I liked it so much, but I did and I'd read a lot of bad books by the same author.   (review continues below) As a whole The Name o f the Wind sucks. If you are a fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series you can probably figure this out. If you aren't a fan though the story is about a woman named Ciri and she is a princess. If there was an actual princess in Jordan's novels there would be more focus on the character, not on the prince who doesn't even have a name. However, there is a lot to love about The Name Of The Wind. In the first book Ciri is still a princess, but in this one we have a lot more time to know her. She starts off as a pretty normal character but she grows and learns throughout the story. She is still pretty good at being a princess but as she gets older she gets more and more involved with the outside world and has to make tough decisions. She also learns to be more selfless and wise for what she has become. She isn't the most graceful person but she is very brave and will do anything for her family and friends. She still has a lot going for her which is really refreshing. I really like this book because there is still action throughout and it gets into the realms of romance. It's like the fantasy equivalent of a soap opera. We learn a lot about Ciri's past and learn how she came to be a princess and also the politics and religion of the kingdom she comes from. If I had to put this book down I would be sad because it is a good story and I really liked the world building, characters, and plot lines. However I can't recommend this book as a whole. I just didn't like it as much as other books that I have read by the author. However it's still a good read and I have recommended it to a few people as well as being part of my reading rotation. (review ends below)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's only one problem with this book: the first third is boring. It takes about two and a half pages before the protagonist (whose name is never revealed) gets a plot going. We're given a brief introduction to the main character, and then we're left to guess at his motivations and back story without any sense of how these things fit in with the rest of the story. It's almost as if this book is trying to tell you that you shouldn't read it. That's it. Then we get into the meat of the book, where I found the story more engaging and interesting. The next section is also boring, but there's a lot to enjoy there. It does feel a little out of character that the main protagonist would be a girl so I was hoping to see some gender bending in this book. That is sadly not the case. This book is too slow to be enjoyable, but it's interesting enough to justify being read on the last day before the weekend. Read with an open mind.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My only negative was the narrator.   She was very "voiced in" as if she was reading the book for the first time.  That would have been fine except that she didn't do her job properly! The book could have benefited from being read aloud rather than her talking, as she tried to make it sound as if the book was a collection of random short stories but I think that was a bad idea and a terrible narrator. I'm so glad to find a narrator who works! She really put the story together as if it were a story in her head. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping to pick up the next one in the series. The book itself had me reading on almost an almost full time basis and even I was able to finish the book in one go (without the "extra" stuff, that would make the whole thing a lot longer). However, I didn't really like it and the fact that you have to buy all the stuff just makes me want to skip all of the next books.   I read The Magician's Nephew  and  The Magician's Nephew,  both of which I thought were good but this one...not so much.  This book was nothing but bad from start to finish.  The Magicist's Nephews     It's just so...bad.  It starts off pretty bad, with a group of kids who are running away from home and one kid is a Magician.  The story then takes a nosedive after a "magic spell" is discovered and the parents come looking for the kid but don't find him. The kids then have to spend the next few years in a Wizard's castle.  They also have to go through an exam called "magic exam".  The whole thing is so contrived, that I really didn't care about the characters at all.  I think the author did a good job of making the character of a Wizard stand out, but I think they would have been better off without all the "excitement".   This books has some good fantasy elements to it,  but I just can't see it ever being interesting to read.  A story with good characters and a good story to tell but this book just doesn't do it.  Overall, not a good book.  My rating:  3.5/5   The final book of The Magicist's series  "So now, it's time for the final book in the trilogy: The Magicman's Nephysons! " " The Magicl's Nephsons!" the big old wizard said proudly, " I had to bring them all back from the dead. " " How are you going to do that? " the little boy asked his father. " I have a secret magic. " The boy didn't say anything and just sat there with his father looking on with hope in his eyes.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish my daughter read more.   The story was interesting, but the language, while not terrible, was not the best either.   It is a great book, but:  * It was hard to keep up with the plot. I found myself not reading a lot of the book in one sitting as my mind kept jumping from one plot thread to the next.  I wish the story would have had more of a dramatic tone that it did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has an epic plot, the characters are interesting and it has an interesting concept. This book is great to read and gives you a great idea of what you'll get if you take a deep look into the human psyche. I think a lot of people should read this book, especially if they're thinking about becoming an author. The story has a little more going on than I was expecting but that's what makes the story worth reading. I'd give it four stars if I could.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was reading this book I thought this book was a piece of shit from the beginning. The writing was bad and had no substance but that did not stop me from reading it.   My main criticism of this book is how slow paced it was. It took me the entire 3 hours to read it. The pacing was slow because the characters are all in love with a girl that they are friends with but have been friends with for years. They have all met each other and know each other. They are all so used to being together that it takes them some time to adjust to the fact that they have to be separated.  This is a story of one of the main characters and his best friend.  This is a nice addition to the story because it takes place after the main story.  I really liked the first person, first person voice, although a bit cliche, the main character's voice and perspective is nice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not find the stories and the characters interesting at all.   The book does not have much in the way of an emotional arc, and the story focuses on the bad guy and his gang.  My problem was that the bad guys seemed to just come out of the woodwork.  In fact, the best book by the same author was about a family of vampires, and it was about two kids and their vampire father.  Even the good guy didn't seem like a real person; he was just a blank slate.  I mean, if he was a real bad guy, why did he want the kid dead?   It seemed like he just wanted the book to be a story about a vampire.  He just wanted people to think he was cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting this to be good but it was disappointing. It's a little difficult to read at times because of the fast paced nature, but it's not bad at all. I am surprised that this didn't get a larger scale book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know what I expected from this book. It was an interesting book in many ways, but also a very disappointing read.   It is a fun read, but it doesn't do much for me other than to give me a headache. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting something more, and it's not. It's a fairly good, if not good enough, book about the first generation of American-style black American writers, which, I guess is what you get when you include William Faulkner and Raymond Carver, and then add writers like Flannery O'Connor and James Baldwin. It doesn't include Booker and it doesn't say anything that you haven't already been saying for decades. That's a criticism. The book does have something important about the nature of writing and black American writing, and I would have liked to see it expanded upon a little more. But for the most part, this isn't going to be the book you're looking for. Posted by Jay Allen at 9:19 PM

Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my all-time favorite books. Not really any flaws or faults to report except that it's a little bit too short for it's own good. That being said, it's worth a read. I've seen other reviews mention this, but I never got around to it until now.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you read the book, you will know that she's not going to do anything. If I were her publisher, I'd refuse to sell this book to anyone with the slightest knowledge of the field.    If you like your books to have a "big picture" feel to them, but also have the ability to focus on individual characters and their personal relationships, then look elsewhere.  As for the "tension" between the two leads, well, that's an aspect of the book that is just a bit off, but I'm afraid you get used to that sort of thing. -JB
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One word: annoying.   There are a lot of reasons to like this book: the story is intriguing and I'm looking forward to what happens next; the main character has a real struggle with her faith (so to speak) and I feel bad for her; the characters have a lot to them that makes them likeable; and so on.   But one thing that kept me from loving this book is the annoying narration of a man that wants to be a writer but has no idea what to write about or how to do it.  For all its strengths, this book really feels like a waste of time for someone looking to learn about writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I do think that this is one of the most unique works I have ever read. It took me a while to get into it, and I kept reading in an effort to finish it all in one sitting. The characters were complex, interesting, and relatable. As I moved on to another book I felt like there was so much left to learn about this universe. I would definitely re-read this book if I read it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A must read. There are a couple of points that i could not agree with. I think she should have used more "poetic license" when portraying the history of her religion. She uses the word "slavery" so many times in her book that i wonder if she even thinks it's a bad word. I am not sure why people who actually believe in slavery feel the need to defend it. It's a very simple and straightforward word to understand. To say you believe in a doctrine where children are born into bondage is so far from what true believers believe that it's not funny. She seems to have forgotten that her book is supposed to be a historical study of a religious sect, not a biography of a slaveholder. She makes this mistake a lot in her writing.   The other point i can't agree with is that she is so passionate about her faith that she cannot admit she is wrong about a very, very small part of history. She is like a child that has been taught that the sky is blue because of a myth she has grown up with. She doesn't admit that her belief is faulty and her belief has led to some very damaging results. She's a good person who has some problems but for that she should be praised, not condemned.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was like watching a movie that's been edited so that the actors are completely bald and fat, like a comedy with a happy ending. I hate the editing of these books. I wish they had left out some of the worst parts of the story. It's like I got stuck with a shitty TV show instead of the book. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:      When I found this book I was in the middle of a big and intense novel (in a good way of course) called A Thousand and One Nights. I was hooked instantly, but as soon as the author introduced the mysterious characters of the book I lost interest and moved on to other things. It's hard to imagine why I would have enjoyed this book so much. I'm certainly not looking for a series that will continue on from book to book. But there are some good things about it.   First of all, I like the cover of this book. It really fits the book. The illustration is very accurate.  ....   The plot is as follows. Our main character, Harry Potter, is very bored. He has just completed a sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and has now been told he can no longer go to the summer camp. Harry and his friend Bill Weasley are bored as well. Bill's father, a renowned magician, is about to perform for an international audience in a castle that has been transformed into a giant labyrinth, complete with magic that allows him to bend any rule or any law, and in one case, allows him (Bill) to teleport from one side of the labyrinth to the other. The only problem is, Bill has never learned how to cast the spells, and he needs Harry's help in the end.  "If we can't solve this problem we can always run away." That's what Bill tells Harry before running away, leaving Harry to solve the problem by himself.   is that Harry, however, is more than just a wizard. He is also a teenager and, in his teens, his problems with magic run a little deeper. The best way to describe the book is a mixture of Harry Potter and J.R.R Tolkien, a good writer who is better than his reputation would have you believe.   of course, this was a fantasy novel with lots of magic, but I can assure you that it was written with the best of intentions. One must be able to read well for a novel such as this to be successful. I really loved the way the author presented the magical world of this story, the way he introduced the characters and the way we, the readers, got to know them. His characters were realistic, I didn't feel like they were being put on the spot. They were realistic in the sense that they knew magic exists, but we never
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Good book, and not too good at times, especially on the last few pages, when I think they could have used a little more info on the different countries, so I was surprised they didn't mention the USA and Canada as well.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     " A book that is about a man on a journey through love. There is a lot going on in this novel and yet it never becomes exhausting." -The Book-Off " The main character is a flawed, complex man who is often hurt by his choices, but he is also a man who has overcome adversity and is still looking for the right person in the right place. As a storyteller, I am grateful to be introduced to this complex, conflicted character." -Booklist "This is the tale of a man trying to make a home for himself in a world he cannot change...The book contains both good and bad qualities. The good is that it is both smart and very funny in a literary way. The bad are some things that are not very interesting or thought provoking. The ending is also problematic to say the least. "  " The story is full of good ideas and a little bit of "just enough" to keep you coming back for more." -Library Journal " The first chapter introduces us to the protagonist, who, unlike a lot of books about love and loss, doesn't have a lot to work with. The man is, to put it nicely, stuck." -Powells " A story told in a way that is not afraid to use metaphor and allegory... [It] gives the impression of the author's ability to create a realistic and even complex character. The story has a little of everything; it is a tragic love story, a comic book, and an adventure story with a happy ending. All very interesting things, which I think makes the book the most interesting among The Hated. " -The Millions "I enjoyed this book. While not perfect, it was well-written, and it was also fun." -Fantasy Book Critic " This is a good book, if you're into heartwarming, romantic stories that get dark towards the end. I highly recommend it. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had great hopes for this book, but it failed me on many fronts. I was excited about this book because I wanted to learn more about the history of a topic I love - Celtic culture - but there were very few facts presented, and most of the information was either incorrect or poorly interpreted. For instance, the story of the "Celtic" "Elder's" appearance was not included in the book. I also believe the book to be a translation of an ancient text, and I am surprised by the "expert" interpretation of the text that was used to write it. I read a review of this book on the Internet (where else?) which is the primary source for information I found on this book. The reviewer stated that the "Elders" were actually "Chaldean Elders" (i.e. priests), but this description was far from accurate. The book states that the people were referred to as "Easter Islanders", but that is a different name from "Chaldeans" (as I originally thought). The "Chalder" is also NOT the name of the person who lived on St. Joseph's Island. The Chaldean name is "Chalaeder" which means "the king". It does NOT mean "the elder". The author also states that "the ancient text of the Book of Enoch is probably the one most accurately translated from the Aramaic." Again, this description is a completely incorrect translation of the word "Chalfed". "Chalaneder" is the Hebrew word for "the Elders". "The Chalder" refers to the "Challeren" which is not a word found in the Hebrew. "Chaer" is NOT a Hebrew word. This translation is also in error - the word used is "Celed". The Chalder also means the "King" and "elder". "Hebrew" and Chaldea are not the same word. The word "He-Ra" is a term that actually does NOT exist in Hebrew. The term "Chereph" can only be found in a very few places in the Old Testament - I believe it was found in 1st Kings. I am sure that most if not all "Challedeers" are "Chaliardenes" - I have only found a few mentions of the Chalder in the Book and these are only in the most recent and most unreliable sources. The title
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What you'll find is a book that seems to be in trouble from the start, but does not go into too much depth on the problems with it. The book does cover a lot of ground, but it does not come across as a well-written overview of the subject. It is a bit of a slog to read, but there's no point to it other than to put down a book.   The title of this book may sound like it could be a good idea, but if you are looking for a good book to read on a day when you have a lot on your mind, you might want to go elsewhere. It's a nice book, but not worth the time.  "How do you make an old fashioned newspaper look like a computer"  This is one of those books where you read the first chapter and then you think "what was I thinking?" and have to go to the next chapter to find out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book two stars because the author seems to have a bit of a hard time with gender roles and stereotypes in her work. While a great book, this doesn't really make it so that one of the most successful and well-known women in the field of history may have trouble getting her writing about male characters right.   For starters, the main character, Sarah Tewksbury, is not a girl and her character is completely written to be a man. While it's true that there are female heroes, such as Mary Magdalene and Ann Radcliffe, these are usually seen as female heroes to be worshiped by men. The fact that Sarah Tewsbury is a man who becomes a hero to a man is something we can only guess at, but the lack of understanding of what it means to be either a woman or a man in this world is so bizarre that it made me cringe.  Also, her description of the war seems very sexist:  "She was a man and he wasn't. Not a woman, not a man, just a man."   While it makes for good satire, it's an unfortunate way to portray a war.  The author should have called this book The Story of a Man. In fact, she should have written a series about men, because men are the heroes of this story.  A story about men and their experiences in the War is what she really should have been writing. The story is not what it should be about because the main male character doesn't understand what his female friend is going through and he doesn't have the courage to try to understand what that experience is like.  I don't have a problem with the characters themselves, I just wish I could see a bit more from Sarah and from the rest of her male compatriots. Sarah Tewkesbury is not the only example of an author who has a problem understanding gender roles. This problem is actually so prevalent that it's not funny, it just hurts. This is particularly true in the case of one of my favorite authors, Margaret Atwood.  Ms. Atwood writes a book about men who are the victims of female rage, called The Handmaid's Tale, which is a very disturbing book. There is one major point about this book that has nothing to do with a male protagonist. The main female character, Offred, wants to have children and she will do whatever it takes to have them and, to be frank
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You're probably already thinking this, but when I went into this book with that level of expectation, I was disappointed. When you've read a great book, it can be a pleasure to return to it years later, and in this case, you can't help but feel like you've missed out on what was going on in the original work.   I've been meaning to read this one since I first got it, but as I said, I read a lot of horror in my youth, and I haven't really been that interested in fantasy in the past.  It wasn't that there was anything wrong with this book, but I just wasn't drawn to it. The plot didn't have that same sparkle to it as it had in the old one.  If you like Stephen King, you'll likely enjoy it, and if you aren't, it's not like you will get much out of it either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:        To me, this book is a book that was supposed to be for young readers but ended up being a terrible book that has so many errors that I could write a whole article about the errors. If I had my druthers, the author would have rewritten the book from the ground up instead of making the same errors over and over again. It's sad that she got a job as a science fiction and fantasy writer at the age of 13. Her first attempt at science fiction was "Gangland".   I don't know if I would be that impressed by her next two books since they are so similar in format and content but if they're as bad as this one is, I'm going to put them in the trash. There is only one thing to say about this book and that's that I love it. I'll definitely be picking up a copy for the kids and maybe for my own enjoyment.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book after a friend recommended it to me. I was looking for something new and thought it might be fun to read. I read the first 50 pages, and then found it difficult to read as the author is slow at some parts and even slower at other parts. There is not enough of a plot to make it all that interesting, or else the book would be complete (it's not), so it's more just a longish story about some people who meet a lot and have a lot to say about the whole "thing" they call "humanity". The ending was not the ending I was hoping for, because of all the things I'd been hearing, but not getting a lot of explanation, and the ending leaves more questions than answers.   I think a good book should have all the answers and should make you question everything you thought you knew.  I'm not sure the ending could have been better. Maybe he was really trying to show how people's beliefs change over time, but there wasn't a lot more to say after the conclusion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking for something like a horror novel, but I'm not sure if it was the story that made me nauseated.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     This was an okay book for me.   I enjoyed it, but I felt that I just don't get this type of book.  I just can't understand why people read this type (of books).   If you're like me, and you hate books that have a "bad girl" who doesn't get what she wants, you'll like this.  My only complaint is that the characters are so boring.  This is like watching a TV show where the character(s) are so annoying that you get annoyed.  For me, this was the type of story I could just let go. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the book doesn't live up to what you were expecting it to be (a "classic" science-fiction adventure that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world), it doesn't matter. There are worse books out there. The thing is, "Star Wars" is just that. A film that has been made several times, and each time has been more successful than the last. I have been reading Star Wars for about 5 years now, and while it's not my favorite book, I can see why someone would like it, and have been enjoying it. A good mix of action, adventure, humor, and a good romance. There have been a number of times when I've felt like it was really taking me for a ride and it had me on the edge of my seat, but it never completely takes me away from the plot and the characters. I think this book could do well on a film, and I am glad it was as good as it was.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Goodreads will never sell my book. My husband is an avid Goodreads member. I wanted to tell everyone about how this book sucks and not only is it bad, but it's written by a total idiot. I'm not kidding, this is a complete and utter embarrassment. The book is about a group of people who have a hard time with math, so they invent a game in which they pretend to solve math problems by using their bodies as "sticks", like a version of Trivial Pursuit. This is obviously dumb and it's obviously written by someone who doesn't have a clue what she's doing. There's nothing cool about this book, and even though I'm a fan of the author, I can't in good conscience recommend it. It's an embarrassing waste of the writers time and a total waste of her talent. If anyone gives this book to their child, don't bother telling them it's good. I mean, there's no way I'm going to be able to read through it again.  ...  2 out of 2 found this review helpful.  was not satisfied. I liked this story a lot, but the story got too confusing for me. Some points were explained by the characters, but they were still a little confusing. The author should have made sure the reader would understand what was happening, because her story wasn't interesting at all. I would like to see more of her work if I ever buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought a copy of this book to read when the kids were younger.   But now I am older, I think this book needs a change to a different book for the younger kids.  This book is not educational, it is not entertaining, it's just a bunch of fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If your review does not contain some useful criticism, it might be time for a "no-fly zone" on your Amazon account.   One positive review from a fan of a book will be enough to convince many book readers to buy it.  It will not convince many of them to continue on, however.  If you have a friend or relative who is a reviewer for a book you are considering, be sure to give them at least one positive review before you buy it--and you will probably never have to get a message from them again.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It had the biggest flaws I have ever seen in any book I've ever read. The prose is really uninspired and the story is boring to me. I think that my favorite character was the guy who went to the beach with the group and was talking to people about what a great time he had just a few months ago when he went. All of the people he talked to were complaining about everything in life: bad job, money, problems with the law, etc. Then the guy came back from the beach and told them that his dream was to write a book like the one his friend was working on. This guy is just that boring and uninspired. Then in the end the man is fired and gets a great job writing a book about his dreams. This book is a total waste of your time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is weak, the story is boring, and the story itself is poorly executed.   This book is the worst I have read in ages, and I am pretty sure this was the last time I will ever pick up an SF book, ever.  My rating is 5 stars, but only because I found the book interesting enough to at least try. If you want a good SF story, this is a decent choice, but with a story like this one, you really should read the original.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's like watching a train wreck.    I had been hoping for a change of pace, but I ended up with the feeling of being dragged through a bad movie.  I don't think any book could be worse than this.  The author never explains how he got to that point (or if he does, he doesn't seem to care). The dialogue is so flat it's almost not funny. The characters have so little to do that it's hard to care about them.  It didn't even make me want to look for the next book.  To think I spent $20 for this is the greatest insult of all. I'm not sure what's more insulting: being told you're wrong for enjoying a book you don't like or being told that you can't get a good book anywhere.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible.  I don't even like the book.   I had heard it was a very good novel.  It is not.  For one thing, I don`t think the author will finish his trilogy.  Also, there are things in the book that are not good. I just don` t think a book that costs around 50 bucks (or even 50 cents) and only takes you 20 pages to read is worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   1) The book is not bad; it is quite good and a good read; and it is the sort of thing I should read more of. The character development is interesting; there is a lot of interesting material here about the various characters; and a lot can be gleaned from the various aspects of the book. 2) There are things that could have been done better; a number of points that are not properly explained, or that are implied but not made clear; and, a few things that seem unnecessarily and unnecessarily complicated. 3) There is a little bit of romance between a couple of minor characters, but the story is not about romance. It is about the nature of evil and the ways in which it works, and about the efforts of men to fight it. 4) The final pages, and the last paragraph, are a bit of a slog. I thought this was a very good read and the story was engaging throughout; I recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was a pain to read, mostly because I had to go back and forth to find things, and I had trouble with a few things, like how the characters were described in a way that wasn't clear. I have to say, the book itself was really good, but the lack of explanation for how the story was told made it hard to follow. There were no "aha" moments in the book that really made me wonder about it, so the whole experience felt like you were just slogging through the story. I've got my eye on a sequel that I'd like to read.  31 of 39 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was good enough but it was a pretty weak story. The book is about a boy and girl who are friends and they live together. The parents are never mentioned but are mentioned during the story to be good parents. It takes a while for them to figure out how to live with this. They don't really learn much. They end up with their own problems with them and their new home. The author had a lot of good ideas in the story. I did love the little things like the fact that the mom and dad have cats, a dog, and fish, or the fact they had their own beds and a lot more. However, these are pretty small things and they are overshadowed by the big things. The story never progressed much and there was no real suspense. The ending of the story was a disappointment and just sort of ended.  My review of this book: The ending was a disappointing one. I had such high hopes for the story and for the little interactions they would have with their new friends. I was looking forward to the fun stories the two would tell. I could not have been more wrong. It was so bland. There was no excitement. The characters were so bland and nothing had happened to them. They stayed there for a very long time and did not evolve. They were just a lot to look at.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is my first book by one of the authors and i'm not impressed, mostly because of how many times i re-read this book, so i feel like i can speak more about it to avoid wasting your time, and just to make my opinion clear. For a first book, the pacing is bad, some of the sentences are really long and repetitive, there is a lack of motivation, the protagonist is only a "monster" and no other emotions of empathy and understanding are shown, and the ending is a bit misleading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I don't know who is behind this book, or why, but they should be ashamed of themselves. This book was a horrible waste of my time.   The first few chapters are fairly interesting. I thought the worldbuilding was a bit weak, but I enjoyed the first half. Unfortunately, all I can say about that is that I'm a sucker for worldbuilding. I think this book is the first in the series to give me a worldbuilding problem, as the next book in the franchise will hopefully solve it. But, it didn't.   a couple of things I thought were interesting:   -There are some very funny moments in the first couple of chapters. For example, a group of dwarves get into a fight over a statue that they believe is too big for them. The statue is made of glass, and one dwarf grabs a handle. They break a small part of the statue and throw it, and it lands directly in the dwarf's face. The dwarf tries to talk the other dwarves out of it, but the others won't listen. They decide to just smash the statue. They have just killed a god, the other god, who is also their leader.  's a world that seems like it was meant to be a medieval fairytale. It's very detailed, and the art is absolutely stunning. The only thing I thought was kind of odd is that there are two goddesses, and they don't interact much. They both have their own, distinct ways of acting. In the first chapter, there's a bit of an argument over a magic sword. In another scene, a woman is asked by an evil witch to be her maid. When she refuses, the witch turns her into a pig. That's about it. It might be good to know more about the gods, but in this book it's like they didn't even bother.   I'll get back to them in a few chapters.   the next few chapters were meh. It was really boring to read. There was a lot of pointless information, and there was a huge amount of plot holes that didn't seem to bother anybody. There were several things in here that just made me roll my eyes at how stupid they were.  -The characters were terrible. They were flat and boring. They had little personality, and none of them seemed to have any motivation for anything. The dwarves were just there to be annoying, to be the bad guy,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think my rating for this book is a solid 4.0   The story is pretty much what you'd expect from an OAV. There are some great action scenes, some very interesting, and a few really excellent romance plots. The pacing is a bit rough, and the writing is a little on the dry side. The ending is a big letdown.  Overall:  I liked it.   It was pretty interesting and different.  I would read the next two books in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For my taste, , is not a good book.   It is not funny, is unoriginal, and is not in any sense a story that I would want to read again. I liked it enough to read a second time, but not enough to reread. A: Well, I read the first three-quarters, the beginning of the first-third, then I started reading the ending, and I just couldn't. And I have to say that I've read a lot of books that I thought I'd like, but when I was finished I just didn't like. It is difficult for me to say it isn't my cup of tea, but it's not my cup, either. And, you know, it's a little bit like The Hobbit. The whole thing, the whole thing.  B: I have not finished the first four books,  and I really hope that I will in the future, but I will not wait for them to come back from the publisher, because that will not happen. I'll just wait for a new book, which I have never really got around to. I can't say that the book was bad, or that I disliked it. It just wasn't mine. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (i am not a big fan of negative review).   But this is a good book.    My main problem is the writing style. This book is a classic example of the worst kind of writing I have ever seen. The author uses the first person and the third person too frequently. And you know what? It's okay! It's great! The author does great! It makes you like her more and more! This makes me feel like the author is actually trying to write a well written book. But she's not. She just says the words and does it poorly. It's a horrible style that really takes a bit of the enjoyment out of the book. Even if you get it, you will feel like you're reading something that's not your favorite. This is especially true if you've ever read the book before.  The character and story development are also not the greatest, but they are not terrible. At least I felt like they were good and did the job. The book starts with some of the most horrible situations I've ever seen a story set in. Some people die horribly. There is so much darkness. The plot is not clear or fun or anything to write about. And that's the best thing about it. If this is the author's best, this would be a perfect 5.5, no question. The other things I have to add are the bad ending and the story being just a little too long. There's no real buildup, no reason to keep reading. I'm not going to say if it's worth reading (I have a few favorites, but I don't want to give too much away), but I'll say it's just too slow and boring and doesn't have enough good things to give the rating more than a 4.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am absolutely LOVING this book! I have never been the biggest sci-fi fan in my life, but my daughter has recently been taking me to a couple of her sci-fied book signings, and I have to say that so far, they are the best. I have read a few other people's reviews, but this one is by far the most thorough, in-depth, and informative. I've already been writing a very detailed review for this book. I am definitely a new fan of this amazing author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had nothing to do with the subject and everything to do.   I don't think there was enough research to make a real point out of the book.  I will say that the writing style is very good and the story was very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're a fan of literature with a happy ending, read the book.   The ending was nice but the book was over-long and too-long. I'm glad that there was a happy end but there were many things that were unexplained.  The story was good enough to be entertaining.  I liked the characters and how they reacted to the events.  It would have been nice if the author had kept the tension until the final pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm just not that into the science fiction. This one was not good. I was going to give it 2 stars but I can't give it less than 2.5 stars. It's a little dull and too technical. Not much depth to the story. I read it because it was a free book and it didn't take up that much of my time.  I'm a big fan of sci-fi, especially Star Trek, so I had high expectations for this book. The first paragraph:  "The ship, a vessel that had been designed to be as safe and functional as possible, is rocked as it travels through a region of space near the edge of the galaxy." (p.5) Oh come on, this is a spaceship that is supposed to be safe, right? But then the "a region of... near the... edge... of the... galaxy?" What's that mean? It means that it's someplace where space and time aren't linear. So it's "in" and "out". If I am reading this in space, that means my ship is "in out". That means there is no back and forth. I've only heard of such a region before in the science-fiction world, but that's a huge "if". As soon as I saw that paragraph I knew this was not a good book. If you don't know about this, it's an alternate timeline in which Earth and space have merged. Things like time travel, wormholes and alternate universes have never been explored before in a science-fictional universe and that is why I thought this book was going so well. However, I think this book will turn people off from reading sci-fiction, because it isn't much fun. It is hard to take your time in this book, there is so much information about the science and it's not really clear. I would have liked to have gotten to know the characters better, but the science stuff is so detailed that you just know that it is what you're looking for. It just keeps getting harder and harder to stay with the story, I kept thinking I should just read this book in a month but I just couldn't. If I could give this book two stars, I would. It will not win any literary awards and it will turn many off from sci-fim. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    And you can learn about the science behind this in the book :   There's a lot of science to be learned from this book, but I didn't get enough of it in it to understand it at all. It is a book written by a neuroscientist who is studying how our bodies work, and so is it surprising that he would be a bit confused with the various neuroscientific explanations of consciousness and the various brain structures involved in it?    The book does go into the brain a little bit, but then he spends a lot more time on the rest of the body. That's not to say that the book doesn't cover the brain enough; it does. It just doesn't get me at all as a scientist.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     It's a good thing that the author has a way with words. I found this book to be nothing but a poorly written rant filled with spelling, grammar, and grammatical errors. A review by "a reader for 30 years" states: "The text is difficult to follow, which is why the book doesn't give you much of a sense of how to approach a subject. This book was written by someone who has a problem with her own spelling, so much so that she was so embarrassed she had to print it out again. It is a pity the author of this book never got help from a reputable dictionary publisher to correct the errors in her writing." I wouldn't want to read that review.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't have a problem with this book, but I was very disappointed by the story in general.   This is a very dark book with an extremely dark twist in the end.  I thought this book was good, but not spectacular. The book is so dark that I could only take it halfway to completion without feeling sick, and I don't think I would have gone on to finish it.  The ending is really creepy too, like something out of a horror movie, but the creepy twist is the only reason I gave this book 3 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book.   "A bad book, the type of book I'd be ashamed to bring to a friend's wedding. A book full of mistakes and half-assed plotlines that, while entertaining, feel like they're only serving to pad the novel out by three-quarters of the way through. A mediocre book that doesn't merit the two and a half stars it has been awarded. "   - Bookworm Blues   This is a book that just doesn't stand up. The plot starts out alright, but as the characters' story line progresses, it becomes a bit of a bore. I really can't say anything bad about the book, but the book itself is just so poor in quality.  It's a fun little romp that can be read in an afternoon, but if you take the time to get through it, you'll find that it really doesn't have much of a plot. If you don't have a few bucks lying around, try looking for a used copy, you may find a gem in the bargain.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book just has a bad ending. I know that sounds silly because I'm usually the first to write a review about something I hate, but I'm a writer, not a writer's agent. I felt like the entire book was just an afterthought, a last minute addition to the story that doesn't even feel like it belongs. It's so bad that I don't even want to look at the blurb.   I know I'm really bad at reviewing, so I'm just going to say "This book is just... so bad."

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a great book for a younger child. I had a hard time keeping it in mind that this was actually going to be a series. It is a book that you can read over and over and it still holds up. The plot has a lot of promise. I just hope they can keep this story going. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is bad, but the plot is good. I was expecting it to be the opposite - a good book with a bad writing. In fact, I think that the writing was more like a mediocre book that tries to be a masterpiece - a bit too ambitious, maybe. My other gripe is that it's only around 80,000 words, which isn't much for a book about the history of American military intelligence in the 1920s. But then, my book is also a biography of my father, and I needed the more immediate perspective to be able to do the research.  A very intriguing read.   The book starts with the early years of the Navy's first code book, the one used for communicating with the Germans in the war, and how the Germans were able to break into the system by simply writing the decoded message in plain language. I had no idea what the book was about from a marketing perspective, and the first thing that caught my eye was the description of the code book: the design, the materials and construction, and so on. The book goes into more detail, which I liked. The main thing that stood out to me was how the information was collected and collated. How the Navy kept track of what was being received, how it was collated and where they had access to the documents. The description of a code book in an old book store, with the books on the shelves in between the shelves of books with the most recent code book publications, was pretty cool. The history of the United States in the first half of the 20th century was really interesting, with lots of interesting historical figures and anecdotes to be found. There were a number of different organizations of interest in the book: The OSS was a precursor to the CIA. The CIA was in the beginning a research organization for the OSS and eventually became its own organization, and was able to recruit new personnel who were more interested in the historical history of America. The FBI and the CIA were involved in various counterintelligence missions, such as wiretapping, etc. (The FBI was also a counterintelligence agency at this time. For instance, the FBI wiretapped President Harding's telegraph in the days before they got wiretaps for the Supreme Court in a case involving Senator Joe McCarthy). The State Department was a part of this early espionage apparatus for the United Nations, providing them with information about the Soviet Union.  .   He discusses the various activities,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading this book at the suggestion of my good friend who is very knowledgeable about books and lives in New York City and it's about a girl named Lucy and her best friend Lucy's new boyfriend and Lucy's mom.     I would have liked this book a lot more if it was about Lucy and Lucy and their family and Lucy getting married and having kids and then Lucy going off to college but I guess that's something that can happen in the life of a person that is a woman.  So the story revolves around Lucy and this guy named Sean and it starts off with Lucy and Sean being friends and they end up getting married because their families are so different and then the couple start having problems and Lucy goes to her therapist (her mom) and then decides to break off from her husband (or maybe Sean wants to divorce her and get his divorce papers done at the same time) and she goes to a church that teaches that you can get your divorce papers in a few days if you're a married person and then there is a church in New Jersey called Holy Spirit Assembly and I don't know how a woman who is so conservative can get her divorce papers so fast but she does and then she heads back to New York and that's when the whole story of the book starts to go bad (I thought she was going to get the divorce papers at the beginning but that didn't happen and then when they do get them she says that they are not the same but I don?t know what that means).  The other thing that bothered me was that Lucy got pregnant when she was about 30.  But then the book doesn?t say anything about that.  She was about 26 and she gave birth to this boy in the summertime.  So that?s the only thing I can think of but it seems like she just gave birth and then decided she wanted her baby back.  It?s not as if she was a teenager that couldn?t have gotten pregnant before.   I understand that some people can get pregnant at 27 or 28 so it would be hard to imagine a girl like that being pregnant when you were 26 or 27 but that?d be impossible for a woman in my opinion.  And when she had the baby and gave birth, she called her boyfriend a b?tch but it?s like this boyfriend was just trying to have sex with her.  I feel like a lot of people would have called him a b
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's like reading the Bible, only the first chapter has one or two more mistakes than a lot of other books I read.   The characters are so thin it's hard to care about them.  I have to wonder about the editors who decided to give this book away. I don't think that this is the best book I've read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually review books I have to read as this is a genre I don' t typically do it in. I'm a big science fiction/fantasy fan and this was one of my favorite books I had read this year. My biggest gripe is with the ending. I felt the ending was a bit predictable. Maybe that is just my taste in books but I thought the ending just ended too soon (as if this book is like a one act play).     The character of Kavik is one of the best of the book. He is a very likable guy. I think the plot really came together around him and I really like this guy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The only things that kept me interested in this book were the romance in the middle and the very last one.   As far as I know, this is one of the few books in the YA section that is written from the viewpoint of a non-romantic, female protagonist and a male, non-Romantic main character.  In this regard, it feels a bit like a female Harry Potter novel. _______________________________________________________________________________ I think I can safely say that this book has nothing to do with The Dark Knight.  This book has a very similar tone and structure to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.   It's like reading the next version of the first book.  For the record, I don't really like either book very much, so the comparison was kind of funny to me.  Although, I do have to say that I have to admit that there is a lot more to this book than The Dark Kettle.  It has some more of that "Darkness" feeling to it and I think that this is the real reason why the book is on this list.  It's hard for me to write about this book because it is very different.  As I said in the last review, the first half of this book was very dark and very depressing.  I can tell you that the last half of the book wasn't nearly as depressing to me as the first part.  After reading this book, I was so happy that this world was finally taken away from me. I want to read more of his books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:       I loved The Night Circus   But this is just a mediocre fantasy series that is riddled with issues   - The plot was very interesting (in its own way), but I was really disappointed with the story. While I enjoyed the idea of a man who can speak to animals and can become their master (and was also pretty cool), this was a bit too bogged down in the fantasy aspects.   My problem with this series was mostly with the characters - most of whom were boring, overly complex, and in some cases, downright awful. The main character and his wife have a son that they are desperate to give a proper send off. They go out for a very special picnic. While they are there, their son sees a small girl. They are so desperate to be there that they rush to the picnic and try to keep the child from finding out anything about the girl. Unfortunately for them, they are seen by the child who runs off. The child runs into a house where two mysterious old women meet her. She runs away from the old women and meets a man that she is sure has killed her mother. The story starts out quite nicely, with the main character getting to learn more about himself and what he is capable of. Unfortunately, the plot soon loses steam. I started getting frustrated by it from the start and this continued throughout most of the story, but I don't blame the characters. It's a very confusing, confusing story with lots of confusing sub-plots and it's hard to keep track of who the bad guys are. The author spends an awful lot of time describing magic in general, including how the people who use it are like gods, but doesn't explain why they use it or the consequences. In addition, he spends so much time explaining magic in the book that he fails to explain it in the main plot. For instance, the main villain, an evil magician, spends almost no time explaining why he is evil. Instead he just goes around stealing and destroying stuff until someone finds him. The book doesn't really end at all and the author does a very bad job of putting an end to it. He fails to finish off the story by actually showing the ending of the main story and leaving it open for a sequel. It was a very disappointing ending to a very good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this book has become so mired in politics that it has lost much of its originality. What was once an interesting, dark fantasy that dealt with the horrors of war and the perils of the unknown has become a farce. The story revolves around an arrogant British nobleman who leads an army into war against the forces of a brutal and oppressive Islamic country. As a fantasy, this makes sense since Islam is a dark and sinister land, and the Middle East has been the epicenter of many wars. However, this story is far too predictable and it turns into a farcical war story with too many political themes and elements thrown into the mix. Most of the time, the characters are either idiots, incompetent, or completely uninvolved in the events of the story. Many of them even become involved and do more harm than good, including the main character himself, who seems to be a very unhinged character. This story lacks the originality of previous fantasy stories in the genre that I used to read. This may or may not be the author's fault as it is possible that the events that take place in this story are completely unrealistic and his characters may just be the ones that need to change.   The most popular fantasy book ever:  In a very interesting analysis, the popular author, George R.R. Martin, states that in his opinion the series, Game of Thrones, is more popular than any other fantasy book. In fact, he has stated that no fantasy book has ever been as popular as this one.  Game of Thrones is the only book of its kind to reach the No. 1 spot on the New York Times hardcover bestseller list 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a disappointment   One of the most common misconceptions about children is that they don't learn.  They do.   They learn by reading, and that's the point of reading, right?   That's also true for adults, especially if they're used to reading books that are too short and easy to follow.  The truth is, when they're able to read an entire novel, it's just too long and too confusing to keep up.  There are lots of great books about kids, but they are often very short, and for kids who have grown up in an environment that is easy to read, it can be a bit too hard. The other issue is that the books that get reviewed on the blog are often written by non-literary writers, who don't have the same background and knowledge that you have as a writer. So you may have to do more work to understand the author's points.  So, I encourage you to make sure that the book you're reading is something you would read in the first place.  If it's a book that's too long to follow, I have found that it's often best to leave it out of your list altogether.  Of course, I would never suggest you stop reading anything you enjoy completely (though that's never been my style) so if you do find yourself skipping a book, do so only because it's getting a bit long.  As for reading outside the school curriculum, the best place to start is with the "Great Books" lists from Literotica: http://literotica.blogspot.com/ I also recommend The Library of America's "Big Books" series:  http://www.the-library.org/big-books/ The "Big" series is what you want. You get 10 volumes, each with a different cover.  My pick for the best book in the series is "A River Runs Through It" by Ralph Ellison.  In a sense, this is the book for kids. It's a very short and simple book.  While not perfect, it has a lot of fun with language, which is important to teaching children to read.  And, just like you can learn a lot about someone by reading their books (like what a character's real name is), you can also learn a great deal about a book by reading the description of the book on the back of the jacket.  You can also take a look at
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have had so many great books this year that I really feel like this one was just bad.   It's written in the first person and has lots of scenes that are about family life that I don't really see the point in reading.  It is about a group of people going on a camping trip and there are many family references.  This book is really about a small group of kids from a very small town (a town in Ohio).  It was okay, but the next book in the series was better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting something to surprise me.  I had no idea what to expect.   For those that haven't read the book,   the world is run by the "Order" who have a religion of their own and believe in the "Power of the Gods".   The Order have their own rules and have little to no tolerance for anyone not in the Order or those who "disfigure" them.  In addition, the Order runs the government so that they can do what they want.  When the Order find out the true history of the world and how it came to be, they feel they have no right to control the world they claim to own.  What you get in the book is all the chaos and chaos that the Order causes but that is not what I thought I would get.  The main characters in the story, the King, Queen, and King's friend, get by with just enough to keep themselves afloat, a simple life that is somewhat of a lie as the Order is constantly conspiring against them. The story is a bit slow to progress but I didn't mind it as it keeps the action to a minimum and doesn't give the story a very interesting pace.  Another thing that bothered me was the romance that is brought up.  Some of the main characters are a bit too nice to the point of being annoying.  One character says "My name is Princess Kana and I'm not into guys."  I didn;t really care much for it.  Lastly, it didn't have much plot to speak of in the end but was still interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a pretty decent book, but I don't see any redeeming features in it.   There are no new ideas here.  If you enjoyed the old book, you are going to enjoy this one, but there are no surprises in it either.  It is predictable and the ending is a surprise and you have already guessed that ending, why keep reading and learning about it.      I give it a 2/5.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A big part of the appeal of this book for me was the idea of seeing what would happen if a male heroine was introduced into a world in which there was no female equivalent of the manly traits such as courage, strength, bravery, and heroism. I wanted to know how a world with no women would look, how they would interact, and whether the male heroine would be a hero or a villain. I read it in a few days, and I was not pleased with how things turned out.   In fact, I have not been back to read any of the other books by this author in quite some time. This is the first in a series of "heroes" (the other being "the girl"), and I feel like it was a waste of an author's time to try and write a book that did not really work. I think she spent more time making the heroine a slut than writing a story. There are quite a lot of characters in this book, and for an author like this I would have thought that a good amount of time would be put into giving them a background and an identity rather than creating a female version of their male counterparts, but there were no background details about the characters to give them a sense of who they were, and no identity for them beyond that. I really want to like her, but I found her to be a disappointment. It is hard to give a book this low a rating, and although I was pleasantly surprised when I got home that the book was free, I really don't think it is worth the price of admission.

I wish I had read this sooner." – @Avery_Shum "The Black Hand in the Shadow's book is a challenging read to a lot the black readers. One of the black characters is a serial killer and this book is about him. The other black characters have very little to do with the story. It also is a bit slow, but the action is very well done. The story and the prose are both engaging and original. I really enjoyed this book. I think a lot more people could benefit from reading this book." - @brylinds "I really enjoyed the book and it was well done with a twist at the end.

The characters are stereotypical and I found myself wishing I could kick them out and replace them with other characters of different races.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of the book. The book is fantastic, fun, and thought provoking. I'm sure I'm not the only fan that is surprised by what a good book it is. It's a story that is just too good to be true. It was a really fun read. However, the actual story is not what I expected and is not really necessary for anyone to read this book. This is not the reason why I gave this a negative. The main problem I had with the story was the ending. I was hoping that the story would progress into a good conclusion with all the bad things being brought to light in the end. However I think it was more like the author just wanted to give a bad ending to the book and he did it. It made the ending really boring. Not a fan of that method to make a book even better!   So what if the author said to the reader, "I lied to you. I don't believe you." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "This book is a mess"  "This book was a failure." "The story is poorly told."  1.1 -  My review of the book in the book  I read this book when I was a senior in high school (18). I would read every book that the school put in the library, and this was one of them.   I have a little boy that loves to read. It wasn't hard to keep him interested. It was also a nice break from the other books I read during the week.  .     This book is not bad, or a disaster. It's just not well written. It is written in a kind of high school fiction kind of way. It has a nice plot, some nice characters, and is really enjoyable to read about.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "If you are looking for the perfect book for children, look elsewhere."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's pretty simple. The author's writing is so bad that it's not even funny. The plot is so dumb that the author has written a book that even a retard can enjoy. The book is a parody of a variety of books from different genres.   It's just so bad and boring that I can only imagine how bad it is for real readers. This is the sort of book that every fan of the "Fifty Shades of Grey" books should keep away from.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a real shame. I really liked this book. I had an incredible time reading it and it was a blast. However, there are many things I didn't like. I thought the author was writing a parody of a lot of modern romance novels, the main character was a total dudebro, the ending was boring, and many other things. The author did not explain much in the way of what was going on. For example, in the beginning of the story, a man says to his girlfriend that he would love to spend time with her, and he is talking to her in his normal voice, but in the end, he calls her names because she didn't answer his call. It was almost like he was mocking her, even though he was trying to be nice to her. It just seemed like the author wanted to do a funny romance novel in the vein of Joss Whedon's The Vampire Diaries, but instead, ended up doing a straight romance novel. It made me wish the whole thing had been different, even if the ending ended up being very good. Also, I had trouble with the character of Mr. Hulme.   I thought he was a really good character, and that he got more developed as the book went on. However I found his actions and his attitude to be very annoying at some points. The way he treated his girlfriend, and the way his friends treated him, and his constant bickering with his parents, was very annoying and annoying. Also I wasn't a big fan of the whole story about the vampire who gets possessed, but what a drag.  I'm not sure if I like the ending... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - The characters, the prose and the plot - It's just not well written, at all, to tell you the truth. It's so poorly plotted, poorly written and not at all believable to be honest, so much so that I find it hard to believe anyone could ever be able to finish this story. The character's personalities are all way too over-the-top for a child's story. I found it very annoying that the author kept trying to make me feel sorry for these characters in order to try and sell the story, especially when it's obvious that there is no character development or character growth in the book at all. Even the protagonist, as far as I know, is just there to act like the character she has to be in order for the story to go forward, and she doesn't change much at all to be able do this, but instead acts like a child for the rest of the story. It doesn't really make sense why she was chosen to be the main character since this story is supposed to be a kid's story, but I guess this author just couldn't resist making her the main heroine. Other characters too, aren't really developed at all and it's hard for me to believe the author would try to make them all likeable and good. Overall this book just isn't very believable. And the story is not worth reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      There are many people that I have met and spent time with who have taken great interest in how much work I do for a living, especially in a field such as photography.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a while, I tried to like The Great Gatsby. I have to admit, I did enjoy this book, and I think it was interesting and a good read. I do think though that the story is not strong enough to carry the story. The book is well written and a lot of fun to read. The characters are good though, but again, the story takes a back seat. If you are looking for a good time read, this one is worth a try. But as a book, it didn't get it done. I give it a 3.5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the first few chapters don't bother you, then just skip to the good stuff. There's no doubt this book will take you to your very lowest place. This is a book about what it is to be a bad writer. I love that, but don't read it if you're looking for a real challenge. This book does a great job of being as honest as possible. I'll admit that the language isn't always perfect, but if you don't have an excuse to be bad and want a glimpse at how it feels to be the "worst writer" then this is the book for you.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know how this book made it into print, but it should be banned. The author clearly has no knowledge of psychology. For example, in Chapter 10, she says: "We know, intuitively, that the only way to know what an individual has done is to look at the behavior of other people around them to see what they might be thinking and feeling at the same time, to look for signs of deception, deception in intentions, and deception in action." Well, I'm pretty sure that she didn't. As a matter of fact, what she said is that we can predict the behavior and the emotions of others from behavior and emotions of a few individuals in a room, which is completely wrong. If you really want to know how to know someone's true intentions, look at how they act and talk to other people who are close to them. Also, the author is clearly a woman, which means that she's probably very insecure about her own body. I don´t think that she has any clue about female body image. Also she states in the last chapter of the book that: "For women, sexual power is not power over a man. It is power over the man's mind." But if this was a book written by a man, I would say that it would make perfect sense. After all, women use power over men to get what they want, so in a way women should have complete power over males. That is, the only male power the author shows us is that the women are smart enough to see through the lies and the manipulations. But women have no power over their own minds, and we don't see this in any of the fiction books. I'm not sure if the author actually believes these things or is just trying to convince people that all women are liars. The last chapter states: "That leaves only one option for women: to take on that power" but I don`t see how that is possible, since the author states that the woman can only have power over another woman if the male is willing to lose the power that is his. The chapter goes on to say that the male can only "lose his mind" because of this, which implies that the female loses control over him when he loses control of his mind. I guess we should all learn from Freud's definition of insanity: The belief that the world works according to rational rules without the interference of irrational rules, especially one's own irrational
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts out well. The protagonist and his wife had a good, happy life until they lost a baby in a car crash. The baby, who they never told anyone about, was adopted after a couple of years. When the husband finds out the baby was lost, he decides to never tell anyone and live a life of secrecy. He doesn't even tell his wife about what he did with her baby. At first he's happy and happy, and then the story turns into a slow descent into insanity. At one point he's talking about going to the bathroom in a crowded room and then realizing there's no one around so he just pee out in the open.   I think that's a good point to end the review on.  My rating:  I'm trying to give it a 5 star rating because I thought it was good but I couldn't give it 5 stars. The book is a horror/novel. I like to be scared. I liked the premise of the story but it wasn't very good. I didn't feel like the main character was in it. The author wrote it with a different style than most and that made it read differently from most but I wasn't a big fan of the writing style. I was also not a fan of how he edited it because he cut away things that were relevant to the story and put in things he had to in the beginning of the book that were out of character. I also think it's possible the book was edited from the start of the manuscript and then re-edited. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping for a more positive review for this book. The book is a good book. It has good pacing, and the story has some good character development and a plot that is interesting (although it's somewhat predictable).     It is just a really hard book to review because it is so different.   There are many things that I liked (mainly the ending) and a few things I didn't care for (main-ly the pacing).    I'll say I got a kick out of the "Candyland" and the "Shark's Tale" and I liked the premise (the main character has a bad time and gets a job working for the sharks, although it's not really explained how this happened).  I think I liked it better than I would have liked the more popular version of this book from years ago, "The World's End", because the book is more original and I didn the more "mystical" flavor that was present in that book.  However, I still wouldn't call it a good sequel and I wouldn't really call it better.  The thing that makes this book a hard book is its ending.  There is a plot twist that is really jarring when you get it, but I have to admit that when I got to the end of this, I was quite disappointed.  It is a little too abrupt and it seems that some people didn't get it.  I thought the ending was pretty bad.  The problem I have with it is that the twist is just too good and too sudden.  What's really weird is that even though the twist was pretty good, the twist in itself, and not the twist that follows, is what makes the book a really good book, but the twist at the end is just the wrong twist.  A book can still be good without the right twist or the right cliffhanger, but to me, the right "tricky ending" is really what makes a good story.  And the "trick" that is the twist isn't as cool as it sounds.  That's not to say that there aren't many cool twists in this book, because there are.  But this twist that was so good doesn't really fit with the rest of the story, nor do the other twists really fit in with the other plot elements (main characters are in trouble? Check. Sharks are causing all this trouble?
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had just finished the first book, and was ready to read the second book.  It was a very long book. It was not a fast read.  The plot is about the same as the first one and is about a man's search for the wife he lost.  He finds her, and things progress.  There is a lot of mystery and action, as well as a lot on the relationships between the characters.  This book was written for teens and young adults.   There are many moments where the characters are shown to be very flawed and not always the good people they are made out to be.   The main character, J, is a very good person, but also very naive, and I don't think he always realizes when someone is being deceptive, and is a little too much of a "yes man".   It is a shame too, because there is a good ending.  J seems to get back together with his ex, but there are many problems that keep him away from being with her.  I do think the story could have been better, but I had a good time reading it.  I liked the second half of the book better.  Another person who gave it a five star review, and did say it was the best book she has read so far this year, gave it 4 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not very good, in my opinion. The characters are really dumb and most of the plot is just "spoilers". I didn't enjoy this story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    (I've read more than 30 so far, and have yet to finish one of them, though I'm hoping that might change soon. In my case, the problem is that I just can't get interested in the story. There's so much going on that it's difficult to care about any of the characters, let alone find any sympathy for them. It's really not that bad, but it is what it is.)  —  I really should have read The Withering of the Lark sooner, but I was so caught up in the first couple of books in the series that I thought I'd just pick it up for the finale. And that was a mistake! It wasn't all bad; it's a decent, straightforward story with a solid ending. But at no point in the book did I feel truly drawn to anyone. All I felt was anger, frustration, and general unhappiness. The pacing is just a little too slow at times. And the ending. It came out just a bit too smug. It was nice knowing I'd see the next book in the trilogy, but the overall feeling of frustration and disappointment is so strong that I'm not sure I will be returning to the series. I know that it isn't all that bad!  [review of free book]
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The world needs more books like The Art of War: The Art Of Winning by Sun Tzu.   I am a professor at one of the most respected universities in the world, and I love this book.  It has been translated into Chinese, Russian, Japanese, German, Arabic, French and Spanish.  Sun Tzuo was born in the 7th century BC, a Chinese sage.  He became a philosopher after studying with Confucius and lived under several Chinese emperors.  This book is a study of tactics and strategy. Sun T zu was the inventor of the concept of wang, or strategy.  The best way to describe the book is this: it is like the chess grandmaster himself is writing the book.   The book is divided into three sections: the "Art of War" Section, the "Evaluation" section and the "Tactical Section."  In the first section, Sun Tzen explains the art of war, "It is not a question of knowing things, it is a question how to do things. "  The ArtOfWar is a guide on how to defeat your opponent, which is the most important part of a military operation.  There are two parts to a strategy: the strategic section and tactical section.   The strategic section is designed to find out what a particular type of army is good at doing and then implement those tactics into a campaign.  In a tactical section of the book, Sun tzu gives his advice for when you must choose between doing a certain thing and doing that which would be optimal.   You must choose the tactical plan that will give the best result at the end of the day.  For example, if your opponent is a weak and weak country but you have no intention of invading it, you must use your tactical plan to crush him into submission. This is the "win at all costs" approach to strategy. What is the tactical section?  The tactical section is where you learn which parts of the army can help you win an engagement.  One of the biggest mistakes I see players make is thinking that just because their army is strong they can defeat the other's army.  If you know that your army has a lot of armor that cannot be penetrated by the enemy's small arms, then you can move your army around so that your infantrymen and cavalrymen can attack from a flank or in a rear assault.  Then you can use the armor to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you read all the bad reviews, it is possible that you will think of this book as the worst of them all and forget how good it is. It is so bad that it almost is worth reading again. I'm thinking of it as a very boring book that doesn't do much. This book doesn't help the fantasy genre or the way books can be written. It tries to teach how a character's destiny is shaped by her character flaws. But the book only has a couple of pages devoted to that. The book ends, but at the very end, the author tells a lot of stories about the people she has encountered, but nothing about how the story ends. The rest of the book I could easily skim over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only positive to be found in this book was a review that said, " The first part of the book is interesting, but then it gets to the'magic' of the world and I got bored and didn't feel the book would get much deeper."   If you've already read this and think there is no more to it, then I think you might be just as frustrated as I was, and that's an issue with the whole book. The main character is just not likable; he's a jerk and a jerk only because of the society he lives in. It seems like he has no real issues to work out but is forced to solve these problems and is able to do so by being able to lie and get away with it. If it weren't for this book's flaws, I would have read the sequel and probably gave it a 3 star rating, but even though I still enjoyed the first part, I found myself wanting more from the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first read this I didn't like it at all. I can't remember the exact moment that I decided to drop it for good. It took about a month or so before I finally started to actually like the book, although, in retrospect, that's probably not a surprise because I really didn't care for it. What I liked about it was that it was a pretty interesting look at the history of the world as seen from a Christian perspective, which is, of course, the traditional view, but also a very interesting look of the ways in which Christianity has changed and expanded since the days of Augustine and Aquinas and even the Crusades. It's pretty clear to me that Christianity has grown as a world religion over the past two centuries and is now very much a global religion, but it's also pretty clear that it has also grown as both a belief system and a political and military force, which means it's not going away any time soon. This book is a pretty good introduction to some of the history and culture of the period, but when it came time to actually read the book I found that I actually had to skip the first two chapters because they were just so boring and didn't really give a good sense of what was going on in the early Christian world. It really is all very dry and boring, and I found it quite irritating. I really like that it's a history book but I don't think I could get my head around reading it if it was solely an introduction to the history, which might be a good thing, but really, it's still a pretty dry, boring read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wish the author had given this story better treatment. The pacing of the book is atrocious and the worldbuilding was very confusing, with a lot of details and words not explained very well. The story starts out with a good deal of action, but then you find out a lot about the world before it even gets there. It feels a lot like an unfinished novel.   It is very hard to believe that the author didn't actually write this. If he had a lot more experience as a writer, I believe it could have been a much better book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I would have read this book sooner.   It seemed like the author was trying to be clever about his plot, but the writing was so stiff, that it just came off as a story with no purpose to it.  Rating:  3.5 out of 5.  The next one to read. I had a rough childhood, I was abused, emotionally abused by my parents and grandparents, I lost my parents in early childhood and grew up without a mom or dad.  They left me and my mother with an abusive and alcoholic step dad, he was a drug addict and alcoholic, and my step mom was an abusive alcoholic who turned into a drug addicted woman who killed herself.  I went from a poor teenage runaway to an alcoholic who slept in her car every night.  When I turned 19, I married a man who beat me and stole from me and had me put in a mental hospital, he also molested me when I was a child.  While I was in the mental hospital my mother told me that her husband had killed his wife, because she would not marry him.  He was in jail when I got out.  So after this I was alone and angry, and I started reading about the great and the good who were in prison.  One of the books that I read was the autobiography of an old man, called Charles Manson.   Manson is a person who was in prison for killing people.  Charles Manson was the only person that I have read about that I found interesting.   In prison he had a woman called Linda Kasabian, who was an exotic dancer in the Manson family, she was in love with Charles and she told him she was pregnant and then Manson killed her in the shower, because he was very angry with her, and this happened in 1975.  She got out of prison in 1979, in the 80's.  After reading about Manson, I think he would be a perfect fit for Batman, and could definitely be an interesting character for an adult comic book.  And if we look at the last chapter of the book, which I found quite interesting, we see how the book would end and where we go from there. Rating:: 3 out of 10. The last book I read is another about a comic book hero.   I was looking for a comic with a female heroine that could be my girlfriend. I read the Wonder Woman comic book, and there were
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You can't even go into the negative review without sounding like a huge dick. I don't think the author has a clue about what a good book should be or should not be. I found this book to be horrible in every way.   If you're looking for a good read, go to a good store. Not a bad one at all.  I was disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished this book, and I am sorry. I've never liked the idea of ghosts, and this book is just a disappointment. I think it would have been better if this book was more a mystery, rather than a ghost story. A ghost story is supposed to be more intriguing, so I could understand the authors trying to create a suspense. However, the lack of a suspense factor really kills this story. I liked the ghost that was in this book. It was a very creepy ghost. But the rest of the story, I don't know if there's an "end" to it. It's a one-shot, and that just didn't do it for me. I didn't have much to say about the characters, as I don;t have much of a problem with them. The ghost, however, was not very well developed or written, but that could be due to my personal dislike of the character. I would give this story a 2-star review, as it really shouldn't be called a "ghost" story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is absolutely amazing, and it's just hard to find a single problem with the book. This one is so engrossing and the plot is a good solid one, but there's nothing about the story that really stands out to me, and I'm not sure that I would have been able to put it down. I was really excited about this one, and to be honest I was a little put off at first by the concept of a woman who has two husbands at the same time, but the idea of two husbands just kind of slipped by me as I read it. I did find it a little strange at first that two men had sex with her at the beginning of the book, but I guess that's just how we do in most of these kinds of stories.   I would recommend this book to people who have been wanting a "satisfying" love story for a long time, and are willing to put up with some oddities. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A story I didn't like, the premise of an astronaut living on a space station is interesting and interesting enough but the story itself is rather weak. There's some great imagery, a good premise and enough plot to make it worth the read but not enough of it. In the end I can't think of anything else I'd like to read from this author. This is a story that I don't think I'd have loved as much if it was about a man who's lived in the city. 1.5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been described as a work of fiction, with a "narrative" and an "artistic" or "illustrative" style, all of which I find highly misleading. The novel is in fact an epic poem - in which every sentence and line contains its own poetry (or, indeed, a rhyme scheme). The prose is so stilted that it sounds like the author is typing at a typewriter. But it is actually very good prose; the sentences are often well-formed, with an occasional slip here and there, but the language is beautiful and clear. I particularly like the prose in the endnotes. It is quite a feat to make a book with a literary reputation sound so poorly written.   (Also, I'm going to assume that the editor did not actually read the book before putting it on the market.) As a reader who loves poetry and who has read only a small number of poetry anthologies, I was very pleased that this book brought some new voices to the table.  I was also surprised by how many new poems there are - it was nice to have a new perspective, even if it wasn't the one I was looking for.  I had already seen some of these poems in other collections, and enjoyed them a lot. (I am looking forward to reading some of the poems in some other anthologies.)   Overall, this is one of the best collections of poems I've ever seen in a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "It was just the opposite. I enjoyed this book a lot. The characters are interesting and the plot is simple, with a few twists. The writing was good and the author never put the story down. I will be buying the book when I get home from work tomorrow. I really enjoyed this reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book. First of all, I don't understand why the woman who wrote the book is trying to pretend this is a feminist book about rape culture and sexism. It was obvious she wasn't a feminist when she wrote this book, but instead a self-centered bitch with a sad ego and a need to be in control. The story was about a guy who is the object of this woman's attention. She is very controlling and manipulative. She had been doing this for years. She gets off on making guys feel guilty about rape and when she finally breaks the guy, she finds out he raped someone else years ago. I thought she was extremely rude to him. Her first book was about an abusive abusive wife, so how could she be a feminist. It is hard to think of a more self-absorbed, selfish and immature person than this woman. I didn't like her book at all, but I was glad it wasn't as bad as the original one. Overall it was a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a disappointment to me. I have purchased all of the books by this author and always love them. They have been on my shelf for years. But after reading this book, I will have to pass on this one. The story is about a girl that starts a relationship with a boy, he is her first love. But she gets caught up in a political campaign that changes everything. I was hoping for a happy ending and I got it. The problem is that the ending was the weakest part of the book.   It could have been good if the author had gone back to that relationship. It is an interesting story that had lots of heart, so it's a shame that it was not explored fully. I didn't find the book to be realistic, there are so many inconsistencies in this book. For example, one character is supposed to be a girl, she has breasts, the other is not. One character can go out with a guy, then switch back, and then go out again with him. This was extremely hard to take, I felt cheated because the writer seemed to have made up these inconsistencies. I do have to say that I did not find this book depressing, it seemed to make you appreciate life and the way it is. Overall this book is a little underwhelming, but still worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed in this book. The story was well written but the writing could have been more original. The characters were interesting but their development was shallow and predictable. The plot didn't advance as well as I was hoping it would.   I would give this book two stars if it were not for the fact that it is not an original novel. It is an adaptation of a novelette by an author who has not written a book since the late 60s. However, that said, this story would have been better served if it was set in the present day (which is what the author intended), and had a different tone. The author is known for his quirky characters and this is his second best book, only this time he decided to use a different approach. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I have read the first few chapters of this book before reading the author's review:  I am not the most educated of people; I was only in high school when I heard about all the health issues surrounding gluten, and have always wanted to check it out. I was a little scared that all of the "miracle cures" will be true, but all I learned about gluten was that it makes people "stupid" and "unbalanced" in some way. The gluten-free diet was suggested as a way to combat the health problems; I went on a gluten-less diet for a few weeks and I found that it did have some benefits, especially for my body!  The biggest thing I learned from my time on this diet was that I do not know much about "gluten" and what it does to people's bodies. I have always felt the need to eat gluten since I was little, but I can understand the argument that it has some health benefits for some people, but that is just not the case with me.  After starting my journey off on the right foot (so to speak), I was excited to learn what other people were doing about gluten-related health problems. I think it was very hard for me to find information that was in-depth and presented well. The only thing that I can find are things like this (yes, I did type that):   "A study has been conducted on the effects of the consumption of different kinds of wheat flour on health. The results suggest that a high-gluten diet can lead to obesity and diabetes in individuals with a genetic disposition toward those disorders. This is because high amounts of gluten induce the release of insulin and increase blood glucose levels, causing the body to absorb a higher amount of glucose. In other words, the more gluten you eat, the fatter you get"  While I agree with most of what that person says, I think that this is a bit of an oversimplification of how gluten interacts with our bodies;  In terms of the effects on our health, there is absolutely no reason for us to avoid gluten in any form. What is important to know is that it can be a healthy part of a healthy diet and that our bodies are capable of processing gluten in a safe and healthy manner.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "We'll get you for your muddying the waters, Mr. Brown."  A positive review:  One of the reasons why The Red Shoes made a great movie is because its author, the late George Roy Hill, was so talented and knew so much about the business of publishing.   He had a vision for the book and used that vision as a guide in writing.  I think the book does a great job of getting at the heart of what publishing really means and is all about.  It's about the money of a book and it's about what publishing can be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a bit worried when the book arrived. The first page of the book had a warning about "tattling" in the book and was printed in bold letters. I assumed that meant it was about a kid who got really good at scratching off drawings on walls. Not so. The book is about a couple who have a very disturbing and weird relationship and they have sex, but only in ways that are really horrible and uncomfortable to watch. I kept waiting for it to get even uglier. Unfortunately, it never did and the couple got a great deal more disgusting as the book went on. I can't wait to read the sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a funny and clever novel, but the execution is just too slow to make it worth reading. A couple of times I was on page 1 only to be interrupted at every turn by a new chapter. Even worse is that the author uses some very bad clichés: people talking about how great the world was, the main character being a wizard/god (which of course makes everything better), etc. The main character's name is "Kirk," and he has no real motivation. He just wants to be a cool guy. This is actually made funnier because Kirk is not really a great guy at all; he's an average guy in a world of the fantastic. If the book had been shorter it would have saved the author from writing a book that could have been a lot funnier and a lot more entertaining. Also, if this had been a novel instead of a short story I'd have probably rated it 4 stars instead of 3.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a good book. My mother read this to me as a child. When I started this book, I was expecting a good story. I was not disappointed. I am happy to have read a good novel. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys children's stories, but who is looking for a different sort of story. The book does have some issues with characters who don't appear to want to be there and some characters who are overly serious. For example, there is an old lady who does not want to help her daughter with her homework and who is also a great big jerk. The author uses this character because she is a character that I like to read about. She does have her moments of being very annoying, but not to the degree that I found her character to be annoying. Overall, this book had me looking forward to another chapter every time I opened the book because of the fact that I was so intrigued by the author's characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book based on a recommendation from my parents. The review I have about the book are based on my reading of the book. I am a bit puzzled why the book wasn't better. This book does not contain many good points and the author had a great story to tell. The characters are very shallow and the book doesn't get going. It's too bad because there is a lot of interesting things to learn in psychology. I don't even understand what it is that the author wants to say in this book. You learn nothing. There are many things in psychology that the authors could have talked about but the book seems to be trying too hard to convince you that psychology is something different than other sciences. The author seems to take great pleasure in making you doubt your own perceptions. It is difficult for me to buy this book because I don' like reading about psychology. The writing style is too slow and doesn't match up to the subject matter. This is a short book that only contains 10 pages.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I got a great book. It has interesting and detailed info about a group of scientists that went to the moon. It is the first and only book I found on NASA's lunar program and covers what they did, how they got there, what went wrong and why. I think I will have a copy with me all the time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a good first experience for a reader who is curious, interested, and a little skeptical. However, for the author, she did a terrible job in this book. The premise of the book is well thought out, but the author had no clue how to tell the story in a way that will be entertaining to the reader. The end of the story, while still good, does not feel like a true ending. The beginning of the novel starts out as interesting, and ends with a book I never would have bought for the same price as this book in a book store. I do recommend this to those who want a good read and would like to have a chance to check it out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (the book's first page) is not so good.   The narration is good, but it's the dialogue that's the problem here.  The first person narrator has this weird accent that makes me think he's from Pennsylvania, and that accent doesn't even sound right in this dialect.  I get the idea that this would be a great book to read to kids, but I can't imagine how you would teach children to write like this.   I'm not one of those people who just goes through the motions, so I don't like the style of writing. It's an interesting take on language, but the use of first person narration makes me wonder whether this writer is trying to be edgy or if the tone is the problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I recently received a copy of this book. I've read other books about the early LDS church and found them to be somewhat accurate. This book is different in that it isn't the history of the LDS church but the history from within Mormonism. Unfortunately, the LDS religion doesn't share my love of books about religious people.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If your goal is to write about a novel in which you feel you might like to read it, you will have a difficult time. The plot is slow and clunky, and, worst of all, the characters are bland and uninteresting. The ending is disappointing and gives little indication of what might happen in the next book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a group of kids in the 90s that play in a sandbox that contains all kinds of things to see. It's sort of like a movie theater with a big old screen.   I didn't like the cover, but I did like the interior. It had lots of interesting characters and a lot of information about the people involved. I think it would have been better if the book had been longer, because by the end it was a bit dull.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think anyone reads many books written by a woman, because I don:t think it is that often that a woman writes something that isn:t just a rehashing of the same old stuff. And for a new writer like myself to read a book like this is: a bad idea. I know I'm not alone in this thought, but it still feels like I'm getting duped. To be honest, I'm more annoyed than annoyed (though that may be due to the fact that I've been waiting for this book for so long) because I can see from the opening pages that there is a lot of potential for good in this book. I'm particularly excited about the character of Gertrude, and I think she:s going to be a compelling heroine. But it just seems like she:d do much better to write a book that doesn?t so closely follow the exact plot of the film. I have a hard time seeing what the author was trying to do with this book except for a generic plot line in which Gert is just some random girl who finds her way into the military. In fact, I would consider this book?s pacing to be worse than that of the movie, which is no great feat to be sure. While it doesn? t seem to have a clear theme, it?s clearly not a novel. I wish this was a nonfiction book, or at least a book where the author could talk to a professional in the military about the military in Vietnam, but that?s only because it? s hard to imagine a more bland version of the book than the one we have here. The only way I could think of to make this book work for me is to change one sentence in this review: It?s hard to picture a more blah book than this one.    I do want to say that it is not a bad thing to read books written from the perspective of someone else. I?d also recommend that you read the other two books by the author. (Hemingway did write "The Sun Also Rises" and "For Whom the Bell Tolls", which were also written from a male?s point of view, and while that is a book I?ve never read, it seems like a nice take on the subject.)  10 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * I have a feeling I'll probably end up hating this book so I might as well write a review before I read it. * What a complete piece of shit this book is. I have been reading the book since I first heard about it and every time I come across a sentence I don't like, I cringe and wonder why they are saying it, only to read that they actually are saying this. The world of this book seems so alien to me because of it's crazy "we're all one, we're all connected" mentality. * I'm just disappointed I can't get past how boring this book actually is. * And as if that wasn't enough, this book takes a bunch of weird plot points from the Harry Potter series and adds on to them. The plot of this is so convoluted I have no idea where to begin so I'm going to just leave it out to not give too much away. * The ending of this novel sucks, as well. It's not that I wanted this to be a happy ending or anything, but I just didn't feel much satisfaction about it. This is the first time I have read a book where I thought "I'll never know what happened next". * Oh god I just hate the main character, he's so annoying and I hate how the author put him on a pedestal in this book. I'm not even going to try and guess where this book ends.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was starting out I wanted to write a book, and when I read some great books, I wanted a book to read. But then I started writing one, and I was surprised to find that I was writing one. I was not expecting to finish the first draft. It was a difficult, difficult book. It had a lot going on for the first half of the book. The story of a single mother trying to raise her two sons after the death of their mother, and how that works in her house. The children, they do not understand why their mother died, and they want revenge. The second half, I thought that was a little too complex to write at first, but it got better as I went along. There were some things that were wrong with the story. It felt a bit too long to me, and then I thought, well what did it matter? I don't care. I just want to know why. It's just a book. I think that's what readers of my books always say:    " I don't care if it's too long or too short, if it has a good ending, a bad ending, whatever. I don' t want to read one of my characters having to get into a shootout and then get shot and then have to escape. Why? Why do I have to go through that?"   I think, if you are writing a book and you just don' ts want to write the whole book, then it makes sense to leave some of the parts out.   Now I think I've got it, I think   that you can take this as a starting point.  When I was first writing my first book, I just wanted to read and read, I did not care what happened to me. When I started thinking about writing the second book I wrote for the publisher.  And then I wrote a book for an agent.  It was my first novel.  What had I done wrong?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book a lot. It was well written, well edited, and really interesting to read about the lives of these two characters. I felt like it was very well-paced, and the ending was very fitting and well-done. As with so many of the things I've read, it's a good and interesting read, but I don't see myself reading it again. I'd prefer something a little bit more "grimdark", or something with more of a mystery or suspense or action to it. I think this is a good thing, but it does get a bit tiring after a while.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on recommendation from my buddy. I liked the book at first but the book got a little boring after a while. A few chapters in I really wanted to know what would happen next and so I stopped reading because I was annoyed by the book. I do not regret buying this book but I wish I would have waited until the end so that I could finish the story properly. I would not recommend this book to anyone because it did not impress me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a bad short story, it is not the worst short story in the world. It is just not all that good. I enjoyed reading it but it is just ok.   (Note: this is part 1 of a series of books. The entire series is available at the Amazon link at the top of the review. The links to parts 2 and 3 are also there.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really should have seen this one coming. This book is nothing but the worst book I have read all year. It has everything I hate about the paranormal genre, including some that I'm not crazy about. For the first couple of chapters, I actually found it interesting that the ghost girl was a bit different from the rest of the story line. She wasn't a ghost at all, and it just made me chuckle. Then, just when I thought that she was going to be the last character in the book, she went and killed her sister. I didn't care for that either. The last part of the book was a bunch of bad ghost stories that had me rolling my eyes. The book is full of "I wish" moments and it didn't end well at all. Don't bother reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am in love with the idea of a great sci-fi book, but as soon as I read this one I was disappointed in its execution. The book starts off promisingly enough with a great lead and nice opening, but then just about every character is a dickhead. I thought the main characters were good, but they just were way too overbearing and annoying. I also felt bad for the girl who got killed off. She was a pretty cool character. I'm really excited for the next book in this series, but I'm just going to say that this book isn't my cup of tea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's an excellent read for fans of The Lord of the Rings and the fantasy genre. The book is written to be as close as possible to The Lord Of The Rings with the added bonus of being set in a medieval setting.  (reviewed the day of purchase)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My friend sent me this book (in an earlier state of readme-ing) a couple years ago and I remember that I loved it and enjoyed the story so much I decided to keep it around until I finished it. But it just got so old! The story was great, the characters are amazing, the plot was good, but this book got stale. As I read, it's like it was written last year and I just didn't care. It's so depressing.  This book got boring and I didn't enjoy it any more.   I don't know why, but I just don't like it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the book is written well but the plot is very confusing, the writing is not that interesting, and the ending is just sad.     1. A very poor ending.  2. The story is confusing. You could go back and forth and never know what happened.  (This is because of the main character who is just wandering around the book)  3. The writing is NOT interesting. Most people will see the book and say the writing sucked  4. The ending sucks. I'm not going to spoil anything but it is sad, and that's about it.     The only book I've ever hated is a book by a guy I really liked and would read again.  He's a good writer but the main characters in the book were just too much for me.  I can't think of another book that I liked so much I never wanted to read anything else by this writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "The book's narrator, who says he was once "a member of the Red Army's'special section' – the secret police – is clearly no Stalin, although he was the author's most important source for the story, and has some useful insights about the Stalinist period. However, there's just so much to dislike about the book – the narrator's constant references to his 'bad times in the SS' and his obsession with the fact that 'Stalin said nothing happened during World War II', which is a shame." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author makes up characters and the events in this book seem to be taken straight out of a tv show. This book is a bore.   I am in my thirties and am in good health. I have read a lot of books on health and had some good experiences but not with this one. I hate how this book is written in terms of a fictionalized version of medical advice. The author writes about how to prevent certain diseases.  One is that people should watch their eating and exercise. I am a health nut and did not watch my eating or exercise.  The last one is that you should make sure that you do not get a cold.  My father has died of a cold since I have been alive.  This is not the way to treat someone with a cold or the way the doctor wrote about it.  It is also not written in a way that a layperson could understand it. The doctor states that if you are not in a good state of health your immune system will not be able to fight off any illness. This is also a myth.  Also, there is no evidence that colds are due to a lack of immunity or any illness that the immune system cannot fight off.  I can not see why the author wrote this.    I would not recommend this book to someone with an unhealthy immune system.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've bought and read dozens of books by Michael Crichton and, for better or worse, every one has been a pleasant surprise. This is one of those books. It's the story of the last living survivor of the ill-fated expedition to the Antarctic ice cap. In the year 2076, the U.S. government has declared the Antarctic a protected site, which has made it extremely difficult to send expeditions to explore it. The government also established the Deep Freeze Expedition, a small expedition with the goal of recovering one of the lost ships from the expedition which went missing in the Antarctic in 2071. The expedition is headed by Charles Bishop (played by Tom Cruise in the movie "The Mummy Returns"). The expedition begins in late 2068 when they make their way to the southern continent. However, the ice cap is now completely covered in a thick layer of ice and they have to make their own way. The crew is made up of a few old veterans, but there's no time to get used to their new equipment. Things start going wrong as the expedition is sent into an icy region where they run into a group of aliens. There's a lot of tension with a few of the members and, in one particularly comical sequence, the crew is locked in a refrigerator and frozen by the aliens. Overall, this is a good book. The plot has a good pace and the characters are well developed. I don't think I'd give this book a higher rating than a 2.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I've tried this book many times and I can never figure out why my family loves it so much.   The first couple of pages, the first time you pick it up you get a feeling that this book is just going to suck.  It is a good story and the characters are interesting and well developed, but you're going to be disappointed when you finish.  I loved the idea that someone would go on a quest to find the world's greatest sword.  This book has a very interesting story and there is a lot of mystery.  The characters are very unique and you get to feel like you're in the story.  However, the characters that we spend the most time with are not really that original.  The king and queen are so dull.  They are the two main characters and they never really have any interesting interactions with each other and they don't really seem like they will get together with the hero, so there are no conflicts to keep you interested.  These are just two very generic and boring characters that don't do anything that is exciting.  If you love fantasy books, then you will love this book.  There are a few things in this book that really upset me.  1.  My wife didn't understand why I was so upset when the prince dies.  He has a great deal of personality and I have a lot more fun reading a book that has my character go on this quest and solve all of the problems.  In this book the king gets sick and it took the main character 2 books and thousands of pages to figure out what was wrong with him.  2.  When the hero got married, it was never explained that he was the king's son and not the king or queen's son.  That's a huge plot point in the books I read when the characters had an heir.   It also takes the main hero and his family a long time to figure things out, that's not really the kind of thing I want to spend a lot longer reading about.   I also wasn't very interested in how the king was feeling when he was telling his children about this quest.  Why didn't he have it explained to him when he had been telling his kids for years that he wasn't going to give up? I really wanted to see the king getting emotional about this and having a flashback.  3.  We know that the dragon is immortal, so it should have
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is quite a sad tale of an unhappy marriage, a child who was never born, the loss of a loved one, and the death of a beloved cat that I can only believe has a lot more heartbreak and pain than a lot of other novels I've read. If you want a little fun, this is a fun read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot was ok (a little confusing, and I'll go into it a bit more below) but there were lots of unnecessary details that annoyed me. I was always frustrated with how they kept reminding me that I'm an animal - and that's not a small detail that I have to keep reminding myself of. In my opinion, the book should have just been the "dog-eat-dog" type of thing, but there was too much of that kind of thing. I have never understood why humans have to be so obsessed with animals - I thought maybe there was something good about the idea that you can't be too close to animals. There was a scene where one of the puppies had a disease and my main character, as well as the other puppies, tried to save it. It was too touching to me. The author could have just had the disease killed. Also, I hate when authors keep mentioning a disease that isn't really an issue. The main character in this book has a disease called lupus. She has it and it's not really a big issue because she doesn't get sick. But the way the author says she has it reminds me of when they say "I have diabetes" when they have it and then say "but I never have diabetes." Anyway, I'd give the book a B+ but I think the fact that there were many things that I couldn't put my finger on kept it down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -  I'm not a great fan of this story. As I've mentioned, the narrative doesn't go anywhere - there are no new ideas and nothing new is said. A lot of what is being talked about is old stuff. The whole story is about a boy's life growing up in a strange family, which is mostly about his mother, his father, aunts and uncles, etc. I don't really understand the point of these characters - a lot of it is just about their relationships with other people. The fact that the story is set in the Middle Ages and is set around a woman named Jodi is just the icing on the cake for the overall negative experience I had with the book.     - I don't feel the book was really well written and I'd like to see it in a paperback. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You are one of the best authors of the decade. You can make me feel good at times and bad at other times. You don't take itself seriously. You just make your characters come to life and make their emotions so clear. You've made me cry.   You're a gifted author, and you make me want to read more. You are on the top of my list of authors to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first one was terrible. The author claims to have the best story. The story is very much a retelling of an ancient Greek myth. The myth has nothing to do with real life. The protagonist is a hero who has saved the kingdom from the worst that life has to offer. The ending is so terrible that I can not even begin to imagine how one can make sense of it. Not sure why someone would even bother to write a review about this book. The only reason I would want to read more of this is because I am curious. My favorite part of this book is the last two chapters. But I have heard good things about The Hero with a Thousand Faces so I am going to give it a try. I'm going to be very disappointed. This book is like a book version of the movies that are so lame. They were never anything more than a poorly written joke. This story is just a big old lie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I read this book at the suggestion of a friend (who also liked the book), and though I liked the story and characters I didn't get the message. It wasn't the fault of the book, but I would have liked to have been more informed about the subject." "When I got to the end I was completely pissed off" "Well, this book, is a bit on the cliché side, but the humor and the story did not disappoint. I had to re-read the book just to make sure I got the point and I still wasn't. I also liked this story about a boy who is about to have his penis cut and is left alone in the hospital while the doctor tells him how to react to such a serious thing. I found myself laughing at some points and other times I just felt sad, like I would be if someone just randomly cut my penis and left me in that same position. I have never read anything like this so I would love to read more books by this author." "This book is a very poor representation of the male experience. This is a book about a man who has a penis which is so large that he has to have it amputated after it gets infected and cannot be treated with any drugs. He was abandoned by his father and was then adopted by his mother and their new daughter. She is not a very pleasant person, and there are many references to her abuse of her children. This makes it very clear what this boy is dealing with. He is left with the hospital and it is left up to him to get it out, or lose it. After the amputation, we learn that he is not the only one with a penis that must be amputated, as his mother also had her male parts removed. I think it was an unnecessary book."

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book. There were a few parts that left me annoyed but then I realized I read it before it was published so I didn't really have an opinion on the actual book. I also liked how it was a little different from other books in the genre. For example, I like the idea of a female knight who is good at her job and just doing the work for the noble people. Also, the whole thing about a young boy learning his father's secrets. This was really nice. However, there were also a few bits of plot that didn't go exactly how I expected. First of all, this is not a light novel. There are parts where she is fighting with swords or fighting against demons or demons with swords, and those were pretty much the only times the heroine showed any fighting skills. I think a lot of people think of these things as the reason why the book is good but they were never the main focus of the story. Secondly, there was a point in the book where a lot more time was spent talking about the author and his books instead of the main protagonist. I don't think the author was a complete slacker in the writing department either; there were a lot times that I would be in the middle of a paragraph and the next moment the character would be talking about something else. This didn't bother me because I never stopped enjoying it so much, but there were times where it felt like an editor got a hold of it. Maybe I read this before the book was published and had to deal with the fact that the book had a different structure. Finally, there is a lot I wanted to write but just couldn't because I was trying to read it for a book club. However I still recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about a female hero but who is not afraid to be a little bit different.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received a copy of The Gist, and read the blurb. The book is actually very fun to read. Although the story was interesting (my son had a hard time understanding the whole thing), it has some of the problems that many romance books have. First of all, the romance is not romantic at all. In fact, I didn't find any romantic chemistry between the characters, which is a bit sad. Secondly, there was too much of the same character traits in the relationships of the characters. Each person had different personalities, and you could tell which character liked whom and which character did not. This book could be very good, and there are many good things to say about it, but it is really not the type of story I would have loved.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this is that the author is at least trying to get it right. There were problems with the story, and the ending was unsatisfactory.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I didn't like this book as much as I liked the first. This is a really good book though!   It is a book about love and loss.   Written by a man who was also in love and lost. It is told through the eyes of his wife, who is in her forties and living in the middle of nowhere with no job or income. Her husband has been out of work for almost a year. He lost his job at a local plant for the same reasons as her. He is a good guy, but he just wants to stay home and take care of the kids and be there for his wife. She wants a job but doesn't have one. They were married for 8 years. He started her career at his company and now he is unemployed. She started in her career in the field of advertising, and now she is unemployed as well.  They are both widowed and have 2 kids who are 10 and 14.  The story is about them coping with their loss and learning to get through the tough times.  This story is really well written and a really sad one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of Neil Gaiman, but unfortunately I don't get to read much of his work as he prefers to work in the world of The Sandman comics. That being said I have a few of his short stories that were collected in a single volume as well as a few other things I was really excited about and was disappointed to find that most of them weren't made available digitally, or maybe I'm just old. I was excited about this series because it had been promised for ages and finally it was released but it's so bad it's really hard to be excited about. I don�t think they can fix the story because it really lacks anything interesting to it and the whole book just lacks any sort of momentum, it's basically a slog. The writing is bad. It really is. I'm not sure how long it takes to read this one but it really drags on and on. The characters are all just flat. And worst of all, the art is terrible. This is by far the worst artwork I've seen Neil Gaimen work on. And the art isn't even good in some parts. The only reason I even gave this a three-star review is because the two-parter The End and The Dream and Other Stories did make it into the trade paperback and I did pick up the second one for a reason. If this book was a complete waste of time then there's no reason to pick it up. The Dream is a wonderful story but the rest of the series isn't good enough to save it. If I had a bad thing to say about it it would be that the art was so terrible that I felt like I was looking at the actual art in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard a great deal about this book and had a hard time choosing between this and The Manchurian Candidate (another highly recommended book). I am not so sure that The Manchu is as good as it was made out to be. This book is much more of a thriller than an autobiography, and as a thriller it is quite a disappointment. As a memoir, I liked a great many things about it: the fact that the author managed to write a great long autobiography on such a complex subject, the fact he is a good story teller and writer (though I did think the author might have taken a few more liberties with some details), the fact the author knew what he was talking about (and has written a good memoir about it), the amazing detail about the life and times of the author, his family, etc, and the fact this is a very well written novel. On the other hand, I was a little disappointed that the story is so limited and the story told so little about the author's life in China, and it was too bad that the book ended at the time he was in his 40s. I guess I liked this book better the second time around. There is a lot of information to take in about the man's life and the political context that made up his life. He did a good job at giving the reader a good understanding of why Mao decided to allow him and other political prisoners to flee to Japan and the way the Manchus reacted to the American "invasion". It is always fascinating to learn how different the views of people can be even if they agree on one thing. The most interesting part of the book to me was the way he described the first meeting between the author and the Japanese ambassador, and when he was finally able to meet with the author in China and find out about his childhood and life, etc. The way the author describes the various Chinese and American political figures from the time were interesting and gave a good idea of what was going on, and this is something that cannot be said about any other memoir I have read in a long time. The story is told in the third person from the perspective of the Chinese American. However, the third-person is not his real voice. The author did a fine job of blending the different voices and voices of the different characters. He does this very well and made the book a lot easier to read, but he is not as good at this as the other two people
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first started reading this book I was impressed by the quality of the illustrations, but even more impressed by how well the stories were conveyed. I found the prose to be a bit hard to follow, but a great introduction to the ideas of The Culture. The Culture is a social/political theory and philosophy with a fascinating mix of ideas.   After the first chapter there is a section on how the Culture is different than society generally and another on how it is different from the United States.  This is a book I'm sure a lot of people would love to read but find a bit too confusing or hard to understand.  The Culture: The Way of Men is an incredibly enjoyable read, especially for those who are interested in social theory.  I can see this being an entertaining read for anyone with an interest in social policy and/or who simply has a passion for reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a waste of my time.   The only positive thing I can say about it is it is short.  It would be a great book for the "What's in a name?" theory. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written in the style of a textbook, so that's a problem.   I got the book from a book store in Los Angeles, but in the middle of the first chapter, I had the feeling that I was going to be reading something along the lines of The History Of The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire.    The book tries to explain how the Arab world's medieval era has changed in a modern sense, and it doesn't really do it particularly well.  The reason it doesn 't is that it is written as if the reader already knows what the medieval Middle East was like and why it was so barbaric.  This would have been much more successful if the author had tried to explain why the medieval period had been such a disaster.  I know it's not the best book on the subject, but I didn't think it was a waste of my time.  What made the book a total failure:  I don't think you can really fault the author for trying, though.  He had an extensive background in Middle East studies and had done an entire Masters dissertation on Islamic civilization.  As a result, he is able to write some interesting and well-researched pieces.  But most of the book reads like a textbook with a good deal of padding.  It also lacks the depth that would have allowed the book to become more than just a quick history refresher.  Unfortunately, this is a bit of a shame since a lot of what he writes on is useful.  In one case, he explains how early modern Muslim kings were able to expand so quickly, so I recommend reading that instead of his short history.  There were also several interesting and useful insights on the Islamic tradition in general.  If only the book had been a little more engaging and a lot shorter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the funniest books I've ever read! It is really funny. The story is a simple one, yet the story and the characters are the real draw here. My only criticism is that I feel the story is slightly stretched, but that is not an insurmountable issue. It is funny! I love books like this that take a simple and relatable situation and twist it on its head! I also love the fact that it is funny in the "pumpkin-spice" way, and not in the wacky-funny way. (The best of both worlds.)   This is such a fun read that makes me smile so many times that I almost can't help but laugh my ass off. It has something to do with everyone getting a second chance.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book through the Kindle app on my iPhone (because I had no internet connection at home) and I have to say this book is a disaster. There is so much wrong with this book that I really just don't know where to begin. There are so many examples of typos that make it impossible to read the text. Also, one of the characters is a girl who appears to be a teenager but is actually 15-16 years old. I have no idea how that could be. The girl gets killed at the beginning of the book but then returns later in the book and is a completely different character. I just couldn't get through the book because I was so confused as to where she was at that particular moment in the story. It was also really confusing to read her description in the first paragraph of the first chapter, where she says:  I was the only one in the car. I was driving on the highway, which was flat as a pancake, as the day had begun to turn to evening, and my brother was driving the passenger's seat. I thought my brother would be able to stop us before we hit the curve. He was driving so slow that I almost didn't see the curve until it was too late. We were only halfway through the curve when I saw a flash. The car shook as if it was being shaken by someone standing next to me, and then I saw the flash again and knew something was wrong. There were no lights on the road so I couldn't see any cars approaching. At the time I thought it was a car wreck but I later learned it was just a car, but I also knew that I was in the wrong car. The road was dark and there was a thick fog so I didn't notice anything until we hit it.  But I did notice a small flash of white and a loud boom that sent shivers down my spine.  As I continued driving, I saw my mother's legs hanging out from the window, her head thrown back, her face twisted in an expression of pure terror. She sat upright and screamed at me to drive so we would not crash into a tree. I knew that my mother was trapped in the passenger seat. The lights of the cars ahead of us caught my mother standing in front of me and I pulled off into the nearest intersection. I tried to open the door but it wouldn't move, and it would have been easier to stay inside. We crashed
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good and well-written book, and I'd love to see more by this author. I haven't given it 5 stars because I'm a little disappointed by the ending, but even a little disappointment can make it all worthwhile. I've already ordered another book from this author, and if it is as good as this, then I will not hesitate to order again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . I'm not interested in reading books that have no redeeming feature.   They are books I don't even want to read.  They don't challenge me at all and usually just bore me, especially the books that are only in the first book.  I've tried to find a book that is the whole package: the characters, the setting, the dialogue, the plot. This is the second book of a series.  As far as this series goes, it does have the potential to be great, it's just not that good.  For me it was just a waste of time, and I don' have the patience to waste my time with some garbage.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If a book is bad, I do not buy it. I don't buy books that are bad either. If a company makes a bad product and a lot of people buy it, then that company should have to compensate the people that didn't buy it because they like good stuff better.   I think the first thing to say is that, if a book has a great plot and is well written, I'll happily buy it if I don,t have to read the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would not recommend this book to anyone.   This book does not teach you how to become a better writer.  I have always wanted to be a writer, but never have.  When I read this book it seemed to me that the author was just trying to put out a bad, boring book.  For me to be able to become an author, I need to work my way up from the bottom.  The good books that I have read and the bad books that have been written, have all helped me.  But, this book has made it harder for me to become successful as an author.  That is a shame.  I thought that this book would have helped me, but the author just made me feel like a dolt.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is poorly written, lacks any real suspense, is very heavy handed on the violence, and the characters are one-dimensional.   At the end of the day the characters in this book don't do a whole lot but you can at least take some satisfaction out of their demise.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My rating   : Out of 10      
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * Please note that I don't expect people to like my books.   I write them and they sell.  It's just that I'm a writer, I'm self-published, and I have a little extra time to devote to it now that my husband is out of the Navy and is a bit better at dealing with the "burden" of a family.  I like my readers a lot, and if they do have a bad experience, then I'm sorry for them.  But I'd prefer to keep it to myself.  My main reason for writing books is to create and entertain.  There is no way I can be that creative when I have that in mind in the back of my mind and my heart in the front.  As a matter of fact, I'd rather have a bunch of kids in a bathtub and go "Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!" than write a book.  *
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... I thought it was one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. My kids and I read it several times because the illustrations are beautiful and I love seeing their imaginations and imagination.   My youngest son and I both hated it.  It's a horrible book that is filled with horrible drawings of ugly characters and a plot where a character dies at the hands of a pig.. it just didn't seem right to me.  I'm disappointed in this book because I thought that it was going to be a book that would help me with some of my anger issues.. we read this book together and I really enjoyed it, my daughter read it with me but I don't think she wanted to read it too.  This book should have been a complete disaster and a total waste of time for all involved.  I've seen a lot of comments on this book that say it should have never been made. I'm all for having a conversation with your kids about the things that make them angry. But this book is beyond that. I mean seriously, this is such a bad idea it's mind-boggling. It makes you wonder how parents can allow themselves to be so completely brainwashed that they would actually allow their kids to read this horrible, awful, ugly book to their children. If you really want to read the book, I'm pretty sure you can find a PDF online that does a much better job of setting the book up to be positive rather than this abysmal mess that has to be made into a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book is often good in some small part, and a good book is sometimes bad in some important way. For this book, I don't like the idea that it's not entirely clear who "he" is. I know the author is a "he", but I am confused about how "he is" different from "she is".   I don  I'm going to be honest: I don?t think the characters in this book were good. I think that they felt too similar and the whole story felt a little too forced and like an extension of the last. I don;t know why I bothered. I do not like these characters, and I will not read more about them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in one night and was left feeling very unsatisfied. I didn't really enjoy reading this book at all. The story is very generic, and the author didn't seem to have any kind of creative ideas about how to write a good thriller/fantasy. I really liked the first book, which was just like a generic medieval fantasy/suspense novel with a medieval twist. I loved the first two books in the series, which are better than the book I just read in one day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is very dull and boring and is not very interesting. I really wanted to read a book about a new form of government and the struggles that face the society. But the author never got around to any of that, instead he just wrote some dull book about history and politics, I really can't think of any other positive or creative ideas he got from the ideas in this book.  My thoughts after reading it:  I guess I'm just too tired of reading a lot of history books. I would rather read a little historical drama or something, and if I'm going to read one about a future government then I want it to be interesting.   This book has been released a while ago and I remember reading about some of the interesting ideas in it a while back. But this book is just boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      It's not a bad novel, per se, it's just not great in my opinion.   As far as the main characters go:  I liked a lot of the characters.  A lot of them got the kind of development that would keep me engaged.  However,   I felt like the main female character,  Mimi, had very little depth.  She didn't seem to really like the people around her, and so I don't feel like she develops as much as I expected.  There are also a lot   of side characters and I felt, like I said, there was less depth than I would have liked.  The writing itself was alright, it was fun.  I had a lot fun reading and that's a rare thing to say.  Also, I found a lot in it that was funny (mostly the things that were supposed to be funny.  But I found it to be mostly pretty cliche.  6.5/10 (This one is for those people who have been waiting for a long time to read this series.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A friend of mine gave me a copy of this book as a gift. I have to say that I loved the book. It was well-written and I enjoyed the chapters about the history of the city. Unfortunately the book has some really bad writing in it. There were times when my eyes rolled back and I couldn't see anything. One of the main characters' lines of dialog was so long that I had to stop the book at around the 8th or 9th chapter. I think the book would have benefited from having less dialog (especially during some of the boring conversations that the characters had with each other). Overall the book was okay.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a hard time writing a negative thing about a book. It's the only genre I do not hate. My son gave it to me and I was able to finish it and finish it quickly and very well. It does take a while to get through all the stories and I did want to skip it so that I didn't have to go through all of the other books he had picked up. However, I couldn't. The ending is very unsatisfying for my expectations and I don't think I will be reading it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very good book. I can't recommend it enough.   My rating: 5 out of 5 stars. The book is an adventure that I absolutely loved. It is very engaging and well-written. I did have some trouble with the grammar, however. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "When I read this book, I was disappointed to see that I had been led to believe that the only way to deal with the pain and anxiety of an abusive relationship was to go on a killing spree. This is a book I will be avoiding for quite some time to come. I didn't need a "shoot-the-dog" message to know what this book was trying to convey--to show us that there is more to this type of relationship than a one-sided kill-and-be-killed. It is impossible to know just what happened in the lives of the couples who lived in this house because the records were never kept. Most of the stories I read about these people in the book appeared in the newspaper and are somewhat sketchy, but the stories that were told are well-told." It seems that the woman who would have been in charge of the dog's "kill" would have killed this dog to be rid of its mess. But that's not the whole story.   The woman did make a very deliberate choice, at the time, to leave the dog alive. The dog was in need of some attention and she decided to keep it, and later, when she was getting ready to get rid of the mess of the previous tenant, she was going to kill the dog and put it out of its misery. This was a real tragedy, one that should never have happened.   I don't know how to reconcile that with her not wanting to be responsible for what happened to the dog, and how she might have tried to protect her child from her decision, but this is the story that I believe she wanted to tell and that she wanted the children to hear about.   She wanted her children to learn about a real problem that people have in a dysfunctional family and not get the impression that the way to overcome this problem is to go out and shoot the dog.   This is not a novel that I would recommend.   There were parts I didn' t like, but I think those parts were unavoidable as a result of trying to try to make a book about one family.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have read the book, you know it's not the first bad book by this author, but it is the first book by the new author of the title, and I was not happy with this book. The writing style is uneven, the plot is rather simple and boring (well, that's what I wanted anyway), and I found it a bit too hard to finish the book.  The book is written as a love story between a man and a dog. In one way, this sounds awesome. In another way, it's annoying. If you love dogs or if you think dogs are cute, you might enjoy this book if you like dogs.     If you like good writing, then this book might be for you.  The plot is really simple: a man (C.S.E.) falls in love with a dog (B.B.D.). The problem is that B.B.'s dad, who owns the dog, is dead. The only thing C.S.'s girlfriend, a young girl named M., wants him to do is to find a way to bring B. B. back. And so, they set off on a journey to find him. This is a novel about dogs, so the writing style will be different from most dog books. And you'll also have to read the other books before this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on a whim because it's the only book I could find where the characters seem to have no problems or troubles to deal with.   They don't seem to care about what they've done, but they still want to make it right because they know it was their fault.  There's nothing wrong with that at all, but this book isn't really about that.  This book had a lot of problems.  It didn't follow through on a lot, so there are a lot inconsistencies with the characters' pasts and what they think happened.  To make matters worse, the author doesn't always follow up on the characters as much as he should.    The first book has characters we like, but then we get no more of them and a lot more exposition about the people who created this world.  Some of this exposition is interesting, but I wish he spent more time fleshing them out and explaining their personalities.  If the book has been going downhill for so long, it's hard not to have high expectations.  Unfortunately, those expectations weren't met.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a great book to read for me, although it's not very "proper" for a first time reader. As I have read other reviews, I agree with others that some of the material may be a bit confusing at times, but I'm sure that it's to be expected for a non-fiction book. The only major thing I didn't like was the section about a woman (probably a first-time reader) who is unable to write her own biography. The author doesn't make it clear when the woman actually writes her own biographical material - instead, the material that she puts in the book is based on her father's recollections of what happened. That's a bit weird, but you still have to trust the woman to do the research and produce the information. Anyway, the book was good and definitely worth reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a fun read, but for me the plot was not as complex or as deep as I would have liked, as well as the characters were not well developed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters were just terrible.   I could not even enjoy the book because of the characters.  The best thing I could say about the book is that it's short enough to read in one sitting, which was a huge plus for me because I had to go to bed early.  I think I was pretty excited to read about "a mysterious little thing who was a good friend and a good soul and didn't think about things like a baby."   However, it did not turn out the way I hoped it would. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy the book. This book was just not interesting. There was no tension and no development in the story. There were some twists that didn't add anything to the book at all, and there was too much plot that made it hard to actually read.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    4 stars  My brother had just read a book called " The Art of Loving " by Dr. Laura Berman, and he was telling me that it was "awesome", and that the author's methods were very effective. I had never heard of Dr. Berman before, but when I saw the book cover I knew I wanted to read it right away! I loved the way she wrote in a very simple but clear way, and how the techniques she uses worked. The problem is that she seems to be the only one doing it, so if it doesn't work for you (which I think is inevitable), you'll have no way of finding out if it is the right thing for you, and thus there is no hope of getting someone to help you improve your relationships. What I found most infuriating was the way the book was written - it felt like she had done it herself in her own way and just called it "the art" - no matter how much it makes no sense.  5 stars  and that was the best advice she gave. I learned a lot about how to love someone I thought I loved. -Jana G., Chicago, Illinois

Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favorite book of all time.   I liked this book.   The main character has the ability to change his shape and form.  He has to do this because his shape is too different from anyone else's.  This means that people don't think he is a human, but his form is a sort of hybrid.  For example, he has a body the way an animal has a tail and he has fingers and toes on his feet.  I have a good friend who is a scientist who studies human bodies and she says he is kind of like a dog.  But this is the point of the book, not the characterization.  You could say it is a mystery as to how he does this, but I think it is more than that.  A scientist friend of mine told me this story but said she found it a bit confusing, not that she wasn't interested in it, but that she had a hard time connecting all the different things I wanted to know about it.  So I went to Amazon and got the audio book. It was a very good read but the character was very difficult for me to like. I would like to know more about how he did it. I think if he had a stronger female role model, he could have been a stronger and more compelling character.  The romance aspect is a bit annoying and could have made the book better.  (It's not that the romance was bad, but it's hard to care when he's trying to hide what he is from her.) The ending, while kind of nice, is a little anticlimactic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You should only read a bad translation or a book that has been translated from another language.    If you want to know what a book should be like in English, look for a book written in English by people who have read and enjoyed the original.    If you don't care about English translation quality, skip this one.  This is a very good book, even if you don' t want to translate it. But the quality of the translation is so poor that it is impossible to trust it.  The translation is completely inaccurate and unreadable. The author clearly didn't bother to understand Japanese grammar or pronunciation.  There is nothing wrong with the original but the poor translation makes the book very hard to follow.  It is difficult to translate a book into a language that is not your mother tongue.  When I first tried to translate this book, I felt like it would be very difficult to understand. But after looking at a few more translations by English-speaking authors, I think that this translation is probably the least accurate one available.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I knew this book so that I would have had the time and energy to get through it. I had high hopes for this book because it has the makings of a good story about a good guy who's trying to be a good man. Instead, what it becomes is a complete and total disappointment, a waste of time that you will hate reading and one that made you laugh at least four times (including a really funny joke about a person who is "puffed up" and "gruff"). If I had known what I was in for, I probably wouldn't have spent all that time reading it. In fact, I might have put it down immediately. But then again, you can't know. In any case, I've tried so hard to like this book... and now that I know what I'm getting into, I'm pretty sure I'm never going to enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (This review is from a second edition, not a second printing!)   It took me a while to get into this book, and I'm glad I did.   The book focuses on an "emotional journey" of two people who are "unworthy of love."   As the book title suggests, the two of them have two distinct emotional states.   I really enjoyed this approach.   We are so often told about the "emotionally unavailable" or the "weak" or "abandoned."   We are often told that these are the types of people who should not be in a relationship.   These are the people we are trying to convince to be with us because we think we are a great match.  I thought the author's approach was unique and helpful.  My one problem with the book was that the chapter where the author described her relationship with her ex and how it affected her as a result was over-exaggerated and, I thought, unrealistic.  It didn't show how it really affected her emotionally, but the author was clearly trying to illustrate how important the emotional state of one of the partners was in terms of being able to have an intimate and healthy relationship.  Her book is well-written, well-organized, and a good read.  In addition to being informative, I enjoyed the author.  She was honest with her readers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a couple of these in the 1980's. The first one was a romance and the last one was about a young girl who gets a big blow-job and then turns into a cock-eyed monster with big fake tits.   If you don't like sucking cocks you have no business reading these books.  I had a book about a girl who sucked a cock and turned into a monster, but not that many of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book is not a good read.   You see, this book is NOT an introduction to the history of the Church, or an account of any of the events that took place at the time of the death of Joseph Smith or Joseph F. Smith. That would require a book that can be published and sold. This book is a history of a very small percentage of those who participated in the events at the death (or death) of the Prophet Joseph Smith in the early 1800's.  .  The book contains three main chapters that deal with the events of 1820 and 1823. They are:   1. The first chapter is titled "The Origin of Mormonism" and was written in 1826 by the Rev. Jonathan Dunham. His book is based on his personal investigation.  a. It details his investigation of what was being said about the Prophet Smith in some places in the country and his understanding of what the Prophet was saying. His study and investigation was based on what was happening then and where. In other words, he was just following what people were saying and doing and not making up anything.   that I have found very interesting.   it says:  .  1. It is not the history that you may be expecting. I was surprised to learn that there were no documents proving the Smith family was a polygamist, that polygamy had never been practiced by Joseph Smith, or that he had had an actual marriage ceremony performed. I found the evidence for the two polygamy claims in the History of the church to be very weak, and even weak evidence for one was pretty damning. A good example is the fact that Lucy Mack Smith claimed that Joseph Smith was present when she got married. Joseph Smith had already claimed he was present, but had given no proof. In 1835 a family member named W.W. Phelps claimed to have the marriage ceremony and the documents proving it, however his own family rejected the documents as fraudulent. He was also found to be using forged documents to get people to believe in him. In fact, I have received a letter from an old man who was a member of the Phelps family, claiming that there was no evidence to support Lucy Smiths claims of being married to Joseph. B. The second chapter is a summary of the history by Joseph F Smith. It describes the period of the Smiths involvement with Mormonism which begins in 1823 when the Smith was in New York and stops at the same
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an oddity. I love many fantasy books, and the genre has produced some great books, but most are just a little too dark, or too darkly drawn. This one, though, was too weird and too odd. The author makes a point of using a lot of double-entendres, and it comes across as pretty weird. There were some very clever puns, too, and they worked well. Also, this book is a little short (only three hundred pages, which is rather short by fantasy standards), but it's definitely worth reading if you're into these sorts of books. (3 stars)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was disappointing to me and it will probably not be the last. I was disappointed because this was a re-read of my favorites that were written decades ago but had little to do with what has come out in recent years.  I know I'm in the minority but it was not fun at all to read. As it was mentioned above, it has nothing to do about what has taken place in the last few years. There's not even a character in this book who I really feel like I can connect with. I think the real purpose of this book was to showcase the work of a younger author.   "He's a genius, that's the thing" was a quote that came to mind while reading this.  The book is really about a college student who gets involved in the "progressive" movement and is drawn to the idea that women are oppressed. This is the book that I wanted to re-watch because I thought it was about the same sort of ideas that I'm trying to tackle in my own life. But in this case I didn't like it.  While I was enjoying the college life and socializing with people who had a different point of view than I did, I was pretty disappointed that there wasn't any change in my opinion of feminism. The main issue that I have with the feminist movement is that it's often based around victimization. When people are victimized, there is no empowerment. The only people that are empowered by being a victim are those who have been victimized. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher and enjoyed it a lot. But the writing isn't the best. There are some grammatical and stylistic problems with the style of the book. The writing style is pretty simple for a book of this size, with a lot of long words and small paragraphs. Most people won't have much trouble following the stories but people who want a little more technical reading may find it difficult. And if you are not looking for more technical or academic material, then you might be disappointed. The last thing I want to say is that this book has no author credit and no author's note. So, I'm not sure how the author managed to get the publisher's attention to give them a copy of his book. I would give this book 4/5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book sucks. It's boring as hell, and I felt like there was an underwhelming amount of development and depth. I'll admit it was a fun read, so it's not a huge loss, but I'd give it a 6 or 7, since I would have loved to have seen more from the character. The author is also trying to create a romance between this couple, but it just doesn't work. The "romance" was a lame attempt to pad out the book (which really just makes me feel like the author didn't really know what she was doing at all) that just makes you want to throw it away. It was really sad, and it made me feel so bad for their relationship. Maybe next book.  Posted by Samantha K at 6:22 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've bought this book twice. The first time it didn't work for me, and the second time I took out a new copy.   It doesn't matter whether you are writing for kids or adults, it is fun, educational, and easy to read.  If it was an option to just say this book was so-so and skip it, I would have.  There are a few plot holes in this book that didn't make it into the book, but the writing is so good and the character development so believable that it isn't a big deal.  I'm going to start a new series now that will be based on this book, and it is sure to be awesome!

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters in this are all bland as hell, and when they're not in a constant state of depression or despair, the characters are usually a complete and utter waste of space. The main character is like the generic male protagonist in a manga, which is the first reason this was a huge letdown.   I'm pretty sure the "hero" is in love with the girl, but that's the least of it. The way they deal with her is pretty awful too. I don't think they realized that if you're going to make a harem manga where the MC gets all the girls and the guy is in the backseat all the time, why not go a little further and let the other characters actually have a personality? It's a really annoying and annoying story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of the Twilight series and I have read all five books.   This is a really bad book.  I thought the characters were interesting and the plot was well developed, but I did not find the books to be exciting.  The romance was so rushed it was confusing and it felt like the books were rushed by the author to get her books out in a timely fashion.  If you are a fan of a good book, then you will enjoy this book. However, if you want to read about the first time a vampire goes on a date with a human, and if you are not a fan, you should just skip this book and go to another series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So, I picked this up off amazon for the price and i was expecting an ok read. It's basically about a kid in the 90's who has just graduated high school and gets stuck in a gang for a few weeks. It gets a lot of bad reviews on this site for the same reasons that everyone has said about it and it's the same thing. It is nothing but a story about a guy living with a group of kids. It doesn't get deep at all and there's no real emotion or character development except in a very slight amount. It also tries to say that the kids in the group act like total assholes for no reason but it fails at this as well.The writing in this book is quite awful. The character's speech is quite monotone and is the most boring part of the book. I really don't see how anyone could enjoy a book like this. The ending, while not a horrible ending, it doesn't have the emotional impact that I thought it would have given the book was about a group that are acting like assholes just to get money. It was a waste of the author's time and i just wish it had been different.This book is basically a rehash of another book I have read by the author. You get to see him try to make something new with it, but it just doesn't work. If you're looking for a fun read that won't give you anything interesting you'll like this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (if the author ever responds) If you want to write a negative book review, the first thing I'd suggest is to do so with some perspective. In the book the main character's parents are portrayed as evil, and that in itself is bad enough. The badness of the portrayal is compounded by the fact that she herself believes she has done nothing wrong. (I have no idea if that was the case, but if it was, her mother should have told her that a) she was doing nothing wrong b) her father wasn't really in charge of her life, and c) if she had wanted to keep her parents away from her, it would have been much easier if she just had a lawyer.) I have a hard time putting this book down when it's in my hands (despite the fact I don't read or watch television), and it's always something to talk about. I wish this book were more popular.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book can be the best one.   I wish I had gotten this book sooner.  "The Blackest Eyes" is a very dark and disturbing story.  It has a lot of gore and sexual imagery.  The story revolves around a man who is obsessed with the sex organs of a group of teenagers.  One day the man has the opportunity to meet a local girl named N'Diaye.  They have sex, but the girl is pregnant.  Now the man finds that his "loved ones" are starting to die.  In the end N'diaye, her friends and their families are all dead.  My favorite part of this book is the main character.  He is so well written that it was hard to read.  His backstory, feelings, thoughts, etc are realistic.  I felt for him throughout the book.  There are many ways you can think this book can have been better.  You could have a darker story. You could make the characters more sympathetic.  That being said the story is still interesting and will have you thinking about this story for a long time.  This is definitely a book to be read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the book, but the author's tactics were wrong. He was being too negative. I'm still very glad to have bought the book because I was just hoping he would do better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and enjoyed it. Unfortunately I have very little patience. In the end the book was too much of the same (I like a challenge but this was too far removed from my original goals.) I would have preferred something a little lighter or a different theme. Overall it's not a bad read and I would recommend it for the fact that it was entertaining and not boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really know how to explain this book's problems. The plot doesn't work well, the characters are flat, the language is pretty gross, and the plot is totally unoriginal. I am still hoping for a sequel to this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book, but it fell flat on its face. I was hoping for a good story. It didn't live up to expectations. The characters aren't likable or realistic. The author didn't write with them in mind. There is no plot. It's just a bunch of characters trying to kill each other and nothing else. It wasn't interesting at all. It made for a boring read.   I have been very pleased with the service of these books, but this one just disappointed. There were a few really funny parts that I couldn't put down. But overall, I don't think the book has much going for it and will likely not be picking up the next book in this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a few things about this book that make it so amazing:  It's written by a woman.  It has a great plot and characters.  The sex scenes are hot.  Some of the sex scenes I would argue are not as hot as some of the more recent stuff that has been written.  (Yes I am just as guilty as anyone.)  It contains a story about a very small town that is completely and utterly destroyed.  While I can't say that it has a huge amount of "drama", this is an adventure story so the sex stuff is a little over the top (and that is saying something considering the content).  The "magic" and spells used were pretty cool.  This is a story that will really stay with you and it does so in the most beautiful way.  I really recommend this book.  Recommendation:  If you are a fan of Adventure/Romance fiction, I can not recommend this enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read most of these books, and I cannot find one positive thing to say about them. It is hard to say why I have not liked most of them, since it is not like I am not a big fan of any of these authors either. That said, I have found that the majority of these are not very good books, so perhaps it is just that I have never read a book by some of these writers before.     This book is a story about two very different people, a man and a woman, who meet on the street on a certain night. They have different ways of seeing the world and different ways they react to the world, but they both want to change the world for the better. In a very short time (about two weeks) the story turns into one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. The first part of the story is about a woman named Mary who has been raped by a man. She goes to a doctor and gets a consultation for help. After she does some thinking about it, she has a very bad idea. So, she tells her doctor that she wants to have an abortion. The doctor does his job and he gives her an abortion pill, and she gets some of the money he gives for it. However, the next morning, she is unable to get up off the floor. The doctors says that it is a common side effect of the abortion pill (which is the main character's name) so he tells her that she might have to have it repeated, or that it might have been the abortion that caused the side effect. She feels a horrible guilt and says that she will do whatever she has to do to keep from ever having the abortion again, which leads to her deciding to take a different method of birth control. This leads to the second part of this story. It has to be one of my favorite books I've ever read, it is really disturbing and graphic. There are so many descriptions of the unborn child that I just kept thinking about them while reading this book. I'm just glad I finally finished reading it, because I loved it so much. The story is just amazing, the first half is one of those amazing horror stories that just grabs you and never lets you go. I was just in shock every time I thought about a different scenario and every time the characters reacted in a different way. I don't want to spoil the rest of the book, so you'll have
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received a review copy of this book from Goodreads, and was very impressed. It's a well written book that is very easy to read. I will be giving this book to all my friends. :)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * I enjoyed this book very much. It had a very clear, easy-to-follow plot. I really enjoyed the character interactions, and I enjoyed the fact that it was a very unique take on this genre. However, I didn't like the story. I wanted more. I liked the concept, and it was easy to see where the story was going, but the story itself just wasn't that compelling. There were a few plot holes I kept pointing out, and even after reading the book I didn' t feel it was quite as good as it was being made out to be. I'd like to try this book again, but with a better plot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (The first review by a reviewer saying they gave it four stars is a bit too generous: it isn't really a good book.) This book is full of some really interesting and useful insights into how we think about information. One interesting finding is that people use the first book they read to determine their reading level and that, in fact, the most important question to ask when reading a book is "can I understand what's going on here?" and that this question is very different from what it is to ask "is this book any good?". The first book is important because it helps you figure out your reading level, which means you can go on to read more books at that level which is good for you in some sense. The second book is also good for those who like to have a sense of accomplishment, so if you do like books with meaning, then you'll want to read The Secret Things, which is the third book in the series.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first started reading "The Book Thief" I was absolutely enthralled. From the beginning I was enthralled with how the author uses her characters and the way her writing was so well developed. I love how she makes each character feel so much more developed and relatable. It's also so well paced that by the time the book was over, I just wanted to keep reading. I just wished that she could have continued the story and not told a completely different ending (I guess we will never know why that particular one was cut out of the book) and that maybe she would have continued her main character's growth. I also wish that she had included more of a background on the characters, so we could understand what they did in their youth, but it didn't seem that way to me (although I am always interested in the background). Also, the story could have just been about the main characters and a different setting to the story would have been fine. Unfortunately, that was not the case. If you're into historical fiction, I think you'll like this book. If not, I still recommend you read it just because it's good writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so flawed that you just have to be a jerk about it. You would have to have to go to hell to be so much of a cunt that you spend $24 on a book that leaves so many things out that I would have loved to know.   I know people get the idea that it is a mystery/suspense/spy book. So many people have been waiting for this book and many are disappointed. Not only do I not get the big twist ending I was hoping for, but also, it is all very one-sided and the author tries to explain why she would give us the twist that she did by making it clear that it was something that she was very much planning all along. It just doesn't make sense.   The mystery is not solved at all. The characters are not fleshed out. The villains are not bad guys. The main story was a waste of time and you are left wondering what the hell is going on. The book is very hard to follow. The author needs to write a mystery that is not about a murder mystery, is not a romance, and is not an adventure story that uses science as a crutch.   at least I can tell that the writer has been around for a while and her writing style is more than the average first-time writer would have, but I still had to keep reminding myself that this is not the first book she has written.  7 of 7 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was good. I had a problem with it for one or two passages but after a couple of rereads it didn't bother me.  I can't give it more than 4 stars because it is a bit too much. I don't dislike it, I just didn't love it. This book is about one family in South Africa. I read this in a language class. The parents were both in school but they were divorced by age 20. It seems they lived alone for a couple years and then got remarried. There are a couple chapters about them. There is a description of their house and a description about their daughter. She is 6 and she goes to school with two other kids. There was a picture of a kid in her school. There's a description and a picture in the book but no name or place. One kid was missing one ear. There were other little things and this is what got me. There seems to be a description every time the girl sees a black man and this description was not as detailed as in the other book by this same author. The pictures were not very good. One of the boys is also missing an ear.  I don't think I am alone in disliking this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an excellent book for children and teens. I'm one of those people who thinks every book has to be good to be worthwhile. This is not one of them. It has some good moments but has so many things wrong with it that I am left thinking, "Why the f*ck would anyone read this?!" This is a great book to read to kids and adults and for older kids to get them reading again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't enjoy the book. I feel that there are a lot of mistakes in the book and that the author is being very sloppy with the grammar. I don't mind errors in a good book, but there were so many grammar errors in this book that it wasn't fun reading. I also didn't like the book's subject matter. I can't remember many details of the book, as I kept forgetting some things. There are some minor plot issues, but for the most part, I would give the book a C-. I did enjoy reading this, however, and it was entertaining. If you want a short, fun story about two boys who accidentally become "The Doctor" and a little girl who helps them, then you should read this.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book really did not help me with my decision on whether or not to become a vegan. I had heard the hype about it and really wanted to read it. I went into the bookstore and the only thing I saw were vegans and I was like I don't know where they all are... and then I saw vegan books and they weren't even vegan.. it is really bad.. I don t even know how to describe it.. what I really want to say is "I hate it".. It is really really bad and not a good start to my vegan journey. I hate this book so much and I know a lot of other vegans hate it too. I will just put this here: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this case, I just didn't like the book enough to read it again.   There are things I didn't really like about it.  I'd like to see a sequel to this series.  There's nothing wrong with writing a sequel, but if you're not good enough to write a book like this and it's not as good as the first, then that's a problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author does not like to use'real' people, he prefers to use imaginary characters. As the book starts he has to decide who to have as a real person for the readers and the author does his best to get them as convincing as possible. I don't know why the author has to use such fake people. I understand that some characters are to be used for the story but they need to be believable and not too ridiculous. It can also be annoying to be stuck in the character for so long, as they seem so shallow. I like to have my character change and mature, but this is too far in some cases and just makes the story even less believable. There are some cases where the character is very different from the author's intention but it is so far out of the characters mind that they're really not believable. Also some characters just come off as not'real'. I liked the author who did not write about a particular area, but instead a wider picture that would hopefully interest others. A review by an 'expert' is just another review by someone that knows very little about what they are talking about. The author's explanations of the theories is confusing, he claims the world was created 5.000 years ago or 6,000 years or something but the author states they have seen the proof at different locations around the world. The theory is that some people have a different DNA from the normal humans, this is why the world looks so different from everyone else's. A book of this nature has to be written by someone who knows about the scientific theory of how the world is formed and what makes up the Earth, it is not a book about the creation of the world and how it evolved into what it is now. I thought the ending was too abrupt and I wanted the author to explain it a bit more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this on a "Thank You!" holiday gift list. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this was a novelization of a tv-series. I have seen this a few times on tv (including one of my all-time favorite shows, "Star Trek: Enterprise" ) and knew a lot of it already, so I was actually looking forward to it. I did enjoy the show a lot, but I do not watch much tv. This was a little too short to be worth it. One thing I found out in the beginning was that the characters all speak the same language. They all seem to know a bunch of common phrases, but they all had to learn their own language. It was quite difficult for me to understand some of the dialogue because it was not easy for me.  I do appreciate the effort that was put into making the characters seem believable.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book. I've read through several of her books and I have always found her to be a very talented writer, but this one really let me down. First, there is very little to choose from in the beginning of the book. All the characters have names that are well known, but their motivations are unknown. I get that most of them are in love with one another, but I don't feel like this is an adequate explanation for the actions of their love. As a result, a lot of the story simply revolves around the love interest and her struggle to get close to her target, and it is a very long journey. The other main character, Elisabeth, is a boring and generic "nice" girl who spends most of the time thinking about herself and her life. Her motivations are never clearly explained and when you think about it, she never really has a story of her own. There are two other female characters who are not really explored much, but have great potential to become main characters in future novels. As for the supporting cast, most of us will find out what is going on in time and we are left with a lot more questions than answers. I really wanted to love this book, but my interest was just never very sustained. Recommended for those who like the kind of stories with a strong female lead.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book, which is well written and has a good balance of character development and action, is more a case of having a good story with a bad ending than the book is bad, I was just not drawn in. However, the ending was so abrupt, and I was so upset by it, it made me doubt the validity of all the work that preceded it, the characters, the world, the events, and the plot.     The plot of this book is good, but it is not compelling enough. The pacing could be better, however, the novel could be improved by introducing more information and less plot holes at a quicker pace. There are some plot holes and it felt as though the story was going nowhere at a faster pace than it needed to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The first time I read this book I just kind of laughed out loud because it was so awful. But as time passed I started to see how badly the author messed it up.  I am not much of a fan of the horror genre, so I went in with low expectations. But I was absolutely horrified by this book!  The thing that annoyed me most about this book was that it was just so terribly written. The first part of the book is pretty horrible; it is just so slow and confusing. Then the book kicks in and gets REALLY dark and terrible! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "This book has a number of issues with it, but as a whole, it's just a bunch of awfulness."  " I really don't have any strong opinions about this book.   It's a fairly standard fantasy novel; there are a lot of 'bad guy' type characters and a few good ones, but for the most part it's your usual boring hero trying to do good.  "    Review by Sarah - December 9, 2017 - December 13, 2017 book review This book is a great example of how not to write a fantasy novel. The main characters are all evil and their story is all about vengeance. I'm a big fan of The Black Company books by Jim Butcher. In these books, the main characters were the good guys, but in this book, they turn out to be the bad guys. I can see why the author did it, because the book could easily have been a classic. The problem is that the characters are not believable. They're not even likable, in my opinion. They act more like caricatures. They don't act like people, and the author doesn't seem to care about the actual feelings or thoughts of the characters. It was a very frustrating and anticlimactic book that ended on an extremely unsatisfying note. This book would have been better with a lot less characterization. There were only a few pages for the main character. There is no backstory, and nothing about the characters or their relationship in the story.  The best part about the book is that it's not too long. I wish that the author could have finished it. I just didn't enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this book is terrible.   The story has some good bits but there are a lot of awful bits too.  The best bits are the moments of fun, the adventure of the young, and the funny moments of banter between the characters.  It has a plot that is mostly okay but I don't feel like it is worth the time it takes to read it.  A book about a girl who loves a dog (and that dog does not mind when she has a human in it's life) that is basically a collection of funny moments is not worth the 5 stars it gets.  I gave this 3 stars instead of a 4 because I thought the characters were likable and the writing was good.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just so boring, so repetitive, and so lacking in any kind of entertainment value. It starts off with a "I'm sure you have all heard about this book" thing. So I guess they didn't even bother writing out the synopsis. It has nothing original or funny to say about this story. I read an article about a scientist that made a video game, but I don't think they even put in a single quote of his work. And for a story that is supposed to be funny, there's almost no humour or humor at all. It is a very boring and repetitive story that just makes you want to turn the page. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book, but the author's description was very unhelpful.   The book has a lot to say about racism and anti-blackness, but it's so riddled with mistakes that it's hard to find something worthwhile.  The only thing I think is interesting about this book is that it talks about how prejudice can be based on things like the color of skin and a lack of privilege.     I don't see how that's relevant to the real world because the author (who claims to be from the hood) claims that the white people in his neighborhood weren't racist, only he was.  So while the book talks a lot about racism, it doesn't really deal with anything that I can relate to in real life.  This book had a lot of potential, but I was disappointed by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The main character, Jodie is too passive, her mind is not in it.  Her sister is the opposite, she's always active, she always thinks of what's next.   "The story takes a turn for the worse as soon as Jody finds out about her sister's infidelity, which she never told her.  When Jodys sister finds out, she runs and hides but Jodies sister goes to her house and has a nice chat with her.  The next scene shows Joday coming home to find a message from her sister, she tells her that she's pregnant and that her husband is cheating on her and that she will be back.    Jodi then calls her dad, she doesn't know what she's talking about, but her dad tells her to stay and not tell her sister.  Jodays father's response was that she should always tell a friend.  It's such a stupid thing to say, but she does.  What a silly little book, Jods sister comes back with a baby, which makes her upset.  Then Jodia's mom tells her a story about when she was a baby and how her dad was taking her to the store.  I don't care what Jodhie thinks, she never has to tell anyone, not even her mom...   I really did like this book, but I can't tell you much about the story.    I did like Jodlind, and I did want to hear about her relationship with her parents, it would have been nice to hear more about that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not a good book. I liked that it had lots of action, which wasn't surprising given that a movie was being made. It's just really, really bad, and that was the first thing I noticed.   The art is pretty lame.  It is very difficult to imagine the story told in the book's style.  I don't know how they did it, but the book is written with a heavy-handed tone that makes a lot of the narrative look like it's written in third person. I don`t like it.  How do you feel about reading stories?     I'm not sure. I read a lot, but my favorite genres are fantasy and mystery. I would say that my favorite books are ones where the author is telling a complete story.  In the case of this book, the author was making it up as he went along. The story starts out with a man who is trying to bring in a new client, and the only way he can do it is by putting himself in terrible danger.   It's an unusual idea to begin with, but it does work. In the end, the story is very short.  This book is a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have always been a fan of Stephen King, but even more of John Stephen King. The first two Stephen King books I read were excellent, but I have to say that this one really wasn't. It has a bad ending and is just a mess. If you like King you should give it a try, but don't read this book expecting a great read.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I loved this book.   The plot is a bit predictable, but not by that much.   But I really enjoyed the characters.  A boy who was born in a brothel finds his way through life as a street   street  rapper.  It's not exactly a happy story but I can't say it is all bad.  3.5 Stars This is my favorite book in my collection. The characters and the story were a joy to read. I was looking forward to reading it again for sure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        So, I bought this book because of the rave reviews by other readers, and I wanted to hear what they thought.   The story is about a woman who gets a job at a private military company.  She is hired by someone, but her boss is not very pleasant. She is put into a small barracks, and the only other women are the wives of the men who work there.  The woman is very lonely, she is always thinking about her mother and sister and when she finally gets a chance to go out, she meets a young soldier with his mother in tow.  My main problem with the book is that I thought she was a terrible narrator.  There are parts when she talks so much, and even sometimes when she is not talking, it feels like she is still talking.  This happens a few times in the book, and it feels very unnatural for the narrator to sound this way in her first person narration.  I don't think this is a matter of voice actress not being able to act.  It was actually just that this story was not believable to me.  In my opinion, it would have been much better for the woman to have the book read to her by another narrator. The book is not bad, it is just not believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I got this book, was because the reviews on Goodreads gave me the impression that the book is not good. The only reason you would even read this book is to understand how a book can get so much negative feedback. But, at the same time, I got a good idea of why a book would get so many reviews and positive reviews.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     "I really like it. I do like a good book and a good author. I'm not a fan of books that are purely for "self-pleasure" like the title suggests. If this is a good example of an author with talent, I don't like it." "This is a nice story. Good plot, good character. I think it has a couple of interesting ideas. I don 't understand why everyone hated it though." "Just a bunch of boring characters in a boring world, no plot and a boring ending." "The plot is weak at best, and the ending is lame. The most interesting characters don't even make it out of the prologue." "My problem with this book is not so much that it's bad. I just really liked the first part of the book. This is a shame, because it's a really good, long-winded, philosophical tale. I really like that."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read and listened to every book by John Galt, but he just does not sound right to me. I do not like the constant comparisons he makes between himself and the government, especially when the government has not kept our country safe. I feel like his voice is always echoing out into a society and we are all just the same. I have never seen a man so angry. I will never buy another one of his books.  My favorite book of all time (so far)! By: jaydee Location: Austin, TX Eyes: Blue Skin tone: Medium I agree, it is one of the greats. A must read, and I'm so glad you had the opportunity to review it. The only thing I wish I could add is that the book has more insight into society than most. It could be even more of a dystopia, but it's too easy to assume that. One more thing, don't give the title, "The Last of the American Revolution", to a book with that title. This is the American revolution as you've never seen it before, with all the ramifications and implications it has. It is a book of hope as it is the last and most dangerous of the revolution.  the last of american revolution By: JohnGalt87 Location: The Great Pumpkin State, Ohio Eyes: Green Skin tone. Medium This book is the only one I've found that has a little bit of humor about life, death, and the state of the world. It's a great book to read for anyone who is not a libertarian.   It's a shame the author got so caught up in his personal crusade to get everyone to read his book because the book does not make a lot of sense.   and it's pretty easy to see that you can just skip that part.    For me, it was just the final section of the book that was worth reading. It gave a better idea of what the end of the empire was going to be like, and where we were headed. I wish he did not get caught up with his crusade to see people read his stuff.   that was pretty good stuff By: Lobo2222 Location: Wisconsin Eyes: Gray Skin tone  As a libertarian the book makes me sad that the world is so screwed up. I find it amazing that we still have governments in a free society.   the ending of this book was great as well and a bit surprising.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A novel I read last week I thought was amazing, but the ending was awful.   The author had this beautiful way with words, and I could feel myself getting swept away by his story.  Then the ending came, and it just ruined it.   The only reason I finished this book was because I had a hard time coming to terms with what was happening.  The writing itself was so smooth and so well done, but this was the only thing that I felt like ruined it for me.  When I thought I had read a perfect book, I got sucked into what felt like a story that just kept getting better and better, but what I got instead was something that was just a little too perfect.  For the story, it did a lot for me, but I wish there was more depth.  I could have used another book or two to get the full experience. I would have given it a 5 out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -The main character is so immature that his first sentence is "I'm a fucking loser. The last thing I want to do is do anything that will give a good impression of me." This is true, but the real problem with his first attempt at writing is that he doesn't even realize how stupid it is. Even though he tries really hard to make up for it with a second book, the first one's just so inept, it's not even funny. He should be ashamed.        I just bought this book because I liked the cover art. Not the cover. The book. But... this book sucks! The character is a douche, and the story is just stupid. This is the first book in the author's My Favorite Genre series, so I knew I had to read this book (or at least the first in the series, but I was disappointed that the author didn't even try to create a more interesting and realistic world). He does try a bit, but he just doesn't get it right. The main character's self-deprecating attitude just made my blood boil. I thought that the other characters in the book would be fun to listen to, but they were a total waste of time. The best characters are just sort of... there. I didn't feel like I cared about any of them.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The protagonist was a very shallow person. I didn't like him. If he is going to make a decision that could have a positive impact in the plot, he should use some common sense. This book was too long, too confusing. I had to skim the book because I was too tired to understand it.   I would recommend this book to people who don't like to read or people who are really bored. I would definitely re-read this book if I ever felt bored.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As I have said before: the book does not tell a good story, and is mostly written by way of a bad story, but I am still intrigued enough to want to read it. The best part is when the author reveals that she is a child, and was the reason she did not want to live with her parents. So the idea that she could be a child again and have such a beautiful and happy life with the love of her life, and also with someone that can be her mother is a great idea, but the execution of this would have been better if she could have been more consistent about the age, her own mother, and her own parents.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book back in 2011 when I was in high school. I think it is a great book, but it is just not that interesting. The writing style is kind of funny and not that original. And it is actually more boring than I remembered, though I didn't realize how boring until I finished it. It just doesn't stand out that much from the other good fantasy novels I have read recently.
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I would highly recommend this book to everyone! It is well written and the story is interesting. I was a bit surprised when I found out that it is about the early days of WWII, which is when the American soldier really started to get good at his job. I'm also a history buff and this book gave me a good sense of just what life was like in a combat zone during WWII. You can also see some of the issues that were going on with the military at the time. This book is not a history book about the war, it is a story that you can see the man's life through. It was a real treat to read, and it's good to see that it still holds up today.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        A good book is better than a bad one, but a bad, bad book is worse than a good one. That's just how it works, isn't it?  The plot is terrible:  You know what else sucks?   And you can see that in this book.   (A lot of that is the plot, which is awful and stupid and cliched.)   I'd rather read a book with interesting ideas than read a bad plot.  I'm so glad that the plot wasn't all that bad.  It didn't mean a thing when it failed to develop the characters in any way (even the most interesting character is pretty much useless).  The author is known for writing short stories that have absolutely no character development and a "message" that makes absolutely no sense.  In this book, he does that.  The idea that your entire future is based on how you treat the women you have sex with is a bad idea.  If you go on a date and it turns out that the woman you're with wants to have sex, then it's your fault, not hers.  He's also trying to tell us that if you are attracted to someone and it isn't a big deal, then you are going to be unable to handle a relationship and never want to have one again.  (The implication is that the "good" guys will never get a girlfriend.  This is just plain wrong.)  And then you get all these scenes where the character that is actually important to the story gets thrown into the background for the other women.  I don't know.  Even if this book wasn't about a bunch of guys who are in love, I can't imagine how the book would get any good reviews from people who don't have a problem with that sort of thing. (That's the other problem with this book; the author's ideas about how to be in a relationship don't hold up to scrutiny.)  It's a big stupid cliché:  A lot of clichés are thrown around this book: being able to trust your friends, the importance of your job, being responsible for your actions.  All of those things make the book pretty good, if you're not into clichés, but you're going to have to sit through some boring, unexciting stuff and then some other boring, uncompelling stuff just to get to the good stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You're not a good person for not picking up this book. It is horrible. You know why? Because it's a good book. The plot is stupid and the characters are awful. You can tell by the first 5 pages that this book will be no good and there is no way to change your mind once you've seen a preview. You might like it, if you like books that are bad, and that is about it. You're probably better off spending your money elsewhere than on a book that doesn't have enough potential for any sort of enjoyment. And I hope your family and friends have a lot of fun watching you go through a mental breakdown.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a book that I would say "does not deserve" to be in this genre.   The characters have a little too many flaws that do not come through enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was super disappointed when I got this book.     It was a really fun read, but after the first couple pages I found myself rolling my eyes every time I tried to put any kind of effort into it.  The writing and art was fantastic but the story was not interesting and it made me feel like I should've known it was going to be a waste of time.  This review will be a little long so I'll break it down into some points. Story:  There are five main characters, three boys and one girl.    You don't get to really get to know any of the characters, but I found it interesting.  While there's a lot of background info, it's really a quick start and then the main story is a lot like a typical fantasy.  It's very fantasy-y and very short, but has an interesting story that feels like it would fit well on a web series.  The book opens with two kids trying to figure out a puzzle on a book and then a big monster attacks them.  Then the story takes a turn for the worse when the girls realize that the monster is a girl who is trying to hide the book they're trying to solve.  They decide to run away with a friend and a cat and then are chased by a girl named Sabel who wants to know why they're hiding the book, which is about a girl called Lillia who is killed by a guy named Pius, who is a very powerful magic user who has a secret brother named Bion who is also a powerful magicuser.  Now I don't want to go into any spoilers, but the ending of the book left me a bit disappointed.  I felt like I didn't get a really solid resolution of the plot and I didn?t feel like there was much of a character development to speak of.  But like I said, it was a very short book so it's not like there's much to say about that.  There's an ending to the book that will make most people happy, but it just wasn't enough to make me feel any sort of connection to any of my favorite characters in the story.  So I wasn't able to love all of them as much as I would like.  And the only people who I did get to love were one of the girls (I don't know her name), a cat, and a monster.  If you
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The Book of the New Sun" is an excellent work of speculative fiction. As a reader of science fiction I am glad to see some new and interesting voices at work in speculative fiction (particularly speculative fiction in a more mainstream form, like a book, not just a series). But, I would have to rank the story as merely average.   The story is not particularly bad, but the worldbuilding is not good. The main characters are all very interesting, with the only downside being that there are three of them. The narrative is not overly convoluted and does not require any significant amount of detective work to read.  The plot is not bad, though it is a bit dull in the latter half.  But that is the only problem I have with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "The story of the woman who was caught in a love triangle with three other men who were all very attractive was pretty fascinating. The author was very convincing at keeping the focus on the love and not the sexual aspects of the three men, but there were times when it felt a little forced to me. The book also had a bit of a romance feel to it which was refreshing, and although I was a bit surprised that it was a romance (I thought it was really about friendship) I loved it."  - Review by S. A.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've had some good books and some not-so-good books. A few were pretty bad. I can tell you my favorite of the bunch was The Dark Tower. It's a great book, and I like a good story. But after reading it I knew that I would have to pick up a good book to get my money's worth. In this case I will go with the original version of John Grisham's The Innocent Man, which is better than the later editions, and if you like The Stand or Red Harvest and like the mystery, go out and buy it. If you like this book or a similar one, you might also want to check out the John Griswold Collection. If you are looking for a good action thriller, I'm not sure that a good thriller is in the works. It has some of the same features as Red Harvest but a bit more action, and not enough mystery to make me want to keep reading.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not been able to finish the book. The writing is very bad, and the characters are terrible. I just wanted to say I couldn't finish it.     The book seems to be written for a very young audience, but I find the characters immature and annoying.  This book is also just confusing and difficult to follow.  I did not get it. The only way I can get this book to make sense is to listen to it and read it for myself. I have not finished this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book. There is a good deal of good writing in this book but the plot, the romance and the character development are not up to the task.   The story follows the journey of a man named George Bensley. George is a man who is very clever but also very naive. He has very few friends and has never had a relationship. He lives with his mother and father. His father runs a small hotel and George's mother is a retired nurse. George comes to live with his father when his mother dies and George is sent to live in a hotel with his uncle. He meets the handsome and intelligent Mrs. Bensness but their relationship is not very strong. They are only acquaintances and their connection is more than just a platonic one. They do not have any physical intimacy. The relationship between George and Mrs.Bensness is the main theme of this book and is not developed very well. It is not really an interesting story about a man living with his parents and dealing with his own problems.  , George, is not a good writer:  Mr. Belsley's prose is excellent but is also very confusing to understand. He uses multiple and redundant metaphors, he uses the passive voice (I was actually surprised at this), he uses double negatives (I don't even know what that means), and there is a lot of grammatical errors. He is so bad at writing a book that he is not even able to make it seem good. I did not get it and I cannot figure out how to recommend it to anyone. There are so many flaws in the book that I do not think it can ever be successful as a novel.  I had the feeling it was a joke:  I loved this book! I had the same feelings as many reviewers had when they first read it. I was so intrigued by the premise and the fact that a man was living with just his parents. In my opinion this is a fantastic premise. This book would make a great movie! And the writing is actually pretty good! I loved the fact the the book had a romance aspect and the romance was well written! The plot was interesting and the characters were all interesting and developed. The book is just not good. And if you do not know what to expect from a book on the topic of love, please do not even try to read this book because you are going to be lost. There really is no redeeming qualities to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Read less  I got my hands on a copy of this a long long time ago and   I'm glad I gave it a try.   It is a nice, quick read.  I like the ending where   the protagonist and his friends decide to help the poor in their community but it is the book about the other characters that are the focus.  Some of the characters are very flawed   some are quite good.  It would have been nice if they made more of them but other than that   it is an entertaining read. Also, it is a short read so that means less time spent thinking about it!  This is my second review but I hope it does not get lost on the way to the beach!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about three months ago. After reading the previous book I thought I would be okay, but not good enough. I have read most of his books and have no qualms about them. I gave this book 2 stars because it does have some great elements. It is a quick and easy read that doesn't hold my interest for more than 2-3 chapters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second book I've had sent back. This is a book which I gave three stars. I liked the first book but I liked it a lot more. There were a lot of scenes I liked but the author didn't like me enough. This book got me through my anxiety so I'll be watching this book carefully for that one scene in the last chapter where I say I'm not sorry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to really piss off a person, tell them the book was terrible.    My rating is a 3.5 out of 4.0 because it's a fantastic, fun, and extremely well-written book.  The most recent entry in this series, a novel with a few flaws, is The Secret History, but I'd consider this one a better book in most respects. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I'm not a big fan of 'literature'...so what's so great about this book?...nothing. The plot is terrible and has absolutely nothing to do with the story of the book."     The reviews are in for this book and they are... mixed.  Here's a review I found for The Last King of Scotland. - This book is a disappointment. I don't understand how a book of this sort could get published in the United States when it is clearly not very well-crafted. (The first two thirds of the story is almost entirely set in the past, with only the first third dealing with any historical setting whatsoever.) A few of the characters are completely stereotypical, and some of the plot points are completely confusing and don't follow the plot line at all. The writing style is very simplistic and the story doesn't build upon itself to anything of consequence, other than making people go through what happens to them and not much else. The ending, which is what you might expect from a book about a magical quest to kill a dragon, is pretty pathetic.  I'll be honest, I didn't really expect to enjoy this book. I didn a lot of criticism for how it was written, and I felt that the story was extremely lacking in plot, and was more a book with a "who is he? What is he doing here? Why can't I remember his name? WHAT is his quest? WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?" tone than a well-written adventure book. After reading about the author's other works and getting more into fantasy, I was looking forward to reading this one, but in the end, this was a book I found to be lackluster. - I don the story to be an interesting, engaging tale. But it has one major flaw. The "epic" ending that is hinted at at the beginning of the novel. The author didn't follow through with what was hinted at. So, as you read through the story, you wonder why the author kept us in suspense, only to abandon us at the end. I was hoping that the author would bring back the main character at some point in the second half of the narrative, but the ending felt like a let down. There's really nothing wrong with the writing style or the story. It's just the ending that disappointed me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had a dime for every person who has said to me that I should buy a copy of this book to support my teacher (and I have one of the greatest teachers in the whole world), I'd be rich beyond my wildest dreams.   What a scam this book is.  The book is poorly written.    Not in any way that a person reading this should be offended or angry.  But the fact is this book was written by someone who is, as of the last time I checked, an accountant.  I'm not going to say I'm mad at this book but I'm going to let someone else say that.  And this is why I will not buy this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The second half of this novel is great, but the first half is a bit too dry and boring to be worth reading.   In a recent interview with an author on the BBC I heard the phrase "write what you know", but when I saw this book I was left scratching my head. It took me quite a few hours to get through it, and even after doing so I still wasn't happy with the whole thing. There is nothing wrong with the first chapter - I enjoyed how it ended, and I was just glad that the whole novel was more successful than I thought it would be. The real problem was the last third of the novel - the characters become less and less interesting, and the action is just not that exciting to read.  It is also a bit confusing. As a young girl who read it for the first time I think this novel was quite a challenge to me. I wanted to love this book, but it didn't give me what I expected. It was boring.  I don't understand why it ended - is it supposed to be that the characters are so different from the first book? Or is this just a case of too much going on? It was just a bit of a mess in the last part, so I don.t know what to think about this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The reason why this book did not hold my attention for much longer was that by the time I got to the end of the book, I had learned very little from it and was left wanting more. It's just that the book was so short that there wasn't really a chance to really get a whole lot of meaning out of it all.  4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am glad I gave this a go. I bought it in a used store, not knowing that the dust jacket was only part of the cover. I thought the book was about a dog, and when I pulled it out of the wrapper, the jacket started to fall off. The dust jacket, not the book itself, was on the floor. This made me so mad! Then, when I got home, I found the dust cover hanging on my bookshelf. The inside cover is still in a good condition, and I have a feeling I will use this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've bought books from this site before and had a good time while reading them, and in this case I was disappointed. If you want an adventure fantasy with a little romance in the mix, the book is perfect for you, with all the parts fitting together nicely.   The main character is the good guy from the get-go, with a somewhat tragic backstory that I really enjoyed. The story picks up after a certain point, and though I wouldn't call the plot interesting at first, it gradually develops nicely and I was able to care about the main character enough to stay for the conclusion.  This was the first book I read from J.W. Rinne I was so excited to read this, I didn't know what to expect. I was expecting something like a modern day version of Lord of the Rings, but Rinne took something very different and twisted it up with a few twists of his own. There's a bit of romance in there, it's not so overt as to make the story sound like it's full of sex and heartbreak.  I was really looking forward to this and thought I'd be more than satisfied with it. It wasn't quite like that, and I don't think it was for everyone, but it had me hooked. There was just something about this book that just got to me, and that's a good sign in my book.  The characters are just good, I don' t know how anyone could hate them, it was just that it didn't quite click with me the way it should have.  There are some elements in the book that I personally didn't enjoy. The romance wasn't as subtle as I thought it would be, the romance didn't develop as much as I would have liked. However, the plot and characters are so good, the reason the book didn't work for me was mostly due to it's flaws. Overall I thought the story was good, and definitely worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was in the middle of reading this when it started turning into a horrible rambling rant about the "diversity mafia". And then I found out that he didn't read the books he's criticizing but just read the reviews. I guess you need to know a few things about this guy before you go on this tirade about how much it sucks to be a white person in America. First, as someone who has read several of his works and enjoys them, his argument is mostly crap, so I'll try and be brief and keep things mostly consistent with what he wrote in this book. He starts by telling a story about "a kid named David" who wanted to be like Superman and did a bunch of bad things to become that superman. He says, "David had an IQ of 140. He also cheated on his girlfriend with 5 black girls. David is the poster child for the dumbest kind of people in the world." Well, yes. He cheated on a girl in college, went out with five women, and lied about it all in the same day, but that doesn't make David a bad person. He is exactly who he is. But we shouldn't be so quick to label people based on the behavior of the moment. You'd have to be one of the most racist people in history to hold a grudge against an African-American who robbed you in high school. And if you think "dumbest" and "cheating" are the same thing, you need some time to think about the people who write this shit. Next, David was a horrible parent to his kids. "David didn't think he had any obligations to them, but he wasn't a great parent either, he was a bad parent. He treated them like cattle. His children are still angry with him for it." I've never had a parent that treated my brother or me like cattle, but maybe that's because I had a good one. In any case, I am not sure why "children are still mad at him for" that. As far as his kids go, if he made them eat better than they should or didn't have enough food at home and then blamed them for not being able to keep up, then sure. Maybe he should apologize. The point is, if you're a good parent, you don't need to say anything, because the children will never be mad at you. David did bad things in his life, but I didn't
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a book snob but this is a good book, but it was very hard to get through. I think this is better than some other writers who are better known, but this isn't a great book. The characters are well-written, the plot is intriguing but not original, the story is set in a dark city (though not the first one) and the action is quite good. The main character is an orphan but you never feel like he's abandoned, and you don't feel sorry for him either, like in the first book. He wants to be in a good fight. Also, he has a very close bond with his pet wolf. I did enjoy the characters and the plot. However, I don't think you could make a better book if you don a lot of research into their lives.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm really disappointed with this one. I read it after hearing how great the movie is. But alas, it wasn't good. Not even close. It's just bland. Nothing that I enjoyed about the book (besides the story itself). I'd give it a 3-star, but just give it half the rating I gave it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I bought this book after seeing reviews from people who didn't like it.   I bought this in hopes that I would like it because I'm in the mood for a good book that I'll probably forget soon.  I'm disappointed.  I think the only reason I bought it was because the cover art was cute.  And it was a really cute book that would have been perfect to take along on a day out.  This book was way too long, and as a result I can't see myself reading any more of it, or buying the other two books in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      1) It's short, which is disappointing.    2) There's some grammar and spelling errors, but they don't get in the way of the story or the characters.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In some cases you are just being too pessimistic and expecting a bad result. It is like the saying goes: "if the sky is blue, it is because the sky was blue once." The book is not a bad one. I found myself reading a lot about what the writer and his friends and family had been up to over the last several months. It gave a lot of background information about the people involved and the changes they had made in their lives in the last 5-10 years. It also gave a list of things that the author was going to be doing to take his mind off things. However, there were only so many times he could take a look at his life and make it go away, so he did this. He also was going through the entire year of 2009, which is another long process in itself. He would do a year by year breakdown of all the good and bad things that had happened in his life this past year. If I had read the book in November 2009 I would have been reading that it was all about losing one's mind. I was able to take the good parts and appreciate that it is a good book. I only wish the author would have included a little more information about this year since it seems that it had some negative changes to go through, but it was the last year he had a big house, so maybe that was the only thing that was going on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a funny story.   After being a kid, I read a lot of comics by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples, but never read this book before it came out. I knew I liked this guy, but I didn't know why.  It's a laugh riot and a fast read.  I was so glad to see he went with the "noir/romance" style. He really put a nice spin on it. It also did it's job of not being pretentious and just being funny. I loved that about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I have ever read, and not just because I was too late to save it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . You don't want to do this, because the author is probably a very nice person, but you are doing your job.   The whole book is an exercise in self-hatred.  The main character is obsessed with being different from the others.  He constantly berates himself for his lack of ability in things he has no control over.  When he does get an opportunity to do something he has little or no control in, he fails miserably at it.  If you were the kind of person who was bullied for being different, or you feel like an outsider, this book is for you.  If you are just looking for a good story, don't.  It has a great cast, a couple of really good scenes, and the ending is kind of awesome, but...the story is the story. If I read a book that I hated the first time I read it, I would probably reread it. I've probably done this for about the last five books.  This is one that I was not so sure of.  I'd read it once and liked it enough to read it again.  Then, when I had a second chance to read the book and it didn't quite work for me, I'd give up on it.   I'm glad I didn't, though.  In fact, I finished this one in a little over a day and enjoyed every second.  There are some parts of it that are pretty well done, especially the second half of it. There's a good storyline, a lot of interesting characters, and a few well-written moments in the story that make it worth reading.  As always, I have my reservations about some parts.  For one, the book is short, so it's not as much of a waste of time as I thought it was going to be.  You could probably get through it in a couple hours if you really want to.  But, for me it took a lot longer than that to read and really enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     Read a positive review about an excellent book:  " I'm glad to have discovered this book and its wonderful message about the love and understanding that exists between a gay person and the people of their same gender. As a bisexual woman who came out when I was 30, I have known for a long time that I wasn't like the other women, that I was attracted to other women and didn't know how to be with women. That's what made it so hard for me to be in a relationship with a woman who is also bisexual. Now, I've figured it out! I've found the courage to fall in love with a man! There is no doubt in my mind that a person who is bisexual can love a man. No question about it! It's just that for me it's more than that, it's a way of being with the other person."  —Katherine  Reviews of this book:
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was well written.   However, I had a problem with the ending and I wish I had found a better one before giving this book five stars.  Part of me is upset because the ending was awful.  But I will read more of this series. I hope this book is better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     It's interesting that I'm about to give this book a 5-star review.   I have a hard time writing positive reviews about books and I don't like giving them a good rating simply because I feel like it makes the author look good.  I'm giving this book 2 stars because of a few minor things I didn't like.  These are just minor things and do not detract from the rest of the book and if you can overlook these small flaws, you will find a very worthwhile read.  The major issue I have is that the "spoilers" in this book are really a minor thing.  There is no major plot twist, no big revelation, no character change, no real shock or drama.  So why is this a 5?   It's because the things that I really disliked about this book don't diminish what the book has to offer in the end.  It isn't a book I am going to rush to read or re-read and I would definitely recommend this book to a friend who enjoyed The Hunger Games and wants a good book to read. It's good, but not great.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You cannot get a copy of this book! The book itself is good. The book is written in a very good and coherent way. It's a little over the top at times but overall, the writing is good, the plot is good and the author does a good job at explaining the concept and the characters. But, I didn't like the way the book ended. I am not sure if it was the author's decision or if it came up during his reading, but the end of the book was very abrupt, as if he just did not care at all. Also, some characters are just way too bland. If you are a person who hates books where the author doesn't care and does not give a s*** about the characters, I suggest you not to read this book.  If you like horror or fantasy novels:  I read this to try and find the best of both worlds, horror and fantasy. If I have to choose between horror and a fantasy book, I'll choose fantasy, because I can go into a scary house and kill everyone in sight.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not well written.   It is like a series of bad drawings by an unknown artist.  At times the writing is terrible. At times it is funny. The story is hard to understand.  As a fan of the comic I loved this book.  The characters are interesting. The setting is fascinating.  I think the ending was the best part of the book. The artwork is terrible, the story is bad, and the writing.  It has ruined my desire to read about this character
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not really my fault that my son turned out to be a very poor student in the end, but I couldn't believe the number of errors he made on the writing end. This was one of the most frustrating books I have ever read. In addition, the chapters are often too long. I mean, really too long; the last chapter was just too long, and the rest just went on too long as well. So, yeah, don't read this. If you have an interest in reading the Bible, this book is a must-read; if you don't want to read the Bible and just want to pass time, just read a book like that or something like it. There's really no excuse for such a huge mess of a book.  19 of 20 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was the first book I read. It didn't have a beginning, middle or end. I was intrigued enough with it and I read it. There wasn't much to the book. I don't understand how this author came up with such a crappy plot. The writing was sloppy and I don t understand why the author couldn't think of more than five good reasons for his character to die. I also found the pacing and story odd. I really have no idea why the protagonist dies at the end. And, in fact, I never found out who the murderer was and why the hero dies. I think this book would have been better without the horrible ending, but I would rather have the poor plot.   I recommend this book for anyone who is intrigued by the supernatural and doesn t know much about it. I do recommend this to people who have never read a paranormal romance before, because it has a lot to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a decent book, but the story itself was so boring that it made my day go by and I was unable to put down. This story did not even get my attention. I am giving it two stars because it is the first in a series, but it will be hard to continue with that series when there is a whole other series that is far better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The cover photo on the back of the book is one of the best I've ever seen and this book is a wonderful read. This book has been a great success. One of the most enjoyable books I've read in years! I have to admit though, my favorite parts of the story were the ones I didn't like as much!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't remember if I got to the point where the book was over or when the book ended.   Maybe it was when I was about half way through the book.  I got stuck in a bit of a plot hole and just kind of gave up.    This book has an interesting premise, but doesn't go anywhere.  You don't really get to find out how anything is really tied together until the end.  This is a bit disappointing.  But, there's nothing wrong with a book being a bit too long.

Please leave a comment saying why you didn,t like the book!  *   If you read all my reviews and don't like them, then why even bother?   I am not a good writer.  Here is what's wrong with this book: *1) This is the 3rd book in a series called  The Dune Chronicles.   The last 3 Dune books have been good.  The next two Dune novels are going to be bad.  *2) The novel is in 3 volumes, not 5.    *3) This book is not a sequel to the previous Dune novel.   *4) This novel was written in the middle of a 7 year gap between books in the series. *5)  This is not an original novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so pleased to see that my son, and so many other children, had enjoyed reading this book as much as I had.   My son loved this book, but I'm afraid I wasn't so pleased with the ending.  It is hard to review a book that doesn't finish on a high note, but the ending of this book was certainly not a high point.  In the beginning of the book, there is a scene where the children have to get up and play because they had no choice and the clock is about to start.    The boys had to go to school, but Mom is so stressed and exhausted that she can barely even be in her own bedroom.  For this, Mom is rewarded by the other children who go to the playground to play with her and she goes.  There, in the middle of the playground, she finds a toy car and decides to play and play and finally, when she has had enough, she says to the other kids, "I'm going home," and runs down the hill.   Then, in some ways it's cute, and in other ways it is tragic, because Mom did not go to sleep for a while after finding the toy car, but finally gets into bed.  In the next scene, the other boys run up the hill and Mom is still there, but she doesn't say anything, doesn't go to bed and goes downstairs, and just sits in the kitchen in her pajamas.  She looks at a clock with the day at 2:00 and thinks to herself, "Today's not even 2 o'clock. What am I going to do with myself tomorrow?"  At one point, Mom says, "There's nothing I can do to go home and get this over with," but, again, she can't because she can no longer go upstairs.  One of the problems with this book is that it never gives an explanation for how the clock works, but we know it can't be anything simple.  The clock in the book is about 2 feet high, and the other way it works is that the clock has a small hand which turns the hands of the other hands and the hours go from top to bottom, which makes no sense to us, but somehow, to Mom, makes sense.  Then, when Mom gets back, she does find a way to make a plan to get back in her bedroom, but not before she has been to the bathroom
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This was a book that I got, had to wait months for and that I hated. Not in a good way. No, I really hated this book. I have read so much good fiction, and this was like going to the zoo and watching some of the animals being tortured. I loved everything about this book, but then I read the characters descriptions. They just were not accurate to life in the real world. The author describes them with all the accuracy, but the characters were very unrealistic and I could not find any of their behavior that was realistic. For example, one character, who was a police officer, would talk about the things he would do in the "hot seat" to his officers in the field, but in the office, he would not do them. He never had to use his authority to do anything with the other officers, and would only use it when they went too far. The other officers that he worked with he would have to let off their dogs when their dog was out of line. I'm sure the author could have made them seem like a good example of officers, but that was not how I would imagine they were as real officers. Another character would say he'd rather go to jail and lose his license for failing to take care of his kids then let them go to school in the city because he couldn't make it to court in time.   "No offense to the police, but they do a really good job."   Another was a former cop who was very angry that the department changed and became more restrictive when he was a cop. "Why didn't you let us know that you wanted to come back?" He said he wanted the department to keep the status quo, and I have to agree with him. I can't imagine that it would be hard to know about the change before it happened, so I can only imagine that the change would have been better if the department had not changed. That's one of my only problems with this book is that I felt like the author didn't tell us enough about these characters. The way they treated their kids and the way they felt about being a cop? None of that was in the book, so it was not in my mind. If you want to read a realistic portrayal of a police force, I recommend you read a book about the Baltimore Police Department and not this book and read "Training in the Dark" by Ron Sargent, if you are interested in that
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is not a very good storyteller or writer. There is no sense of danger, or excitement, or anything like that. I'm sure he's a nice person, but I don't think he's worth reading.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book, and I liked it. But I was disappointed, and it's a big disappointment. I'm not really a horror fan and don't care for the kind of story-driven, gore-soaked thrillers that are really popular now. I like a good suspense, mystery, suspense-thriller, and this book just didn't deliver the goods. I understand that people who hate the original trilogy don't like this one because of the change in story, but even after that, I still didn't like it. It's also not really surprising that you can't go to a movie theater without being overwhelmed by the number of zombie movies that come out, because zombies are a big part of this book.   This was my favorite part:  In some ways, I was so impressed with how well I knew this character I was a little surprised at the ending (especially since the book went on way too long).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first two books in this series, The Magician's Land and The Book of Spells, were both amazing in all regards.   This series has so many problems that I was not expecting.  The premise is completely different from that of the books that preceded it.  Even more surprising is that the first four books in the series have been published as short story collections.  This is a first-rate series, but it has gone through several problems.  I do not recommend that one read all four books because that would require reading the entire series as a series.  You would have to read the series in order.  If you are willing to take the chance and are not afraid of being turned off with too much information, you would be well advised to read all of the four books.  These books have enough information in them to satisfy the reader and are far less dull than the earlier books.   The first book in the collection is a fast-paced adventure with a happy ending that had me totally hooked.  It tells the story of a boy who finds the world beautiful, yet the boy is too young to understand how it feels to be loved.  He is rescued from a desert by a magic book.  After the boy learns what the book does to him he is able to see the world from the book's perspective.  For those with a bit of a dark bent (and I am one) this is perfect for you.    The magic book is the best character in the book.   I have a sneaking suspicion that this book was intended to be a film and it was probably based on the book of the same name by Joseph Campbell.  Like the film it does an excellent job with it's story and characters.  A great addition to this series is that it is now available as a complete story collection, all four volumes.   If you have a serious interest in magic and the occult, you should read this book. It is short, not dense, and well told.   This series is one of my personal favorites and one that I am sure will get added to my bookshelf.   Posted by Jennifer J. at 1:10 AM No comments:
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great read. It's funny and full of amazing characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most annoying part of reading the book is that I didn't like this book.   It seemed that the author didn't write a good story, and didn't follow the plot lines well.  It wasn't very funny, and was basically an after thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are some parts where I feel like I am reading a bad story. And I can't blame the author because I have a tendency to make the same mistake in stories I like.   For instance the ending is very weak. It's a short book and I felt that it didn't develop anything in the last third of the story. It was a cliffhanger. It would have been nice if there was more of an ongoing story to the end.  There were a lot of characters and a lot to deal with.  It was hard for me to figure out what my favorites were because the plot was so confusing.  I would recommend this story to any fan of science fiction, space travel, and magic!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If there is one thing that makes books so compelling it is the writing, and, as far as I am concerned, J. R. R Tolkien is the best of them. The most famous and acclaimed author of the 20th Century, Tolkien is regarded by some as the greatest fantasy writer of all time. I think that may be true, but I will take a different view, and not only for the reasons you might think. I find Tolkien's work to be lacking in one particular aspect: character development. What's the purpose of a novel if you never get to know the characters? In Tolkien's works, characters do not even seem to know themselves; their character is defined by what other people think of them:  This is not a good thing. Not a good book. And to me it's a big problem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is good, but the characters are awful.   I really liked the book, but when I was reading it I felt like I was getting an unpleasant experience every time something happened, like the character was getting hurt and the author knew about it and didn't care. I'm not sure how I feel about the concept of the "evil-doer" in a story who is actually a victim. It made me feel like I just watched a terrible soap opera. It would have been better if the author had kept the characters' voices simple and kept it more on a "this is their life, you don't understand them" sort of level, where they just act out. However, I still think that the story was really cool. If I were to recommend this book to someone, I would give it three stars. However if you're looking for something that is a little different to this, this is definitely not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     One of the best books I've read for a while!  By: Emily
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I will never read a book by Mary Skelter again. The first half of the book is just tedious and boring. The book is told from the perspective of Mary S. Skelver, a woman who has been a sex slave in the Nazi concentration camp for over 30 years. I have a difficult time reading about people's pasts because I am too easily able to empathize with other people, but I cannot relate to a book about being forced to be a sex worker. When she escapes the camp, she's still a victim, but it's hard for me to believe she can move on and still have the ability to love. I'm sure there is some validity to her story and it's a good book, but the ending just seemed very out of place for this type of character. It's not a bad story, but there are better books to read in the same genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My book wasn't awful (and I'm a little worried it will be), but it was an utter disappointment from beginning to end. I was excited to learn that there was a new edition coming out, hoping it would bring back the magic, but this didn't come to pass. A lot of the writing was just poorly done and the characters were poorly written. Some were annoying, such as the main villain "The Foppish Gentleman." For a book with so many other issues to be brought up, he was pretty boring. A large portion of the book was devoted to the main characters talking about how they are "unappreciated." It was a bit annoying, but not a big deal in the book. They did have some interesting points that they brought up (like "the system has been corrupted"). But most of the time the characters just went on and on, being really slow and boring. I guess I have come to expect less from this genre. The main character is also really annoying. He has a very bad habit of "talking about things." This often gets him into trouble. I understand that "talking" is a big part of being an author, but he was just bad at it. He had a lot of really good ideas about how to do the book, but most of his ideas were really bad and never worked out. The final portion of "the ending" was a big waste of time. As the book ended I couldn't tell if it was the good ending or not. It didn't seem to change anything. It wasn't that the characters' lives were going to change or anything. But I didn't feel any of the excitement or emotion I felt from the first half of the story. I wasn't even sure what the ending was about or if it had any impact on the book at all. This is just such a huge letdown. It's been a long time since I've had a bad experience in a book. I should have loved this book. This was a very disappointing book, and even worse than I anticipated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really did not expect what I got in this book. In a series that is known for it's dark, gritty and bloody and intense stories, this book was pretty much a non stop torture session, filled with blood, pain, and most of all... I don't know what it was but something about this story made me feel like the characters were trying to kill themselves.   The main character of the book is called Raziel. He is an angel who had to do everything he can to stop the evil from destroying the planet. The first part of the story is about him trying to do just that, trying to stop one of the two evils, the warlord Azazel and the other angel, the evil magician Zevie, who is trying to create a new religion to control the people with. In fact, the entire book is about a religious war and an uprising, and it's mostly about the good guy trying to fight his way to victory, while the bad guys try to stop him.   It gets even more difficult as the story goes on as he must use the angel powers of the holy grail to defeat his enemies, and he is forced to use his own body as a vessel. At the end of the fourth book, he uses the holy sword of the same color, which was given to him by Azazel, to defeat the evil warlord Zevi who was planning on destroying the world. This is the part where the torture begins, and the bad guy Zevah ends up turning the protagonist of the series into a demon because he tried to use the holy power of the grail for evil. But we see that the story doesn't end with the main character turning into a monster, because he is still needed by Azazi for some reason, and as the main protagonist, he must continue with the mission of saving the world in the future books, and this is when the real torture begins.       I've had a lot of negative experiences with this series, and I have to say, that I was one of those people who was very disappointed with the ending. I could not get behind it because the character of Azazil, one of Raziels good guy side, turned out to be one of my most hated characters of this whole series. I hate how manipulative he was, how he tries to make all of his problems go away just so he can win a fight. I couldn't get behind
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am absolutely in love with this book.    I know that the title is a bit of a misnomer, but if you are looking for a simple, quick read, then this will be just the book for you.  It's fast, easy, and fun.  The characters are wonderful.  This book is written in the same style as many modern day adventure novels, including  Lost Legends,  The Legend of Khan,  and  The Hobbit.   This is a fun, fast, funny book. It's got a lot of action, lots of laughs, and a bit on the silly side.  I highly recommend this book for fans of fast paced adventure books, or for those who like to read adventure books in the way the book was written, rather than how it was published.  What was it like to write this book? I was quite surprised to learn that in this day and age, most writers are still relying on the pen.  For this to be a good book, the author had to put in a lot more than I would expect.  After a few months of working on this book, I realized that writing wasn't a big deal to me.  Writing doesn't feel hard at all.  Some days I had no idea how I was going to write something.  Sometimes I felt like my head was going numb and I needed an anti-nausea pill.  On some days, it was harder than others.  However, I was always able to come up with something to write, no matter how many times I failed.   I learned a lot about story structure and pacing and I also learned how to write a good story.  By no means am I the best writer out there, but I have had a great amount of fun writing this book and I am very proud of my efforts.   The best part is that I've gotten some fantastic feedback.  A lot of people have told me that my book is a great way to pass the time.    If you haven't read this book yet, don't worry, I'll make it easy to get it.  You can find it on Amazon.com for less than $5.00 (you can buy a paperback for under $4.00, so this is a good price!)

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I read the plot of the novel, I was very disappointed by it. The beginning was very dull and the ending just was awful. The last pages were just depressing. It took me a while to get over the fact that I couldnt finish the novel and the characters. It was not a good book at all and should be avoided.   Author: S. G. Hall Summary: The year is the 30's. All of the main characters are in their 40s. The main character is an older woman. This book is written in a very simple way. One of the characters has a problem that we are only told after the story has already moved on. This was a very good book for a young adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My husband bought me this book after finding a good review online. This book is the first in a series and so far I really dislike it. It's filled with a few of the usual "magic" words and a few phrases that sound ridiculous. I was hoping for some kind of supernatural magic, something like the kind in H.P. Lovecraft's writing. But no, the magic here is very simple and not that interesting. The characters are also pretty flat. There are a few good moments and then all is back to being a typical book with a good plot. For those that love the occult, this book is probably for you. But I really thought I would get something more from it. (4 stars)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good read. This is one of those books where I think, "I might enjoy this book if my family would just get it." The characters are interesting. The story is compelling. The world building and world setting are engaging. The characters interact and react to their surroundings. The prose is well written. The ending is satisfying and leaves the reader with a sense of finality.   So, for my review, let me just go on the record by saying that this is a must read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this in the summer of 1998 when I was about 25 and it completely changed my perspective of books. I am an academic. I do not read literary fiction and rarely read genre literature. The book itself was not bad, but the style was so different. It was like reading poetry in a different mode. I thought the style and the book were amazing. When I read the book again a couple of years later I did not think it was that great, but I am just an intellectual at heart, and that is what I remember.   BEST BOOK OF THE 20TH CENTURY:   I read a lot of contemporary fiction in high school and college and read pretty much everything I can get my hands on. When the chance came up to pick up a book by John Irving for my summer reading, I immediately jumped on it. The plot is really interesting and the characters were interesting as well.  "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" is one of the very best novels ever written about a time period which is a lot like our own time, as it is one which is characterized by a loss of social cohesion and the development of a culture of "selfishness."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I think the book is good but there are some bad things in it that I found annoying." "If you are expecting something good about this book you will be disappointed. Don't waste your time and read a better book." "I don't think the author's experience of getting her PhD will be relevant to the experience of many PhD candidates. I think she got a great deal of credit for getting her degree, but she is still not a PhD in that field and she doesn't explain how she can say that. If this is how PhDs are evaluated I would have been totally disappointed."   So you think I haven't been clear, Professor.  One of my favourite parts of this blog is how a lot of the time people are able to learn something about their own academic careers from someone else's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book had a very strange and bizarre plot. I'm not even going to go into detail about how bad the story was. I won't even try to summarize it. The only reason it was so bad is that it was written as a series of short stories, each short story building on the next one. It's basically a trilogy with one story. Each of the three stories are about a family, a priest, and a little girl. The family is struggling financially and are trying to raise their daughter. They are married to the priest's sister. When the priest dies, it's the father's turn to do the priestly duties for the family. The stories are pretty much all in the same style: the priest is very sad, the little girl is very mean to her father, and she is trying to get a big car. But, she just doesn't have it yet, and it doesn't really work out. I have nothing but contempt for the little sister. She's the worst. She doesn't act in character, she's a bitch, and even when she does act in a certain way, it doesn arouse pity and disgust in me. I wish this book had been done right. The best way to write a book is to do it well. I would love to hear what other people think about this series. Read more
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is good. A lot of work, a lot of thought and care put into a book that does nothing to actually improve one's life.   I recommend this book, but as it is a first read, I would probably skip on to the next one or two.   3 of 3 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You need to try a few other books and see if you like them first.    The first few chapters were fun and interesting to read. But then the author started trying to write about the characters in a very cliche way. I thought that the first few paragraphs of this book were a little too dramatic.   I think the book needed to be more "straight forward" and less "filler".   But all in all, I thought the book was good.  You should check out my book review on Amazon. I also have a few reviews to read:  - The book is too short and doesn't do well with the setting and the characters.  The story would have been better in another setting, maybe a fantasy one.  - The "I hate being mean to others" character is a bit weak and unrealistic.  It seems like every time he tries to save someone he doesn't end up saving anyone.  The author wants people to love him but the way he uses these people to get to the end of the book makes it obvious that the book isn't for him or anyone like him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I opened this book, I thought it was going to be a fun adventure story that would end in a great way. This book didn't have that feeling, at least not initially. I loved the first half of the book, and was hoping it would get better. Instead, the book ended on a cliffhanger: the main character and her little sister, who are on a cruise ship, are kidnapped by aliens and left on their own, with no way of rescue. The aliens then take off in the spaceship, which is only slightly larger than a bus, with a little boy named "Piggy" riding on the back of the ship. The ending made me very sad, so I couldn't put the book down. This is a story that is so well-told, but the ending is so poorly written, you can see right from the start that the author wasn't expecting it to be that good. There are also two other characters that are mentioned in passing throughout the story, one that's supposed to be evil, and the other that is supposed to have died, but is actually just having his memories altered by a mysterious force. It's clear that the writer did not want this story to end the way it did. I can only imagine the emotional impact this ending would have on a child, as I've read many books with similar endings that were just as bad as this one. The plot twist is very poorly executed, as the main characters are not involved at all until the very last pages of the story.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     No, it's not a bad review. But, I would have said it had better descriptions.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story:  In a book that could easily have been a series of short stories, we see a man, a girl, and a horse with a mysterious past, a boy who is different in a way that seems like a bad thing, a monster that comes back and gets revenge for the past, and an all-powerful villain that wants to do bad stuff for no reason. I'm all for a good and complex villain, but this is just over the top, and I'm not sure I bought the premise, and the world that is created is not very compelling. The characters are also a huge disappointment.   I was expecting something unique, and something that is not only a fantasy but also a very mature and well-written fantasy novel. What happened instead is just a very generic plotline and characters.  It also seems like the author doesn't have a great grasp on history, history writing, or the human psyche.  I really want to like this book, but I don't recommend it.  Overall: 4.5 stars.  The book is not a perfect book, nor is it a well-crafted book. It is good, but not exceptional in the best sense of the word.  With that said, it is still a good read and it has my full attention.  My next read is not "a" fantasy but one that is just as good, and that book is the third installment in my "Dark Tower" series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a book that gives you a little taste of the way science can change your outlook, this is a good book. It will give you a taste of a certain aspect of science. However, the book is far more about the science itself and the process of scientific discovery, than the science. The main focus of the book for me was how the scientific method is used in the field of psychotherapy. If you want to know how a certain discipline of medicine works, then there's a good chance you will find an excellent book in this genre. It gives you some insight, not only into the science of psychology, but into the way these fields work and how the field itself changed over the years. I would highly recommend this book to a college-age science student.   Posted by Richard Litt at 5:37 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sooo excited for this book! This book contains so many new and original ideas, characters, and plots. This is what I've been looking for since I was a little girl and now it finally arrived. I can't wait to read it and I'm looking forward to my review.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It doesn't really matter if I was bored by this book or if I'm a bad person because there's no real plot and even less of a resolution. I think this is a really bad book for people who like to be immersed in a story but don't want to learn anything. Maybe if I had learned more about what's going on in the main character's life it might have been a good book but I'm still pretty sad about this one because I had so much hope for it and I ended up reading about a girl who was like a cat trapped in a mouse house. I wouldn't have even cared if I did learn about the plot because it was just going nowhere and I just didn't feel like I learned anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You're not alone.   One reviewer of this book complained that the author failed to give her a realistic portrayal of female characters in fiction.  He also said the book had no characters that were remotely complex and real, as a result, none of the characters seemed to have any depth. I had two characters who, to me, were complex and authentic. The main character, S.S. Tammi, was a tough, strong, independent woman. S.T. was the first Indian woman I encountered in college. I remember when I met her, I was amazed at her intelligence and her ability to function in a society that was largely dominated by men. She was, in fact, the first woman I met that didn't have to fight to be respected by the men around her. S T. was tough and tough-minded.  I don't know if I should call her a hero. She did what she had to in order to survive. But I also have to say that she has a very strong sense of justice and a sense of responsibility.  It wasn't until I was in college that I encountered any Indian woman who was anything more than a maid or an office assistant.  This book, which is about a woman's struggle in America to find herself and have a family, did a really good job of capturing a certain part of India. I enjoyed this book and found it very informative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So my review of this book is based mainly on what a horrible author I found it to be. So I went out of my way to not read this book and just read the previous one. Then I found myself reading this book.   This book, in my opinion, is a train wreck.  The narrator, who is a good-natured yet very strange guy, is very unreliable, and even a few times I felt as if he was just making it up.  Also, I had to give it two stars, because it did get better the more I read it, but as of the end of the book, it was just so very bad.  I have a lot of bad books that I read, but this one got to be top of that list.  This is what I wrote at the beginning of the review:  After finishing this book, I didn't know if I should continue or not.  It was so horrible.  And I can honestly say, I think it's very unfortunate that he was hired to narrate this book as it was so awful.  How was he a competent narrator?  Why were other reviewers so positive?   I didn I think I was the one who started this.  This is the first book I ever read.  My mom asked me if I was reading a storybook.  So I asked my mom, she said, "no, you're reading a novel."   When I told my dad, he was like, "you need to stop reading novels."  So basically I was introduced to this weird fantasy world called the "Shires."  My dad wanted me to stay away from it and get back to reading historical fiction.  He didn't believe me.  Why would a fantasy author write a realistic historical novel?  Why yes, I do believe my dad.  For what reason do you think you need to read something so fictional that it's not like your real world.  As I kept reading I began to wonder if my father knew something that my mom didn't.  But if it was something like a fantasy, shouldn't my dad be able to recognize what a fantasy is?  But he had no idea and he made no effort to get me to read his novel.  Was he afraid that something he didn't like about it could ruin my experience reading it?  Maybe, but how would you know until you read it?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's style is a bit heavy-handed and too detailed for my tastes.   For me this book would be better as a short fiction book, but it is still a good read.  The book is a well-conceived book with a solid premise that works well in its own way, and the author is doing well by the material.  P.S.  I liked the ending, but my wife would not be happy, I just thought that the author tried too hard to make a statement that isn't quite clear (I thought I read something about the "magnitude of the universe?" but I don't know what it meant, and I'm a bit confused about the plot as well). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great little story that was very well written and engaging.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I would have listened to the audiobook.   When I first heard about this book I thought that I would want to listen to the book as much as I would be reading it.  I also thought I would need to use the audio device because the audio book sounded like a lot of blather, and I was looking forward to the novel.  But I listened to it and found myself getting very bored listening to the same information.  When reading the novel I would make a mental note to start recording my audiobooks.    3.5 stars:  To summarize this book in one sentence:     The main character is a guy that is trying to come to terms with the fact that his parents (and therefore his life) have changed for the worse after being diagnosed with schizophrenia.  While being diagnosed, the parents would go around trying to scare him.   I was not a fan of the way this book went about trying to get the main character to be mentally unstable and to commit acts of violence (especially after his parents tried to have him committed) but I thought this book was well written and I felt that this was a very compelling story to read.  This book definitely helped me realize that there are ways to deal with the schizophrenia. It is hard to get diagnosed, it is hard for your parents to do anything about it, and if you don't act on the changes in your life that occur during your diagnosis, then you are destined to suffer and your life is not going to be the same as it was before.  Overall this book has a lot to offer and I will be checking out more from Christopher Chabris.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed the first few chapters. However, it was difficult to follow a plot because it was so inconsistent. I am glad I read it but it has a lot of holes.   I enjoyed the story:  I liked the story. The plot didn't get very interesting until the final few chapters but it was interesting nonetheless.   It was interesting:  The first couple chapters were pretty entertaining, but then things just devolve into being boring and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     If I could give this book less than a star, I would. I'm not sure what happened to the author, or if she even knew how to write. It doesn't seem like she actually gave a damn about anything that happens in the story and instead just goes with the flow, and then there's a bunch of other stuff going on and the book becomes unreadable. So the last third of the book starts to get kinda boring, I don't want to read that again. I guess that's just how the story went?   I don "I don't see it." If I had read it from beginning to end, I'd say it was a good book. But I didn't because it got boring, and I had to do it in a few short chapters and I think it got too much and I didn the author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is a fun one; not really original, but it is a good story, and it does have a nice twist at the end. The book itself is the kind of book you read on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It's got a very basic plot with an over-the-top protagonist, and lots of side characters to play off against him. The art isn't terrible, but for what it is I would have liked to see a little more color. Also the ending was a little predictable. It was fine, but just a little short, like I mentioned before, which means it's a book you can read over and over until it feels like an extension of yourself.   Overall this is a book that I would enjoy a few times, but I wouldn't read it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I opened The Wind in the Willows  it was like a drug-induced nightmare.   The plot was interesting but I couldn't put my finger on it, it just felt off.  I kept expecting the story to have some sort of ending or resolution but it just kept getting worse and worse.  When you are in this mental state it feels like you are on a roller coaster, if you look too long at a rollercoaster then you will fall off the track.  A novel cannot possibly end on a high note.  I kept hoping that a character would appear at the end of the novel or that there would be a happy ending and I was frustrated by the fact that none of these things happened.  One of the main characters had a daughter, a sister that he loved very much, I felt for him because he had to lose a sister, but it was just too much to deal with to even get through the book.  To top it off, the ending was not satisfying, I don't know why they didn't kill him off at the last second or why the book didn't end the way I wanted it to.  This is just a very disapointing novel, I will not be reading any more of these books by Roald Dahl.  1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It wasn't terrible. It just lacked the spark.   "It was hard to take," she sighed, "but at least I tried."   My friend had just returned from a book convention in Las Vegas and returned to her home to get her belongings while waiting for her husband to pick her up. The novel that she was reading was not a book for her, nor was it a book that she had seen in the bookstore.  At the time of my book tour, I was asked on the streets of New York how I had gotten such great reviews.  I smiled.    "I don't," I said, "I got really great reviews."  It's a lie.    As for my favorite writer, I still adore J.R.R Tolkien, but he is no longer my favorite author.  There are three reasons for this. The first reason is that I am not a Tolkien fan, I have not read "The Lord of the Rings" in a year, and the last two parts have not even been published.  The second reason is my age.  As a teenager, my favorite authors were, and still are, George R.R Martin and Michael Moorcock.  That said, the three of them have their merits, and if I had to pick, I would have to say Michael Moorock.  A couple of years ago, I began to look into Tolkien's work more, and decided that I was actually getting into the series.  After all, the "Moorcock" of "The Children of Hurin" has a lot of similarities to the "Tolkien" of the "Lord of the Shire."  The last time I saw Tolkien, I had read "Eowyn"  in about two months.  I was only a week out of high school.   The third reason is how different "Lord Of The Rings" was from the other books I had been reading.  One day while walking along the beach with my mother, I noticed a billboard with a Tolkien quote on it.  While looking at it, I couldn't help but wonder how long the quote had been on the billboard.  About fifteen years ago it was removed.  The day I went back to the book I was reading, I started to get a really bad feeling about this book.  Even though I knew that this was a trilogy of three books, I didn't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last book i have to review that was on my "must have" list is by author Peter S. Beagle. This book is not one that i loved but the writing was just too good not to. In the beginning of the book when the main characters first get their ship, they see the ship that was the reason for the author's name being on the book's cover and it's the same ship that the characters are fighting with on the front cover. This ship has also been used as the ship of the main character's nemesis in the last few books and it does not disappoint. The story is not as much of a story of the character's lives as the story is about how people who have had a hard life (and even the main protagonist himself) are the reason that a book that they have read on a journey to the stars has reached a certain destination, and that if you're an exuberant explorer, you'll want to make your own journey, no matter how bad of a job you do. And yes, the characters do meet some aliens, which they must learn to live with as they come to terms with how they got to their current place in life and even a planet they will visit. It all does remind me of the beginning part of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. My biggest issue with the book, and this was mostly the reason why I gave it an "8.5" instead of a higher rating, was the ending. The book ends with this quote:  " I have no idea what happens next, or whether I'll be coming back. I think I will probably stay on earth until I run out of books. Or go back to writing novels. Or both."
Write a negative review about a bad book:      My review:   I did not like this book as much as I should have.   A group of kids find a strange book in the attic that explains some of their problems in life. The book tells the kids that they have to solve a riddle before the book will read the answer. The only problem is that a riddles isn't a game. It's a puzzle, it's a ruckus, it takes planning and thinking, and it's really hard to remember what you just put together.   I'm not sure that it was meant to be a book of riddles, more a novel. There are no puzzles or questions in the story and there are no hints or clues to the answer other than what you pick up from the book. The best it is a sort of "story" with the kids figuring it out by themselves.   It's not a bad story in its own right, but it's also not a r  My first review:A group  This book was very bad.I did like the idea, but I did not care for the execution.The story started off with a great premise: a group of teenagers find a weird book in their attic that they call their'saga'. This book was supposed to explain their problems, but instead it was a plot device that was never explained or made clear.The book was an exercise in pointless riddles.The riddles in the book had no logic or answer to be found, so it was basically a riddling story. The kids had to solve each riddle by themselves to find the answer to the rest. I'm sure that the kids would have solved the riddles without the book, but why they had to do this just to figure out the answer on their own I have no idea.When I first read the book I thought that the book was a great idea because I have been in a riddler's mood for some time now. I have always liked riddles because of how they challenge me to think, and the more you can get away with in a good riddle, the more fun the riddler will be for you. I found that the riddle in this book was rather lame and didn't require the kids to do any planning to solve. They could have put more time and thought into the story instead of giving them a rambling book.The first problem is how there's really no point to the riddly. Most
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very hard to review this book because the story is unbelievable. I mean this is the story about a guy that is found naked and covered in blood on the street, but I can't put it down. It is so hard to put down that I was almost tempted to do a no-review for this book. I am not a huge horror fan but this book left me in total shock. I was amazed by the violence, the violence in the scenes with the girls, the brutality, and the way that the author described them as if they were in the middle of a bad nightmare. I don't know how they managed to convince the reader that all this was just an act, that the violence was a dream, but it worked. All the girls in this story were so realistic in their bodies, in their expressions, and in the way they interacted with each other, and I really had a hard time placing them in the story. They were almost real, but they were not. It was like being in a real horror movie.     I also loved the descriptions of the "magic" of the author. I had to do it right then and there:     This book was so realistic and so real that I actually felt like a zombie, like someone who had no control over what was happening around me. I just don't understand how this author managed to write a good horror story but this story was just too unreal. And what I mean by that is that the story was real, like if the characters were just out on the streets, just being attacked by the creatures that inhabited this house, or just being in the basement of a house with a secret room, and they had a dream where they were being raped by these creatures and had no way of getting out of it, but there was something else going on. Something that was not so real, something that made you doubt your own eyes. I know that sounds very strange, but this way it was hard to believe the story even though it was so unreal that it made you almost believe it.    This story also left me wanting more. I wanted to know what was in the secret room. Did the monster really get out of the basement? What was the true reason that the narrator stayed in the same house? Did the girl have anything to do with the murder? What did she do in the room with the monster? And why would the monster do such a thing to such a poor girl
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This one is pretty awful. I'm a sucker for good romance, so it was great to finally get into a rom-com. The writing was OK at best, the characters were just terrible, the story was just bad, and the world building (in the form of a history book from the 60's) was just terrible. I just could not see how these two people would ever become so bad together. The last half of the book was so painful to read. If I had to write a review like this one, I would say "fucking awful."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of science fiction when I was growing up. I liked some of the stuff but was often bored, and a few years back a friend (a very nice guy) told me to read "The War of the Worlds." I picked it up, only to find that I liked the book even less than I thought I would. I don't normally read books with strong anti-religion messages, but this one is one of the more entertaining examples. The book is narrated by a girl from the future, and we follow her through the aftermath of an alien invasion of Earth. (This is one thing that makes it a good novel to read.) The book starts out strong enough, telling the main character's story, and the introduction of her family. Things get worse when her grandfather is brutally killed by the invading aliens. And then the book goes off the rails completely. In the second half of the book (after the alien invasion), the story moves from the near future to our world, and it gets very badly off track. In addition to this, the ending of the story is completely unsatisfactory. I'll admit I'm not the type of person who tends to like to complain about bad endings, but there's just something about this book that just didn't sit well with me. The last ten pages were utterly pointless and made the whole book seem a bit silly. If you have a hard time tolerating the kind of stories where the characters become completely insane (think Firefly or the Alien films), or just a story that gets off on telling the reader they're crazy and crazy, I wouldn't recommend this one to you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was one of the hardest I have read to date. It started very good and ended in a very unsatisfying ending. I would have liked more focus on the book's history, and it's possible the book could have been made better if the author had provided a different point of view. I'm not sure if the book was written as a stand-alone but the ending was very unsatisfactory. 5 of 5 stars   This is a brilliant read! An absolute gem of a book that is a perfect introduction to the great fantasy genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book, and I didn't really like it. It's just a poor excuse for a novel, a poorly written tale of a boy and his dog who are trying to rescue the people they love from the evil evil that is the evil man from the old story, the same evil that killed the parents of the girl he loved and took his family away from him, leaving him to have to take care of his dead dog. But that's just my opinion.  Review's format:  I don't have anything bad to say about this book; it's just bad. I don't remember much about it except the fact that I read it and it sucked; it was too horrible to finish it and not worth my time. I read through it as fast as possible after finishing my other book and it was much too much for me to get through.   It's only a novel and not a series. I think, however, that it was meant to be a series like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, which is about a boy who runs away to a magical world, meets a magical girl, and runs into all sorts of problems trying to return home.  :  My brother likes the idea that people need to be saved from evil, so his hero and girl have a secret plan to save the people from this evil. But this was an evil book; there were plenty of monsters in this book and there was definitely evil in this story.   was that my only complaint? :  Yes, it was a terrible novel that was worth just sitting down and reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a poor attempt to re-imagine or extend the scope of the novel's first act.   If you haven't read the novel, it may be difficult to figure out what's so great about it.  The main problem with The Magician's Land  is that it attempts to reenact the book's first two acts.  The Magicians land on earth.  As they travel, their powers are tested.  They meet the other inhabitants of earth.    The Magicist's Land is an attempt to replicate the structure of the first two chapters of the original.  In some ways, this is a great idea, but it doesn't work.  It's too long, it's too heavy on the retelling of what happened before, and it's not nearly as enjoyable as it ought to be.     The Magician  To summarize, the story is about a young man, named Tintin.  He was a child during the Second World War who is sent to live in an exotic land called The Magicland.  Tinten, being an incredibly strong willed child, is given his father's old red feather that he has used to draw his power.  Along with this red feather, Tintan is given a magical book called The Wizard's Book, that he can draw on his magic to use his powers to defeat evil magic.   The plot of the story revolves around Tint-in's quest to travel to The Magic Land and defeat the evil magician Dr. Frankenstein.  And, the plot of The Magicman's Land goes something like this: The MagicLand is in the middle of a war between two magicians, who are competing to take over The Land for themselves.   One of these magicians is called Doctor Frankenstein, who is the best at magic that he is capable of being.  This is a fairly straightforward plot, except for the part that it goes off the rails pretty much immediately.  It gets more interesting than that, but the story doesn't quite make its point. The problem with the plot is that when the reader is first introduced to the Magicland, it feels very familiar to the world we know from the second act of the book.   We get all the classic tropes, with humans traveling on horses, going by plane, and meeting other human beings.  But the magic that the Magic Land uses is somewhat different.   It's a sort of

Write a negative review about a bad book:    - - -   I had an interest in the genre of mystery. I read a lot of books but only a couple that were even remotely interesting. This book was a lot more interesting than most of the other books I have read. It was well written and the mystery element was good but I wish that I had read a few more mystery novels and not gotten this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only real downside is the book is so full of holes. The book has the basic structure of: A man and a woman meet, go to a party, get drunk, get into a fight, the woman leaves, and the man goes home. The woman leaves. That's it. Then they meet again. Then the man leaves again. And then the story goes on, and on, until the end. In the first 200 pages or so, it has a number of potential twists that would be fun to see play out. I'm not a great fan of the book, but it does at least provide one of those fun, unexpected story twists that people look for.   For someone who has read everything about the history of women and warfare since Ancient Greek times, it is a bit dull. The history is very dry, even for a history book. The focus of the story is on the women, not men. There is no mention of the fighting techniques or warfare techniques used during this time period. There are also no names given to the men who are actually fighting the women. There's a lot of back and forth between the women and the men. But that's about all the drama there is in this book.   In the end, it's really just a collection of war accounts. The historical events and battles are really nothing interesting at all. There seems to be a lot more of the "what ifs" in this particular book than the "facts" of the historical events.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was not bad, the characters were well done, the plot had a great twist, and the author managed to add to the plot in the end. However the book does suffer from a problem that I've come to expect from other bad books. The author did not develop the characters enough to have a real plot in this story. At the beginning of the book the characters are introduced and are all well thought out. Then, as the book progresses the author changes each of the characters to the point where none of them have any real character development. The characters that I really enjoyed are The Man in the Mirror and The Devil in the Room. Unfortunately the rest of the cast was just not very interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - - -   I wanted to love this book, but it is not really that. I'm not sure if the author had a bad day, or if this book is just hard to get through. The book is about a person who can control time. But, they do not know what is going to happen. In the beginning of the book, she was able to do a very nice thing. And it was pretty, and pretty simple, but in the end, everything was different. There were some bad events that came to her. Then, one day she felt a horrible thing. She felt that a very horrible thing happened. So she couldn't stop the pain and the thing hurt her more. This time, she wasn't able to control time, and there were some things that she can't stop.   And that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book. I was really interested in the story, but not sure how the ending worked. After finishing the story I felt that it was too long and I didn't feel like I got the full story, so I'm not sure I'm going to go back to this book to get more of the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was okay, I'm sure, and I liked the writing, but there were a lot of things that were wrong with it.   The most obvious is the way that I am supposed to be enjoying the story and enjoying the characters, but the writing just is not doing it for me.  It takes way too long to get to a point where I can say that there are real problems in the story, and that the problem is the author's (or whoever wrote it) choices (which were bad, in my opinion).   So much of the way the characters talk is just not right for this type of story, you're not supposed to feel like you're sitting on the edge of your seat, but you have this feeling that the characters are constantly running to and fro on their feet in a way that doesn't seem natural.  But I like some characters, I just don't like others.  That's all I have to say about that.  I feel like this book has some interesting ideas about people's lives and relationships, but it's all boiled down to this very cliche romance plot.  My favorite thing about the story is the description of the characters. They are all interesting, and it's hard to dislike them all. I did not really enjoy this book much. It felt rushed, and the pacing is all over the place. There is also an entire side story that doesn 't work very well at all. The main character of the story has a lot going on in her life (in a good way), so I can't imagine why she'd feel so out of sorts all of a sudden.

Write a negative review about a bad book:         A friend of mine who is an attorney, told me she recently came across a novel in which a child is told he has cancer and he is to take off his clothes and go to the hospital. The child has the choice of refusing to go to hospital and being sent home or going to hospital. He goes to hospital, dies, is cremated, and tells his father, "My daddy would never do that to me." It was a very sad story, but it was told in a way that made it seem like a realistic account of a child's choice to avoid getting treated for cancer.   My mother, who is one of my best friends and one of the most important and loving people in my life, has an aunt who suffered a massive stroke when she was 35 years old. My aunt, who was a brilliant writer, was in great shape for her age. She was working full-time and living her dream. She got married and had a child. When my mother heard about her illness, she felt so guilty about not helping her. After she lost her daughter, my mother said to her, "You were 35 and you got cancer? Then I guess I can't save you any more."   She didn't really mean it, but she still felt guilty about the loss of her best friend.  Another of my friends has a mother who is completely brain-dead and cannot speak, can't use her hands, can barely move her feet. My friend's mother told her mother, "The worst thing about my mom being brain- dead is I can never say goodbye to her and hug her good-bye."  In a way, both of these mothers are being true to their wishes. Both are being truthful. Both of these women are being in complete control of their lives. The problem is, for both of them, the control comes from the lack of a choice, and the problem with that is that if a man and a woman are going to die, it would be nice to know that they have control over their fate. It would be much nicer to know they have some say in how their lives turn out.  As an example of what I mean, let's look at the subject of suicide. Many studies show that the suicide rate among women is two to four times that of men. Women are four times more likely to attempt suicide, three times more often to die by suicide, and two and a half times more

Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I just don't like this one - I mean, if I were reading it for the first time I would probably love it, but the second I'm reading it I'm not sure what to think about it. If I were to be honest, I don't think the author even reads the book, just the review. I read the book a while back so I'm really familiar with the book and can say that this is a good book, but just not a very memorable one. - It is a really long book - it went on for well over 200 pages, so the plot is not particularly original or anything, but I found that it dragged on and on and it just wasn't exciting to read. - The characters don't do anything interesting at all - they're all just cardboard cutouts who repeat the same thing over and over again. I don  "There was a little girl who was a true witch, who believed that a man with a broom and a bucket could catch mice."  I just don 't like this book. Not for the characters, who aren't terribly memorable, but for the plot and the way it is written, which is pretty much a non-sequitur. It feels like it was just thrown together because the author wanted to have a novel to read for the holidays, but couldn't think of anything interesting to say. And as a result, it's just sort of there, doing nothing but repeating itself.The book follows a couple, a young boy named Harry and his friend, a witch named Sarah, who go on an adventure around their town. Harry and Sarah are tasked with tracking a giant bat-like monster, named "The Bats" to its lair, and there's no real twist in the story other than this: the story is told through the point of view of a boy and a girl.Harry goes off on his own on this adventure to search for the creature, Sarah accompanies him, and they make their way across town to find the monster. And then... the story just stops and the book moves into the past. I mean why would they bother to tell the story that way? I know this sounds kind of lame but it's actually really effective. Because all the time spent in the past is spent in detail, so that you really feel like there is a lot happening, because they're telling the story by describing the places they're going to and they don't really say a whole lot
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has not one original idea but rather a rehashing of many previous books.   This book makes a lot of claim about being a great book.   There is an impressive amount of work put in this book. However, there are also some glaring errors in logic.  Unfortunately, this means that the majority of the content is of a sub-par quality.  While the writing is of some quality, the errors are too numerous for the amount of effort that has been poured into this book to be worth the read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am so, so sorry I have read so many horror novels recently.     The author seems to be trying to write in the style of Stephen King, which doesn't seem very successful.  I got this book on a recommendation from a friend, but was disappointed when it was time to finish.      
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very good book with good stories and excellent writing. Unfortunately, the author completely overuses the words "socially awkward" and "genius." A lot of words come out of his mouth, and sometimes I found myself having to correct him. If you want a book that contains all the usual plot points: a teenage boy who has to deal with all the social challenges of growing up in a small town in a different world; a girl who helps him and doesn't seem to like him; a boy who is smarter and more attractive than the girl he loves and who has a crush on her; a plot twist that involves the murder of a teenage girl; and so forth, this is a good book for you. If, however, you are looking for something different and a little edgier and more philosophical; if you want to read a book with more story than action, and you have a high tolerance for social faux pas, then this is not a good choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot of this book was amazing!   But there were two problems with it.   First the author doesn't like to draw things realistically.  Secondly, the author was very careless with grammar and spelling.  This book is not bad, but it isn't good either.  There are a lot of good things in this book.  It just doesn't have enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read most of these books, but they never make me want to read more books from this author. I don't even like his writing style in a lot of the books I've tried to read. For example, I like his books on history, but his history books are the most boring and the least interesting I've ever read about that subject. His books about psychology and economics are good, but the only book I could imagine reading in this genre is a psychological psychology book. I read some of his science fiction, but it was either a bad translation, or just not interesting. I'm not sure whether I'm willing to spend a lot more money on this author's books, or I just have a high enough tolerance level to read some dull books.    "The problem, then, is that his works are too dense to be accessible to newbies. But, then again, this is an author who once described a book on the ancient Romans as a "tour of the human anus." " "The problem is that he's written a lot about people who aren't really famous. We know so little about them that many of the events in his stories seem completely improbable. "The trouble is that you'll have to be very well read to understand the stories he tells. A lot of his books take place in different countries, but if you only know a bit about a place you can't follow them. "And, by the way, I don's really liked some of these stories. But the problem is they're just so dull I don and really don't want to spend any more time on them. The whole genre of history in general just seems too difficult to me, and I find very little historical fiction to be of any interest."   In summary, I find this author to be quite boring. It's a shame as his books are quite interesting, but I don"t understand why he's still writing. This is why I didn't buy any of his recent books: They were just too boring. There were some interesting characters, but as the author has said, they're very hard to understand. So, as I said, I didn"t buy any books from him for some time, but now that I've finished them, I"m interested in reading some of them. I wish I would have read them some time ago, because they were fun and interesting to read, but unfortunately, I've just finished reading them
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was bad. I really wanted this book to be good. I wanted to give it 4 stars. This book is a waste of time. I am going to finish it because I know I need to do the reading to get a sense of this character. I got this book because it's a hard sci-fi story, and since it was free I picked it up because I was curious. I expected it to be worth my time and I am very disappointed with the story and the character. It would be nice if the author had spent more time exploring the setting, making the characters more human and not just the aliens, and it would have been nice if she would have spent more attention on making the book interesting, instead of the aliens. I'm sorry, I should have saved my money and read a good book instead of this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is good but lacks some key elements that make it a great book. The book starts out slow and has a very slow buildup to it. This is the perfect time to read a book that will not be ruined by a cliffhanger. You have been warned.   "The end of the book is a lot of bullshit"   My brother had been talking to me about how this book felt similar to the movie, but it did not feel like the movie. There were scenes where characters just stopped talking and had a conversation, which was amazing. However, the pacing felt very off in this book. When this was happening, the character was talking to a person of the opposite sex. I thought that was so clichéd to say, but they did it so it felt true. For the most part, I was enjoying the book, but I felt like the pacing was off. Overall, a solid read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What I'm trying to say is that I have been really impressed by this book, but I'm not sure I'll continue reading it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a small book shop in the old city of Damascus where I went as a tourist and had a bad experience in that store and will never return. This is a bad one. There are many bad ones in the city but not this one. The place is not clean, the people are rude and they make you spend a lot of money on useless stuff. I asked the clerk for a few papers and he said he had to call the police or something because I didn't have a permit to take a picture of a monument in the middle of the city. He also said that all tourists must have a photo permit and that was fine because he didn't know why I wanted a permit when there is a store in the other direction that sells everything. It's a bad store but you have to go there if you want to buy something.  A nice little store to have on your way around the Old City. They carry a wide selection of books, posters, postcards, souvenirs, and even a few books. The book selection is fairly diverse, though mostly old ones. I purchased some interesting old French and Greek texts and some Arabic books. I can recommend the bookshelf that is currently occupied by books about the siege of Damascus, which is about a siege that took place in 1692-94. The next shelf over houses a variety of Arab and European translations of the Quran and a couple of Arabic books, all of which are interesting and have an Arabic translation. They also carry a nice selection of French novels and some of the more recent French translations of classical French poets. The shopkeeper is very helpful and friendly and I hope they continue to stay open.  a place where I go to buy books, a place to get a book. the bookstore owner, M.D., is nice and greets me in Arabic, but his English is not very good. so I have to translate all my questions to him. - the best way to go is to go early before they close (like 8 or 9 am, or at least half an hour before the doors close, but I go at 9:30 am, and his answer is "it will not sell", so i'm pretty sure there is something going on) - you can have a snack (I get some juice) or drink something (caffeine is good) before going in to get your book - the first few times i went in for a book, the clerk was speaking French, and
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a good book and this was a disaster.   A poor translation and poor characterization ruined it for me.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You may find that you really like something you wrote a few weeks ago and didn't realize it at the time.   If you do, you can write a more negative review, because it's hard to have an opinion in a book that you haven't actually read.  But if you're going to write a negative one, then you should do it after a week or two of having read it.  It's much easier to have a one-word opinion about something you haven.  I also find that the best way to remember a bad review is to tell yourself that that review is written a few hours after you've finished reading the book.  You're going out in a few minutes and you're like, "Oh man, I didn't really like this.  This book is shit."  Now, imagine you finish a book in a day and the only thing you're thinking about is how you don't want to finish it.   3.     Make a list of books that you think you may have a problem with:      This is a very common and effective technique that almost all people use to deal with reading.  Many people start to wonder what they really think about a book and think they should take it out and read it again before they can say what they actually think about it. I have a hard time with this, because I think you should take a second to think about something and then write your opinion about it in your book (if it's a short book).  I think I'm going to have to go buy a copy of it just so I can read it over and over.  If you're really trying to figure out what you think about the book, this is one way to approach it. The problem with this technique is that you're making a list in your head about the things you don ald really dislike about a particular book. The thing is, you don 't know what you don' t like about a certain book until you read it for the first time.   Now, you could read this list and go, "I really didn't like it."  But it wouldn't help you any.    You'll just find that some of these things you didn't dislike at the first reading are actually more fun to read about.  Some of the things in your list might just have nothing to do with the story.  If a book is too long, for
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So, in conclusion, I can safely say that this book is the worst book I've ever had the displeasure to read. There are only three or so good things about it, which is sad because that's about all there is. It's just a bunch of cliche, cliché, terrible plotlines, and a few truly terrible characters. I hated all of them. As a reader, I wanted to like it but, as a person, I couldn't enjoy it. Maybe if I was a fan of bad novels I wouldn't have a problem with this one but I couldn  What the hell is a sibilant whisper?  There was a time when I felt that the world was falling apart around me. This was before my sister married a man who had a large family of slaves who worked for him in his large farm. This family, who seemed to always be in some sort of trouble or predicament, never ever seemed to get better. They were always in danger, always in a crisis. They never seemed to have any kind of solution. My mother, who had had many children before, never felt she had enough to feed all of these children. They all went hungry. This man, my father-in-law, my brother, the children, and the wife, my sister, had little food of their own. They had no money to go out and buy any. They lived in fear that the next day they would all be killed, if not by the man and then by another member of the family. The only thing they could rely on was their fear of the man. I never was the same after I heard my father in law tell my mother that I and my sister were going to be killed by him. I don't know how I could have survived this for another two years. I mean, if I could, I might have. But, even after he got rid of me and his children, the man just continued to kill me and my sisters for no reason. He would go to the slave markets on Sundays, where people would be willing to sell themselves and their children, just to get rid of my sister. And every week, we would hear that he had tried to kill my father. We always thought it was just a matter of time before it was our turn to be sold off to someone else. When my father would tell my sisters that the man had killed my father, she would just give me this look. She said
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author writes in a very poor way.   I have read many other books that were good, but this is not one of them. It has a huge plot hole, a very boring ending, and some very silly plot development.  I do not recommend this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The book is a waste of time and money and doesn't deserve it." "There is no story, just pages and pages of technical terms and a lot of boring boring text. This is a really boring book and I won't be buying it."  This review is of the third edition of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Computer Programming, written by David K. Wheeler. The first edition, published in 1978, has been out of print for a long time, but some hard-to-find second-hand copies are available. The second edition, with the first book's new cover, was published in 1993. In this review I will primarily comment on the third, fourth, and fifth editions. I am not a programmer, so my own experience using these books is limited. I would therefore welcome other opinions on the books. I have a hard time finding these books in English in the United States, which makes it hard to discuss them. (The first edition was printed in English, but it was printed by a different publisher, so the covers do not match.)  One of the best features of these books -- besides their high quality and reasonable price -- is that Wheeler is the one who wrote them, but not the editor. Although this is not strictly accurate, it is close enough. They have a strong, consistent style. Some authors do not care to bother to write their own copy-editing, as Wheeler does, or to edit out extraneous words, but he is careful to correct the errors in the second edition. It is difficult to read the first edition and not notice the frequent, grammatical mistakes; the same is true of the second. These books were the only ones I used in college, and they taught me a lot about programming. I was able to read them while at school, even while doing some work in assembly language; I was not a good student, but I could read them and do some coding.  Unfortunately, these books are difficult to use in today's computers. Most of the programming code is written in assembly code, which is hard to understand and hard to change. Many programs use macros that do not compile, and the code is difficult even for experienced assemblers to understand. Even more serious problems occur in the first- and third-edition books, where they have been published for years, and where many pages are not readable. Wheeler seems to be trying to avoid these problems, but the books are hard to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I can say is that I would've been more pleased with it had the book written the way it was supposed to. The author is the best, not by a hair, but by a lot. I'd say that she is probably better at writing female characters than male ones. It would have been great if, like in the last book in the series, the author had a more diverse range of characters. It's a shame that the ending was like this, as it was not at all what I expected. The way that the book ended I thought was a bit strange and disappointing, but I'm not sure if it was intentional or not. The book is a little longer than I thought it would be. It didn't feel as short as I thought, so maybe the end is good.   "The Way" is definitely more of a stand-alone book, but if you were interested in the story then I don't think it's too bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book, but it was a disappointment.   It was a little too detailed, and there was too much "this has to happen to this person" in the first act, and I was wondering what was going on the entire time.  As if on purpose.  The second act was too focused on plot, and it's like they wanted to just have the big climax, but they never really explained it.  It also just felt to me like the book was written a bit rushed and not well planned out.  For a first book of any genre, that's a HUGE letdown.  Overall, it's a fun read and a solid book, and if you're looking for a story with a mystery, or a suspense thriller, this is a great one.  "A good book never needs a sequel.  Good books always demand one.  "     -M.V. Lee "As a long-time fan of the paranormal genre, I am very pleased to see that I was not completely disappointed with this book.  I liked the idea of using a supernatural thriller like this for an introduction to the paranormal mysteries that will be introduced throughout the series, and the characters were well-developed and interesting.  There were a few things about the book that irked me, but in the end, I think that they did a good job of keeping the story going and making sure that the mystery was not resolved.    There was a lot going on in this book and it left me wanting more." -Kathy D "Well written, and filled with mystery and suspense.  While I can not help but to smile a few times, I found the final installment to be lacking, but not completely, as the events that are described feel a little bit rushed as I'm sure the book did not need to be so complex and lengthy.  In any case, it was good, and enjoyable.  If you are a fan of mystery, suspense, and/or suspense thrillers, this book is definitely worth a read."   -Evan M "The book does not really leave you with much after you finish it. It seems like there was just not enough time spent in the book."  "It was a good mystery and a good book. I just did not enjoy the ending."  -Mick S. "I found the story to be very well written

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a few of the books in this series, and while it is a very good story, I feel that there are some things that were overlooked or missed.   The first book is a perfect example. It is the first in the series and covers the character development of the first book. It introduces our lead character as a 15 year old girl who is bullied by a group of girls who she has had sex with. The story is pretty good, and I thought it was very well told. The problem with the book is that it was written by a man, who writes a lot of male dominated books. It seemed as though it was all the same girls talking about the same thing over and over again, but I feel this is a problem with books written by men that I have encountered.  , is another book in the Harry Potter series. Again, a very enjoyable story. It takes place after the end of the last book. The main character was a wizard who went to the Quidditch World Cup to get revenge on the bullies. While the story has some elements of the series (like Quiddich, and the Triwizard Tournament), the author also wrote a very well written Harry Potter fanfic. The book is very well researched and interesting. It's got a lot going on with the Tri-Wizard tournament, and a lot is happening that we haven't seen yet in the books. I love this book and it's my favorite book of the Harry potter series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a pile of lies that I can not give a good rating for. I have read the first 20% and the rest are just flat out lies.   First: I am from Texas and have not lived in Arkansas at all this summer, yet I still have to explain what the hell that is. I am also not a fan of Arkansas either, but I am sure if I were they would be the same with my experience in a large part because of the large percentage of the population that is in prison.   of the 20% of the people who are in prison the majority of them are nonviolent drug offenders.   And the majority who are not in prison are non-violent drug offenders who have been convicted on a drug related felony.     The majority of the drug offenders are not selling drugs to sell drugs. There are some drug dealers who sell drugs and a large percentage are people who sell and buy drugs. And of course there are some people who have an addiction to drugs, but those are not drug dealers.  The other 60% are murderers and rapists and child molesters and child abusers and rapists. The only thing they have in common with people selling drugs is they are people that have not had the ability to have their lives back or do a good job with the time that they have. And they are all people that do not fit in with any category of the law, yet the government still forces their life back onto them through a draconian law.   I cannot believe how some states have created such a law because they are violating people's rights for the "crime" of being in a cell in a prison. And the number one issue is that this was written and is being enforced by the people's representatives!    I will be writing another review when the book is published, but in the meantime I would like to say that my review should not be interpreted as my own opinion or the opinion of all people who write this genre. My point here is just to point out that in the next 3 years of this "new" law the people that make up 80-90% of prison populations will still be able to do whatever they want with no consequences because the government can say "well if you do this you will be in prison for the rest of your life!"   And the people in that 20% that aren't murderers and non-offenders will be able do whatever the hell they want for the entire 20 years
Write a negative review about a bad book:    To those who have purchased this, I really do hope that you had a pleasant experience. I have read the whole book, and I have to say that there are things in the story that bothered me, and there is an obvious lack of a certain type of personality. There were many times when I didn't feel that the characters had as much depth as I would have liked, and it was a bit disappointing.   The plot was ok, nothing that I am not used to, but there were a few things that I don't like: 1. The use of the term "Dementors". I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and as such I get a bit annoyed when a movie makes use of Dementors, because the Dementor is a thing from the books that is just used to give people fear (the Dementored's eyes are blue). In this film they just make up some new word for the thing. 2. The "Rubeus Hagrid" thing was quite a shocker. I do believe they are a wizard, but the actor playing him is quite ridiculous.  In my opinion, this is my second favorite film of all time.   This was great, and if you haven't seen it you should!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title alone will turn a few heads, but in reality this is a very good book. I just didn't like the protagonist, the main character doesn't really seem to be a likable person. He acts like a spoiled brat and I didn't really enjoy the story. He was a bit boring for me, I felt there were so many better characters.  6.5 Stars  9/10
Write a negative review about a bad book:     " This book is not a book that has made me re-evaluate my world view and my faith. I do not think the author is as a Christian as he says he is. There is only a small part of the book that is actually about Jesus but that is the least of it. I find it hard to believe that this is a genuine Christian book but it is. I don't even know how to describe the book. It is a little too much, to say the least. I would have rated this book three stars but it needs to be revised to four, maybe even five. It does not follow the pattern in the Bible and I cannot put it down." "I think this book is a very interesting look at the Bible but I don´t think it makes much of a case for Christianity."  The Author  David Chilton has always had an interest in Christian theology. The former Presbyterian pastor, who attended the University of Oxford, became a Christian minister and has taught at the Evangelical Theological Society (ETS) in London for almost 20 years. He is currently at the Institute for New Thought in Colorado, and writes on the history of Christian thought for the British public media. He has a PhD in Ancient Mediterranean History from Oxford University and taught at Cambridge University before returning to the UK to teach at ETS.  As he tells us,  My own life journey was not always a happy one. My early Christian experience included an early loss of faith and the subsequent struggle to come to terms with the pain that accompanied it. My journey is now one of coming to terms and having a good laugh at the absurdities of my former beliefs, the hypocrisies of my fellow Christians, and, now, in my younger years, a very good deal of intellectual curiosity about what it is about the Christian faith that makes me happy and healthy. I feel that the faith I have discovered in my own time has much in common with the faith that Jesus taught. As a teacher of comparative religion I am often called upon to explain some of the Christian doctrine I have encountered, whether from the modern day or the Middle Ages. At times I find myself saying "the Jesus story that is in the New Testament is not the Jesus story as we find it in the Old Testament." -From The Author's Blog -  Why are people so easily influenced? What is it about Christianity that makes people so prone to accepting everything that is said about
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was one that i had given very low scores and was only recommended to a few friends. However, after reading a couple of chapters, I have to give it a higher rating than my last. The story is pretty good and i can see where the author drew from his experiences when he started writing. However this story doesn't stand up to my expectations.   My main complaint is that the first half of the story was very predictable and made me want to see the next chapters to see if this book will make the story more interesting. It was not. There were so many plot-holes and the story just kept ending in the same place without a satisfying conclusion.  The most disappointing thing was when the author states that he could've written a better ending for the story.  The only reason I gave this book 3.5 stars is because the first part was very well written. The plot was good and the characters were likable. Unfortunately after that it turned bad and the writer made the whole book seem like a chore. If you are looking for a good story about a boy who just had to get out of his comfort zone and learn to be a man and accept his own faults then this is definitely the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a teenager, and I hated it.   The only thing I liked about it was the humor:  The main character, Max, is a high-strung teenage boy whose father died when he was young, leaving him with the role of breadwinner for the family.  He has a girlfriend who has her own problems, and Max is always on the edge of being thrown out of his house, even when his girlfriend is in the same school.  It's a fun little romp, but the ending was not funny and it was just a waste of my time.  I'll probably be trying to read it when I'm older, if only because I love it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a bit skeptical about The Way of All Flesh. I mean, I'm a fan of Catherynne Valente's The Mirror Empire trilogy, but this novel was a toughie to read and to understand. I got through the first two thirds, then had to stop. It seemed a bit long, and I found myself wishing for a cut-down third of the novel instead of having to read the first few sections all over again.  I suppose that's a good thing, because the third half is the best part of the book.  The Way was a fascinating look at the effects of being a woman in a patriarchal society:  The author was able to get some of the most realistic writing from a female writer I've read to date. I never knew what to expect, but I couldn't have been more satisfied. The author's ability to be convincing and sympathetic and believable was amazing. I was surprised by the degree of emotional depth she brought to this book. It makes me think a bit harder about the effects that sexism has on our lives, both in the short and the long term. It was so well written and so well read.   I think this is a book I'd recommend to a reader who is interested in the subject matter. It's a well-researched and well-written book, and it was great fun to read.   I was very pleased with this book, but it still left me with a nagging feeling that I'd like to read more of the series, so I can see what this book is all about. I'm also going to have to re-read some of The Mirror Empires next week, to get a better sense of where the series is at. I can't wait!    The Way of the Immortal is also available from Tor Books.  I got a signed copy through NetGalley.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have found several times that I cannot get into a new book, especially an easy read, because I can not get past the bad writing.   This book was exactly that for me. I think I read the first few chapters on a Kindle Fire and just couldn't get past a couple of the chapters on the first day of reading. I read another book in which the characters used a "vacuum cleaner" to clean a room, and I thought it was pretty funny and funny, but this time it wasn't funny. So I thought to myself, "why not just use a broom?" and then found out the broom was pretty expensive and that the "vacsuum cleaner", which I think is a horse and it can be a good idea, is about a hundred bucks.  Also, I had a problem with a couple in the book, the main female character was very young in age.  I also had a big problem with the female's body and she always was in the shower at least once and once in every bath she was naked (not sure why that is the case, but I was a little bothered by it), so she seemed a bit unrealistic to me.  Finally, I would just like to say that I have never read a book this poor in its editing.  It seems to be quite a common occurrence in the last year or so for books to be edited to get them out before their time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a long-time reader of this website. I have been going back and forth a few times on which of the three books to review first. This is my fourth trip to this site. I like these books and I like this site as well. I wanted to try my hand at writing one but didn't want to risk anything and so I decided to stick to the three first published in this series, 'The Dark Tower'. The first book, 'Dark Tower' was a great beginning to the series and I was glad to have finally read it. Then the third book, was great too but was a bit rushed with the ending. I love the characters, the world building, the magic, and the gunslinging. The first 3 books are fun to read and there are very little things that could be improved, especially in the second book where I found myself getting frustrated that the author got bogged down in world building at times and didn't seem to care as much about the plot. The last book, the second one has a bit of a jump and is a little bit of an overstuffed book with so much backstory, characters, etc that I felt like the world didn't have enough time to breathe. Not that I couldn't tell, because there were plenty of details to keep you guessing. I'm glad this series is still going but I felt the last one didn't really have all that much to offer except for the world-building and gunslingin'. My next read will be The Drawing of the Three. I am planning to take this book as a jumping-on point and work my way back from there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -   This book was so bad that I didn't want to go back to it even when I knew it was a "no" and wasn't worth reading. If you don't want a bad read this is a pretty bad read. The stories are good and the art is good but the writing is terrible and the writing isn't even good enough for it to be a bad story. It has so many problems with characters and events that it makes it seem like the book was written as a long story about a group of characters, not a series. Also the writing seems very choppy and not very interesting. The only real character is the girl who runs the cafe. The author had a really good idea in the first story about how she would act like the character but she just wasn't that likable and the whole thing just ended up a mess. I don't really care for this series and I have little hope for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first book I've read by a young woman that was actually funny. My only complaint is that it could have been more like a play instead of a novel. The story was well-told and I did like the characters more than what I had expected.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have ever bought a book for a kid, you probably bought the same book again and again. The fact that it's a "kids book" isn't a bad thing--in fact, the kids' characters are engaging and colorful. However, as a grown-up who reads for enjoyment, this was not one of the books I would have wanted to share with my kids. The author (who writes for the Internet and the Kindle) is an avid reader who writes short stories and short-short fiction for the Kindle, and he was clearly inspired by the best authors in the world and their ability to communicate their ideas in a way that is easy to understand. It's just that I found the book to be dry and tedious. While the kids were very cute and fun to read, I didn't find that this story was anything I'd want to read again. A few times, it became too much to handle. It has a few memorable scenes, but nothing that will stick with me long after I've finished the book. I'd rate it 5 stars for the humor and the good writing, but I'd probably give it 1 star if I had to read it to my own children.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not that this book was a bad read. I just found it dull. There's only so much you can do with a short story and there are times I thought about why I read a short book and found it wasn't very memorable.   Overall, a good read and I've found some good short stories in there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A lot of people have written about this book. It's a long one. But so is a lot of great books. And it is hard to go wrong with a good book by John Scalzi. It was a great experience reading this book, and the writing is superb. A new favorite.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In an excellent review of The Golden Compass (The first of his four-book series for young adults that started with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and finished with The Sorcerer's Stone ) Michael Grant wrote: It is not quite the classic children's book that its critics have made it out to be, but that's partly because its success rests on a false premise. What is the fallacy? Grant is a great fan of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and he writes with the warm affection of someone who genuinely loves his children's novels. But what about the book's story arc?  I'll leave that for you to decide, because the book is full of surprises, twists, and betrayals. I loved the second book ( The Subtle Knife ) much more than The Golden Scroll, and I think it is the weaker of the three, in part because it lacked some of the magic that made the first book so entertaining. But what makes me a fan of this book is that the magic is something Grant understands, and I know why he's so fond of it. It's a classic kind of magic. The wizards and witches of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world use the old and the new, the sacred and the profane, but Grant understands the difference between the two, which is why the magic works. The "Old Way" of magic is a lot like that of religion—you use it to make the world a better place. In his review Grant mentions that a reader might feel frustrated by the plot twists, but I disagree. I found myself eager to find out what would happen next—something about magic in children's fiction is always interesting. The plot twist is not an act of God or a "bad" plot twist. It is the magic itself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     One of the worst I've ever read. What a waste of time. The story is pretty interesting, but is totally predictable. I guess I wasn't expecting a series like this, but this is just one example of a really bad book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it a bit too serious for my tastes. There is little humour, and a lot of drama, but that is more an effect of having to wait until you are ready to read.   (Not to be confused with the series of short stories in a very similar tone, which are more amusing.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a man that was a criminal in his youth and that he had gone straight, not out of a sense of moral obligation but because it was easier than going to jail for a crime he didn't commit. When he meets his wife, she tells him he's going to be a great father for his son, and the two of them bond over this news. She's also going to tell him about her affair. She tells him that he's been with her before, and he says he's not. He goes on to ask her out on a date, and she says that she's not ready yet. He finds this disappointing, and in the middle of a fight with his wife's father he finds out that his wife and her father have been talking about him the past few months. The wife's mother tells him not to let his wife find out about his affair with his mother. His wife tells him she's had a lot of sexual encounters, and one of them was with his father, so it's okay. His son is furious and he's about to fire his father because of it, when the wife shows up at his office and tells him they've been talking in private for the past year, and her husband is telling her to have an affair with him. So there's really two things going on here: a) The husband is in an affair because of his wife. b) The wife is in the affair because her husband wanted her to be. I think there's a lot more going on than the book covers. In the second half of the book I couldn't tell if the wife was just saying this for the sake of getting out of trouble or if the husband had cheated on her. I'm also interested in the question of the meaning of the name of this place: Haltom is a pretty big deal. And the people living here are just so... normal. I'd love to hear what you thought of this book and this character, and if you have any additional thoughts on the story or if you've seen it on screen or in a film. Posted by Andrew P. Meyer at 9:19 AM I've always felt that the best books I read are ones where I am completely immersed in the characters' lives. I really like the world of this novel, and I found that there's so much more going and it's so rich, and so well thought-out. But as a reader, it's easy to
Write a negative review about a bad book:   When I bought my copy of, I thought this was going to be great, but it was just ok, and I'm glad I read it. In some ways, the story felt like a fan-fiction, where the author put himself into the character's mind, and wrote a story from his perspective. It got a lot better as I got deeper into the novel, but I still wasn't into it. The story is told from the character of John Paul, a man who's in his 50s, living in New Jersey. He had a lot of success as a businessman in his early days, but that changed dramatically when he was a young man. The main thing he wants is to be the best lawyer in the state of New Jersey, but he doesn't feel he's good enough. That doesn't stop him from trying, though, because if he fails, then it's someone else's fault. Unfortunately, when the big case comes, he's not the best choice for the job. He ends up becoming the biggest target in the town, because he's a foreigner, and they're always looking for an excuse to beat up on foreigners. It was a fun book, but one that didn't make me feel anything, and didn't feel like the author cared what I thought about it. 4.3 out of 5 stars I'm a big fan of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books. I have a few copies of A Memory of Light in my library, and it's one of my favorite series ever, as it's full of action, adventure, and wonderful characters. While the first five books are great and very much worth a read, the sixth and final book is a little... not so great. The sixth book in the series, "Night of Dreams," is by far my least favorite book in this series. It's a lot like "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" from the books by C.S. Lewis. It has the action of the first two books, but there's a plot twist in the middle. I was also disappointed because I wanted more information about the characters, and not just what happened. I'm not going to say anything bad about this book, because it's not bad. It just didn't work for me, and that was just too bad. Maybe I'm just not a big Rand fan, but this book just didn 't make me a fan of this series in the way I wanted
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first started this, I liked it but was let down by the ending. That being said, I have to say I have not been disappointed by the rest of the book. I have read plenty of books about war and military life. My favorite of those books is the book that inspired the book I read about this book. It was written by a retired soldier, who wrote a book called "Towering Inferno: A Soldier's Story of Battle and Sacrifice." The book is about what it was like for him to go from the United States Marine Corps to the Peace Corps and then back into the service of his country. I had never read this book before and was really intrigued by this book's tale. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to know what it is like to be a soldier. The book really was worth the read. The only complaint I have about the book is the ending, where it takes a turn for the dark and the characters are left to their own devices. There are some really good stories in this book, and it is a shame that the ending was so disappointing. I just finished this book after having read the other two books and it left me with a feeling of sadness.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -   So I read this book by a friend. She was a first time reader. The reviews were good. The only problem was that it was not good enough. It was way too short. I found this book to be boring and dull. You will not find any new ideas or anything original here. However I will admit that this is a nice read and you will like this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only downside of The King of the North   was that I couldn't bring myself to finish the book. This isn't because it was boring or poorly written (although it was), but because of the way that the story was built up. The beginning and middle of the book are slow. The last third of the story is much faster. The pacing felt off to me. The story of the war has been set up very well, but I was just tired of it. There are a lot of scenes that could have been cut, or which were unnecessary, and in the end the book was so lacking in plot that I wanted it to end right there, and not be resolved. For those of you who like your fantasy to be resolved in one book, don't read this one.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been described by people as "a work of fiction"   that is "highly problematic and uninspired"  to "poorly written and overly emotional"  which leads to "the characters feeling empty and lacking in depth"  and even "the plot being incredibly predictable, repetitive, and predictable"  It was written in 1998 and is an extremely recent re-telling of the story and the events in the book that I remember so clearly.    The plot of the book is very interesting and it is not unlike the book I read about a year ago and the one I saw the movie about a month before this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a well-written, well-designed, and highly entertaining novel, and one that, on the surface, sounds a lot like the first Star Trek movie. It may be a great experience for a Trekkie, but there's nothing about it that's really original.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   .  I'm a great believer in the power of positive thinking and that the ability to make positive changes in our lives can actually be a positive force in our society.    That's a lot of talk about "positive thinking".   I do this with all my books, but in this particular case, I believe that people really do need positive thinking strategies and techniques, especially when they're facing a loss.  "If you only have one thing to say, it is that negative thinking is a huge waste of time and energy because there is no chance of changing anything and you can waste a whole lot of time. You need positive ways of thinking that can really help you change things. For example, if you want to be more optimistic, look at negative things as signs of weakness."   "It is a common belief that negative beliefs about oneself cause us to be unhappy. Negative thinking is not an illness. It is a way of making life more bearable." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book and it is one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style is so bad it's not even funny.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book because of what I had heard about it. However, I am disappointed in this book, mainly because I am not sure the author has fully studied the various aspects of how men and women behave on dating websites, but I guess that is the cost of exploring this subject matter, right? There are two problems with this book: (1)   The author claims that he has been to an internet dating site and observed and listened to women and men on it; but he never mentions how he actually went to the internet dating website to observe and listen to what women and even men are doing and saying on the dating site.   This may be because he didn't find a good place to go to the Internet, and (2)  This book has been reviewed in a lot of other places, and has been criticized as being too harsh towards women on the internet; but I don't see why.  In fact, if the reviewer would have just read some of the other good reviews that he found, they would see that the reviewer, the author, is not giving a very complete picture of what men and female online interaction on dating sites is like.  I found it interesting to hear and read about some of what women say on dating website and the ways men behave on those sites, but since the author doesn't really take the time to examine his own experience, he gives the author an incomplete story of what happens on a dating site with women (I think this author has a bias against women, and he didn t like this book when I read it). In fact the author claims to have been on a "dating website" with a woman and has observed how she behaved, but he does not mention what he actually did on that dating website. In fact if a person had done that experiment, they most likely would have found that she acted just as poorly as she does on this site. This may just be because they have been told stories of bad women online, but that doesnt give the author any credit for actually trying to make a complete picture, because he doesn t give any. However I think that this book was better written before he changed some of his mind.  What I am trying to say is that I found this book to be poorly written, with some bad assumptions, and lacking in a good understanding of the subject matter (but I may be too harsh and critical). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is a massive mess and a major waste of space. It is filled with a whole bunch of information, but very little actual meaning. I got a little more meaning from the information in the back of the book, but this is all just very academic. It took me forever to finish this book because all I was interested in was reading about the various people in the book who are all so stupid that it is very hard for me to not roll my eyes. The characters themselves are all quite stupid and very little is even done to flesh them out as human beings. I'm sorry that I actually spent so much time reading this book, I'm sure it's not going to be a very popular read, and I can only imagine it would be a lot harder to finish for anyone who actually read the book. I have no idea how much I would have enjoyed this book if I had actually read it. It was probably something like reading The God Delusion or one of those books with the book club reviews, but with an entirely different sort of content. I really enjoyed the idea of a group of intelligent but socially inept people living together but I just didn't find it in this book. So, there's that.  Helpful Reading:  "How much does a college graduate earn? What is it worth in the stock market? What does the average male make? How much do female athletes earn? How many female musicians earn? These and hundreds of other questions were addressed in "The Education of Henry Adams" by Henry Adams. For the sake of clarity, we'll concentrate here on the answers to the questions posed in the last paragraph: This is an amazing book because the author, Henry Adams, was not only smart enough to know what he was talking about, he was smart enough not to get himself fooled by the academic language used to describe a work of genius. This is what you'll read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In any case, this book should not have been written; its thesis is flawed and not worth reading. This book should never have been published; and that is what makes it so disappointing. It is a book that claims that the U.S. is "the world's number one terrorist state," when it clearly is not, and it is a fraud to claim that the United States does not engage in the kinds of activities that are "the hallmark of terrorist states." The book's claim that "U.S.-led interventions in the Middle East have not only had devastating effects on Iraqi society, they have also undermined the United Nations' ability to act effectively as a peacekeeping force" is based on a misreading of history, a distortion of the relevant literature, and a gross misreading. As a result, the book does not even claim to be an honest historical analysis, but rather a book of deceit and deceitful distortions. In the end, the authors' attempt to portray the "bad war" in Iraq as "the war that changed the world" is pure fiction, based on pure propaganda.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of the series, but for some reason I have been disappointed by the last book. The characters were not developed very well at all.   There is a definite lack of development.  The way we are introduced to the characters is a little confusing.  I think that there is a reason why this has been cancelled, and that is because the last series (The Way of Kings) was so good!  I have read all of the books but one and the last was the worst.  The first book was so original and unique it would have been hard to copy, and I would have loved to know what happened to some of the characters.  As someone with high hopes for this series I don't want to know how much worse this book is going to be, but I do hope for a better book. 1 out of 1 found this review helpful. "What can change the nature of a man? The nature of time." The Great War, 1914-1918.  I was introduced to R.A. Salvatore via his books The Expanse and The Red List, and as someone with a deep interest in history, I was eager to see what his upcoming fantasy epic would entail.  Although I had the good fortune to be a beta reader for The Red Lists, I never read any of the Salvatores, so it wasn't until now that I finally picked up The Great Game.  With a cover full of gold and a subtitle that sounds like it was written by James Joyce (which I didn't even realize was a thing until I read the book), I thought I was in for a treat.  Unfortunately, the first half of the book left a lot to be desired.  There were several times where the world building was just...okay.  These were the moments when I was waiting for the author to fill me in.  Fortunately, there were some moments when the author was doing that.  But after the first couple of hundred pages I was ready to give up.  At the end of the first book I just wanted to know where this story was going.  This book just left me a little disappointed.  It is a very well done series, with a high fantasy twist, but it is just not what I expected.   1 star out of 5 "There is always a beginning and an end. And there is always work to do." The Hero,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a very very good book by a very good author. It is well written, very entertaining, but unfortunately not well written in terms of its content, so the content is not good.   It is interesting and has some good humor. But it is not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I ever do write a negative review about a book again, it will be about the last part.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The way we are taught to read and write today is such a detriment to our youth and our nation. They should all be taught to use the written word with care. I would like to make a recommendation to my teachers and the schools. There should be a requirement for teachers to read every book published this year. Reading is a critical skill and this is a good book that is not to be missed." ~C.F.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing in this is poor.  It is boring to read.  There is not a lot to like in this book.  The characters are not interesting.  They are just there to act as background for the main story.  I didn't have a whole lot of interest in this, but I did not expect much. The only good thing about this book is that the author is self-publishing a book, so if that has an influence on the writing, then that is something I will consider.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will always give a 5 out of 5 for the story and for being a complete mystery book.   The main character (the one the reader should love) is a perfect guy. He is a hardworking kid and he is one of my favorite characters ever. However, the mystery behind the murders of the women in the town isn't that great and the book didn't come close to solving it.  I would definitely recommend this book. Although the first part was somewhat boring, it made you want to know what was going to happen to the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So a reader wrote me after the last book and said:  "I liked this book. I liked the characters and I liked that we had to see them change. I loved the world they came from. I did not like it that there were so many "sick" characters in the book. We had so many sick people that I hated them. One was a woman who was trying to cure a friend of a chronic disease. I hate seeing good people take advantage of people with mental illnesses. I thought this story was about how the bad people and their evil ways hurt and ruined so many lives. I really liked this character and the change she was forced to go through. The world building was very good. I would not have liked it if she wasn't given time to grow as a character. I wish they had had more people like that and made the changes they did to all the characters. So this book I did like but not as much as the last one. I don't think the world building will last.   This is a quick read so I have high hopes for future books.  4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "No need to go out and buy a second copy! The second copy is just a waste of time."   From: Jennifer D (Mt. Vernon, VA) (amateur book reviewer) "It is not a bad read, it is just not an interesting read."  From the review on bookwormbarbie.blogspot.com: "This book is a waste! It was a bit too much work for too little payoff, and there are so many boring parts of the book, and the book only goes so far in explaining something that is not necessary for the story. It was interesting to learn about how the people on a starship work but the story was not engaging. The aliens are pretty cool, but that is about it."  In a nutshell:  This is a good book, I just don't like it.  And I don't hate Star Trek: TNG.  I do however hate the TNG writers, particularly David Gerrold. He is a really lousy writer, and I hate him for it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a definite style in this book that I've noticed in some of his other works that I can't seem to get used to. The style is sort of awkward at times but it is also really engaging and I actually found myself feeling a sort of connection to him as a person as we spend the whole book trying to decipher the motives behind his actions. The story is fast-paced and there is a lot going on which I can understand since he is just trying to keep a secret about his identity. The ending is a bit disappointing because you do get a very big reveal which is kinda anticlimactic. I've read other stories with similar endings, some good and some bad. However this one is a big disappointment for me since I had such a hard time with him as an author and I think that is because I haven't read a lot of horror, I read a decent amount of mystery and I'm a sci-fi fan and his story is a pretty generic cyberpunk tale. I don't hate it, but I would probably never pick this up again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will try to be objective about this book but I'm going to be very, very unfair in my review. I have read a number of good books by the same author in the past and this one just didn't make me interested enough to read it again. The story is a bit of a mess but the characters are interesting. In addition, the characters were written with a real human feel and there was a nice feeling that they were living their lives and not trapped inside a book or on a screen. However, after reading this book I was completely bored of it. I found myself wishing I didn't bother with it and just went back to some other book by the author. If I did, I probably would have finished it before I started reading the new one, because this book took so much energy from me to start reading and that was not what I wanted.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book with great literary skills has great storytelling ability but a problem that plagues these books is they don't have a good plot. They try to pull things out of nowhere but with every book, it seems to happen in the same place again and again. They have the potential to be great novels but they always come down to "This is what the book is about" and nothing else. This is a book you could give to a friend just to say they read a book. It is a good short read that will have you wanting to get into more novels by these authors. If you have a chance to read this book, you will enjoy it!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * You might like the book even more after reading the above review, but I'm guessing it's more of a 'how the heck did I miss this'?   You might like this book even better after reading that review.   It is pretty much a re-hashing of the same old stuff; a bunch of people getting their heads stuck in a mud puddle, and someone finally getting up to the task and doing something with it, but it's not even a good idea.  (That's probably my biggest problem with it. I'm sure this book would have worked even better with a more original twist, but alas, it's the same story over and over again.)   As I was reading it, I thought, "Gee, maybe if I took another look at that guy who died and found out that he didn't, like, have a brain in his skull and was actually some sort of mutant or something...  I can't really think of a single other character who gets a chance to do anything important.  * It's like reading about a friend getting the flu and trying to run away to the hospital in a wheelchair but having the same stupidly painful and dangerous surgery over and again.  And then getting in a car and driving off and making a bunch more runs to the emergency room, but they don't save you, you get the flu, the doctor gives you more medication and the pain in your back grows worse and worse until your legs are bleeding and you have a seizure and you end up in the hospital.  In my opinion, it feels like a real-world sequel to a book called The Power of Habit (which is not a bad movie, mind you).  I have seen that movie, and the book is so poorly written it's hilarious!  * That being said, that isn't to say I wouldn't be interested in reading the sequel or whatever.  But I'd need a whole new review to write about it.  For a book that's about a guy who finds the solution to a plague (which apparently involves a big rock and a buncha people in fancy hats) and the people who think he's nuts, I can't even imagine why it made the list.  I had a hard time taking any of the characters seriously in the first place, so it's easy to see how they're so unemotional in this book.  This book wasn't terrible, but
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (Don't want to spoil the plot here, but if you don't want an emotional investment in the book, don't read it.) A great book, but a bit repetitive. The author wrote a great story, but unfortunately, the ending was the problem. Read this book. Read it soon. Or don't. It's up to you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending wasn't all that good - I liked the concept, but the writing wasn't very good - too much backstory, too little real characterization.   So I'm trying not to make too much of a fuss, but I just got over being disappointed in the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is my first experience with a book written by a man who claims to be a feminist, and I'm a bit appalled by it. While I can't tell you exactly what was wrong with this book and will have to wait for my next one to see, I can say that I would not recommend it to a girl that is a bit older than me. There is a lot of talking about how women are in a "gendered" state of ignorance or worse. Men can't even hold a conversation with a woman without the entire group being called sexist and sexist men. I couldn't help but laugh at the thought that women will be the ones that hold the power in society in the future.   I have heard more women bemoaning how they didn't get to experience all the wonderful "female privilege" in this book than men.   The "diversity" is a "diverse" group of women with many of them being in the business world, and the "diversification" is an entire group of men who are "dynamic" in nature. I wouldn't expect a male professor to know what "doubling" means, but the author apparently did not know or didn't care. Even more ridiculous is the statement that "a man's voice has a unique voice. A woman's voice often sounds like a man's. And that means that they're not necessarily 'equal'." The author then goes on to say that there is "a big difference between a man and a woman and how they use their voices" (which is a dumb idea since a woman is always going to use a man if she is a woman. Women have to choose who they associate with, and what they associate about.) There's no mention about how there are plenty of men and women who are really "distant" from the "mainstream" for a variety of reasons, like being a woman or having a different background or experience from men. We have been given the impression that these differences are so profound that they are irreconcilable with being human beings. And it is just so... so... wrong.     It was so hard to read this book! I have no idea what is wrong with me, but this book made me feel sick to my stomach.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book is a bad read.   It's very bad.  So, bad for the author and bad for everyone who has read the book.  If you have read the books that I reviewed I think you can make up your own mind.  Also, if you buy one of the books I reviewed, buy the others.  I think the book I reviewed was about 100 pages too long for the book it was about.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a very strong anti-drug message in this book and it's very hard to understand how it's an "anti-drug" book when you read it, because it is all about alcohol. You can't tell me that people who go over the top on drugs like meth and coke never fall in love, they never have sex, they don't want to quit the bad stuff, etc. The idea that drugs are bad is just crazy!  (This is not a spoiler to any of the other reviews. This book is the only review that I will post on this site since it is the best book I have read all year.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received the book via email in exchange for an honest review, which I have done. I had high hopes for this book when I first heard about it. I've always had a great respect for the work of Jack Vance and I've been very fortunate to have met him a few times. He's an old friend and has given me many a great read over the years.  This is no exception.  It's definitely a stand-out among the first volume of a trilogy I've purchased over the last few years. This book does not disappoint. It is, by far, my favorite of Vance's fantasy.     I'm in love with the story, the world, and the characters. I'm still not quite sure how a few of the characters got to where they are, but they certainly do in the end. This one is a fantastic entry in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was an interesting read. There were many parts that were interesting and I would recommend it to a friend. But, there were others that were dull and unenjoyable. I enjoyed reading it but it was also unenlightening. I think some readers have to be prepared for such a book. I would only say that the ending is disappointing. It does not help that the author makes several statements about how it is the perfect time to die and then, nothing happens.  5 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this series. I am a sucker for "gods" stories in literature, as well as fantasy. This was supposed to be a good "god's eye view" look at the world of the gods. But I was underwhelmed, and let my expectations run wild. There are some very good things about the series, as all gods are awesome. The series is set in the same universe as "The Book of the New Sun", by Robert Jordan, which I also read, as the books are very similar. However, I didn't like this series, especially after reading the first book. It seemed to lack anything that made "The Wheel of Time" series worth reading. In fact, there seemed to be an unnecessary amount of filler. The good stuff:   The world of T'laru is one I want to visit, as it is awesome. While "The Old Man's War" takes place in the real world, "The City of Mist" takes a look at a fictional setting. I like the concept that some of the creatures in "The Mist" actually have magical abilities. (One of these creatures is a "dragon.") The series starts out with a dragon named Chthon, who lives in a magical city called T'u-Lo-Wah, which is the city that is the setting for the series. T'Laru is a very small city, only roughly 20 square miles, and most of the people live in a village called Jalan.   The bad stuff:  The story seemed to start out on a cliffhanger:  In the first novel, the series starts off by giving a bit of backstory on Chthonis, the dragon who lives inside T'Tu-Lo. But that only seemed to confuse me a bit. At least a bit, until I read the next book. This is the third book in the series:   I wanted to know what happened to Chthoni. I had expected to get an idea of what happened in the books that are already out (which I did, as we get some information about Jalan and the other cities in the world). But "The Shadow" tells us very little about Chthonia (the name I just made up).   And then the story seems to fall apart:  There seems to be some disconnect between the events of the first two books and "The Way of Kings", which is set
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish that this book was longer - it was only 5 or 6 volumes, and I had to read them back to back and it was very difficult to figure out the order.   This is a very good fantasy series - it doesn't have any action (outside of the battles and some magic) and the story flows nicely, but it is too short.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book is really bad. It's filled with errors, typos, bad writing, grammar, etc. The characters are not particularly well-developed, either. They're basically just there to be "well-acted". The "fans" who seem to be taking this book so seriously will be surprised when it's over. There are only about three characters, none of them particularly interesting. The story is bad, bad, and, yes, just really bad, really. (As a note, if you don't like it, then you probably won't like any of the other books I've reviewed this week either, so you really ought to avoid this one, unless you really enjoy reading bad books. I think it's probably a decent "puzzle" book, for someone like me who just loves bad things, so I guess there's that.)   I didn't hate this book at all. It was fun, and I think I might like it. I really enjoyed the story, though I'm sure it'll be a bit of a struggle for many people to sit through. This book is not a bad read. It wasn't bad at all, though. It didn't make me want to vomit, and it wasn't the most riveting book in the world. But...well, I don't know. Maybe it's a lot like some of my other favorite books? Maybe? I'm still sort of on a reading slump. Maybe I'll find a good book next week, though...   A review is an opinion! You might disagree with it! I'm not saying you shouldn't read it, just that you might not enjoy it. What do you think of this book? Are you interested in reading it, or would you rather read a good one first?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "If this was the work of one of the great novelists of all time, it might have been so much more than the sum of its parts. It is not the great novels which endure; they live off each other. They grow together, like a human tree. And the author's personal history of depression, grief and loneliness could not have been more personal than this book."   "For me, it was a great, terrible book. It was a sad story, but it was written with great compassion and an utter understanding of what depression is like. It did not feel like a story, it felt like a journal of a life."  "I hated this book. I hated this man. And I hated myself for liking him. "   I do not think you could write anything like this book, even if you wanted to; it is too personal, and it is difficult to write without the pain that goes with it. The author could not understand the things that made me laugh; she could not empathize with the things she loved; and she could hardly describe the things I was terrified to think about.    When we hear of someone who has been suicidal, we usually think of the person who committed suicide. It may sound cruel to say so, but that person is the exception to the rule. Almost every person who has lost a loved one to suicide has had a suicidal incident in their life; almost everyone has felt suicidal once or twice in their lives. The experience that we have of being suicidal is a direct response to the suicide of a loved and important person, someone who we truly love and who, to the end, we would do anything to be able to see again.  I am trying to remember a time when I felt so angry, so afraid and so helpless when I thought of my sister, but I think it was during the days after we had gone to the movies and she'd fallen asleep in the recliner, right after I'd finished watching.  It was about the time that her mother and I went to the cinema together. I remember sitting in the theater with my sister and thinking about how much I would hate myself if I couldn't see her again. It still made me angry, and I felt terrified that I would never get to see her. I felt helpless to do anything. I would try to call her, but the phone lines were jammed, and the wait for the next available answering machine would
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If there are any problems with the book, it's that the book is very easy to get distracted and get lost in.   The book is a collection of vignettes that each have a very strong personality that makes each section unique but you get distracted by what the vignette tells you. The story is very long but it is told in a very simple fashion.  It's kind of like reading a book from the first chapter that is just telling you what happens to people and nothing else.  The author gives the book a lot of fluff to it but it can get annoying after a while.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review:  The author is not well-known but he's a good writer. The book is about a man who is very sad. The author tells him what the world has lost and how he has lost everything. The man tries to find meaning in life, which was not his life goal. One day he comes across a book that reminds him of a past event. The ending of this story was very good. I also liked how the man gets out of his depression after the book and continues with his life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I will start by saying, it was a little on the slow side for me. It seemed to be trying to be a classic from the 80s, but it just wasn't. I can see why this book was so popular for it's style, but at the same time it's not something I could read for an entire weekend. If I am in the mood for something old, I'll do a google search for something like "Coraline" or "The Witches of Eastwick". I won't be picking this up again though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really like this one, but     I wish it was a little bit more fun for me.   The main character,   Michael   Gantt,  is pretty much useless.  He's a professional photographer with a bit of a chip on his shoulder. His sister is pretty much a bimbo.  When Michael  and his brother  go out on a mission,  they are captured by a group of bandits ( a little ridiculous but  they do   get by, I'll give them that ).  But even worse, they get killed and taken prisoner.  This  finally sets Michael    off to do the most evil thing you can imagine,  kill the bandits,  and take their loot.  The first time I read this, I thought this was just the main character doing the "wrong" thing but after reading this book I was surprised to find how evil it was.  Michael's behavior towards the bandits  was a lot less noble and  cruel than I thought,  but he did it.  And it was justified. The plot was good,  it just took a little too long to get to the end.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is an awful book and it is written by a terrible author. The book has nothing good to say about it. I can't say that there is anything bad about this book. I have heard good things about this author but I am not sure if she really knows what she is writing. I was hoping for a book about the Vietnam War but there was not much good to be said. I would suggest this book for those interested in the Vietnam war but this book does not tell the whole story. I just got my copy of the paperback but I don't see why someone would be buying this book over the hardcover. There was nothing in this book that was enlightening to me.   I felt that this book was very poorly written, which is very disappointing when the author is obviously a good writer. If I had more time I would like to read this book because I have only just gotten to know the author but for the time I have read this it was just terrible.  I have already read all the other books in this series that were written by this author. I did not enjoy reading these books because of the author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     I've had this book for a couple of months, and then it had to be read in public. The prose is not quite good enough to sustain interest.

This is a book I'm not sure I'll pick up again in the future but it's a nice read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was just a book.   There were times when I wanted to put it down and I had to force myself to finish it because the stories were too sad.  It had some funny parts as well, but they were a bit off base.  My husband did not like it.  But he is an older man, so I guess he thought it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was excellent, but I was disappointed that the author had such little experience as a writer. She had never published a work before, but as the story progressed, she tried to incorporate the plot of her previous short story, which was the best work of fiction she had written, and instead of integrating the narrative into a whole, she created a story that was too complicated to read, and left me frustrated.   I gave this one two stars because of the story, not the author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, a book about a "fictional" character, for a class assignment. I thought it was a fantastic way to explore the idea of fictionalization and the process by which people come to believe something to be true, and the book itself was excellent. However, the way I was taught the "fictions" of this story made me feel that the author was giving away secrets of the "real world" and/or the nature of reality. I would not want to be taught that there is a "real" "furry", or that this is a true story of a "true" character's life. I found it strange that this was written as a fictionalized account by a fictional character, and that the story was being "told" to my class by a fictitious character as if it were happening in reality. Also, it's not like the book is even all that interesting. The author makes a great deal of fuss over how the author's character, "Tara", is portrayed, especially in this section about her childhood, but the plot makes no sense unless you think the author is a genius. The whole book is about her coming to realize her inner self and the various problems her life is going to have to face because of her "inner self". But in the book, she is portrayed as a really good person (which I've never heard her described as) and there is nothing really interesting about her life at the time. If you are an expert on furry and have read a lot of furry fiction, this would be a great book for you. However if you are looking for a good book on a "non-furry" that is not about the nature and history of furry, this is the wrong book for your library.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book very slow, slow to start, slow going, and very difficult to read. The author does an amazing job at describing the characters' life experiences. I thought the author was brilliant in his portrayal of life. For a book that is all about family and family history, the main character's family history is a bit unbelievable. This book was the reason why I did not like reading it and left feeling very disappointed.   Summary: This is a very well written novel. I really like how the author has created a unique world, and I really liked the details about the family and their background. This novel was very interesting and challenging.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that I really, really enjoyed reading but found to be very hard to get through. This is just an excuse to say that the story is good, but the pacing is just horrible. It started out great, but I was very disheartened by halfway through and that was before I had any trouble with the dialogue, as I'd never read it before. Overall, it's a good read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first book on a subject I don't really know very much about, but it is not a book for a person who is not familiar with the topic. It is more of a general introduction to the topic of writing. It's not bad per say, but I felt that it was not particularly helpful.   I think it was an idea that would have been better on a separate site, but is a good read for people that are interested in it.  The book will definitely be of help to many, if you are not too good at maths.   ...Read full review  Verified purchase: No
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favourite author. This book is too long and is a bit of a slog at times. If you are interested in fantasy then give it a go but I think the last 50% is a very poor representation of his skill. There are good parts, but most of the book is very hard to follow.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    For me, this is a pretty typical and tired fantasy novel. The world is pretty awesome in the sense that it's a fairly realistic and vivid one (a very common thing in fantasy, I'd say), and the characters are well done as well. Unfortunately, that realism just got in the way of the plot. It seemed a bit contrived to me (and I didn't like most of it either), and that's because the world and the magic of it seemed more realistic to me, than to the main characters. The characters were a bit off, especially the female protagonist (and her relationship with a male protagonist, the two of them, actually), and even the action scenes were a little bland, too; I found myself not being too excited by the adventure, and the romance was a little uninspired (even though I found it believable, as it was very romanticized and had a nice heart-to-heart). I was a bit disappointed in the ending, but overall, this was still a decent book for fantasy and/or science fiction fans.   Recommended for fans of: space opera, fantasy, military, sci-fi, and romance, with a pretty believable world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My friend and I have had a lot of fun reading this book. I got to see the good side of this book, too. Unfortunately, there's a lot to dislike about it. Like most books, you get what you pay for. I would definitely suggest that you do some research before reading this one, though, because the information could be found elsewhere (I went to the library). This is also the first book in a trilogy that I am not sure I will like at all. I found this book to be a bit too long. I enjoyed it but not enough to read through it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favorite book.   However, the story is too slow and doesn't move much.  I could have done with more action. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I opened the first book I read, I thought it was amazing. I thought so because, well, I love all things Harry Potter, so of course I loved this one. My husband was so excited when he saw it. Then the second book came and, well. My book club was not happy. So much for the hype I had heard.   I can't get over the fact that all the characters die.  If you like the books (or like any type of fan) you will hate this. I've already finished this book but I don't even want to finish it yet because of the death of the characters. You will hate your life when you finish this book.     What's so sad is that some people thought this would be a good idea because it's a girl and that's why she gets killed. I'm pretty sure the author just wanted to be more like Harry Potter. And she was. I guess that's what I am to Harry Potter because she has been killed and then gets reborn as a boy. I just hate all of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:        I've always loved The Lord of the Rings, so to be asked to review it again seemed like a no-brainer.   However, I had a bad experience with it, and am giving it a two instead of a five.  It is definitely not the greatest book ever, nor the worst.  But I just didn't feel the author was in love with the world the way Tolkien was, and the book was boring and repetitive. I found the pacing to be off, and while the story itself was good, the plot didn't flow as it should have, and it got boring.  There's nothing wrong with the book that you can't find in the Lord of The Rings or the Hobbit, but I found it boring and disappointing. I'd like to give it four or five stars, but there are plenty of good books I haven't read yet.  I was asked to write a review of the first book, "The Sword of Shannara" by Terry Brooks (or Terry Brooks, if you are an Amazonian, like me).  I have read two other Brooks books, "Lord of the Flies" and "The Hobbit", so I knew what to expect.  The first thing that hit me was how big the story was.  By that I mean the entire world is in the story, there is no time limit, but it is not nearly as big as the Lord Of The Rings.  This was very exciting for me, because I don't love Lord Of the Rings and I wanted to see where Terry Brooks took things.  In fact, I found The Sword of Shannara to be just as, if not more, exciting.   In "The Lord of The Flies", there is a great deal of time between the first person point of view and the next.  I found that lacking in The Sword Of Shannaran.  At the beginning of the book the POV is changed to a young boy, the main character, who is a teenager, and at this point we have already established a lot of character.   After a little while there is an interlude where we switch the POV back to our protagonist who is now an adult.  And this is where I found some problems with the story.  First, I felt that there was a lack of consistency with the time and place of the events, especially the time of day it happened, which were often off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book with interest because I am looking forward to reading the next one and it looks like a solid continuation of the story that was given a strong start with A Wizard of Earthsea. Unfortunately this was not the case at all. The story and characters were a little lacking, but the story itself was just plain boring. The whole idea was to set up the next book with the last book's ending as the point of conclusion and to then use the knowledge gained from the last two books to help the characters in the second book. The first book was mostly set up and the ending did not seem to make much sense with what happened in the last one and all the plot points that were not touched on really seemed to go nowhere. I felt a little cheated because they gave this story and the characters a good start in the beginning and then they left the story behind for almost half of the book, leaving the reader to fill in the gaps with his or her own imagination. I feel like this is an example of a story not being worth it because it does not have a good beginning and it just goes on forever without getting to the point where the story could have been finished. I am only giving this a 2 because I would rather go into another book to enjoy it and the author could have easily done this if they had given the first book a little more attention because that story was very fun to read and I am glad they finished it the way they did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read many books by Mr. Gaiman, but this one was the worst.   It was too long, too confusing, and way too much detail.  I would not read the book again.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You can tell it's a really good book, but the plot and setting are so generic that it becomes more of a novel than a non-fiction book.   It also reads like a teenager trying to get a book published.   Read a negative reviews:    You can get an idea about how well a book is selling from negative reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "A horrible book. It was a terrible experience."   "I read the book in the summer and the last day I wanted to read and did not."  The only reason the book isn't a five star is because it's only 2.25 stars.   What made this book so great for me, is the fact that I am a big fan of the Star Trek universe, and the fact the author did a great job in creating this alien language. Also, the author does a good job at making the characters more realistic, and believable. I would love to see more of her writing in future books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book, but that's not to say it's a bad novel by anybody.   I liked it when it was published.  I loved the way it was narrated.  It was well written and I enjoyed it.  The problem is that in the years since then it's been out of print.  If you like this type of book - which I do - then you should consider reading it and maybe giving it another shot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In The Magician's Nephew : A Family Portrait, we read about a magic show of some sort where the host gives a talk to his children and how he is the "grand magician" and his children are the "little magician." We also got to see a scene where the children's "Grand Magician" showed how he makes magic out of the things that happen to him every day.  When my husband and I were little we used to use a glass bottle to make a glass ball out of ice and then roll it around a table or wall as we played. This story got me thinking about the power of the little things that you have around you to do magic.   How would you do magic if you did not have an assistant to work with? How would a little old man who could barely make a few tricks for us manage to make the tricks work for the kids that were sitting right next to him?   When I was younger I used to go to "Little Magic Shows" and I remember seeing these little magic tricks on display. The shows were always pretty good and I always thought the audience would have a great time.  The magician used these tricks to make tricks work. He would get the little kids to follow what he was doing by showing the trick to them before doing it.  A magician's assistant can also be one of the most valuable members of a magic team. If your magic assistant is a good performer or just a good kid, they can be one thing or another. For example a good assistant can show that you can do a trick with a small object. He can also take a trick that a magician is not great at and help out with it.   How to be the Magician (2nd edition) by John James Ramey   I'm a magician but have only done a couple of shows.  One of the few that I have done was this.  It is not the most complicated magic trick but it works very well.  My assistant and I worked pretty hard on this. I used a tiny glass bottle with one of those tiny holes in it. My assistant had a tiny piece of wire from his pocket and he was supposed to stick it into the hole to make it big enough to pour a little wine into, to show me how small this little glass bottle could get.   This is the trick we did and it is pretty hard to do. It works because the bottle is small enough to make wine
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really do hope that this book will get better. It's a well written and well written, but really I had no clue as to how this book would go and was hoping for the best.   And it did not, in my opinion.  It is really frustrating when a book has been written, and it can't stand on its own two feet. This book was the epitome of what I expect a book of this genre to be, and I wanted to love it. I was hoping to see the story go away and start over, but alas, it is not to be.  What was this book really about?   My main issue with the book is this:  While the main character is an "average" guy, I don't think he's really "average". I don the guy to be the exact opposite of his parents, and as you would expect from a young boy, he has a temper which he doesn't understand or can't control. And this is only one aspect of his personality and character.  He is the "typical" "everyman".  So that is the first thing I would like to clarify on. Yes, this book is supposed to be about "everymans" life. Yes there is going to be a "typel," but I do believe that the writer didn't have a "stylized" "real-life" background in mind.  I think it's important for a writer to have a background which you can relate to, so I think this book could've done with a bit of inspiration to add to the story.  It would be a really great book if the author could have had a bit more of a background in real life in order to relate to the character a bit better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been looking for an awesome, fun, easy to read book, like a classic from when I was a kid. I am very disappointed. It is not a fun read. It really is a bore. I have read the sequel, and am also disappointed. This is not one of those things that you read to pass the time. Not a good choice for a first book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I like this book a lot, but the story is slow-going and I was expecting the whole book to be much more entertaining. I wish the characters had developed a little more.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a pretty good book. It was written by a woman who, being a woman, had to face the sexism in the world. She had to do all of this because, if she had been male, she would have been able to avoid the sexism. The women in the book are portrayed as the strong women, and the men are weak, not good in any way. Even the male characters are weak. This book is about a man and a woman working through a challenging situation. If they had been a man or a woman with a disability, the book would have done a much better job.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to read a book about magic. I'm not particularly well-versed in magic but was excited about this one.   One of my biggest fears is writing a bad review.  I'm glad I gave this a pass. The book does take a lot of the ideas and concepts of old-school magic and adds new stuff. There is a lot more of the old-fashioned magic that I have read and enjoyed before.  However, this is still not my cup of tea and not as well-researched as other books in the genre.  The first half of the book is the usual stuff I have come to know and love.  It's great to find old-style magic and get to know the world and characters.  Also, it's a pleasure to see the world presented as it should be (an interesting twist on the fantasy formula).  The magic is done in a way that seems like it would not work well in a mainstream publication.  Although it's not a new book (it was published in 1995), it's good to have it in the collection.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * * *  * -1/2 stars    If you have a problem with a book or a story or you feel it doesn't do enough to support a premise or character then maybe you should write a review instead of just complaining about the book. If you think there's something wrong with it then feel free to disagree with that. But it's not like I'll be posting a 5 star review for every book but it is a little hypocritical to just go on about a book's faults because I have to. This review is not an attempt to bash this book or even review a book that I love but just something I can use to remind myself to go read a book and not have it get me down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I read The Man in the High Castle as an introduction to the new 'Americana' genre - a collection of science fiction and fantasy, from the last few years that have been influenced by the cultural revival in Japan and the American Cold War films, with its emphasis on 'the Man in High Castle', as a symbol of American empire in the twentieth century. While this is true in the novel itself - it certainly does focus on the USA - the idea of a dystopian America, at least as the US sees it, is not present. The Japanese, after all, have only recently been defeated by the US, who had them occupied for many years, and the book is not as well-written, and lacks the depth, humor and humanity that makes the Japanese 'we' in the book. "     "I am a bit surprised to see this book at #7 on the list of 'The Best Fiction' of 2005 and think that it is not just a case of good vs. great - there are plenty of good stories here. However, it would be a mistake to think that this is merely a case where the Japanese culture is a stand-in for the American culture. There are moments, however, when the author has a somewhat skewed view of Japanese culture (in some cases, completely without justification), and the lack of depth makes reading this book more of a bore than it should be. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started the book expecting a good book, but when I got to the last page, my mind was blown. I didn't like the premise. I don't like most of the characters, and the "realistic" and "honest" story made me question my own ability to write believable fiction. I would have recommended the book, had it been at a better price point, but at a very high price, it's more likely to be considered a waste of time than an enjoyable read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a well written story that has a story to tell. However, the story is not very interesting. The main character, "The Black" is a very annoying person with a history of being an evil and unsympathetic character. This is really not a good idea for a story and the plot is not that interesting. However the ending is very good. Also, "the Black" was very well done and had a very interesting look at the world of witchcraft and the power that the human beings have over witches.   All in all, not a bad read, but definitely not a novel you should be reading   [This review was written after the first edition came out but I found this version even better than the original edition. The writing was clearer, the plot was tighter and the ending was more satisfying]
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read, not even the worst book in a series. This book was a joke and I was very disappointed. You should be ashamed of yourself for writing this. If you like the series you'll probably like this book too.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One of the best books I've ever read (aside from my own The Black Witch ). I've been hooked on this series ever since I read the first book back in '98. The world of The Chronicles of Amber is fascinating and full of life and mystery. The characters are great - even the minor ones. The story flows from one set of adventures to another with aplomb, making me want to see the next volume. It's always a great surprise when a book I have read several times (or many re-reads) does something new. I'm a book fan, but even though I know the characters I still find the writing irresistible - even if I know what's coming. The narrator's performance is flawless. The prose is always elegant and sophisticated - not a clunker in sight. The book is easy to read and even though it's very long (in terms of characters and setting) it's not a boring read. I think the book would be even better if it was shortened and had less world building, but it really is quite a marvel of writing that I wish I could see expanded upon and finished sooner rather than later. In the end, this book was just wonderful. I highly recommend it to anyone, but especially to fans of fantasy - especially The Chronicles.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband and I were planning on reading "Climbing Mount Everest" by Michael J. Pollan. The book is a good introduction to the history and science of growing food and farming. There were several things I liked about the book: - The fact that there are not many mentions of any one person.  The author does not have to mention any one specific person to make her point.   - The book shows an attitude that says one of the greatest evils of the modern age is the lack of cooperation among people.  The author even says that she can see people working together, "just not too well."  It seems that there may be no one more opposed to cooperation than Pollan is.  - She suggests that we have a problem with narcissism, not because people are too selfish, but because we are so selfish.  She also suggests that narcissism has become a problem of our times because our culture has become so narcissistic. - The author suggests that modern industrialization is the main cause of the decline of civilization, the problem being that we are growing so much faster than nature, which should be the cause of our decline, but the opposite is occurring.  If nature were to run at the speed that we do, there wouldn't be so much to grow or harvest.  Pollan also talks about how people are getting too comfortable.  He says that there is something wrong with modern society because it has created too much comfort for people. Poll a t's also a little more radical than I was expecting.  It's probably not very popular, but it makes some interesting points, and shows that humans can be cooperative and that we can become self sufficient.  I do not recommend this book for a family, because the book does make some rather radical claims about the role of agriculture. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      This book was very good for a very low price. I would say this is a great book for a first book in a series. The author did a great job with the writing, giving the reader enough information so that he/she can make up his own mind. This is not a fantasy novel, so the story will be different from other books in the series, but it is still fun. The main character is a young man named Sam, and he is a half-blood. I have read all of the other books, but have yet to read this one.  I have also read the first two books in The Shadow Campaigns series. I can not wait to read the third book, The Prince of Thorns.  to be added  This is not my favorite book. Not by a long shot. But I like to read fantasy books so I am reading this book and the other ones to get a feel for what the series has to offer, and also because I am in need of a book that will hold my interest for a while. And I must say, despite the book being rated as a horror novel, it actually isn't very scary. It is very tense at times. I found it interesting though, because I'm not a fan of that genre.   One thing I should say, is that the story, although I do like the idea of the story that the author is setting up, I'm still a bit disappointed that he decided to end the book with what I considered to be the final battle. I really thought that there were more stories to tell, not only about the war but also about the beginning of the war, because the beginning really felt very slow and very in-depth. So even though this book is not good, it is not the worst book in the world.   a new book:  The Prince of Shards and the Night's Blade by Anne Rice, I have not read but the first book, so I will start reading that one now, but I will have to wait a little while.     4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know if this will be a big hit or a flop, but the novel, although it sounds like it is about a young man trying to be a hero and overcoming his demons, is actually a really sad book. The main character has a lot of potential, but he is so much of a weakling that I am not sure he is the hero we were looking for. I didn't see the movie, but if anyone knows about the book they could send me a copy of the sequel to this book so I can see the similarities and differences in the plot. The book was also over long, and the character development took up way too much of the novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    * This review is about a book I had never heard of or read, so I cannot speak to its quality. I also cannot speak for any other book on this list, since I have not read any reviews on this book in the last ten years. I will add that there are some good things here; and also that it seems that when some authors try to break away from their traditional format in such a way that their work comes across as less traditional, there are also a lot of things that do not really come together, as though the author was trying to do too much, including, I think, a certain amount of self-indulgence. And that is my only complaint about this book: it is over-produced; it is the product of too much research and too little story-telling.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A review in the New York Times (by the writer of the book I bought) said that it is a very good book, but that the author's view on science is an example of "science denial." I'm not sure whether the reviewer is right or wrong about that. The review's only reference to science denial is that it means the book does not "encourage a skepticism about the scientific evidence of human evolution." If that's the way the reviewer understands it, then I don't understand it either. If the reviewer doesn't understand that the title is not a positive review of evolution, and is criticizing a book because it doesn't say what the reviewer wants it to say, that's another matter. I bought the book as a result of an enthusiastic recommendation in a book store. (I have also used a number of other resources to read the book.) As a scientist, I think my understanding of evolution as a whole is fairly informed, though it certainly does not provide a final verdict on the evidence. And as a critic, I donot think that reading the book would be worthwhile. On the basis of reading several reviews of it, I've heard people say that it's a "great" book, that it provides "tangible arguments" (they usually say "scientific" reasons) for why evolution is true (not a word about evidence), and that the book is "easy to read and read well." My opinion of this book is that I'd rather have an excellent science-based book than a good book about a controversial and politicized scientific topic (see my comments at http://scitimes.com/evolutionary-viewpoint-book-a-matt-hume/). I think it's bad that the publisher has issued a statement on the book, saying: "Our view of science, informed by the vast body of science that is now available, supports the view that there is no scientific dispute on the central questions raised in the book: whether life arose via natural processes or by intelligent design, and whether we are the product of the evolutionary process." It is certainly true that there are people who don't accept evolution or the evidence for it, who say that "no one is an expert on how evolution happened," and so they can't tell if evolution happened or not. But on the other hand, the people who say "no, I'm an expert" are almost all "creationists," which is a much stronger position than
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy this book, though my son had a good time. The ending was predictable and kind of lame (the woman gets "taken down a peg" by the man, so to speak, but then the man "wins" anyway), and the writing was a bit clunky and repetitive.   (I should probably mention here that this was the only book I read in the last 3 years of my life that didn't give me any particular pleasure.)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You should read this book first and then you can comment about it. This is a well written book but has some serious flaws that make it hard to believe that it was so well researched.   I don't know how you can make a book that takes place in the 1700s about a 17 year old, but there it is.  Also, a lot of the stuff in this book, which is mostly about slavery, is a lot more interesting than the main story that is about the 1700's.  "It will be remembered as the year that a woman became a master of the English language" I am giving this book 2 stars, because it is entertaining and has a good amount of historical facts. I have read many books and documentaries and this book is the only one I would recommend. However, if you want a real historical book (which most books are in this genre), pick up something else, because this one just doesn't have the historical accuracy.    For more books like this, check out my book collection or follow me on Facebook or Twitter for updates.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "I just finished reading this book. A very nice read and a very very entertaining read. I think I enjoyed it a lot more than the book is likely to show. It is like one of those 'one man shows' that are all about an experience, but the author just went out and did what he needed to do in a good manner. The book was great and I definitely recommend reading it if you have the time and desire to go out and check this book out. It would be a great choice for a book club." Read More Reviews...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed the book but it took me awhile to get around to it. The story itself is very nice but the writing was a little slow and not as crisp as I'd hoped. It's a story about an old man who loses his wife and his best friend to an accident and is struggling with the grief. The character development is very nicely done. The pacing of the book was okay. Overall, not the best of reads. But I will definitely re-read the series once the first book in the series is out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For this book, it would be a 4 or 5.    A very good idea to get a few other folks with similar interests to go and read some books together and not only would the group have a better understanding of each others interests, but there may also be some fun to be had.  The main characters were good.  They weren't quite likeable, but they were a little likeable.  It didn't stop me from reading though.  My biggest complaint was how slow things went, I think the book was really only about 30% over.  I think this is a very good way to spend an hour or so reading and a little extra entertainment would make for a better evening.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this one. I have been looking for a good adventure novel to read for a long time now. In my opinion, it's the best. I had a very hard time getting into the story, but once I was, I knew I couldn't put this book down. From the beginning, the pacing and writing was on point. The characters were interesting and I felt a little sorry for them. The story had some great twists and turns and kept me guessing. I really hope this one has an ending.    5 out of 5 stars The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly I like a good "evil" villain. This is one. It's a good book, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have some faults. There are several things that were really annoying: a couple of characters who were completely useless. I know that's the point, but the author said that this was the point of the book, so why not make the point clearer. (view spoiler). Also, the book was full of clichés: there was a princess who was just there to be rescued. There were the bad guys who had no motive or reason for their actions. (One of the main characters is a thief and his father is a bad guy who makes everyone in the family a thief. This character's father is also a badguy who makes his son a thief, who has to steal from his mother to support his family. Another major character is the princess's father. I don't know what is the purpose of this character. And, last, there was the whole problem with the plot. There was some good things, but there was also a whole lot of nothing. A story should be able to stand on its own, and this one really needed a better ending. If you don't mind the clichés, then this will be a good read. But for me, I wanted more, a lot more. I'm sure it'll be a favorite of many. I do recommend this to anyone who's interested in the old-school adventure/crime/western genre.  4 out of 4 stars The UGLY Book It's true that some of the stories in this book have a touch of the "Ugly". I do have to admit though that this book has been one of my favorites for quite some time now (especially since it was re-published several years ago).   However, if you haven
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be just an embarrassment of riches with some very good characters. The only real downside that this book has is that the writing is so terrible that it actually does make you want to rip the book open and give it to my kids as a present. I'm also disappointed with how fast the author went through her plot and didn't seem to have a clue about what she was doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    [1] It was written in 1872. [2] It makes me think of a really good time: the 1890s were the era of Romanticism, but it would be hard to imagine a romanticized version of the 1880s without the Beats, and this book is a lot of fun if you're not interested in that whole period. [3] The book has a great deal of "insight" for its age, which I suppose could be called a "weird" thing in today's world. [4] The author was an important figure in the 1890's and 1920's. He became known for his "experimental" novels, with their strange subject matter (an abandoned house; a house where the walls have been painted over; a man who doesn't want to change his name).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's just not that good a book.   I think a lot of people were just hoping for a good tale of life, but it's just a sad story.  I don't know how I'm supposed to feel when I read this.  Rating: 2.25 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never read a book so quickly and so poorly written. Not only is this book full of errors but it is a complete waste of the authors time as well. The book begins with an introduction of the book and a short synopsis. What follows is a story of a man, who, is trying to save a woman that he is in love with, who is trying, to have a baby. There is an argument with his girlfriend and the mother of his child. This woman also has two other children. She tells her lover to be quiet and goes to get her purse. She arrives home to find her purse missing, she goes back and it is gone. When she goes to look for it again, she finds that her purse is gone as well, she is then confronted by a woman she has a child with and her child is missing. When this woman sees the husband of the woman who had the purse, she tries to get away from him but he is stronger than she is, and hits her in the face. The husband is arrested. The other woman in the book is trying not to tell her husband that she knows where their children are. She goes to her boyfriend and tells him that she is leaving him and her children. The boyfriend tells her that he wants to marry her but if she doesn't, he will marry her child. The couple goes to the hospital to find out that the baby is in the hospital. When they get to the child's bed, they discover that the child has no hair on his body. They discover that they are not his parents. The parents never gave their consent for his conception. It is a long book, it is about 40 pages long. There are no real stories. The characters that we meet are just cardboard cutouts of what they should be. There isn't a hint of anything to make you interested in reading this book. It has very little to recommend it. It was a bad read and didn't deserve any of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book deserves a good review.   In this book, I am in love with a character. And in her love, I become part of a much greater story. That story starts in the summer of 2010, with an unexpected meeting with her favorite character.  The book tells the story of Anna, a young girl whose life has been shattered by a series of unexpected events. She has come to believe that Anna, the only friend who has come into contact with her during her hospitalization, is the mysterious girl from the hospital. But the truth is that she is not Anna, or any other character in the book. And she is in need of help.  She meets, and falls in love, with Anna, Anna's twin sister, who is in the world for more than two years.  And then she falls in a coma, and wakes up in the hospital one year later.  What happens to her?   Her family has always wanted her to be a medical doctor, because, as her sister puts it, she has "always been a doctor."  She doesn't think she should have to give up on that dream, but she knows the time may be up.  Anna wants to make sure that her sister doesn't suffer alone, so she comes up with the idea to build a memorial to her sister in the form of a "stainless steel" bridge.  Once Anna has the plan to get her sister home to her, she is on her way to get the necessary materials. But, she discovers there is a secret behind the mysterious bridge, and that makes it very difficult to build. It may be a bit of a stretch to claim that the plot is very compelling, but, if you are an avid reader and like a good mystery, this book should do the trick for you.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     I bought this book because I'm really looking forward to the new series by Patrick Rothfuss that's supposed to follow this one and it's been out for a week now. But I've been disappointed by all the characters that are in this book and their relationship. My main issues are the following: 1.The way that the main characters are depicted. The world is portrayed as a very bleak one where most people die horrible deaths at the hands of demons and monsters. The main character goes to the world of Valerian and discovers the whole world is like this. I don't think it's a really believable world since that seems to fit the theme very well. But he goes there and his view changes as well as some of the creatures. I mean he meets a really weird race and encounters other people who are evil and they are all demon-like creatures. The whole story seems like a poorly written fantasy book. 2. The characters seem to exist only for the sake of creating more angst or the need to kill the main character. No development at all. 3.The story is about a woman named Valeria who has a problem with how she's being treated by others. She's supposed ot go with a man and learn more about herself. The problem is, he wants her to go with him because of some curse on him. There's no way she can let him go because of something like that. It's a very odd relationship to follow. 4.I don't like how much time passes. It feels like all these different events happen in one day and that's it. The first part of the book was actually really good but the rest of the story just makes me want to throw the book into the trash. I feel like I just kept reading and it was about to reach a big climax or it was getting really good and the last 5% of the reading was terrible. The story seemed like it was building towards a big conflict but it ended up being a boring story about a main character who gets more and more depressed every day and is about to die. If you like the first book, I'm sure you'll be fine but I'm disappointed by it. It really doesn't do anything new to the genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, but I felt it was a bit too long.    The premise of the book is that people who do terrible things don't do those things because they're evil.   Instead, they're victims and so they just do them to avoid feeling miserable.    In my opinion, that's the worst explanation you can have for doing terrible things.  But still, I loved this premise, and it made for a fun read.  What didn't work:  There's a lot of reading involved, and the book was pretty dense.  I found myself having to stop several times to catch my breath after one of the characters' awful deeds.  My one complaint is that the writing itself is pretty awful.  It's very dry and uninspiring.  The character of Tom is a great character.  He's got a great set of quirks and I love how well-rounded he is, but for a book that's just going to be about him, he has a tendency to be a little dry.  That said, I didn't mind too much.   Overall, this book is definitely worth a read, especially if you're into a kind of twisted version of Harry Potter, or if you like to hate on people in general.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book did nothing for me other than annoy me, I got no enjoyment out of it. I tried so hard to find something that I thought was interesting that this book just annoyed me.   I found myself annoyed by the lack of depth, the plot not developing properly, the author's writing style being way too simplistic, the characters not being fleshed out and the way he wrote the story just irritated me. This book really is only about the first person POV of the protagonist, he's the only one who learns about the family that lives in the house before she arrives at the end of the book. The plot in the book just dragged on and on, with some great moments but nothing great.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    *    Review the first book in the series (and then get a discount for this one)   I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about this one. I've never read anything by John Scalzi and, to be frank, didn't particularly care for it. However, after reading this, I think it's a very good novel. It's not a masterpiece but it's pretty darn good. The idea behind the plot is solid, and there's some interesting themes here. I'm actually not a fan of the book's first installment, but that's pretty easy to forgive. The rest of the series is very good (and very funny) and I look forward to seeing more. 4.5 stars.   Reviews: Amazon | Barnes & Noble | Smashwords  The sequel is pretty good, though the main characters still suck (no pun intended) 4.0 stars. It can't be too much worse than the first but that was still a great read. 4 stars.  " It is in the end we are all lost."  ― Douglas Adams This is it folks, the final installment in this book series. I really hope you're all enjoying these books. I hope you like these characters as much as I did. I have a couple more chapters written, so I'll see what happens. Until then, thank you for taking the time to read these books and thanks to all the reviewers who gave it a fair shake.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (this is not a novel, but a collection of short stories) is the perfect example of a poorly written story. The stories were all told by the narrator, which is interesting but the writer's voice was hard to understand and it didn't help that it was constantly changing. I was a bit confused at times when it didn the same person who started the story in the middle of a story and the ending of another story. Then the story just wasn't interesting for me either, but this is my first experience reading short stories. I guess my issues are more with the story and what I didn't like than the story itself. It's not something I'd be likely to recommend.    The Story is:  I found the writing to be very uneven. I mean, in the beginning it seemed well written. It seemed to flow really well but as time went by and the story progressed, it became more and more difficult to understand what was happening. By the end, the story became a mess. The story is just plain dull. The characters are very uninteresting and the plot was almost nonexistent. There is no real plot. This book is a bit hard to get through.   Rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not bad, but it's also not great.   The first section is about the protagonist's attempts to kill himself.  After he does it, the story then jumps to the next scene where he's living with a psychiatrist who is "sending [him] on this sort of ride."   I was expecting more than just a ride.  The next section is also about a man who is struggling with his sex life.  This is followed by a section where the main character has a sex slave.  It seems like a fun little diversion, but really it's just another way of getting the story on the road.  The story then continues to tell the tale of the protagonist, but this time he's moving to the big city.  There are some good scenes in this section, but when you think about it, it's a bit sad.  A bit.  Finally, the last section is a bit of a detour, but in a good way.  As long as you don't expect anything more than a ride, you should be able to get by this one.  (hide spoiler) [the main character's mother has a mental breakdown when her husband dies.  She is institutionalized, and spends her time on a beach surrounded by pictures of her dead husband and her dead kids.  When the story jumps to her trying to kill herself, you are disappointed, but not really surprised.  You probably felt this way about the first half of the book too.  But that's just because I expected more.  I just thought I should know better.  So you can't write a negative reviewer about a terrible book:    I'm going to say that this book is not great, but at the same time, it is not bad.  For the most part, it delivers on its promises.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, there are some scenes that are a bit disappointing.  And that's my fault.  My first reaction was that I wanted more than what this book gave me.  However, I'm getting into books that I don't normally read.  While I expected the first book in the series to be good, I was hoping that the second book would be more of the same.  That may have been a little much. But, like I said, this was my first time reading an author from the U.S. So, it wasn't my first book by
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a really good book. I was disappointed in it however, as I thought it would be even more interesting. The main character is an introvert (which he was) and he falls in love with someone who is a "social butterfly" who is also a high-functioning introvert. That was fine, but I wanted him to fall in love not because he is introvert but because he doesn't know how to communicate (not only with other people but with himself). He doesn't have a girlfriend until late in the book, and it makes it all too convenient to have a love interest that he can manipulate to his will. The romance didn't interest me, but it could have. The characters didn't either. It's just that the book itself is so well-written and I would have enjoyed a lot more if the romance had occurred a bit earlier and the main character could have found a way to communicate more with himself. I would give this book 4.5 stars because it's a really well-rounded read and it will appeal to some readers. If you are an introverted man like my friend, this is a good book to read to boost your self-esteem.
Write a negative review about a bad book:             I had the pleasure of hearing this book read and re-read, and found the story very compelling.   We are talking about a young woman who travels with her boyfriend, and he leaves her.  They go on a "trip" together in search of something.  The journey takes them to a city, and then back to a town where the young man has some trouble with some people, and a local boy who has a gun takes the young woman and her boyfriend hostage, but doesn't hurt her boyfriend.  She's then forced to go with the boy to a big city to meet his parents, but can't because they don't know about the trip.  But they also don't want to know about it, because they are too poor.  At the big city she goes through some stuff with the local boy, but they also find a big mansion, but it's in trouble.  And so she tries to rescue the owner of the house.  While the young people are stuck with the owner's son.  I loved the story.  It is very well done. The plot was fascinating, the characters were fascinating.  However the author did have her story all mixed up, and the characters changed every chapter.  Unfortunately I was really disappointed with this book.  First off the character changed every time a chapter started and didn't follow the plot.  This book was so confusing that I never really knew what the hell was going on.  Even the last page of the book is confusing as to who the young men were and what was happening to them.  Maybe this would have worked better if the author had gone into more detail on what the plot was, but as it stands the author's style was really confusing.  Also I never did find out how the big mansion was supposed to be built, and why it was in trouble, or who owned it, or where the little girl's father was.  So, at the very least this book is a good read for younger children who love a good mystery or adventure story, and have a lot of fun with it.  What I liked:    - Great storytelling:  The young people get into all kinds of trouble and have to go on wild adventures to try to save the big man's house. It's a lot like the stories my friend's father used to tell.  - Great character development: The young man's love of the
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very good book in the "classic" form of a science fiction novel.   The book is about an alien species known as the Quarians.  The Quarians have become quite rich, and there are many ships in the star system that they are using for transport.  In one of the ships, there is a woman who is being used as a "honey-pot."  She is being kept in a small, confined chamber and is not allowed to leave the ship to use the restroom.  When the Quarian ship is attacked by pirates, a young woman named Kaidan Alenko goes to her rescue.  Kaidans are usually male, as the gender has not been determined yet.  During the battle, Kaidane's "sister" Tali dies.  After this, KAidane is forced to watch his friends die in battle and realizes that he has to become a hero.  Once the fighting has stopped, Kaedan and his new friend Garrus Vakarian discuss their experiences.  They realize that if they want to be heroes, they have to become villains to make a name for themselves.  If you are a fan of the Mass Effect series, this is a must-read book.    "A Time to Kill":     "A Time To Kill" is another classic science fiction book. This is a novel about a rogue assassin called Londo Mollari who is hired to take out a dictator known as Golin Rodd.   I would never have guessed that this novel would have been a novel in which you can see the moon in the sky as it comes closer and closer and the space station orbiting it as it nears Earth. The Moon in the Sky is a series of three novels about Londo and his attempt to assassinate the dictator.   The first two novels in this series, The Way the Wind Blew and The Way We Were (with the later novel The Long Way Down not included here) have Londo as the protagonist and they all take place in the distant future.  " "A time to kill":   It is hard to put in a good review about such a great book. It is not just a science-fiction novel, it is an action-packed novel. It has many twists and turns and you just don't know what is going to happen next.  I have read this book several times.   Londo's mother is murdered by an
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Not bad, but a little long in the tooth.  4.   I love how the author is able to write a compelling story with a ton of symbolism, but doesn't use this to sell anything or tell a complete story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because my friend asked me to.   The book seemed interesting but I was never totally in love with it.  I like to think that I enjoyed it more than I did because of the author's background (I'm pretty sure she's an adult now).   I didn't really like the story either and I think that would have been the case if I hadn't read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Read another review by:   J.K.R.  The characters are pretty well-written, and there are enough moments to engage the reader (and the reader gets a little bit of a "What's wrong with you?" moment when it turns out she's not as good at magic as he is), but the book is quite uneven. The setting is solid and enjoyable, but the story is a little more uneven.   The magic is well done, but it has a bad habit of going off the rails in both its plot and characterization.  The characters are good, but I feel like a lot of what I enjoyed about them in the beginning is lost in the book's middle and end.  I would like to see them explore their relationship more, particularly when it comes to the question of why she keeps returning to the church when she should be spending her time with him.  The plot was solid but didn't have a lot going for it.  While the ending is pretty good, it is pretty rushed.  It's a good read, just not as a stand-alone.  Overall: I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy and has some patience.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If this book was really as terrible as some have made out it was supposed to be I would be able to give it a negative score but instead I will give this a one star review.   The only bad thing I can say about this is that some of the scenes that don't sound like they could be a part of the film aren't and the rest aren't that good either.  The story follows a young girl that leaves a small town to live in the city and is then taken in by a group of kids, the kids are a bit more realistic and seem like real people as opposed to some random kid or a dream that's all part of a kid's imagination.  There are a few parts that aren't so great and I found it very confusing.  I was hoping this would turn out to be the worst and I was very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What happened to my brain?   I have been told many times by a number of people that books can never be bad, because, as a writer, I always tell myself that.   I am an artist as well as a lover of writing, and there is no question that when I go into the world of books, there are certain things that I would not tolerate for one second:  the act of telling a story about a dead guy that happened to die with no explanation.  A book that tells me "this book will not be as good as the last one that was better" is the last thing that I am looking for.  I was so excited about the prospect of the novel in which I was working on, but after a year, a book turned out to be a big let down.  So, why was it a let down?  I had started work on this novel in the fall of 2014, a year and a half after my previous novel, The Lost Girl, came out.  The new project had me excited.  With the help of the editors at Random House, I started out writing a novel in a style that I had written and loved in my teens, the sort of teen-y stuff where you're trying to tell a story that will appeal to a lot of kids and then have your characters be teenagers who are trying to figure out what their life is.  At first, I had been thrilled with the prospect.  It's something I thought would translate well to young adults.  I started getting lots of notes from people who thought it was a good idea, which meant that I hadn't just blown a lot.  Even with the encouragement from people, I continued writing the novel, working on the plot and characters in my own way, and got a lot more feedback.  But after a while, the feedback began to get less and less encouraging.  After a few weeks, I knew that I was having a hard time getting people to read my book. The editor at Random asked me to come in and have a meeting about the book.  In the meeting I explained what the novel was going to be and why it would appeal to my age group.  And I told them that I wasn't really sure what was going on.  Then I said I was going back to the drawing board and I would start from scratch.  There was a short pause.   Then the editor said

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a bit slow at times, but the story itself was excellent. The story is about a young woman whose life is going well, until a car accident causes her to lose her left leg. As a result of her accident, she is unable to enjoy her life and she gets sent into a coma. The first person perspective of the character is so well done and I loved it, but it did get a bit repetitive, especially since the author often made her character go through the same scenario in each chapter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that I bought, thought it would be good, and read it. It's just bad. The author writes a lot of "this is how you're supposed to think and behave when you're a woman" stuff, but no one else is supposed to feel bad about their sexuality. If they do, you're being oppressive. I couldn't believe that she was so ignorant. It makes it hard to see anyone outside the straight world doing well. I don't know how a woman could survive without feeling sorry for herself when she's asexual, but she shouldn't. It is a privilege to have a partner, and no one should have to feel that way. I thought that the book did have some good stuff in it - in the end, the sex with the straight woman was boring. I wanted to know what other women thought about the whole thing. It has a lot to offer, and I'm sure I'll be reading more of this sort of thing.  22 of 25 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are going to review a book, at least make sure you have read it. If you have not read it, it is a waste of time, your readers will be put off by this, and you'll be writing this book as an excuse to review it, not because you want to.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If there is a positive point to be made about this book I don't know it; but I'd give it an "only slightly" high rating. It is an excellent introduction to some of the more obscure and under-appreciated parts of world history. Unfortunately it's a bit hard to find the reviews on Amazon or in online bookstores, so I'm not sure if they'll have any good reviews. I hope so. I have not read "King Solomon's Mines" but I've heard people say that the author makes some pretty compelling points about Solomon's discovery of the New World and how it played a role in his history.   For a general introduction to Solomon's research I'd recommend reading the following: "The Lost World of Solomon's Mine" by David E. Dickson.    "The Story of Solomon" by Stephen Oppenheimer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this on the day before I was supposed to graduate and I'm not a college student so I guess the book was for the middle schoolers. There were a lot of grammatical mistakes and typos. The book's structure seemed to change every 3-4 chapters (not that I mind a bit of rewriting, but it wasn't much help in the sense that the ending of each chapter felt like it was out of nowhere, instead of building up to something). My grade of the book: B   As far as the author and the book itself, I don't really have much to say. The only thing I think would improve this book would be if the story was told from the character's perspective; but it's not bad in the least, so I don' This is the second of 4 books I've read that have been about women who are trying to find their place in the world. As far as writing goes, the writing was really good.   The characters didn't really feel like stereotypes of a female, they were more like real women I knew. But I did feel that I wasn't entirely understanding of what it was about the characters that made them that way; that in fact it didn't seem to make any sense at all. I'm trying to put my finger on it and it's hard because I'm a really bad reader, but I'm still not sure what it is about my character's relationship with their father that made me believe that they wouldn't make it out on their own and that they would probably end up in a bad situation. I don,t think it was their lack of education; it's more like I don 't think that they were bad people, they just didn't have the right education, like they were the kind of people who had the education but didn't do anything with it. For me it was the fact that I didn't want to find out how bad things really were because I didn 't want to be the person that said that life was easier than it was. I also read a short review from someone who really liked this book and I thought that the author was the writer and the author got all the credit. So for me it's really hard to put in a good review of a book that I just read and I think that's the case for the author as well. The ending for the book did feel like it came out of left field, and I don "t think there
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not well written, the story is not interesting, and the main character is so annoying that I wanted to stop reading, but I am a very spoiled reader so I continued. If I wanted a good fantasy story, I'd be reading a book called "The Dragon Reborn" or "Giants in the Mist" (although I haven't read those books and the dragons in "Fire and Stone" don't seem that different, they are very similar but it's not a huge surprise because the dragons that appear in both the books are the same). This book is so boring that I would recommend it only to the people who would enjoy reading a boring book in the middle of the day and have nothing else to do (although the ending is still very satisfying). And if you are someone who has no patience, you should never listen to this book. The final rating: _______________ I really enjoyed the book. It is not as good as "Lord of the Rings" and "Game of Thrones" (even though it is better than "Eclipse") but it is still interesting and you should at least try it if you like fantasy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My daughter, a college graduate, found the novel to be one-dimensional.   It is one long, predictable, boring plot.  This book was so boring that it took away from my experience of reading it.  I was looking forward to reading the third book because I enjoyed this one.  As for the book, I was more interested in the story than I was in the characters.  The third book is very close to a book by Stephen King.  Please do not let my daughter buy this book.   Review by: Amanda K. on Feb. 17, 2014 : (no rating)  This book was a disappointment for me because it was a book that I had high hopes for. It didn't live up to the book I hoped it would be. The book is too one dimensional, has way too many clichés that are too common and unrealistic and feels like an overused plot device in a book filled with these things. There are way too much of the same things to be happy about this book and in fact I feel cheated that I read this book but not the one I read two years ago. I will have to look for a more interesting book to read next.  I have also read other reviews and thought the first book was better. I have a hard time believing that my expectations were too high for this book, especially because the second book was even more boring and one dimensional.  the characters were annoying, the plot too predictable. I would have to say if you are a young adult that wants to have a "good" book with a happy ending I would go with the first instead.  of course there is a sequel, but the first wasn't all that interesting and I don't see myself getting into this series again  Please review only if you want to read a book with realistic characters, a happy, happy ending, and a believable plot, but this isn't one of those. . 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most annoying things about this book was the fact that I felt the author was just trying to write the book in as realistic a manner as possible without going overboard. There was no tension that didn't exist. Nothing was really suspenseful enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. There were very few twists and turns in this novel to keep the reader guessing. That, combined with the fact you are reading a historical account and not just a thriller, can make a book feel very one-dimensional and that's one of the reasons I didn't care for it. The story also felt rushed, which caused me to have to stop reading. The author tried too hard to get to the ending. I understand that it's a historical novel but a more realistic depiction would have made this book better. It would have given the author more of an ability to make me invested in this story rather than just a synopsis. Also, I don't think the book could have been written in any other way. I'm not a big fantasy fan but there were plenty of times I felt compelled to turn the page and find out what happens next.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    " The title is quite funny but is in fact pretty bad, it is very long and confusing." - I.K.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is pretty bad.   The story is pretty much set in a fictional world in which a malevolent demon lord has been attacking and enslaving women.  The problem with this book, as with most horror books, is that it tries too hard.  It tries too much and tries to do too much.  What the author does not seem to realize is that by having the hero be a male, and by having all of his actions taken out of his control by the devil (the demon lord), it also puts the burden of a lot of the book's problems on him, as he is helpless to stop the demon lord from enslaving all the women and taking over the world.  This kind of situation is common in fantasy/saga fiction, as the main characters in most of these books become the victim, and the readers get to take over the roles of the villains and heroes.  By having the main character be male, we are expected to accept that his actions can have a negative impact on the world, even though we only see that effect once or twice in the story.  However, this is exactly what happened with this story.   The story could have gone either way, but for the most part, it ended up being a pretty uneventful book with lots of action, but very little plot.  I would highly recommend this to people who want an action-packed adventure story, but who don't want to read about the sexual assault of a female character (which seems like something a fantasy author would have done).  Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am just beginning to try to get more comfortable with the   terminology   used   for   various  things   on the internet. I can't tell you how much I detest that word "fantastic". I am not looking forward to reading any of the rest of this series, but if it isn't this then what is? I will be checking out The Warlord's Bone at the end of the month, and then I'll just move onto a book I really want to finish, the final book in The Malazan Book of the Fallen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For the most part, the writing was pretty good, but one of the most annoying things about this book is that it has no plot, just a series of interesting characters who have a plot that never gets resolved. There is a subplot about a woman who has been raised as an atheist by her father, but the characters and the plot are completely different. I'm not sure how this was allowed to exist, but it does. The story was also rushed. The book is about a family in a small town that struggles with the effects of drugs, and I really felt like the story was being rushed to bring it to a close as quickly as possible. There are a few other things that could have been done better in this book as well.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this for my son, but I will have to wait until he's old enough to read for himself. I was going to give it a 2 star because of the author's bad english, but then I noticed that one of the people on the author bio said they were going to make their book available in all the world's languages. So I guess I should read it in french and latin so my boy can enjoy it. The writing is not good, the story is not interesting. I'm sure this is intended to be a funny book for kids, but it's too old fashioned for my taste, so I guess it has nothing for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are well-developed and there's some good story lines. It's a good read, but it could have been better. My rating is only because I was looking forward to having a good book to read. Not because it was so bad it was fun to read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a very bad book. It should have been a "B+", but it wasn't.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's one of the worst books I've ever read!   I had high expectations going in to this book. And as far as the review goes, yes, it's a bad read. It starts off strong but gets worse and worse. It's just so uninspired! There was almost no plot whatsoever.   The protagonist was a woman who was in a relationship with a man, and at the end of the book, the man was dead.  This makes no sense! You can't just go "well I thought the relationship would work out but then they had sex, and she ended up with the wrong guy, and they broke up." You can understand why he might have thought it would work after all. And then you can't figure out how the guy died. It was really confusing.    The story was boring, and there was nothing interesting about the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    To a fault, The Magician's Nephew is a mediocre book. The story is pretty well told and, while it's a little too long, it doesn't drag. It's not perfect, but it's not bad.   I'm not a huge fan of this book, but if you like the idea of magical creatures and the supernatural, then this will appeal to you. The main problem with this book is that the book is too long. I think this is why it was shelved for a fantasy series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the most bizarre and over-the-top book I've ever read. This is the story of the 'Pigman', an African-American "personality", which is apparently "pig shaped" and has no voice. This "person" is so bizarre, I'm still trying to figure out exactly what makes him tick. There are other characters which are also "people", including a little boy who is also a person, a girl who was once a person and is now a person again, and a lady who is in the middle of a personality crisis. The book is full of references to obscure black pop-culture of the 50s, but does not really have a plot. The story is mostly told through the perspective of "Pig" and the experiences of others around him. The main characters are not particularly well developed - the little girl, the lady, and the other person. The author is apparently a friend of the author, and may or may not be the same person as the main character. The illustrations are pretty great.   Overall this is a fun, funny book. The drawings are simple but charming and it's very good to read about a person who really is a "person". The author seems to have no real interest in the characters and the stories of others, and all of this is conveyed in the writing, which is fairly simplistic and devoid of any style or flair. However, if you're looking for something a little more adventurous than the usual book with no story, this one is worth a try!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just can't.   What a waste.  I guess a good book is a bad one, as the word comes to us.  Not so with The Man in the High Castle  A science fiction/fantasy book that will leave your jaw dropped. It tells a story of one side of a war that takes place in a totalitarian government, as well as the other side. It takes place during the time of WWII as the U.S.A. tries to make a world in which Nazi can't exist and they must be eliminated. What a great idea. Now, with all the stuff I have to say about this book, I'm going to get it over with quickly.  The Man In The High Castle is a book that, even though it has great writing, it is not for everyone.  First off, I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.  Yes, I said 4.  It's a book about a story that is told through an alternate history. So, if you're expecting a fast paced action book that takes the action out of the book it's a good bet you'll be disappointed.  There are some slow points and some parts of the story that may be a little hard to swallow at first. There is a lot of information that you'll need to catch up on before you can see everything.   It's not that this book doesn't have a lot going on, it just takes some time to get into and get the big picture.  But the reason I can give this book a 4 is because I still can't get enough.  This is a very interesting book to read, it definitely takes a different direction than a lot people are going with, so it may take a little while for you to get your bearings. The plot is well paced, there is not a lot wasted in the story, but what is given is done well. There are two sides to this war. One side has been using the Nazis as pawns to create a totalitarian world where a fascist government rules. This group has been creating a whole lot of hatred and hatred of the other faction, which seems to be happening around every corner.  On the other hand, this other faction wants to create the same world, but they do not have the resources to do so.  Their leader is the mysterious Major Frank Jaeger. The book opens with a short story about Major Jaeger's life and the war in
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that can be enjoyed by any genre. The story is very well-written, and it has an interesting plot. However, I had a problem with how the characters were handled. The main character, L.W. is a total and complete jerk. I understand that he's a scientist and is a "nerd". But it's very hard to root for him. I could understand why people would like him because he's trying to understand what's going on and how it's affecting his family. But he's totally in control, in his world. He tells people how to do their jobs, and he can be very persuasive. However his behavior in the book made him seem like a total asshole. I don't blame him for doing what he does, but in doing so he makes a total mess of his family and makes them really sad and miserable. He's not the only one with a dark side to him either, there are a few of them as well. Other characters that came in and out of the story were all bad characters, including the parents. They were all just annoying and unlikable. They acted like they were in control while having the ability to throw a fit anytime they wanted. And they acted like it was "their house" and the story was their fault for making things difficult. And it was never explained how they were able to make their lives difficult. The only characters that stood out as interesting were the ones that were completely unlikatable and acted like complete jerks.   I thought this book was interesting enough, I wish I had more of it.  Rating: 5/10 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was totally looking forward to this book but I was left disappointed. The ending was a major let down. I feel like it's almost impossible to finish a book after reading the ending. I liked that this book didn't have any of the usual teen angst or angst around being a girl. The characters had a happy-go-lucky attitude and the characters that did struggle around being girls, even if it was just to be seen as a man, had their own issues to deal with as well.   There are a lot of flaws that I'm not sure how to fix. Some of the grammar/spelling/etc was off. However, I don't think the author did anything wrong and I can't see how to make it better. I would give it three stars if it had been released earlier.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the book has one major fault: it's too short.  For the most part, this is a very entertaining book.  There are a lot of details to the characters that add flavor and depth to the story.  The problem is that there isn't a lot to the book itself.    It starts with a really exciting set piece involving a fight against a band of vicious villains.  That quickly turns into a tedious exposition dump and it never really picks up momentum.  A lot of the characters also seem to be there only for exposition and they don't really develop at all.  It's also a bit heavy handed with how it shows the destruction of the world.  What really should have been cut was some of the scenes in the beginning of the story where we learn about the different dimensions and species and other such things.  This is probably a minor issue but it really made the first part of the book feel a bit forced.  For a book about the creation of the universe the world building is very lacking.  I'm sure some of that is due to budget and time but I wish there had been a lot more world building and less of it.  Overall the book is a fun read, I can see why the author wanted to write it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book as part of a package deal and I was very disappointed. I got the book on the same day I got my gift so I was expecting to love this book. I was quite disappointed in the book. There is no way in hell I was going to read this. I would rather be reading a book with a picture book cover on it instead of a book that was written by some guy named Brian Michael Bendis. There are many times that the guy seems to be trying too hard to impress you, not doing a good enough job and not showing his skill in writing at all. The book is filled with all the clichés you'd hear from a comic book, but the only clichés that I think are bad are "good guy/bad guy", "all the heroes are bad", "it's just a power struggle" and "the good guy will get the girl". The rest of the clich�s are all over the place. I can think of one time in the whole book when the "bad guy" was trying to find out who the bad guy was, and I thought he was trying too much. In addition to the clich��s, the story itself is bad. You have a guy who just wanted to be normal, who just wants to get along with everyone and then a bunch of bullies come along and try to force him to be the most normal person he can be. He tries to fight them by doing things that make no sense. I'm just glad he never turned evil. I wouldn't have gotten this book if it wasn't part of the package deal, and if it weren't for the hype that this book was going around and my being excited about it, I wouldn�t have read it at all and just would have ignored it. It's not a bad story, just not a very good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't care about this novel, it's probably because the premise is dumb. I'm sorry, but you can't just turn the characters' romantic adventures into a soap opera. Sure, they may do their best to hide their relationship under a cloak of secrecy, but in the end, it is pretty much all for show. This book is an excuse to see more of Rizzo's butt (and a side boob) and we get it. The plot is stupid and contrived, and I can't believe how long it took for this book to come out, but hey, no shame in that, it was a book I couldn't wait to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you are someone who really likes to read books. I did, but I could not finish it. I think it is a little hard for the average person to like reading books. This book is not for the faint of heart. You will most likely read some bad things about this book that will be negative to the point of being sarcastic. I hope I didn't get the review I wanted! I have heard a lot of praise about this story and how it is "dark" and "serious" and I am inclined to agree. However, I am not a fan of the tone. It seemed like every other chapter had a joke or a pun, not the sort of thing I like about a book. I also found it a little boring. There was nothing interesting happening at all. There wasn't a sense that this was a book that was made to be read. I just wish it had had more impact for me. I do not think I will pick this up again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was a bit boring and slow paced for a long story. However there were several good moments and I enjoyed the characters and the setting. However, the story was too short and I did not get to read anything that affected my view of the story or my feelings on it. The story could have been longer and more interesting but the length and the slow pace made the story boring. I give it 3 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad. I've been wanting to read this book for so long, and finally got around to it. I bought this book in a set with The Death and the Maiden and The Queen of Earth.   The novel begins with a preamble on the past of a family who's been murdered. This begins to get into the mystery of the plot. The plot is really thin. There's a man called Dr. J (who does not seem to know his own name) who goes to a town called Dermis to investigate the death of a girl. However, he isn't the one who dies, but the girl, and then the man is put on trial. The man's wife is also found murdered, but he gets a better conviction than his wife, who died in a fire. She has been poisoned and is presumed to have died of a heart attack. J has his own suspicions, but finds the evidence of the crime so compelling, and the investigation so convincing, that he is convinced it is his wife. So, he investigates further, and discovers the girl has a twin sister, who also has a secret life. That's right, another twin sister is involved, and her life is intertwined with hers.  It is a little thin. It is pretty much like a serial killer who's life is also being investigated. It has little development on the character of the girl or the twin sister. There isn't much dialogue. It also has no sense of scale. It was a little hard to read, because of the serial killer theme. It seemed like the author was trying to write something he thought was going to be interesting and cool. However it wasn't. I didn't hate this book. It isn't a bad story. It just wasn't worth buying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author starts the book by talking about how the world is turning into an "old, grey, dystopian world" where the police are so powerful that they can get people to do anything (i.e., lie and cheat).   The plot is one long set-up that is very dull to the point that it's hard to believe it was ever going to happen. When the plot finally gets moving, it's very slow. I'd much rather have this book than a new book from the author that has a plot (for a while) to make you feel excited about the future.   This author's books are very hard to read, and she makes them look easy by describing the world in an amateur way. The way she describes the world here makes the reader feel bad because they know the author is lying about everything. She starts this book off by saying that it isn't a big deal that everyone in the book is a criminal, and then in the middle of a sentence says something like: "If you had read the books in the library, you'd know that the crime-fighting police are much better than the government. They can't get you to tell the truth." And then the sentence goes on to mention something about the government being corrupt, which is a lie. Then, she brings up a random thing about one crime scene. Then she mentions a random crime scene and tells how that crime scene had been robbed by a gang of street thugs who were never caught because the criminals had been taken to prison. Then the sentence ends with: "These are the world's first successful police-state societies."   I mean, really? So now we can get into more of a thriller like the ones that were released in the 1980s. It was supposed to be a "cop book," but the author doesn't even tell us anything about the police. In fact, they aren't even mentioned until the very last chapter of the book. I don't know what the hell is going on here.     And yet, the author manages to sell her book because there are some nice descriptions in the beginning. Then there is the end of the last chapter where the author reveals that all the violence was part of a test to see if the citizens would accept the police state.   I suppose it would be better if this book was not written by an amateur who thinks she is a genius. This book should be a collection of some of her other books
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed by this book. I've had so many fantasy series to choose from that I felt like I'd be spoiled. There are so many fantastic female characters, including some of the best I've read. The characters have depth and have problems of their own that need to be explored. There was a scene in the book that really irked me, in which a character's daughter was made to do what she was told to do, and it was so dehumanizing I wanted to punch the author in the face. There is a plot in this book that involves the creation of a new empire, but it's really just more of the same. I can't imagine what this author was going for with this book - I can only hope that there will be a sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book for anyone interested in politics or history.   I'm a bit of a historian, so it was a good refresher for me.  It was fun to watch the way he used his history to analyze the present-day political climate (in a very accurate way).   It's a lot of information, and you don't know what you are getting into when you purchase it.  However, the book is well worth the investment because it is well researched and contains a wealth of useful information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even remember how I got into reading books by Stephen King, but I'm going to guess that I have been reading his books ever since my uncle (now my husband) convinced me to buy the Stephen King bookcase from a store in his hometown and now I can have everything I need in a single place. So here are some things that I really don't like about this book: - It is very long and hard to get through. The beginning and the ending seem to drag on way too long, and the middle is also just a bunch of confusing ideas that I didn't even understand. I feel like this is a story about two brothers who are trying to get to know each other, but really don?t. - The "true story" about the "ghost" (?) in the book is interesting, but the way he tells it just feels very fake. - There are many different names of different things in the house (e.g. the dog and the cat) that keep confusing me and also adding to the confusion. I'm sure I will just have to look up all the names of things here. - One of the main characters has a weird habit of talking about a "demon in the kitchen".   (This may or may not be a recurring thing with this author, since the same thing happened in another King story: Misery.) - I don?T remember how the "sister?" gets her name, but it?s a good one: ?I like that the writer uses the word "son" so frequently in the last few sentences of this story. That gives a feeling that the little girl is something more. And that's a pretty cool way to introduce a character.) - I just don? T remember how these guys get out of the house...it?s mentioned again, and there?s some weird stuff about the girls? house and then some unexplained stuff about a boat with wheels.   A LOT of stuff goes by so fast that I couldn?t follow what the characters were doing. - And lastly, some of the things that are described as "pets" (e-mail address) just seem so...silly to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My brother bought this in a gift package with a copy of " The Great Gatsby." He read this after having read a few Gatsbys but nothing he had heard of this author. I liked the plot but it was hard to follow. I am always fascinated by the idea that this story was based on a real person and the author was so famous that everyone had heard the story but didn't bother to find out who was the main character. I think this book could have used a good editor because there are some parts I just didn't understand. I'm giving it 4 stars because it was entertaining but the story didn't seem well thought out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The only good thing about the book is that it is actually written by a woman.     She also writes about things that are relevant to a woman's experience.  This was a fantastic read.     Verdict:  This book is a great read about why women can't talk about sexuality on TV.  I was surprised that the book included a chapter about bisexuality and the different ways that women's experiences can affect that aspect of their sexual identity.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You don't need to have read all the way to the end to enjoy the book. The author does a great job of presenting the book from different perspectives. Some might call it dry, others might call a good read. I have no idea what makes me read a book and what I should give it credit for. It's a fun read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book expecting the worst.   The plot of this book is extremely obvious and I didn't need to be told about it. The first 5 pages are a complete waste of time and the main character in this book. She just has to keep getting older and older and eventually she gets all her needs met.  It is all very well written though.  The author is not afraid to say a lot of harsh things about people and to not be afraid to get personal.  Her characters have real flaws but are also very real.  My favorite part about this book are the details about her friends.  They all think they are better than her in almost every way.  I was very sad that the characters had to be so perfect but it is a good story and I am glad I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half is a great little tale of a young princess who finds herself in a strange and dark land. She goes to bed on a rock, but she is quickly awoken by the princess of her dreams, who says that she is her great-grandmother, and she is here for a reason. She is going to return her to the kingdom, but first she must get a magical sword from a giant wizard in the sky.   As far as fantasy goes, it isn't bad. As a princess, I got the sense that she had a good sense of humor, and while this doesn't seem like much of a challenge to an adult, it seems like a big jump to a little kid.  It is very much the story of a princess who is going through her own growing pains, and it takes some time before she gets the magic sword. It's a good story, and though it has a few moments that were a little jarring, it's a fun tale to read.  I would recommend this book to a good deal of people, but I also wouldn't recommend this one to anyone with a hard-on for fantasy.  There is a fair amount of violence in this book, and some of it could be considered disturbing. The princess, who is an adult who has been told that she cannot be a princess in her own world, is going against all odds to do what she thinks is right. It is a good lesson in bravery, and as a parent, I would recommend it for children and adults alike. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I'd known it was this bad, I'd have bought a different copy!  The writing is bad. The story is bad. The characters are unappealing. The pacing is bad (a lot of pages are wasted in describing things, while there's not much time for characters to do anything). The story itself is really bad.  The plot was interesting at first, but is now so bad and confusing, it's not funny, and I can't imagine a reason that anyone would like it.   Rating: 1/5  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the opening chapter, I knew that this would be a good book and it was just as I expected. The main characters, D and K, are two young, bright and determined high school kids with a common sense and a fierce sense of justice. There are a few plot holes that can be explained in less than a paragraph or so. The characters are likeable, the story is a little too short, and the worldbuilding is a bit uneven. But that doesn't mean this is a bad novel. I like that it is set in a world that is familiar but not quite right. I'm looking forward to the sequels!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good, solid, but not exceptional book by someone who has a very different outlook on what the Christian religion is and should do.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:      You don't want this to be read by anyone but yourself.   (I've made a couple of exceptions, but usually not as extreme as this one.)   It's not that I hate the book -- a lot of the characters are fascinating to me.    It's that this is a story about sex, and it's an incredibly uncomfortable one.  This story is not "sex positive."  It's "sex negative."   The whole story is about sex and violence.  And it is presented with a sense of inevitability that the characters don't understand.  I don't know if it was the sex, but the violence in this book is just disgusting.  It's all about the violence. The characters get hurt and they get angry and they don't realize they're being violent until later.  You feel like you're watching a movie that doesn't make sense.  There's no development or dialogue.  Some people might even say that the dialogue doesn't really come across, but I think that's a function of the writing rather than the actual dialogue itself.  The only character who ever speaks, and who is well-voiced and is actually saying something, is the main character.   And that's just fine if it's your main character, but it's bad for this book.   It makes the book feel very disconnected.   The sex itself is not that great, but there's a ton of it, and the violence is bad, but somehow it works to make up for that.   (I actually don't find it all that bad.  If you enjoy bad writing, you'll probably like this book.)  It also does not really feel like a stand-alone story.  This is not a story that comes out of nowhere, or a story where there's some big reason that it's being told.  (It's also a book that doesn' feel very realistic.  In other words, it doesn't feel like it should be happening, which I think is a common problem with books about violence and sex.  What about the characters?  What are they fighting for?   They don't really know.  They're basically fighting for a guy who's a virgin and who's been raped.  So yeah, a lot is being said about sex. And a lot about how sex is bad. And they don' feel like the characters really understand what they're
Write a negative review about a bad book:    ( 1 )   Note: There is no point in giving negative reviews. That's a waste of time. Do not waste time writing one. Why should I read this book?   I have no idea.  Why would I want to read something that I am not sure I would enjoy?  There are so many good books out there!   Rating: 2 stars Why does this book seem to be such a hit? _________________________________________________________ I love the idea behind this book.   I believe that every person is meant to love someone else.  I also believe that people tend to see the people they have a love/hate relationship with and have a dislike of them.  So, in a sense, this book is meant for me.  This is a book about loving another person.  It is not about making your friends like you.  There is a romance involved.  But, in the end, the book is about love.  That's what the book does and it is not the best book in the world.  However, it is the best of all time.  My favorite characters and what they do with their lives is what makes the book such a success.  If you enjoy this book, then I have a feeling you will enjoy everything in this book including the ending.  The ending is very well done.  Also, if you have trouble making friends, you will love this book!   Summary:  It's always sad to find someone you love dead.  And I suppose it's even sadder to find out that they are not coming back.  When a man learns that his lover has died, he is determined to find her before she does.  Unfortunately, this is not going to be easy.  With a dead lover comes a dead man's body and a dead woman's secrets.  After finding a dead body, his only way of finding out what happened to her is through her dead body. This book is like a beautiful garden, full of color and life.  Like the title says, this story is about a man who has found love, but his love for his dead lover has led him to a darker place. He finds himself in a dead lady's body, but he still wants to keep his love alive.  Even though he knows that love and friendship are much stronger and more enduring than death, he also knows that it may be easier
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a book of bad stories I wouldn't recommend to anyone. I did not enjoy this book at all. It was boring and stupid. The only good thing about this book was the character of the girl. She was pretty and didn't have to be like all the other girls. The main characters were too stupid and one of them even was dead at the end. Overall I give this book a 1 star.
Write a negative review about a bad book:       I have been meaning to pick up this book for a while now. It's a wonderful read, and a really good summary of the ideas about the economy, but I just didn't find myself particularly enamored by it. I just found the writing to be slow and ponderous.   A few chapters in the beginning actually did make me think I would enjoy the book, but then I got bored.  I don't remember when I stopped reading it, but it was probably about halfway through. This isn't an easy read to get through.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:       "It's the first of many books about love, lust, and being misunderstood. The only problem with this book is that it is so long. It may be because of the long, complex plot, but the book's story suffers from a lack of clear characters and a lack in development of the characters.   "   The characters are complex, but have not developed enough to have real emotional arcs.  This review may be out of date, but is still worth sharing:  "I do not have much to say about this book. The author seems to have little imagination when it comes to the characters and the plot. There were multiple problems I have with the book (not the least of which was the fact that I had to keep flipping pages to see if the characters would say something), but none of them were plot-related to the story itself. There are very few moments of enjoyment in the book.  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't like a book or think it's poorly written, don't buy it. There are many good books that aren't reviewed very often, and if you don to read one, do so. I just reviewed a book last week called "Crisis of the Republic," a fascinating novel by John McPhee. It is a very good book, but I thought that in reviewing it here, that I'd also tell a bit about why it doesn't score very highly for me. I won't go into great detail about how the book falls apart in the end, but my main criticism is that it is poorly structured. The first section is basically a long account of the rise of the American Civil War, and the events that led to it and the Civil War itself, but the real climax of the book is when McPhef is trying to explain why slavery is bad for the Union. McPfhee's explanation makes some sense, but then goes on for a while to explain some other bad things that slavery did that weren't obvious. For example, McPherfhee points out that the fact that slavery was a profitable business for slave owners is a good reason to support slavery. Then he goes on to explain how slavery is just bad because the slaves were slaves. That's not a very convincing argument. The problem with the "why is slavery bad" thing is that McPhen's reasoning is mostly irrelevant. For a slave owner, he points out, you have to give up your slave in order to buy something that doesn't cost as much. That may be true in one context, but that doesn' t make it a good tradeoff. For one thing, slaves in the Southern states were better off than slaves in Northern states because they were less likely to be killed if they were slaves and more likely to survive. Secondly, it doesn' y mean that it wouldn't be good for the slave owners if there was less violence. Slaves worked hard for their owners, and they could afford to die if the owners got killed. Thirdly, the argument is mostly just McPhet' s argument that slavery isn't bad because there isn't that much violence. The reason there is a lot of violence, he thinks, is because there is only one moral person and everyone else is corrupt or evil. That sounds pretty damning, but he doesn't really explain why there is so much violence in the first place, and he doesn' z mention
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't enjoy this one that much. The stories and characters were very interesting, but it was the plot that really made me turn away. The main female protagonist (Liz) was the most interesting of the three, and she had a nice plot, but what really bothered me was that her character was so very stereotypical. Her parents divorced when she was six, and her father died when she turned seven. She's in therapy, has an older brother who is also in therapy (and whose mother is married to a priest), has been diagnosed with postpartum depression, and, in a classic plot-twist, is also pregnant at the same time. Liz is also so angry, petty, and vindictive that her only redeeming trait is her love of violence, which she uses to hurt those who get in her way, including her father's friends and the two younger boys in her class. Her life is so miserable that when she's offered a new opportunity, she can't resist and is too ashamed to say no. This is a novel that just tries too hard to be too much, because it's a novel.   And the characters are too shallow for me to care about them, so I didn [the main male character, Tom, is described as being an overprotective father, so the fact that he's obsessed with his baby is particularly painful.]    [Liz's father, who is an alcoholic who has a drinking problem, is very unhappy with Tom and tries to run him off. Tom is upset about his father's drinking and his relationship with his wife, which only makes him angrier.]
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to like this book.   My son bought it for his 8th grade yearbook, and the first couple of pages were just a "wow" moment.  After that, I gave it a 3.5 and said I would have given it a 4 but because of a series of "Oh shit" moments.  My husband (who has read a lot of books in his day) didn't like it either, and said it was "boring" (that is, when he wasn't laughing and making inappropriate noises).    So I'm just saying:  I'm looking forward to hearing what people think. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book: In the early 2000's, it became increasingly difficult to find quality literature that explored the intersection between science fiction, technology, and humanism. I decided to search for something in between the two. "Gravity's Rainbow" is my entry into that subgenre.  The book is a novel by the same name by the Chinese author Ng Jeong-hee that was translated by Thomas M. Disch on behalf of the U.S. Air Force. The novel follows an American woman as she explores China and finds herself in the middle of a revolution, in addition to being a Chinese girl discovering a new language and culture. What made the book stand out to me was the author's attempts to make the characters seem believable, even if she chose to make them a bit unrealistic at times. My only real complaint is that a couple of the characters don't really grow much. They are good in their roles but, in my opinion, are only able to do so due to their personalities. I found it difficult to root for any of the major characters. The book has good reviews from the science fiction community. (Kirkus, Starburst, Amazon)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book, but it was poorly written, with a lot of unnecessary and poorly explained characters, a rather pointless and non-original concept and plot, a plot that goes nowhere, a boring and cliched hero (even though the hero is a good guy), a plotline that goes no where, and a story with no twists.  I'm not sure who wrote this book or what the point of the book is, and I didn't enjoy it at all.   The next book: This book's plot is a little better than the one in A Good Man Goes to War:  This book is set in the same world as A Good Guy Goes to Hell:  However, this one has less problems and the characters are a bit less annoying.  I'm currently reading A Good Woman Goes to Vietnam:  A good man and his wife are sent off to Vietnam during the war, and find out that a lot more was going on than meets the eye in Vietnam.  They travel to the North and meet several people (including the "Red Baron" himself) and learn that the war is really far from over. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've heard good things about this book, but I didn't really know what to expect, so I took a chance and bought it. This book is just okay.   It's about a young girl who is trying to kill herself. The whole book is a flashback of her life before the accident, when her dad died from a heart attack while she was being adopted by a wealthy and abusive family. The problem with this book is that it's not really told from the perspective of a young kid. In the story, we only hear from her mom. She is really only in it to make her husband angry, and her mom isn't really in it for her either. The kid is very self-centered, she hates people she doesn't know and the people who have always been there for her. She doesn't think she can do anything right, so she has to prove it every time.    And finally, here's a great song about a girl with a heart of gold, " I'm sorry I'm not a good enough singer /   "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You should not buy this book! I was so disappointed when I opened it and realized it was just a bunch of self-published fanfiction! I knew the reviews that people had given the book seemed to indicate that the writer was more than a little bitter, so I was worried that maybe I wasn't getting the real story, but the reviews didn't have any bad words. The first two or three chapters were okay, and then there was this horrible start to the story, a chapter that seemed to me to be a retelling of one of my favorite books about a group of people trapped in a big, creepy castle. There was a great deal of tension and suspense as the characters tried to escape. Then the author changed the plot in such a way that, if you hadn't read the book before, you'd never know that this new thing was the reason why the book was so bad. The next three chapters became like the last pages of an unfinished book. I knew that this was what the book had been about when I started reading, and even though I had read the first book (which I loved), this was a new take on the theme that turned the novel into a bit of a slog. By the time I got to the end, I was not surprised to find myself wondering how much more the book could have been and still have been a bad read. I'm sure some people loved this book and will like it, but I think you might be better off with something else. If I had to choose, I would have to say that I would much rather buy a good book for less than I paid for this. And no, I don't feel sorry for the author or think the book deserved a 5 or a 7. (I would give it a 6.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought the "Wine with the Dead" series by Mike Haldeman, as a fan of the original. Unfortunately, "Dead Men's Residences" is not nearly as good as the original, and is really the same book, only a little shorter. I'm not even sure what the "Dead Women" books were about. All the women are just there for sex, and in one scene they are just sitting around a table, watching a man masturbate to them. There's an inane sex scene with the main character where she goes down on another woman, then he's supposed to orgasm, but he's still not there. If this is the only thing that bothers you about the series, you can stop reading it, because it's not even that good.    Review by:  I read "Deadmen's Residence" as an adult. It was not that good for me, either in the original or the revised version. That said, the paperback version is still available, so you may want to give it a try.  I'm glad the publisher continues to offer it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the second book, this book has a whole lot of problems.   The characters are a little thin and not all are likable.  Some of the writing is atrocious.    This is the first book in the series so don't take it on faith but I'm afraid there are some problems here that will make a reader drop the series.  There's also some of the characters have some flaws that I thought were interesting, but some of them could have been changed or written better, such as the main character.  This is a series of short stories so the writers have a little wiggle room and if they feel like adding a more developed character or a different story, then that's what they do.  They don't do that and keep the same basic story that is written in the first and second books.  You'll just have to wait till the third book to get a satisfying conclusion to this series.   This book was published in 2006 and was published as an e-book in 2007.  There are no notes or citations so you will have to use your best judgment to see what you will get.  Overall it's a decent book and worth a look but don't expect too much out of it and expect some problems from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Goodreads rating:    4 /5   The world is a cruel and unforgiving place. The only hope, of course, is an old friend who can help you get out of the hellhole. "P.A.M." (Permanently Apathetic Male, Male or female, Mature Readers Only) is a raunchy, fun, fast-paced, and utterly heart-wrenching comedy that tells the tale of a man who gets trapped in a world populated only by attractive women, and the one person who's willing to help him. "I've known my share of guys in relationships who fell for the wrong girls. But that's the one place that I had to admit they were totally right about: they'd got it."   P. A.M. is the story of Adam, a man in his late 40s who finds himself trapped in an intersex friendship group for men, who are all genetically female. "Like any group of guys," Adam explains to his friend, "we come to each other in a very unusual way, and as far as we know, everyone's had to make a personal decision to join the group in order to get to know one another. But every now and then you'll run into the person whose personality you just couldn't place anywhere else."  I'm sure that the average person reading this book will think I'm a crazy lesbian for enjoying it. But I assure you that it's actually not nearly as much of a crazy as it first seems. There's a certain amount of levity to be found here, a bit of leering at the characters' physical features and a little bit of sass, and it's quite enjoyable. It's like when you're having a good time and someone comes along and changes it. As a story, it's about as easy to take as an open-ended question, but with a bit more structure (and a bit less "we just get along fine here") it becomes something much more than that. The book is divided into two sections: a short prologue that sets up the two groups that Adam is a part of, and a shorter prologue for the rest of the book. The two sections are so different in character that it almost feels like a different book. I loved that. It set a tone for the story, while allowing me to see things from Adam's perspective. The first section is a fun and lively read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you find a bad read in a great book, it was probably a bad copy. If the bad copy is in a good book, that's an example of a good copy that was out of print. You are reading a bad version of the original. You might also call the original a good edition. I don't know who this book was originally published for, but I would hope that they would have gone back to the drawing board and come up with a better title. The book is full of references to the Bible, but none of the references come to anything that the author has actually read. Even when the author claims that he has read the bible, the book does not provide him with a Bible. It claims to be based on biblical history and geography, but it does not actually include any evidence that supports the claims it makes. The authors claims are unsupported. The author makes the claims without giving the readers enough evidence that they should believe them. The best that I can say about the book is that it is not bad, it is just bad, not good. I am a believer in God, but the book doesn't really make a case for god. I will certainly pass this book along to my kids. I'm afraid that I may not want them to be able to pass their classes with this book when they get older. I think I might need a religious education. Rating: 1/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The first three books of The Dark Tower Series are great. I read them on a week-to-week basis starting with the first and thinking about what I was missing in the later books. I still loved them. The story was good. There was always a satisfying conclusion that made the previous books seem a bit thin, so I was happy to see the Tower have a little resolution to its problems.  But there were a lot of problems in this book and I don't think I ever really got them all.     The characters were very flat.  They were too perfect.  But that is really a personal gripe.  I think it was a great way to begin the series. " (p. 8)       I don' t really have any issues with this book. It's not that I don t have any problems, its just that they're not as strong as the rest of the series...or for the first two books of the Dark Tower, in my opinion. This book I felt was more...I don't want to say derivative, because the story was great.  It just was a bit too familiar to be really all that great.  I will say, however, that the author has a pretty great voice. It sounds more like Roland to me than some of the characters. The Dark is a nice book, but there were parts I did not like.  One thing I really loved about this book is that they gave Roland's voice some depth.  There were so many moments in the book when Roland was frustrated about the Dark and the Tower's failure to change...even though he has a lot more control of it than any other character. He is very unhappy about the fact that they don't change and wants change because its what he believes will help with the Tower. He wants to have a positive influence and change things for the better.  Some characters that I like, and I think a lot like, Roland don't have that.      Overall, I really liked The Dark and it's sequels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the first book. I enjoyed the characters and the humor, but not the plot. A little too much time is spent on exposition, and when the story really needed to kick in, a couple of characters came out of the woodwork to derail everything. The ending was too predictable. The book was written in the first person but I felt like the POV was given by the character who did most of the work in the book.   A friend of mine said "I don't really care who wrote this, I'll read anything."   Overall:  This book has been described as a 'fairy tale'. It's not a fairy tale, it's a dark fairy tale. It's a real dark fairy story. It is a story of what happens when a poor young girl and a rich man fall in love.  A little too long. It took me over 2 1/2 hrs to finish the book due to boredom and boredom with the book as a whole. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    -   A lot of people have reviewed this as though it was a bad read and you should have skipped it.   I did not, I found it fascinating. I didn't read it as a critique, it was more a description of the world that I had never experienced before.  This is a good read if you haven't read many fantasy books. This is what I read when I was in school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     5 of 5 stars:  A good read.   The story is set up well.  It is not the best story. But, the setting is good enough to justify that.  I had a great time reading it.  My only wish is that it would have ended more happily.  You are very well read. So far I have enjoyed your other stories as well. Very well written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (don't write a review and then ask if you can take it off my shelf, the book won't fit anyway!)   Thank you   for a great book, you got me hooked on an amazing series and a new author.   "I got hooked on the series in one week, and was hooked on it from there. The author's style is easy to follow, and I felt comfortable reading her novels. I loved all the characters, even though they all had their own flaws." I have to admit that I read the first book in this series way before I had finished the previous one. So, it wasn't a surprise that I really enjoyed the novel. I read the entire series in a few days, and am now enjoying them in between regular reading.  The book is well written, with a very unique and original story.  It's good to read a book once to make sure you are enjoying the story, and then once you have finished it it's great to go back and finish more. The first book has some scenes that are a bit too long, but the second book is just as good.   I look forward to the third book, it's a great series so far.  I have enjoyed this series so much.  So I read a review from someone who also has read the previous books.  "This is the third series of this sort that I have read. I have been so impressed with them and so interested that I can hardly wait to get started on the next. These books are always enjoyable and they are very good at keeping you interested in their plot. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is absolutely no need to read this book, other than it was a short, fun read. The protagonist, Iona, is a very cute girl who is in love with her boyfriend who lives far away in the mountains, and who is also a princess. She goes to a summer camp for girls to practice singing, dancing and swimming with her favorite princess. At the beginning of the book, the author makes it clear that Iona is the most attractive character, with a great figure, large brown eyes, big breasts and long hair. It's clear that this is the point of the story, to show how she really is the prettiest girl in the camp. This is the first time the author tells the reader that Ionia is a princess and the hero is a prince. In addition to this, the first paragraph of the first chapter is about her life with a prince who is very young.   After spending the summer at the camp, the heroine ends up traveling with her beloved prince to the capital of his kingdom to meet the king. After that, the book moves into a darker direction, to the point where Iona goes from a sweet, loving princess to an evil, cruel princess with no heart and no will to live. This becomes a major plot point after the prince discovers that she was the princess that died.  The author keeps changing Iona's body every few chapters, but at the beginning she has a long, blond hair, blue eyes and a cute, innocent face. Her face and body changes a lot throughout the book and the story becomes more and more twisted and evil.  This book is written in a very simplistic way and there is a lot of gratuitous nudity in it, which can be read as a turnoff. If you want to read a princess who is a little bit perverted and nasty, this is a good start.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a fine book, but there are some weaknesses which could have been addressed by some better editing.   These include: a single sentence that is too ambiguous, the first two chapters are written without any introduction to the setting or character, and the final third of the book is written like a chapter book instead of an anthology.      Overall this is a very good book and I highly recommend it.  The Black Mirror by David Mitchell    When I first discovered David Mitchell's writing, my immediate thought was "wow, this guy's weird, and if he writes a weird book, he's pretty much done!" But as I delved deeper, I realized that this was more than a weirdness or eccentricity; he also wrote a book with a unique atmosphere.  I'm not a big fan of the term "weird fiction" and am sure that is part of the reason why Mitchell has a bad reputation for so many people, but I think it's also important to acknowledge how important it is to recognize weirdness in a good novel.  If a novel has a weird quality, but is also written well, then that weirdness should be praised (i.e. you shouldn't automatically assume that a novel which has a lot of weirdness must be bad) but I also think it should be recognized when the novel succeeds, and I think Mitchell definitely succeeds here.  For anyone who is interested in trying to write a book that is really strange and weird and totally different from everything you've ever read before, Mitchell's The Black Mirror might be the book for you! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "I am sorry, I have been trying to find out where to buy a book and I discovered this site, and am so delighted I found it. This is a great and fascinating book! I like to read when I get a free day from work, so it will be good to have a few good books available for free to read. It would have been better if the author had been able to expand on a couple of the major themes of the book, but it still has me intrigued and excited about all the possible ideas they would add to their series."  My husband loved this book!  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:        It was a really cool idea but all it did was distract from the action.   What I liked about the novel:    I really enjoyed the book and had a great time reading it.  It is the kind of book that will be hard to put down and I think I might have read it a few times already.  The plot is great.  I really enjoyed this book and the action was great. I can't say that I thought the characters were all likable though. It was an awesome book but I can tell that there are flaws that would have been really helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    * * *   I just finished the first of two "Masters of the Universe" books (Mt. Olympus and Olympus) by a well-known fantasy author. The good points are the story, the character development, and the writing, but the bad points are that the plot is so terribly boring, the writing style is uninteresting, and, overall, I was very disappointed by this book.   The first point is a minor one, but it is one I've commented on in a few other reviews: the plot. In the middle of the book, the characters are introduced and the plot takes off in a completely different direction (though, obviously, it still maintains its usual pace and pacing). The ending was also completely unexpected, although it didn't affect the plot (yet). I thought that it would have been better to have left things at a more interesting place after the prologue, rather than just abruptly ending. However, it did show me the way things are going to be, so I will say that it wasn't too bad.  The second problem is not with the plot, but with the writing. The problem is the lack of "world building." There are many details about the world, but only one about the characters. The other two books by the same author I have read were much better. In "Mt Olympus" the author has explained quite a bit of what the various races and religions are all about. The "Mighty Eight," as I call them, are a race of "humanoids who possess the ability to control the eight elements". There is a religion based on their "gods," and there is a group of people who worship them and who have special abilities. The book describes the world quite a lot, so the main character is well informed about the religion and the gods, and about the people (in fact, about the entire world, including the other races). However, there are some minor details about some of the characters that are a bit too vague for my taste. They are not crucial to the story and, for example, the description of the giant wolf in the middle that eats people isn't very relevant to the plot of the story. In this book the author shows a bit more of his worldbuilding skills.  *  * I have been waiting many years for a new fantasy book by a female author that I really liked. I had a feeling that it wouldn't be the same.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   "What the hell did I just read?    It's a really strange book...   This is the best horror story I have ever read..."    I read a lot of horror. I have a huge number of horror-related books in my collection. This book is a bit of a mystery to me. It's just too weird. It starts out slow with an innocent young girl (who has a name and is a character) coming home from school, not remembering anything, but getting sick when her family's cat bites her on the leg and she thinks it's a snake bite. Her mom says it's just a mosquito bite. Then the book jumps in time and location, to a place in England called "Lantern City." There is this "Lord," and a "Lady" and a young girl, who seems to be all that's left of her parents. There is a strange, evil, monster and it appears that his plan is to make all young girls disappear forever. It all begins to fall apart when a boy called Charlie (who is only about 13) falls in with the monster and they both end up in an asylum. It turns out that Charlie is mentally disabled. The author, Mavis Gallant has a weird writing style that makes everything sound like someone is shouting out in a high-pitched voice. That sounds like she's reading from a notebook and is not very good at it, but I liked it anyway. There was no description, no scene by scene, no names, just descriptions of what happens. There were a couple of pages where I thought the book was going to end and ended up reading about the monster's plans for the young girl. All in all, it's not a book I'll be reading for a long time. I might pick it up a couple times to see how much it is going to freak me out but there are just too many strange things going on to keep it going.  This is a great little story. It is the kind of story that will keep you reading till the very last page.  is a really great little book. I loved it. Its a quick read and will leave you wondering about the events that transpire in it. I had not heard of this one until a friend recommended it and I went right out to the library to purchase the book. When I got home I began reading and found that I liked the book even more than
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You should get out more! Not much to say about this book, but I will say I was completely blown away by the content of the book.    Read an interesting article about a game you've heard of:  The game was fun, but the graphics were bad. It's an old game, but it's so pretty to look at and play.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only book I gave to my father was  The Road to Tyranny. I read it in the second grade, and it was an eye-opener. He is now a registered Republican. The book is a powerful warning against the dangers of the current policies of the left. I did not understand all the details, but this book was very informative. Read it and you can't help but to feel a lot safer about America.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that you'll see a lot of folks in the Christian community raving about for the first 100 pages.    I did, too, when it first came out. But after finishing, I've realized it's a very bad book. This book is a critique of contemporary Christianity that was written by a religious scholar in the 70s.     The thesis is that contemporary Christianity is fundamentally flawed and the solution to Christianity's problems is to start from scratch. The book is very much an exercise in bashing the church and the way it practices and teaches today.       I think that most of these points were made by someone with a lot more knowledge of history and religious studies than the author.  The book starts out with the story of a Christian (a man named Peter who comes from a good family) who was so taken by the religion that he was willing to give up a lucrative business and move his family to a Christian monastery for a year to start a religion of his own. But Peter, like most others, doesn't make it very far.  He is immediately beaten and tortured by the monks.  While he is there, he is forced to watch as the monks eat meat and drink alcohol and smoke and party and smoke some more.  Peter decides to leave because of his wife (who later died and who is portrayed as evil) and his daughter (who is portrayed by the author as a saint) being tortured by a cruel brother-in-law and brother in-law-to-be.  After spending a year at the monastery, Peter returns to his family in a state of despair.  Then he learns that he's been a prisoner in the monastery's basement.  This story is told with great clarity and compassion by an actual participant in the story.  However, I believe the author's portrayal of the monks (who are portrayed by a lot less nuance) to be too much for the story to work, despite the fact that the book presents a good picture of a church in a time when people in other areas of society were not happy about their faith, or their leaders, or whatever.  I also couldn't get behind some of the theological claims made by the Christian author. I suppose that's the point of this book: to bash religion.  And it's really easy to write a book like this.  So why didn't it work for me?  I don't know.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    So my friend took my book to a book club last night and we started a conversation about how we were going to put down our book, because there is a lot of swearing in this book. I'm pretty sure the only swear word I heard was 'FUCK' but I'll tell you this:  I didn't find this offensive. In fact, the swearing is pretty funny at times. I really liked the main character in this story; she's an interesting and likeable character.  My favorite part of the book was when the main girl and the bad boy found out each other's secret; I liked that they both were honest and that they didn't lie to each other; I also liked that there was a lot in this novel that didn't make sense at first but was slowly explained to us; that they kept telling each other the truth even when it wasn't that easy to do. I think I'll read this again in a few years and I'm really looking forward to it.  Read a book at a public library and get a book back for a $1.00: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (Note:  I will add at the bottom of this review that I'm a HUGE fan of the first two books in this series:  )   There are so many times I've seen people describe this book as the  'one'  book in the series.   It's not.  The third book has a much different feel to it.  You know how it feels to read the first book and then realize you've seen every single one of these characters before?   Yeah.  I just spent that much time with them...I don't know how I didn't see that before.  This book is a little more mature in tone than the first and second books, which were pretty much straight-up fantasies.  There's a few more mature themes and questions asked in this book but I feel like I'm going to get lost in a lot of them.    I'm glad I didn`t start with this one, and now I`m reading the other two. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a woman who is an extremely religious person, but is so repulsed by her abusive mother, that she takes her own life. This is a true story, and the author did not try to hide her religion in this book. The book does have a lot of problems with poor writing, so I would not recommend this book to anyone who needs to read the exact same book in order to understand the plot. The woman had some problems with her abusive father, but she was a victim in her own right. This book was so disturbing that it made me so angry and confused. I was reading the whole thing in two sittings because I was having such a hard time keeping the book in my mind!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for a more interesting and creative book.   But it didn't go that way at all.  I did not understand why he thought that I was stupid enough to be interested in his book. And after a while I realized that the book is about nothing more than an individual who does not get it, and has to try to explain it to people who do.  This book could have been about some guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time... I really have no clue.    I'm not sure if I was too young to care, or if I just couldn't connect with his experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be not at all enjoyable. This book was way too long, it was not very interesting, it took up too much of the time, and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.   There is some really good information in here, but it was lost in the book due to the length.  The information is good and it was just way too much.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a little too confusing. I've read this book twice now. It took me the first time to realize I was supposed to take my new friend's advice and that I did. I had to reread it a couple of times before I understood what was going on. I'm starting to think it is a story about people who don't want to admit that they are broken and just want to believe that they're still the same person, that they just happen to be broken in a different way. That is a pretty big mistake in itself. I hope they don't give this book a fourth or fifth edition because the author has gotten a lot better. I think that this is the best book she's ever written. This book might be one of the worst book I have ever read. I give this a 2 out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "...the ending is an insult, which makes the novel even worse. As a reader who has only been exposed to fantasy, this is a travesty...The prose is as unadorned as the heroine, and the descriptions of a world where magic is the new normal don't match the descriptions in the book. And when she goes back to the time when magic wasn't so prevalent, the magic still doesn't exist, just as she didn't exist in the times when it was the new norm. The novel's ending also doesn't make sense, as the only characters that have anything resembling a happy ending are her, the man she is after, and her brother who helped her. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because the ending makes absolutely no sense. "

Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a storyteller, I really loved this book, and as a person who is not terribly bright in certain areas (like math and reading), I really wish I had been given the option to have read it in an older grade (I was in 5th grade, and this book was my 3rd or 4th choice for what I'd like to have done in 3rd grade), but when it came time to choose my 3 books, I just got the "what's the worst book I read today" answer I get from everyone I know, and since that answer is always "a book with a main character who is very very annoying," then I had to choose. I was a bit disappointed by the conclusion (although I'm sure it was the last thing on my mind at the time), but this book is a favorite among everyone I've ever heard rave about, so that may be the main reason why.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading the first book in the "Tales of the Fallen" series.  I was really looking forward to this book because I like the books by Mike Mignola but I think this one was a disappointment.   The plot is decent but it was the way it was executed that I don't like.  It felt rushed and I don?t know if it was by design but I feel that it wasn't the best way to handle the story.  The action scenes felt too rushed.  But that isn?t to say that the story was bad.  There were many things that I liked and it felt like they were being executed well.  In the end, this is the first of the Mignolas? "Dark Horse Comics" series, so the pacing can be a little slow but it is still very good.  Overall, a very solid book that I am looking forward for the next volume.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't usually write books reviews, but this book made me want to write one. It's not that I don`t like horror, but in this book, I was turned off from the beginning. The first half of the book was quite dull. The characters didn't change much and the plot felt like something from a school play. When the characters did change, the plot lost all its interest. Then, when the plot became more interesting, it was gone. The last couple of chapters seemed to be a waste of time. The author has an intriguing idea in mind but the execution of the plot is not impressive and leaves a lot to be desired.   I don't think this book will appeal to everyone, and it has a lot of potential. But it's a very sad story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I purchased this book for my son, whom I had just discovered as an 8 year old when the book came out. Since then I have given it to many others, so I'm sure I've been through many reprints. The reason I gave it 4 stars is the same reason I would give it 5 stars in my book world, which is that it is written so well that no one needs a review. The style of the story is just plain fun and it has an end that's not so cheesy like most kid books have in them. The character development is great and I liked the idea of creating one's own destiny. In addition, this is one of those books I'd highly recommend to parents looking to introduce their children to a world full of fun, adventure, and mystery.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As my husband has already pointed out to me, this book is not for me. I would like to go into more detail, but I will just say that it is written in a way that is so pretentious, I found it difficult to even read through. It's written in the style of a lecture by a professor, and there are many parts that are simply not good examples of what the real world actually looks like. The only thing I can give this book a positive review about is the fact that there is a lot of discussion and evidence presented to back up the facts given, even though some of the "facts" are completely wrong.  A bit of fun on Amazon A few interesting comments:
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book that is very poorly written, is boring, has some of the worst dialogue in any of his books, and is filled with a series of predictable characters. If you are looking for a quick read that will keep you entertained for two hours, you have come to the right place. I am currently rereading this book in preparation for my class at the end of June. I would give this a 2/5, but it is my first book and I am not sure if I will get any enjoyment out of this at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I like this book, but it is a bit on the slow side. It's a fun, light read, and the characters are interesting. However, they have such a slow pace. It is one of those books that requires the reader to read it slowly, take his time, and enjoy.   This is the first book in a series about a young boy who goes to live in a very strange world called the "Witches Country". The author has said that it is about "Witchcraft" and the "magic of life", but I haven't really read about that part. The story begins as the little boy is in a hospital for a cold. He learns of his family's fate, as they are all murdered by a witch, who is a member of a mysterious sect that practices "Wizardry".  The boy's family has no memory of him, but they are willing to sacrifice themselves for their son's sake.  He doesn't know how to deal with this and the mystery of the "Magic Country" is just too much for him.  This is one that I would recommend, as the series begins in 2007. It might not seem like much, but when you read all these books in a row, it does build up to something. This is a young adult, fantasy novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a reviewer, I find this kind of writing extremely annoying. When you read a book, you read it as if you were looking in a book catalog. You don't know which pages to skip to get to the ones that interest you, because the book is written in such a way that you're only seeing what you want to see. In other words, you can't take a book apart to see if it's good. What's worse, you feel like you're missing out on the experience of the book when you skip pages and come away disappointed, as if that's what the author was trying to teach you: Don't get lost in the weeds! This is something I've been saying to people who read my books, but I was especially trying to point this out when I was reading this book. I'm also a huge fan of the "book is the most important thing in the world" genre, but this book just seems to make it about the book, rather than the experience. For instance, this is one of the few times I've heard someone compare a book to a hot dog, because that's all it is: a hotdog. You're not experiencing the hotdog; you're not really seeing the process by which that hotdog is made, whether that be by a hot pepper or by a meat bun or any other way. At some point I will have to finish this book because I'm going to end up having to review the other books in this series, but at the time of this writing I have not finished it, and that's just not something I'll be able to do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book. I thought it was written in the tradition of "the old guy" books. It's easy and readable, and I could see this being a great first book. Unfortunately, the author has a tendency to rehash old material and doesn't bother with the most interesting aspect of the story: the characters. The book starts off strong, but soon loses steam. There are a few plot points that are interesting enough, but the writing style and characters just don't work together.   "You know what I call the big three? The great gaffes, the three-dimensional characters, and the three hours or more a day required to keep a man on his feet." "You know," he said, "that's pretty much what I do."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   .  .  This book had some great ideas and did a good job on the whole, but there were problems in the execution. The story starts strong enough with the first few chapters. It's clear that the author is trying to capture something familiar. The first two or three chapters were the best parts of the book. I was drawn in by the world building, and the characters' journey. Unfortunately, by the end of the first third, I was expecting something quite different, something with a twist to the first half and all those character development from the first two chapters, which unfortunately never came about. I know there are a lot of people who will say that I'm a very particular reader, and that they would never like this sort of book, but I didn't care for the world, and I don't understand what was supposed to be exciting about the last third of the story. The writing is a little weak, although the characters were interesting and the world was interesting, so I'll forgive it. The only thing I didn?t like about this book were the ending. I expected a more satisfactory ending and, despite the author's attempt at a happy ending, it was not there. The last pages were so unsatisfying, that I had to reread some pages, thinking that maybe the story was over and my expectations were in vain. However, this is one of the rare examples of an ending that is actually quite satisfying. The ending is actually a sort of happy end, so maybe I don?t care that the characters go on a journey to a faraway place without really knowing why. The book is written for adults, so it's not a perfect book, and it doesn?t come off as a first book. But it is a very entertaining and interesting read, and if you can look past the flaws, you might enjoy the story a lot. I only gave this book 2 stars because of the ending, which I'm not really happy about. There are some things I don?t like and I didn' t like the author in that regard. However I do see why this book would be of interest to people like me, and even though it isn't as good as I was hoping for, it doesn't mean that it can?t be enjoyable. I would recommend this book to people who like adventure and world building with a little bit of romance mixed in, and who are looking for a quick read in an adult fantasy setting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's pretty bad. The main problem is that the story is written for a very small audience. I did get interested, but the main idea of the story was a bit old hat. The world building is pretty bad, and the characters are pretty flat. I don't think I'll ever want to read a book where the main character doesn't get her own back, even if it's in a very ridiculous way, like she gets a new set of boobs.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is in no way an expert, or at least he is not an expert in what he wants to convey to his readers. The author uses his time on the train and at his desk to make his readers think.   If this were a bad movie, you could dismiss it because it's bad. However, because this book is an "expert", it must be excellent. The movie ends with the man (who has not read the book) claiming the book is the best he's ever read, yet doesn't mention anything about the book that wasn't relevant to his argument. It just made him look like a moron.  The last paragraph of the book, where the author makes a plea to his wife to get over her husband's addiction to drugs, is particularly disturbing.  One last thought:  Another reviewer noted the fact that in the book it's possible the husband could be killed by his wife (since she wants him to go to rehab but not because she is suffering from depression). The author could have handled this better by noting that the husband is also in the habit of using drugs (which might lead to him wanting to take his life as well) or that the wife is in the same habit and also suffers from depression. Either way, it makes the ending so much more tragic, and the reason why you'll read the rest of the novel in a heartbeat if it was available in print.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think it's possible to rate books too high or too low because there are always those that seem to go through the motions a little too well and others that don't quite get there and still other books that just never made it. But this book is on the short end of the stick for a number of reasons:

Write a negative review about a bad book:    " The most entertaining thing about this is the idea that he is a human who is also a member of a race of creatures. He can't see what they see, doesn't understand the language they speak. He is more human than the other creatures, but not fully human. He sees life as we do and thinks he is the one who understands their language but not their culture. It all adds up to a great book and I can't wait for his next book. "  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am going to start out by saying that I read the entire book in one sitting (including the preface) and even though it did end up being an entertaining read, I found myself really bored after about halfway through the book. This was in part because there was so much to learn about the universe, but also because the entire story was wrapped up in a way that was too quick and rushed. While I don't necessarily have a problem with fast-paced books, I still think that a few pages can feel a bit long when you're reading them and that sometimes, if you're trying to learn, you can find yourself a bit confused. In this case, I had a hard time really getting my head around what the book was saying, because at times it seems very repetitive to me, and it doesn't seem to make sense at all when you put the two books side by side. And that's saying something because I found the plot of the book to be very confusing and difficult to follow. Now, before I get too much into this, I have to mention the characters in this book. Yes, we have some characters that are annoying, but other than those annoying characters we have...not much to say. I don;t think it's a huge deal, but when you have such a short time to do a story and this is the kind of story that you're telling, you have to come up with a better story than a simple "evil aliens invade earth" kind of plot line. Overall, this is a quick and easy read, but not something that will last me too long. I'm going to give the story a 3/10, and a very, very disappointing ending to the story. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but would give it an overall of 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One problem with my book is that it contains the same old tired material that many books on spirituality contain:  It's pretty boring.   It would have been better if I had written another book about what to do in your life if you want to find happiness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      The narrator is terrible.   This book sounds like a teenager's diary, with a stilted, awkward quality that does not inspire much confidence.  There are just a few words on some of the more interesting characters.  The characters are all really shallow, and the lack of any motivation makes them hard to care about, and makes their interactions with others seem pointless.  This makes the book unenjoyable.  If this was an English book, it would probably be boring but there is no reason for it to be.     Recommendation:    Do not read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A story that is too simple, or too complex. A story with a big idea that is poorly executed.

(This will probably be my last complaint about this book.)

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book. Unfortunately, it left me feeling unfulfilled and disappointed in what I'd read in the synopsis. The only good thing about this book is that it has an interesting plot and a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:       The Good:  - I loved the way the story unfolded - all the characters and places were interesting - it kept me interested in seeing where the book would go - it was a lot of fun - I liked the fact that the characters got a little more developed - I got the feeling that we were supposed to understand their motivation better - the plot is interesting and thought provoking - the author did a good job of using historical facts to give the characters a more solid and realistic back story   I also liked how he created a good atmosphere and style of the book - the artwork and writing were pretty good   - the characters all had their own unique personalities - they were all interesting - I'm not sure what I liked more, the characters or the style - there were quite a few times when I was unsure about what was going on with the characters (it seemed a little forced or random) - the end of the novel was a little hard to get through - I feel like that it was dragging on longer than it needed to be - the narrator seemed to be a bit too dramatic (for my tastes)   Overall:  I really enjoyed this novel, it was unique, and it was an adventure story - this was one of the first books I've read that I enjoyed so much I wanted more - although the main character was a bit underdeveloped, it still kept me hooked and the story was interesting and the characters were a lot more fleshed out than I expected - I think this is a book I'll definitely be revisiting - thanks so much for the great book!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought the story was amazing for a first book in the series. I was also happy with the ending.   However, when I was reading I found I was getting confused at times and the characters were hard to follow.  Some things were very confusing (I got confused and thought that "John" was the author) but I guess it's the nature of fantasy.  I have also seen others say they were confused as well. I think that's what I was, and so I'll admit I got confused for a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I don't know if I'll ever buy another one of those old books from the 70s.   There's something so "old" about them, like a bunch of old photos with faded pictures of a band.  I was hoping this book would be more like a real historical document--as though it were written in 1884, not the year that it was published.  Instead, it is a bunch o' old photos.  There are tons o' other books in the same genre that are better than this one.  But if you are a history buff and really want to learn about the history of the West and the U.S. Army, then this is a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've always loved this series! My favorite was The Lion's Mouth. In fact, I just finished the second book in the series - and it didn't disappoint. I do not know why people have such a hard time finishing books with a twist ending, but I would rather pay more for a book that gives me a happy ending than one that seems to be a waste of my time. And this book had the perfect ending. I felt a bit sad and sadder about the events leading up to it and I really liked the ending. Overall, I think this is a great story and I recommend reading it for a happy and happy ending! Rating: 4.75 stars out of 5

Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... I don't read many books that are more than 100 pages. I do enjoy reading some longer ones, like the latest collection of stories by David Foster Wallace, but I never seem to be able to finish any of them.   I tried to finish The Bone Clocks, but just couldn't get started, until I started reading the story "The Last Question."   This was my last good book, for the time being.  I didn't finish this book, either.  I was hoping for something better than a sad story about an overweight guy who had to quit the Army in order to be happy, so I gave it five stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to read as a way to learn more about an interesting topic: self-improvement. This book was poorly written and not very useful. The first half was pretty much useless. There was not enough information to make me understand why I was doing things differently. I started with one of my weaknesses, and worked my way through to my strengths. As a result, my life seems much better. Not a great book by any means, but better than nothing. I can't give it a negative recommendation because my opinion has been formed on the basis of other books, and this is not one of them. The best way to get this book is to read other people's reviews on the Goodreads site, which is how I found this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife bought it from amazon, but I didn't because I thought it would be a waste of money. We had a similar idea that a book would be "better" if we had just read it, so I went through the first page and threw it away.   But the book is not worth the time, effort and money, because it does not give us a more accurate view of the history of the Jews in Russia. It gives us a version of Russia's Jews which we may not want, but is not one that we need.  You will not find a "true" and fair picture of the Soviet Jewry in this book. It is not only one-sided, but the author does not explain why he wrote the book he did. There is no attempt to look at the causes of this prejudice which was widespread among many Soviet Jews, and there is no consideration of the political conditions at the time.  It is quite simply a book on "Russian Jewry".  This is the reason I do not recommend it: you will not get the "full picture" about the Jewish situation in Russia from this book and it may not help you to understand how to live in a Soviet society and what your responsibility is there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (I love all the bad books and hate all the good ones)   It's the same story, but in a different setting, with more characters. It's funny and sad, and even a bit violent. It does not come close to being a masterpiece, but it is a good read. Read it in a non-chronological order:  Drama + Thriller Towards the end of the book, a detective is called out to a murder that has been committed against someone who has been a friend of his for a long time.   The detective must piece together what happened to the victim and the culprit.    This is the kind of book that I can not put down.  This is a book where the detective is constantly questioning himself, the choices he makes, and his faith in humanity.  It has a few characters that I really liked, but there are a few others that I just didn't care for. I'm not a fan of the main character, but I felt that the other characters made up for this.  If you like a good mystery, but you don't like the main guy, then this is a story for you. A short, one-shot book:  The first half of this short novel is a collection of stories.  The author seems to be working on a book, and a book that is just a collection seems like it will be a good one, but not for me.  What I liked about this short:  It was funny.  There was also some tension and drama in the mix.  I loved the illustrations. I also liked the mystery.  My biggest complaints are the first half and some of the later ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was awful. The characters weren't original and all were generic.     If I ever get the chance to read a book written by a man I would rather be reading than Stephen King then I am in for a treat.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around the concept that there is more to being a mother than the baby being born and then dying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a fan of the genre, I loved this book. However, this book has a number of problems that made me not want to reread it. The first problem was that the character of Sam did not have enough action. He was the best friend of the main character. He had the same job he had in high school, but never had any of the adventures we as the reader know about, like being in the woods or the ocean. He also had a good girlfriend who never had a chance to have sex with him. It seemed to me that there was a lack of sex that was put in the story, because that was not a problem in the real world. Another problem that I have is that the romance was boring and not enough. It was either too brief, or there was no chemistry. At some point, I found myself wishing that I had never started this book because it would have been nice to just get back to the story. At the very least, I hope that the authors can do a sequel so that the story can continue. This was a good book, but if you are a fantasy fan, you should read another.

Write a negative review about a bad book:      "No author could have written a book that contained as much profanity and abuse and stupidity as this one. And no editor could have produced it as well. This book is so poorly written that it is barely worth the effort of going back to read it at all." --C. C.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I can't even read a bad translation, it is a complete failure of the translation as a whole and as a single volume.   It is simply horrible. This is one of those books that I am afraid to use on paper.  I really like this series.  One of the best written, one of the most interesting books I have read in a while. The translation was simply awful.  The only good thing about this book is the short stories which were all in the middle of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A couple of days after I started reading this book I was about half way through, and it took me a little while to put my finger on the problem with this book, the problem is I found myself wanting more. Sure, the characters were well defined and had their own arcs, and the world building was very well done (as I was expecting), but the plot took a long time to pick up. I'm not going to call it a slow start, but I'm still waiting for it to actually pick up on its own momentum. While it was a very well written book, it just didn't have the pace and speed to really pick up the momentum and interest of the reader until much later in the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading this book after seeing the movie, and I'm so glad I did. I was actually looking forward to reading this one because of the positive reviews. The film left me disappointed because it was poorly written and ill paced, but this book is much more enjoyable because of it's originality, and a good story. It's not a long book, it's not long at all.   The story centers around a young man who has a mysterious affliction that makes him forget what is real, but can't remember anything about himself besides his own name, or that he has some mysterious illness that he's in the process of curing. The novel opens with him in a hospital where his parents are being treated, and as his parents try to tell him of his affliction, the boy starts to remember things about himself, and he starts to feel more comfortable in the world.  As I mentioned above, the pacing was slow and the plot was kind of a mess, but I found myself being intrigued by the character's past, and the way the story would unfold over time.  This book is a little dark in nature, and even for a book that is supposed to be about a "fairy tale" it could have been a little more subtle about the events that are occurring around the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had it all: great character development, a really good plot, an original concept, well-written. It was also very confusing and I couldn't figure out how to start it. In my opinion, it would have been a better book if it had a more clear story arc. The ending was too rushed and I'm disappointed that this story is not the second novel in this series.   Overall:  This is a great book. I loved the character development of the main characters, the story, the plot, and the character. The concept was amazing. It had a strong ending which was not too rushed or abrupt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:      I bought this book from a friend to try out, but as soon as I opened it, I could tell she'd already read it. It's a very boring and unremarkable tale.   You know what it is? It's the story of the two children of a dying man and his daughter. The woman is a total whore and the man a total sinner. You know why? Because he never married her and he never had children. The girl is just there to help him get through his time and her brother is a bad guy who is just a little bit too perfect and evil.   I'd really love to see where they go from here, but I really don't think it has a future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read and re-read this book 3 times already.   As a whole, it was a pleasant, entertaining read, but it felt like the characters were only given an occasional spotlight.  The storyline was interesting but never fully developed and I could have easily forgotten about this book. I did enjoy the humor, and the characters.  I really want to like this book but it just doesn't work for me. I feel like the authors could have given their characters more development and just made me feel more like a fan of their series, which I enjoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed in this book. It was a good read but didn't really hit me with any huge revelations that I hadn't already come to expect from James as a writer. That's not really the purpose of a series but it was still cool to learn some things I was unsure of in the previous books. That being said, I would still recommend this book because it is an enjoyable read and it did add a lot of information to my knowledge of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is okay, but it is not for me. I think it is a good book and should have been published as such. My main issue with the book is the story line, the plot, and the character development. I have to admit, I liked the characters, I felt the pain of the author, and I felt a certain kinship with the main character. However, the story doesn't work as a whole, and it doesn't add up, and there is no way I would read it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read "A Man's Life," by Tom Wolfe, over the course of a year, after reading several other Tom Wolfe books. The author has a penchant for long-winded prose. This novel is an attempt at a historical novel but it was so dry I found myself skipping pages over its repetitive nature. Wolfe takes a lot of liberties with the actual facts of history to write a novel and I found some of his ideas ridiculous. I really wish I had read this before I started the book.  I read " A Man's Way " by Tom Wolf before I read any of Wolfe's other books. A Man  A Man, his wife, and their small boy were playing hide-and-seek in a quiet corner of the country, a country of tall pines and rolling hills, a town that was as familiar as their own. His wife was a dutiful, patient, loving woman, a woman who would rather spend time with her husband, her loving husband, than with the many, many men she could meet, but she had been so busy lately, since Tom had come back from Vietnam and taken a job as a civilian construction worker in Fort Lee, that she had not had a chance to rest. "Have you ever seen anything as wonderful as you are about to see?" she had asked him. He had not thought of the answer. "We're going to get into that little clearing, through a tiny hole, and look up through the trees at a small hill up above us. It's not much more than a mound of brush and a few small trees, but as we get closer, I know that we'll see the peak of the hill that separates our little piece of heaven from the rest of the world. And you will know, and I know, that the peak, and everything that we are about, is there for us to be proud of. It is the one thing in this world that we can be really proud of, no matter what we do. And if I am proud of it, what else can I be proud about?" She had been thinking hard about that. He was only 29, and in a little while they would be moving on to another place. He hadn't considered what his future would be, in a place like that. She was so young and he was still working his way through college. They had a lovely house to live in, with a big, good sized yard and a small backyard. He
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this to be a decent book, not a masterpiece. However I have a few gripes:   1. The ending: I love this part where, when he's ready to be released from prison, he's confronted by his mother, who is there to see him off. She asks, "Would you like to be my daughter, or my son?" (in a way that would make her seem very much like an aunt to a teenager). It's a nice, tender moment that leaves me feeling warm, happy, and sad. Sadly, as soon as we realize that he's not actually being released, she says, "I don't even think we'll be seeing you again." This means that he doesn't get to be the person he's always wanted to be, and he knows that. It's sad, but I think it's important to know about the choices you've made before you've died.   2. The relationship between his mother and his father: I really liked this part because it showed how their relationship was before they were married. I mean, the idea of marrying your parents to get out of a bad marriage is weird, but it's also a nice example of the way people in prison were always dealing with their parents, the ones who didn't approve of them being there, and how they were forced to do things that they didn't want to do, and sometimes things they didn the have to do for their kids. The two also had some pretty strong arguments that showed how much they loved each other, and their relationship, even after they were separated by prison walls.   in fact, it's kind of sad that she even says this, because she really has to know that this isn't going to work out, but there's no way she's letting it go.  The rest of the book is pretty much a love triangle between two other women in his life, and also between his mom and his girlfriend. It also gives a couple of other interesting ideas about the importance of family, especially the way that, once they were out of prison, his parents never wanted to talk about him. I like the idea that there's a family dynamic in prison, and that there are a lot of people whose lives are affected by their parents. And that's kind to bring me back to the subject of the books I mentioned above, and to how that family dynamic might have shaped him, and the things he's going through. I

Write a negative review about a bad book:    To write a review that's a total rip-off, just write a positive review for the other book in the series. To write the same rip-offs that I did, go to Amazon.com and pick a book from the series you enjoy. Look for the "I read the other books so I could write the review" review on the reviews section. It will say something like "If you don't like this, don't buy the other one." And even better, the book you like the best will have a glowing 5-star review from one of the main characters.   I'm sure you're still reading this review because you like me, so...   What's next?   And finally, a question:  How long did it take for the author to write a novel after he wrote a series? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was a student, this was the first book I ever read and I loved it.   The author is a gifted writer and I have been waiting to read more about her.  She knows her subjects and is a fantastic and honest teacher.  The only thing I can say is that this book is not as good as The Power Broker.  Also,  this is a lot of pages of characters that will not be named in a later book, and it is quite a good length. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was reading this book, I did have to pause it several times to put down a hand to my mouth to stop myself from giggling. I just couldn't believe how many things they were saying about God and everything that he does or is. It is so bizarre and unbelievable.   I love how the authors never really try to tell you why they believe this so far off into the future. They just tell you "here is how we do it."   And that's really the only way to do it. I also had a lot of problems with the book because I had to read a lot to get through it.  The problem is that this book is written by people who have an almost cult following.  It's just a weirdly specific cult. I have noticed this with several other books about UFO's and aliens recently.  They are written in a specific way. They tell their readers, "see something that you think is alien?" "see an alien?", "see how weird and cool this aliens is!" And people say, "I sure don't see any aliens." So they tell them what they need to see.  And they say, in the process of telling them what to see, they make things seem so mundane and simple. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The Story of a New Planet. By Charles Stross. 4 stars.   From my review:  This book is the book I was looking for. It is a book that is just the right balance of science fiction and social critique.  Stross has given us a fantastic, funny, and thought provoking story about life on Mars.  He has the ability to weave together a narrative that manages to both convey an interesting and entertaining look at the future, while also giving an interesting glimpse at what our society could be like in the year 2000.  As Stross suggests in his preface to the book, the main character of this story has the most compelling and most realistic version of humanity in the entire book.  This is because the story takes place after a major technological breakthrough by our alien species.  The alien race has solved a problem that has plagued humanity for most of human history.  However, unlike our species, the aliens do not understand or appreciate the beauty of our planet.  Instead, they view the surface as a monotonous, dead space devoid of life.  They go about their lives as if we were merely a minor inconvenience.  We are only mentioned in passing to justify the author's choice of setting, but the rest of the book takes place on Mars where the aliens are more comfortable. The aliens live in the lower reaches of the atmosphere and are constantly being bombarded by meteors and rocks that are created by our planet's gravitational pull.  Because of the lack of atmosphere, the rocks that make up the Martian landscape are very brittle and are very easy to break.  One day, a team of astronauts lands on Mars and discovers that the atmosphere has been replaced with a thick layer of dust.  Once again, a strange species comes to the fore. This time it is a race that is less interested in science and more interested in having power.  It is an interesting twist, because the authors claims that this is actually their idea.  While I was still reading, I found myself thinking that they were probably right about that. I would like to add that this book is very well written. It was fun and very well done.  I highly recommend it!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm glad to see that she got some of the things right:  She gets the social and moral dynamics of medieval society, but at a terrible cost for the characters.  A few of them are good guys, but you can tell their hearts are somewhere else.   And finally, here are a couple of quotes from one of the books I'd like to reread:  I do not like to be in the presence of people who look back on the past as though it were a fine and glorious period in time.  To be honest, I am a bit of a pessimist.  It's one thing to hate the past and another to make fun of it.  I am an old-fashioned romantic, and it never bothered me much that everyone I knew had the same romantic attitudes.    The problem was that I was the only one who had them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not thrilled by this book.   It didn't help that the narrator was very forgetful, and her speech patterns were extremely poor.  The story was a bit predictable and the plot was a little rushed.  It seems as if the author wanted to be remembered as a writer of crime fiction.  Also, the sex scenes were just too much, the worst sex scenes in a while.  There were also a few spelling and grammar errors.  So, I think I'll give it a 2 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My parents took me to a bookstore on my 10th birthday to buy a book I had never read. The salesperson handed me the book and asked me if I wanted to continue.   I looked at the cover.  "This is just an empty shell of a book," I thought.  I felt uneasy about spending money on something I had already read.  The next day, as I was waiting for my mother to finish her dinner, I saw a movie that reminded me of the book.  Then I found the book in a book store.  A book that's so boring, I didn't want to buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm still trying to understand what all the hype is about this book, though it's not that much of a mystery. I was expecting something a bit more than the first three volumes of the series. There's just not enough here to keep my attention. I'm going to give this book two stars because it has its moments, the most memorable of which are the scene where the two heroes meet a character who is the embodiment of the "heroes" of the book, and an action scene involving the heroine that was one of my favorites in a fantasy book. But for the most part this is just a dull fantasy story that I didn't enjoy, even if I did like the heroine, who is a strong female character.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - - I hate this book. It's full of bad grammar, and bad English, and a lot of boring crap in the middle. The author gets so worked up about a simple mistake, I'm not even going to try to translate it because I don't even know what that is supposed to mean. In any case, there are some good things, but this isn't one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a total disappointment. It was not what I wanted out of a vampire novel. First off, it was very rushed. There were a lot of confusing scenes that I felt had little to do with the plot. Secondly, it felt a little too "weird" in the way the characters were written. The main vampire, Dr. Carver, was very bland and forgettable. As for the secondary characters, I found it a bit odd that the vampires who were part of the novel were just part of a fantasy story with the same "magic" that we had seen in The Chronicles of Narnia and Harry Potter. The ending was pretty weak and, frankly, a little confusing. The narrator's voice seemed to suggest that vampires would be able to turn human beings into vampires and it kind of contradicted the whole premise. So I guess it was pretty disappointing. And, it wasn't all bad. I was really glad to see the return of Carver to a normal life after his adventures in the past. Overall, I just couldn't get into the story and didn't finish it.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are many books that are better than this one, but I would not recommend this book.   The best thing that could be said about this book is that it is not about anything but a guy whose only other way to feel validated in his life is to get on his laptop and play a computer game with an alien.  This is why this book has only two stars.  I cannot think of any of the things that the book did better than its two other books in the series.  The most important thing the book does is give us a character who is totally unlikeable.  He is a selfish and mean person who hates his father because he was an alcoholic and didn't help him out much.  So he wants to go to space to get away from him, but his only other option is to meet a woman who is a bit like a daughter to him.  As far as character development goes, this guy didn't have much. I'm not sure if there is enough of an opportunity for his story to expand further in any direction that would help the rest of the series as a whole, but he certainly did not add anything to the plot that did not already exist.  His name is also an anagram of "soulless", which has never been a good thing.  At one point in this book, the aliens who are visiting Earth ask for a human male child for a study that the aliens are conducting.  If you have a man who is this selfish and cold-hearted and doesn't want anything to do with anything, then you will see the character he is trying to be as a character develop.  It also is worth mentioning that this man never really develops.  All we learn about this guy is what his mother told us he was like, and nothing about his life with his father.  There is nothing wrong with not having a lot of detail about a character's life, but when you do have enough to get a good idea, the reader doesn't need to know how their life was like every day to understand their character. The best part about this novel is that I don't think the book was written in English.  No one I know of has ever even heard of this book in English before, so I would hope that the people who reviewed this in English would understand that this book isn't about how aliens are supposed to be like, but about how these two guys are like. I have to say
Write a negative review about a bad book:   So the story is about a group of soldiers who must travel from one city to the next to fight off the Japanese. They fight and they fight and then they fight some more. This book does have a bit of an epic feel, but this does not make for a very interesting story.   "I thought the first book would be better" :    I liked the first two books more than this one, but the third book doesn't do much for me. The characters are all really shallow, but it's easy to read them off as characters because of their similarities. There is a little bit of back story on how one man was sent back to his homeland to try to warn people about a potential war between the United States and Japan. I didn't really care for his story, but that was the least of the problems with the book. My biggest problem with the story was the beginning. While I thought this first book might have been better, I didn a bit too easy and didn't give it the depth it needed. I'm going to re-read the first couple of books and see if I can find the depth in these. I think I could if I read them again and pay more attention to the beginning, but not as easily as I could when I read this one.  I think the most exciting thing about this series is that the author has created something new with every book. I have no idea what they're going to do next. I am interested to see what comes next, but at this point, I'm kind of waiting.    The next installment in the series is called "Catch and Release."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has an interesting plot, but a terrible ending. I found it frustrating that the story was basically over so quickly. It was a waste of time to have to read that first book to get the gist of the whole series.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to buy this book from Goodreads. I have tried a number of books on this site and this was my first recommendation from a reviewer I respect. I was so very excited to get this book and have it in my hands, but I was disappointed in it.   First, the formatting was poor. The formatting was not that much of an issue for me, but the book has not been proofed and it is very rough in places. There were a few instances of illegible text or mistakes, and the author was very sloppy with his or her writing. I am not going to go into specifics, but it is definitely rough to read the text. I do not know if it was proofed or not, but if not, it was not professional writing.   the second problem is the cover. I love the cover art and I have seen the cover and I think it is awesome, but here in the book there is no cover. It is just a white box on a black background with the author's name in the middle. It should have been a better cover. The third problem is that the book itself is not a good read. I read this with the Kindle app on my phone, which is my preferred way of reading books for this site. The book is very wordy and the story does not flow well. I felt that the author did not take advantage of the page space in the format that they chose. I feel like I read more text than it is fair, and this is a problem for a book that is supposed to be for a younger audience. It seems that this is why people recommend the book for younger readers, but for my 17 year old self this book did not do justice to the storyline.   And then the fourth problem is when I had to stop reading, I couldn't help but be reminded of the "Mysteries" series by Robin Hobb. I know this book will have very young kids in it, so maybe that is the reason why I loved this book so much. I wish that this book would have been more focused and shorter than it was. There are chapters that are not much more than three pages in length that have very little content. They were just a little too long for me and I felt I was being spoon fed the content. I don't like getting bored of a book, but there is nothing here to keep you entertained for more than a few minutes.   The story has some interesting
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not finished this book. But I am afraid to recommend it. It is very bad. It doesn't make sense. The pacing is very slow. It starts with the main character being very clever. Then the author shows his "bad" side, by having him get his teeth knocked out by a lion. I'm sure they have been done to death by writers who have not read the book. This one is even worse. The book is about an English major who has been to India, and is now back, and he is in love with a girl and is trying to get her to marry him. It's not until the end of the book that he realizes he's a complete idiot and is not qualified to be her "guardian" for life. The main character is constantly doing things to get the girl to marry and fall in love, and then after getting what he wanted, he realizes that he never really wanted what he got and is really a loser. And then, of course, the book ends with the stupid ending. I have seen a lot worse than this one, but this one really took the cake for me. It will not teach you anything new or enlighten you, but it is just a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book. It is very uneven in its presentation, and as a result of that, the book reads much better than it has any right to. As a standalone it is a solid read, but it's much better as part of a series.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book back in 2007, but it didn't stick with me until about three years later.   There are three reasons: 1. There were just way too many plot holes; i.e. you could not see it coming.  2. It was a little repetitive;   If you read this back then, you knew exactly what he was going to do, and what the end result was.  3. It wasn't well-written at all;  I don't think this is just an English book written in a strange way; I think there is an underlying philosophy behind what he is trying to do with this book.  Now, after three years, I still cannot quite put my finger on what the author is trying so hard to accomplish.  There is no way I'm going to review this again, because I don  You've heard of him - the old man who made the Great Gatsby. Now, I want to tell you about another man who had a similar life, but ended in a very different way. The story I am going to tell about this man has not been told before and I do not know the author - all I know is that he was a writer from the 1950s, a guy named Robert Penn Warren, and that he made a huge amount of money in the process. It is a story about a man who lived in New York City in the 60s and made some incredible money in a short time, a man with the potential to become one of the greatest writers in the world and an incredible number of women falling for him. In the 1970s, his work was so great that he got very famous very fast, a legend in his own mind and to his wife, who was by his side. This man was John Grisham. I have not read all the books by him, but I believe there is only one novel I haven't read by him. So, now you know how I felt about the man and how I feel about this novel. The main character in this novel is John Griswold Grishman, but the man you will meet in the story is John G. Grish. Giswald Grish was a wealthy businessman who bought an old house and built it into a mansion. But, before that he built a small mansion in his mother's backyard. He is a man of many talents. He speaks ten languages and was once a jazz saxophon

Write a negative review about a bad book:    If this book was made up of the best stories you've ever read, this would be one of the top ten best books of all time.   This book would be perfect for all people who like fantasy books, but don't want to spend the time in the gym to build some muscle or learn some new technique.    The only real flaw I found in the book is that it doesn't focus entirely on the action aspect of the fight scene.  When the story goes into the actual fighting sequence, it's a good read.  However, this book isn't a story about the fight scenes. It's a story of a group of people working together to overcome great obstacles and make a huge difference to their community, or in this case, to a world.  It's about people who have some great skills and a passion for what they do, but they also need a strong, supportive partner to be able to keep going and succeed.  I can understand a person getting tired and having to take a break.  But for the main characters, it was more like, 'Oh man, I got to get back to work. I'm gonna take a nap or something. 'That kind of breaks the tension and the intensity of the story.  There are a few instances that come across as cheesy, like when one of them mentions that 'the world needs heroes, but it doesn''t know who they are yet', but there are also very funny and insightful moments.  In the end, I don't feel like I was disappointed by the ending, though.  The book also has a lot of action sequences and they're very well executed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some good points, but the author has to oversell the positives (or "the" positives) so it sounds good on the back of the book. I did like her voice and her story, but I thought the ending was somewhat anticlimactic.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book. I mean, the main character is a girl in a wheelchair and I like it! It's so rare, actually, for a book with this premise to be compelling. What happens to the characters? What happens in their lives? I like the idea that there's a sort of'rebellion' in the book that is going on. But there's nothing about it that I liked. The characters are too shallow. The world building is too simple. The story is way too simple, even when it involves a wheelchair. I don't feel like I've actually come into contact with the characters in this story, but rather the plot has drawn me in through a little-known sci-fi series of books.   Also, I feel like the writing style is just very... monotonous. It takes a lot of effort to read the entire thing, and to be honest, I wouldn't have been able to do that. I think the first thing that has happened is that the story seems to be all about the main characters. And then, the second thing is that nothing seems to happen in the story for about two-thirds of it. And I have to wonder, when you're trying to read a book about a girl with a wheelchair who lives in a world of people with no way of knowing where her disability begins or ends and what happens to her (and whether they have any idea), why is the writing so monotonously repetitive and boring? I'm not sure. But at least now I know where I'll start and finish my read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "A beautiful, well-written, and beautifully written story." - Laura Anne Gilman, author of The Brazen Serpent and The Way Back and a past winner of the American Library Association's Children's Book Award  I am very sorry that I didn't feel like I was making any progress with this book. I got hooked the first sentence when I came across a sentence that read, "I knew that if I was born with a dark shadow I'd grow out of it, but I didn'  The Great Stag - an Irish tradition with roots in the pagan religions of Ireland and Scandinavia. The story is about a young man who sets out to return his family's stag, a very rare trophy among all the deer that his family has left.  After finding the stag, the young man goes on a quest across Ireland, France, England, Scotland, Wales, and across the English Channel. Along the way, he learns the true meaning of the ancient Irish pagan festivals, meets a new family of Irish friends, and learns of the Celtic culture's traditions.  a story in which a man's obsession with the stags of his family, and a desire to reclaim the stag of his heritage, becomes a major cause for conflict between different groups of people in Ireland, with tragic consequences. ...  It was a very good read. It was an easy read that didn't get too complicated. My only complaints about the book are that the beginning of the book was a little boring and that I would have liked more detail on the world that he travels to. It feels like an epilogue to a story that's already written. I am glad that I was able to finish this book because it was a great read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't remember the last time I read a book by an author I liked. I have enjoyed a few of them over the years, but the author has been nothing but an embarrassment to the craft. The books are so predictable that the reader has little to no choice but to read the same thing over and over. The authors name is so obvious as to not give away the author's true identity, so why bother? The book is full of boring character building, the characters are bland, bland characters.   I really hoped this was a sequel to some of her other novels. Not only does this one disappoint, it is a waste of time, if you can even call it that. I was ready to give up on her as an author, but now I am starting to feel like she may be a bit better than I have heard.   "  This book is not even worth trying to be anything more than a bad reading experience, just a bad, boring, unimaginative and dull one.    The characters do not change in any significant way in this book, they just keep being the same characters who have been doing the same things.      If you like predictable characters then this book is a perfect choice.  But if you don't like predictable and boring characters then I don't think you will enjoy this book.     "  What I Liked:  The main character was a bit dull, but then again so was the reader. I wasn't really thrilled with the ending and the main character got a bit tacked on with her final scene. This could have been easily solved with a little more time given to her storyline. Also, I really liked the description of the city. "    "   The writing was really bad.   The writing was so bad that I couldn't put the book down for a whole two hours. I could feel myself starting to write reviews all over the blog and that gave me pause. The characters were just so boring to follow.  It was like the characters were in a book about their lives in a city in the middle of nowhere and they just kept getting in the way, and writing on their way to their destiny. This book has everything to do with an ordinary middle class family trying to survive through their life in a bad neighborhood of an industrial city.  I didn't think this would have been a success. The book should
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story in this book is completely one-sided. Most of the characters are either supporting characters or villains, and when there's a lot of action, you're going to find yourself cheering for the bad guys.   It's a nice little book with some cute illustrations, but nothing really stands out or stands out in a good way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very hard read.  The story is poorly developed and doesn't provide enough to make the characters or setting believable.   I believe that the author is attempting to do "soft science fiction" which doesn't necessarily mean that it's not hard science fiction.  It is true that the scientific concepts used here are somewhat derivative of scientific concepts of the early 1900's but that shouldn't give the author much reason to use them.  And yet, they use them anyway.  This story doesn't even begin to explore the science in a way that would be worthwhile to the reader.  Instead, it wastes time on non-science nonsense and then it ends with an unrealistic and unearned conclusion.  Overall, it's a very disjointed and dull story that just doesn't work for me.  What about it is good: + Good character development (the author does a good job of showing why the characters are the way they are) + The world is interesting and well detailed - The story starts to diverge from the scientific premise (which, considering how many other parts it diverges from, isn't surprising at all) - Character development isn't as good as I'd like it to be.  I really don't think the author gave the characters enough time to develop and it does feel like the author was trying too hard to make things exciting.    I think that the characters aren't developed enough so it makes me feel a bit frustrated when the story moves from one plot point to the next.  What I mean by that is that characters often have very predictable and one dimensional personalities. The only thing that I do like is that the protagonist's parents are scientists (as mentioned in the summary),  and they are extremely well developed and are extremely interesting characters.  For the first half of the book I really felt sorry for them but then I realized that I was being nice, because it's very difficult to be sympathetic to these characters when they are so completely ridiculous.  As mentioned above, their relationship is a bit strange but then, what kind of relationship isn't?  However, the author does manage to make it funny and engaging and it is one of the few things in this book that I actually enjoyed reading.  Another thing I did like about this book was that it provided a nice balance between the very scientific nature of the story and the more humorous side of things.  One of my favorite things about this
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a very bad book. There is a lot of crap in this book and the ending of this book is a rip-off of the ending in my very good book The World Without Us. It is about a scientist who has spent a lot less time on his research and more time on making his wife happy. I wish this book had more of a plot, and less of a book club that's a bad sequel to a good book. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a book called The Devil's Dilemma by Paul Craig Roberts and then read it again.   The first time I read it, I thought the author was nuts.  He talked like a right-wing, anti-government, anti-"globalism", conspiracy theorist.  Now, I read the second time and I have to say that I don't think that Roberts is a nut.  His writing is clear and he's not a conspiracy theorist but a realist.  There's a lot of evidence to back this up but it all comes down to the question of just what's good for the people.  If people are well-educated and middle-class, if they have a job, and can afford to pay for their own food, they can get a decent education.  It's only when they start to go into debt that we get the problems.  The people who aren't well educated and don't have jobs are the ones who don't get the opportunity to get the best education. The problem is that this opportunity is not widely distributed, not equally distributed, and most of the people who have this opportunity don't start getting it until they're 30-35 years old.  This is a problem that Roberts wants to correct with his book.  I don t think that all the poor people of the world are stupid.  But, I do think that a lot (perhaps most) of the poor of the developed world aren't being taught the basics that we need to have for them to have a better chance at a prosperous future.  As I've mentioned before, the reason that I became a libertarian was because I felt that I had failed to teach myself how to read, to read effectively, to understand how to reason logically.  When I started paying attention to the issues (as opposed to just blindly believing in whatever happened to be trendy at the moment), I was forced to recognize that I didn't know where the middle was. I realized that I needed to read a lot more.  In the end, I think that being able to read is an important part of a well-rounded education and that this is the way that education should be done.  One of the big misconceptions about libertarians is that we think that we can teach the people better than the government.  Libertarians aren't against the government getting involved in education.   The problem with this argument, however, is that when libertarians say that the government should get involved
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The badness of this book is so profound, that the best I could do is give it a 4/10. I read this with my son in the backseat of the car while the other kids were out for a ride and had to read it on our own. While I can't be the only person who's had this experience, I'd venture that it's a common one, which is why I am writing this review. We left our house with this book and decided to walk down to the park to pick it up. We came across a homeless man sitting on the grass. While he was reading the book I looked around and saw a few other people at the park. So I asked him if he'd be willing to read a book. I was surprised when he said he'd love to. That's about the only thing that makes sense. This guy was reading a book, and while it was really cool to sit down next to him and read to him, I never got to finish it. The words he was saying in the book were too far removed from reality to be believable. I couldn't feel his mind while reading it, his eyes seemed to glaze over and he seemed distracted all the time. I really thought that he was having a bad day and was reading for company to get back in focus. In reality, I would've been just as lost in my own head without this guy being there. I'd give this a 1/10 because I was expecting so much more from this book, but I don't think I'll be getting this book again.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    You'd expect that from a book about a book, but you'll really feel it from this one.   This is a series with a lot of promise and it's clear that the author has put quite a bit of work into making this series come alive, but there's really not a whole lot there.  I was hoping for more from the first book and while the characters and world did get better, the plot and characters are still very much in question.  At least it doesn't seem like the books are going to be completely repetitive for very long.  It's a bit confusing at times and is far from being a good read, but a good first book in this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   1.   The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world.  The protagonist is not the hero, or is not yet even an individual, but is more like an object: an amalgam of many individual characters who are somehow related to him through a mysterious connection, which gives him his identity, but also makes him almost a part of the apocalypse as the only survivor.  2.  There are numerous errors.  In some pages, the author describes the character as living in an open area, when he should be living in a town.  A large number of places in the book are never described and only described as being in a certain location.  For example, the book talks about a village being destroyed by the apocalypse, but the only thing described is the ruins of a few houses (with people's names written all over them).  There is only one person who is a hunter, a man who hunts a monster he calls "The Destroyer" who he believes is responsible for the apocalypse.  3.  This is not an epic, which is something it should be.  It's more like a survival thriller, which seems to have been written by a man in his twenties, in a very unambitious way (even though he writes in a literary style which could probably have been better, but even in that, it's not very original, and it lacks a certain intensity). 4.  Even if the protagonist's father were alive, he probably wouldn't believe in such a bad story.  And even if he would, he would still be skeptical of it (though not because the author doesn't give a convincing description of the "destroyed" world). 5.  What makes the book even more unbelievable is that the protagonist starts the story in a village which has all the facilities to survive a nuclear war, and goes on to become a hunter who hunts "the Destroyer" and manages to kill it...which is a creature which appears to be a giant bug-like alien (of which it can have an army of thousands) that comes to Earth, destroys the civilization and the cities, and then takes control of people by feeding them with this "The Creature" (of whose shape he says it looks like a cross between a giant flying fish and a spider).  6.  How on Earth can the protagonist survive without any medical equipment (other than what he found in the woods) and not get injured or die
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "My favorite character and the best written in this book is a white man who has very little to no agency of his own in the story. I felt very bad for him, because this was the most character development I had ever seen." - Laura H. (Laurie), The A.V. Club I'm writing a review for a book I read over a decade ago. It's the first book in a series, and I remember liking it, but having a hard time getting into it. It was very difficult for me to really get into the book because the plot is so cliche, boring, and cliche-y, but there was also something incredibly fun about this book and the concept of a world-ending war.   I actually enjoyed it even more than the first one because now that I have re-read it, I have a much better understanding of the first.  It's about a world's-ending plague (not a real thing) which was caused by some kind of alien life-form which was infected and spread across the planet through infected humans. But then it turns out that the real problem was the overpopulation of humans which is a problem on a much larger scale than an overpopulated planet.  The book is very simple. In this first book, there's a guy that has a virus that can stop the world's population growth. So, he is put in charge to try to stop overpopulation and the plague. In the first case, he wants to cure the plague by sending everyone back to their original form (he's the guy that sent them back in the first place). It's also at this point that a bunch of people that are not infected (and who were originally infected) go back to be born again. The virus was actually created by a guy who was himself once infected (it only kills humans because of how the virus is engineered), and he was going to take revenge on the people who put him back in. But before he can kill the people responsible for the original infection, the virus also causes everyone that is not infected to go back and die in order to save the entire planet from being infected. So in other words, the disease is so contagious that everyone on Earth goes back to where they were originally from and is reborn. The only way to stop the population growth is to have people go back one more time to be reborn (in order to get more people to be infected so that
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a lot of very good books out there but these are the ones I tend to read the most (especially with the audiobooks). I usually finish one in a day and a half (sometimes even faster) and this is one of those that doesn't even hold my interest for a few chapters (even when I am listening). I read the first 10% of it, then went back to something else, did the same thing and I still have not reached the other 90%. There is no reason to listen to this book unless you have a really good memory.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You don't want to listen to a bunch of lies that are written by people with agendas to push a product. I read this book for the book. It is a good read. But I did not care for it. It has many problems. The narration is terrible. I am not the only one. I will give the author 5 stars only because I bought the book a few months ago. I bought it as a gift for someone and when I started the book I got so angry I decided not to finish it. I feel bad that I took the time to listen because the book was awful.

Paul sets out to convince this small town to join the Church. What he doesn't realize is that Paul has been secretly communicating with a group of aliens that have been living on Earth for centuries. The aliens are now plotting to make Earth a part of the cosmos in their view.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure if this is the same author as the previous "The Golden One" which I rated 4.5 stars to 4 stars  , and I don't have a lot of good things to say about her other works: a) I think the last chapter is the weakest of the whole book    ; b) I'm afraid it was a little misleading as a foreshadowing of the next part, and it may be possible to figure out the whole story   ; c) I am also not a fan of the first part, it's so slow and it just ends in a bit of a confusing way, but overall it's not bad; d) It does end with a cliffhanger which I think is pretty awesome, which I will wait until the other three parts and then maybe read them; and e) I just don't like the "filler" characters, they don't make sense, and the romance doesn't come across in a convincing way at all. The last part, which comes a bit later than the others, is also kind of a chore:  "A good book is a book you keep reading for all of its worth and to never feel like you are wasting your time, and even though I didn't finish this book completely, it is a very good read, if just for me." I really don't understand how this book can get two stars      So for the other two, I'm going to give it 4 stars - not much to write about, but a nice change of pace - and for the final, I guess I'll say 3 stars  : not a bad read, but I have no desire to continue reading it, and would just be happy with this review and move on: if you read the whole thing, it just takes a really long time - so really, I would just avoid it completely  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book but I really had to put it down for a while. The main character is quite annoying. She constantly makes stupid decisions, and is a complete attention-seeker. I would be better off with another book by this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a little worried when I opened this book and it did not have a "summary" which is what the publisher used to advertise it as. It did not seem to have a bibliography or other reference sources. The book itself was not well organized, the "author" had to put some things in "order" and other things he put down in a bit of a rush. However, there is much to be learned from this book for anyone looking for information on the subject. The problem with this book is that they seem to want to give away too much of the information, it is very long and many of the details are not that interesting, for example, the dates of the battles of Shiloh and Gettysburg, there are not enough details about the battles to really make it worthwhile, the actual maps are not too clear or accurate and it is difficult to find where the battles actually took place.   This book is not very interesting, it does not tell the true history and is an example of "my way or the highway" type of writing. I would only recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to write a good "history book" or if they have a copy of the Civil War, it might be good to read it in that format as there are a few tidbits that may be a bit too specific to be helpful to a modern reader, but I found the historical details and maps to be interesting. Recommended to those interested in history or Civil War books.

Write a negative review about a bad book:     (This is a personal review)   "Why don't you get off my lawn?" - Myself.   You should just be a good neighbor and not interfere with me when I'm trying to do my job.  - I bought this book for a project in college and I didn't enjoy it at all.   the story follows the protagonist a middle aged man who moves from NYC to the country to be closer to his parents. He finds a place in the community and feels that he makes a good friend in the village farmer.  I had really high hopes for this book, but sadly, it failed to live up to my expectations. First, the characters are all stereotypes (in this case white, working class). You feel like they are trying so hard to be likable that you're expecting them to be. Second, the story is pretty cliche. The town has a problem with drugs, they need to get the drug dealers out of the community but it's a lot easier said than done. And that was the biggest downfall of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It took me a few days to get this book to start but once I started it, it took me to the next page. The narration was so well done it made me feel as if the book was written by a well-informed author. I really thought that this book was going to have a very high impact on me, but the end of the book just made me bored and disappointed.   I recommend this book. It is a good one, but it could have been better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't know how to use a book, the best thing you can do is not read it. There are so many books to choose from! My favorite authors are:  I have a strong desire to read more and more. And while I am not a fan of most of the genre fiction, I love to read about historical events, science fiction, and fantasy. I love that I can pick and choose from so many options. If I read another book about a particular genre, I will certainly be reading more about that.  My only regret is that I don't have as much time as I want to read the entire books of a series or more of a new author.  I find that I need to read multiple books on a topic to fully understand it.   My biggest complaint is that there is often a lull in the book that feels like a dead moment. It isn't the fault of the book per se, but my brain has a tendency to run out of focus between events.  In particular, if I am reading the book through at home, I get bored with it right away. But if I leave the house and travel to a new area, I can find the same stories but with a different flavor that is really exciting.  And I love reading non-fiction.  If I ever decide to get a college degree, I want one that will include a specialization in a certain discipline. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe that there is this much negative reaction to this book. The book is a fairly straightforward story about a man in the early 1800's who finds himself in love with a woman who is, quite literally, half naked and covered in the very same thing she has been wearing for most of her life. At least half of the criticism comes from people who aren't aware that naked women have been in the history books before (and who would be shocked if they knew about this particular type of woman-the half-naked woman). I have a lot of sympathy for this author because he's been told this is a common trope in history books, but I can see why others are confused. This is also not the first time we've heard about this trope. I could read a book about a woman in a similar situation and be fairly happy with that, as it doesn't really change things much for me. This also isn't the first book I've read in which the female characters are depicted this way, either. A particularly famous example is The Great Passage, a collection of letters between a woman and her lover (who happens to be a man) written in 1794. The reader doesn't know the woman's real sex until the end of the book, because she is only referred to as "he" throughout the book. It's possible that someone with a different sex-role perspective would have found this portrayal of her to be less disturbing. However, as an author, I'm glad that this book was written, because it has helped me understand the issues that are raised when books try to tackle these kinds of issues (and hopefully it has also influenced people who will read it for other reasons). I hope the other books in the series will help with a little more understanding.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - - - This book is so short that I had to keep turning the pages just so I wouldn't miss any of it. This book should have been an hour long. If I had a penny for every time I read something in the title of this book, I would have a fortune.   A friend of mine pointed me to this book (I think it was a review of a previous book) and said: "A reader should make the effort to actually read this book." I did and I think she was right. This is a very small book, but it is very important.  I have only read a couple of books by William Dalrymple but these two I have read have been quite special for me. The first book was the classic "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy and the second was "The Song of Solomon." I think the two books share something in common: they are both about a small, very close-knit group of people who discover that they have been used by a larger, powerful group.  The book in question, in my opinion, is "The Devil's Highway." It has been my favorite book of his I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is a little thin.   It also feels a little bit like a parody.  A lot of the dialog, while funny at first, gets old really fast.  I would recommend this book as an enjoyable read, but it probably won't make you laugh all the way through.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to read this book because it seemed so different from the books I normally read. The cover art showed a young man who has recently been kicked out of his family. The title seemed to imply that the story revolves around him and his love affair with a woman from his childhood home. The book is, for the most part, a dark and disturbing story. A man named "Mr. R" is the primary narrator. The rest of the people in the book are his "other children" and siblings. We are told that the mother and father were in an abusive relationship for most of the child's life. The mother was unable to love and cared more about her husband's career and wealth than her son's welfare. The father died a few years before this novel. Mr. R is just beginning to become aware that his brother and sister have an incestuous relationship. He is concerned that his parents may know something about his sister's love life. I didn't really think about this aspect at the time, but when I think about it now, it's not something that could have been taken lightly by the author. A few things that I did enjoy were the fact that the book was about Mr.R's brother, who was in prison and the way that his mother was treated at her husband. There was also a lot of violence and sex, but it was well written and the sex was hot. I'm not sure if I liked it enough to keep reading, but I definitely enjoyed reading about it. It was one of those books that you wish was a movie instead of a book. There is no way the book could have ended well without a bloody, ugly death for Mr. and Mrs. R.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the worst thing I've ever bought.   I purchased this as a gift for my husband who was trying to get into fantasy.  I read through the first three books in the series, and the only thing I remember was reading the story in the beginning of this book, and thinking "WTF, this is a crappy book".   My husband bought the paperback copy from Amazon because it was the cheapest one he could find.  To me, he bought this book thinking it was a good book and I was the reason for the bad review.  As a reader, I was thoroughly disappointed.

There are very few books, including my own novels, that I have hated as much as  The God Who Wasn't There.   My copy was signed and had some dust on it, so I'm assuming it's from the early 90's, but I just couldn't get into it.  My main problem with the book is that I feel like I never made any sense out of it. This is probably because it was written by an atheist who just didn't feel the need to explain the reasons behind the religious teachings he used.  For a book written by a self-professed religious man,  The Man Who Was Not There  is so preachy and pompous that it just doesn't have any charm to it. It's like the guy who just left church said, "Alright, I'm a former church member, and I know a lot about what was going on there, but let's just throw in all the boring stuff about how Jesus loved us, and that he died for our sins. This way we don't have to get too worked up about it."  I'm sorry, but it's not a great look.  If I was going to get a copy of this book, I would have to send it back, because I just don't think that the Christian point of view can be accurately portrayed in a non-theological narrative.  I understand that this book is meant to be an allegory, but the way that it's portrayed in this way makes me think that maybe this is not the book's intended message.   It would be really cool to see some kind of Christian perspective portrayed in  The Devil's Mirror  or a similar book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    To me it is clear that the author is not an expert in the field. He gives too much credit to the "author's" experience in the discipline as a starting point for their argument. He writes about things that are not in dispute: a single author is given credit for the discovery of a system of the physical sciences that works well; a single scientist is given praise for solving a mystery in an age of competing theories and hypotheses. He never mentions that it wasn't an "author", but a student or colleague in the 1950s; that Einstein and Bohr were not authors; that the question of a theory of gravity is still unresolved. The reader is left to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the conclusion in the book was supported by scientific evidence. If you buy a book to learn about Newtonian mechanics and it's authorship, you are probably better off with Newtonian Mechanics. If, on the other hand, you buy the book because you think the physics community is awash in bad faith, the title is misleading. For more, read the review by David Hogg. The author is correct, in that the book is in some ways a textbook of a controversial issue. It is not a bad read, and many of the problems in the science and mathematics of gravitational wave detection are dealt with in the chapters. I think the chapter on waveguide theory is particularly interesting, though it is still too short. It starts with the argument that the authors use, that there is an "artificial" waveguide that they think is the best possible description of the waveguide phenomenon (though I don't think this is true; the waveguides I am familiar with are too poor to be described using the term "artificially"). The authors take a simple example of a light wave traveling through a narrow slit, then say the result is that the wave is "trapped". I can't figure out why this should be an argument for anything but "no". The reason for the "artifice" is given, but the authors simply make it appear as if that were the only issue. The rest of the chapter is devoted to describing the wavepacket problem, which is exactly the same as the waveguided problem described in the previous chapter, except that it was addressed by an author using an approach that was a lot more simple. The authors seem to have been under the impression that the problem is really an issue about whether the theory is useful in the

Write a negative review about a bad book:    - It's got a good story with a bad end. The story was interesting enough to keep me reading through it all. But it's not much better than the first book.    Review of: The Riddle Master's Apprentice by Michael A. Stackpole (Kindle Edition) The book is written in first person by a "newer" character who is an apprentice to "a much older master". The apprentice is an intelligent, witty, funny character. He is very talented but unfortunately doesn't have a lot of experience in magic. He has an uncanny ability to learn magic, but has no knowledge on what the "rules" are or why he is needed. He does have a magical talent, which is quite impressive. Unfortunately, the book ends without him ever learning how to fully use his magical talents, so he is no better than a beginner. The book starts with an interesting premise. The apprentice must become a master to help his master and his business succeed. There is a lot to learn, but as the book goes on the apprentice is given less and less of an opportunity to learn it. The first three books were about trying to get the apprentice to learn and the last three are about trying get the wizard to learn. The ending of the last book is pretty disappointing because he only gets hints of how to get better, not a step by step process. The wizard should be able to be good with or without a master's tutelage. The character doesn't seem to be very well developed, either. He seems to be a good character, but just not quite enough to make him worth reading.  Weeks: 4/5
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a world where women are still perceived as weaker and inferior, the main character is a strong, capable woman who has to deal with men who treat her as if she's less than. What the heck. I'm a strong woman. That doesn't mean I can't take a punch.  This is not a book I would recommend to anyone. "This is another one that I thought was interesting. What are some of the things that the men do to the women in the book? The main character's husband beats her, and his wife doesn't do much to stop it." This is what I don't get about "noisy feminist" books.   "I've enjoyed a good number of books by women who are good at what they do: they're good at fighting and solving problems. This book wasn't like that, it was like someone else's problem."    It's hard for me to imagine a problem with the main female character that the male characters did not solve.  "Noisy feminist author has not solved her problem, in fact, she has worsened it with one very predictable and unsatisfying solution."  If there is a solution to the problem of domestic violence, why does the main characters have to keep trying to beat each other up? "An interesting story."  I like the book, but the author fails to make the problem interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because of the good reviews here and on Goodreads. I enjoyed it, it's a good read. But it is very bad, with poor pacing, poor writing, awful dialogues, plot holes, and a confusing plot. It's a big disappointment. - October 16, 2011Poor pacing and writing, bad dialogues  Reviewer: M. D. - favorite favorite favorite - January 25, 2011  Subject: Disappointing The good reviews, including a couple of five star reviews, were nice, but the movie was so much better than this book that I can't really imagine anybody else enjoying this book. If you want a good story, check out The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, especially the first book, which has a lot of the humor and style of this book as well. - January 28, 2010Disappointing  Rated 5 out of 5 by krassie01 from Great book!

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part about The Great Hunt is that it's so terrible.    The Great Wolf is, in my opinion, the only bad book in this entire series.  It is so bad that it feels like I was reading a complete waste of time. The characters, the plot, everything was so bad it was amazing to read.  The character development felt so forced and rushed, they were forced to jump from one situation to another, and none of the character were likable.  This book is written like a middle school kid's book, with a twist, the twist being it's about wolves that are human and a war between a wolf tribe and humans. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book based on the review by Stephen King of it and for a couple of pages I was intrigued, and for the rest I was completely turned off. As a matter of fact, I did not finish it. It is so poorly written, I was able to tell the author put his/her ego above the story. So, my main issue with this book is that I did get what the author was trying to achieve, and I am not a fan of poor writing or bad stories. However, if I could do a few things differently I would have. - For a first time reader or someone who's read one of King's books in the past, I would definitely recommend this one. I hope that he continues to write better books. - The story does have a beginning, middle, and end. The ending is so unsatisfying that I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quick read. - It's not a crime mystery. King is trying to be a little bit too dramatic. - I don't really care for this story and I donned my favorite pair of jeans to finish it (I'm too lazy to go out and buy them.)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this is a great book that I had to get. I was super excited to get it and I did read it on the plane from LA to SF.   I think I'm a bit more open-minded than most people are about religion and religion-related topics, so I was looking forward to this book, but it just turned out to be a complete waste of time and effort.  The thing that made me frustrated about this book was how the main character of the book is very self-righteous and preachy in regards to God, Christianity, and the church.  I don't want to say that this book is a bad read for the sake of making a negative comment, but there are a number of topics that are not addressed or addressed in a way that the reader can really learn something about.  At one point she talks about how "if a mother is a good mother, and she's a bad mother, she's just a bad mom."  It really doesn't make any sense when you look at the whole picture of the things that she just said and the logic behind it.  As far as religion is concerned, she completely ignored the fact that there are plenty of good Christians that are very nice people and do a lot of good things, and that if it's something she is really passionate about, she would take a different path.  This is all very nice, and we really are all just trying to do good, but the fact of the matter is that there aren't many Christians out there that are willing to tell their friends that Jesus is the only way to heaven, that everyone should follow God, and any other nonsense.  Even if you were to take these quotes to be factually accurate, it doesn't really matter, because it is what they seem to be.  I'm sure there are millions of good Christian women out there who actually go about their business being nice, giving money to the poor, and helping their community, and they are not being persecuted for not being "the right type of Christian."  This book does nothing for the people of the bible, the people that it's named after, or anyone else that it purports to speak for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You're probably right that this book was a total let down. My main beef is the fact that it was not a complete story.   The main story of the book was about a man that was very ill. He has a son named Michael who is in a wheelchair as well. The father was at his best when he was with Michael.  He could do a lot with the wheelchair.  As a main story I think the author should have not only have had his main character (Michael) in the wheelchair but also have a little bit about the father as well as Michael. It would have been a great main story. Unfortunately the author did not put enough effort into the father.  "Michael doesn't just get up and go. He's stuck in his wheelchair. He gets up and goes to work, but he has to go through the motions. The money he makes in the city is enough to get by, but it isn't enough to buy new chairs." I understand the idea behind the story that the man's life could have been different if he had had new chairs, but his father in the beginning of the story was very much a part of his life as well (at least that's what I read). His relationship with his father was very important to him and he was not as emotionally hurt as many characters were in this book. The author didn't go into enough detail about the family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ...I'm giving this one an A+. I was hoping it would be a bit more than a collection of short stories about a bunch of crazy characters, but it turns out this is a very serious and thoughtful work of speculative fiction that does a good job of building a world that I can imagine being interesting and even unique in the future. Even though the writing isn't perfect and there's a couple of frustrating scenes, this is an incredible collection of stories that should be read by everyone. I highly recommend this book to any reader who likes speculative fiction.  4/5 stars  Read 5/25/2012 Review
Write a negative review about a bad book:    - I was excited to try this because I had heard great things about it from friends (including one who claimed he'd read the book five times, and found it to be a perfect fit for his daily routine).   I have a very unhealthy obsession with reading. I was looking forward to reading this book, not because of the content but because of how the book feels.   Although I loved the story, I felt like the pacing was off and that it was a bit slow in the beginning.  Also, some of the names used to represent characters seemed a little strange.  My overall rating: 4 out of 5 stars (3 for story and 2 for pacing)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The books I have loved most in my life are the ones I've loved least. The ones I would be ashamed to have read."  I love   The Little Sisters of Eluria by Sarah Lotz, because   I love Sarah LotZ! I love her books!   She makes me feel   happy to see a happy ending. I feel  The books   They do. "What a lovely way to go out, to die, and to go on forever!" - a friend, on a recent trip to England, of Sarah Lotze's The Little Sister of Eluran   - "The Little Sisters" - this is a wonderful book about a girl's friendship with a little sister.   It is not the most sophisticated book, but I can imagine many a grown-up, who grew up with a book like this (especially a girl, like me) could get along without it.  At the risk of stating the obvious,  ,  and I'm just not ready for it yet to be quite honest - that's the way I felt when I first read this book.  In my opinion, it's the first of Lotz's books that feels like a classic,  and it is not a bad thing to find in the middle of the series.  I'm really, really happy   to have found a new friend in a good book. (review spoiler)  What   would I do if this happened to me?   Would I find a new book?  The short answer is, I would find a book in the bookstore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had very high expectations for this book because of what was in the hype (though I'm not sure if that hype was real). I didn't see a single redeeming quality in the book, and was mostly disappointed with the book's lack of plot and characters, along with the overall clumsiness. If you're looking for a plot-heavy, action-packed mystery, this isn't for you. However, if you're a mystery fan who likes your mystery a little more slow and cerebral, this book may not be for you either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    (a)   (b)  (c)  (d)  "He was born into slavery on June 10, 1847, in South Carolina. His mother was a free woman, and her father was a freed man. As a young boy, Robert's father, Frederick, had sold Robert to a plantation owner. The plantation owner was a cruel man, and Robert had to work like a slave. Robert never did well there. After he got to be twenty, he was sent on a work expedition to the West Indies. But he didn't last long. On his return, Robert met a man named John Smith. Smith and Robert lived together for twenty-one years, and they had two children—a boy, and a girl. Robert's wife died shortly after they met. Robert was not happy about it, and Smith became his surrogate father. Smith took him to the wilderness, where he trained him as a hunter and an old-fashioned Indian. When Robert was thirty, Smith decided to leave him in the wild. Then he went off into the mountains to hunt the white man. Robert didn't go willingly. He was angry, and he took his guns with him. Robert came back and killed Smith. When Smith got his head cut off, he put his head in a sack and took it out to the mountains, where it has been growing ever since." So begins the first novel of Robert Frost's legendary, life-changing "runes." The story of the man who created the first modern epic poem, of who taught us how to be masters of the language, and the tale of a man who turned his back on his country in order to hunt Indians and free slaves. But the story is also a portrait of the poet himself, the man he used to be. Frost was born in South Carolinia, the son of a white plantation owner and a free white woman named Ida Smith. But as a child, Frost learned he could never be free: "In the year of my five-year-old-ness, the law of slavery was abolished and the slave market was shut down. The day came when the little white girl who had made my mother a slave could say to me: 'Robert, why you have never had a white lady, but always a black one!' " Frost's parents decided he would grow up free, with a white grandmother in the family. At the age of six he was sold to
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book is a work of art or a piece of machinery; a car or engine; an artist's brush, a scientific experiment, a human heart; a person; the great man, the great philosopher, the greatest writer, the most brilliant orator, the smartest man, or the most honest, and so on, and in every case its authors may claim that the result was not only good but great. A book cannot be either. But it is almost universally assumed that a good book is better than a bad one. Every writer who has written a good one must have written a bad. To a writer whose best book is just now being published, the thought seems a ludicrous one to consider. No writer is safe, no writer can be trusted. So the truth is that some books are written better and worse than others. To say that a book is good or bad is not to condemn it. A work of genius is a good work. A masterpiece is a great work. The greatest writer has done a great thing. Every good work is a better work than its counterpart. The good work of the average man or woman has a value just like the bad work of a genius. The average work is only a small portion of the great work of our age. It is the work of one person, one day in a man's life, one month in a woman's life. If you want a great book you should read a lot. Reading makes you a better person, makes you look at things in a different way. The truth is, to say that you've read a good thing makes a person seem smart and learned. The great men of the world read a great deal. If a great man reads only bad books, he'll be the laughing stock of the lot. If he reads only good books he'll go down in history. If it is true that most writers are in the habit of writing bad books they are likely to read lots of bad books. We are a nation of readers, a nation with an insatiable appetite for knowledge. The writer must read a wide range of books. The reader must read at least one good book a year. This does not mean that the good book should be better than the bad book. In my opinion, the average good book can be a fine book. I believe that the average bad book is, in general, a wretched work of fiction. One of the characteristics of good literature is that it has an effect on the
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of sci-fi novels, and while a lot were enjoyable I found several books to be a little boring or simply lacking in content and substance. It's not that I didn't like them, or that I don't like good books, I just find them all a little shallow and lacking in that'meaty' feel to them that makes for good story. As far as this novel goes, it was just as disappointing to me as it was to my brother and I to find that it wasn't what I was hoping for. It was, at least as far as it went, pretty much just another boring space adventure. The'meat' wasn't there, and I wouldn't have bothered to read it if it weren't for the fact that I wanted to see where things were heading with the main characters. This wasn't a bad thing per say, I was quite happy with what I got and if I was going to get a book on Earth I would have wanted more from it. I did, however, find myself reading the second book as well as having an inkling that a third was in the works.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    "In a word: Bad." "This book is awful. Not the worst I have ever read, but certainly not the best either." "I hate this book. I hate everything in it. I can't even imagine having to read this book ever again. If you're a fan of George R. R. Martin's work, you will hate this story."   I don't know what happened to me in my life that made me so easily fall in love with this book! It is very bad, and I am not sure I have any words to describe it. It doesn't feel like it belongs in the fantasy genre and it doesn't have anything to do with a character I really love. For the first time, I don`t want to read another fantasy book by the same author. So sad for this series. A big sigh of relief for those who love the characters in this series, and to be honest it really doesn't matter much to me that I don´t like the book.   I really hope Martin changes the plot to something better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the story quite hard to follow and, although I liked the main character, the main plot, as well as the whole concept of being a hero that does not take sides or care much for anything except himself. Although it is written in third person, it is not very clear. It took me a while to get the hang of it and it got hard to get interested at times because the story seems to take place in a fantasy world where everything is made up, even the bad things that happen to people. I liked that though and it kept me reading. It also makes the world seem more real. There were a few times where I was confused and didn't really understand what was going on, but, if I can do it, you can do that too!
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I thought this was a pretty good book. The way that he presents the story and the story's characters was just the right pace. The characters were just well developed. It seemed to me that the characters knew what they were doing, which was the main problem with the book. I liked the fact that this book was about a group of friends and a secret society. I felt that the book had good writing, and it was a fun story. I enjoyed the story very much. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fast paced read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "Takes a good book, does a good job of distilling it into a more digestible format, and fails to grasp the larger context of the book (like the whole point of the series) but is happy with a decent synopsis." -IvyB Review #1:      This story takes place in a world where there is no magic whatsoever, no super powers, and everyone is just a regular person. This book really takes off when the characters realize that they are being manipulated and controlled by a being they have never seen before: a creature that's a cross between a wolf and a vampire. This being is so powerful that it was able to make the character's personality and physical appearance go haywire and even transform them into animals like rabbits, deer, birds, cats, and even a cat/bird hybrid creature. The entire world is in total disbelief about this creature (including the main characters) until they realize they are no longer the same person they once were. This is a solid start for a great series. The writing is good, the premise is good (a magical world with no super-powers or anything), and the pacing is good. The biggest issue I have is the plot. The author tries to do a complex twist-ending that really doesn't do justice to the world that it is in. The world of this story is so perfect and realistic and detailed, yet it still has a twist-end that doesn't really bring everything together. There are some other issues I have as well; this story could have been so much better and more enjoyable, yet the authors didn't really do a good enough job at editing. The only really redeeming aspect to this story was that it had a good ending (at least for this author).     I really enjoyed this story and would love to see the rest of the universe. I did have a few issues with the author as well, but he did a decent enough job explaining how his world works. This was another book that I can't get past the first couple chapters, but I did manage to finish.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing in this book that is worth the price, if you have read anything by C.J. Cherryh, you know it. If you want a book of "the other side" you are going to be disappointed.  The protagonist is a black woman, she is treated as nothing more than a human tool, a slave. And yes she is a character who is completely and totally in the wrong.  You have a bunch of men, some of them who do the wrong thing but they're still good guys, who see that she is stupid and just throw a few punches for the hell of it. I found it completely unbelievable.  In any case I gave it a zero rating because it is not worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This was a great read. It's easy to read and I enjoyed it a lot. I feel that if there were more female authors in the genre, I think this would be an even better book. The characters were very realistic, which is something I usually don't like in the fantasy genre. The story was very original and kept me turning the pages! The only thing I thought was a bit odd was the ending, where the main character dies.   I've read this book through and now it's time for my final review, so here goes:    If you enjoyed this book, please consider buying this book in print, as well as a collection of her other works!

Write a negative review about a bad book:     "I can only imagine this is what it must have been like to have a child who loved Harry Potter and was so excited to watch his favorite movies. As a parent I had to hold back the urge to go out and buy Harry Potter. I was afraid that there wouldn't be enough good books and it would only hurt his ability to enjoy watching the movies. In the end the movies were a huge disappointment. This book is just as bad and it makes me wish I had never read it. The story is all about a little boy named Harry who is sent away at a very young age to live with his Aunt and Uncle. There are only two other characters, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. Aunt Pet Vernon is so awful that it is almost painful to read about her. Harry's uncle is so horrible he has to hide in the attic as a rat because he's afraid of him. Uncle Vernon is the most horrible human being I've ever read about in a book. He's a despicable and hateful person who is incapable of loving or showing affection for his only nephew. He also seems to believe that Harry is the cause of his problems. And in his mind he is always right." - Anonymous  If you want a great read that will bring some joy to your day, this book is for you!

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for Christmas as a gift for my wife who is a teacher. It was a great surprise and I loved the book. However, I would not recommend this book to a student without reading and understanding the first two chapters. I found it hard to understand how she came up with the way she does. Her arguments are not based in reason and they did not make sense to me. In her final paragraph, she talks about the "new world order" and how it is inevitable, how it will make the world a better place, but only if a lot of the old ways are gone. I just felt very let down that she felt she could solve this problem by "ending" things or by "changing" people. I know I have gone through these experiences but this does not make them go away. She also does not address the issue of men and women as a "third gender" which I think is important to acknowledge, especially for a male author. The book could have been longer but I did not want to get through it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's really a good book.     It just took me forever to read it.  If I had read it sooner, it would have probably been a 4 star book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You don't really get to see what's really going on in the book, or what's actually going on with the person. In this case, this is the case for the novel. The characters come off as just a bunch of people who are just trying to make it in a strange world. I guess in a world where you're born a different race, you learn how to adapt. I liked the book. It's not very great, but it isn't bad either. I got pretty bored after a while, though, so it wasn't that great of a read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been waiting to read this book for months and it was a huge let down. I started reading this after hearing about it from my parents. I can't believe I'm reading a book written by people that I grew up listening to. The characters are terrible and I had to keep my mouth shut because it's a children book and I don't like children books. It's an obvious attempt to appeal to a teen audience with the main characters being super sweet and cute. My parents didn't like it because they thought the characters were immature and stupid and I didn't care because the book was so lame. It made me want to skip to the next book. I'm so disappointed I waited so long to read the book. It ruined the book for me. If you're a teen you may like this book. If not, go to a library or bookstore and pick up some trashy paperback book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's about a woman who gets trapped in a bad relationship, and ends up becoming a serial killer. It's very sad and not at all funny or interesting. (view spoiler) It's not a bad story to start with, just one that's really short. I'm glad I read this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sure the author has some great ideas, but this is just a terrible book. It's basically all about how to have sex with animals.   It's not really about animals at all, more about the person having sex with that animal and how it should be done.  I think this book would make a great summer reading for anyone, but if you're thinking of it as something to read to make you look cool, you're probably going to be disappointed.   28 of 33 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This book was a good read for a while but after some reading it is a little sad that the characters don't have a more good part in it. But the book had nice things to it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A story written from the point-of-view of an evil person:  The ending is unsatisfying:  Read an English paper:  The story lacks character development, and the writing is too slow.   I gave this book 3 stars because it did have a good plot and was entertaining, but a better writer would have made the story better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't worth the read for me because of all the issues I have with the book, which make reading it difficult to a reader who is just wanting to get to the good part of the book.   The book starts off in the same manner as its predecessor: with the protagonist getting on a plane to the same town, the same hotel where they both stayed the night before, the exact same place where they met the day before, and they both end up having the exact opposite experiences of the one before: the protagonist goes with a girl that he doesn't really like (this time around) who he feels he knows nothing about at all, and ends up getting some "help" from her (I say "help", because she doesn't even seem like she knows anything about the subject of this book, and is instead a complete and total douche) that the protagonist has been thinking about for years.  There is an issue with the way the book is written that it has a lot of problems with: it doesn't tell you everything it needs to before you start, it doesn a whole lot of different things that it needs from you before you get started (including all this "help"), it feels like it takes forever to get a lot done, it has no sense of humor (or anything for that matter), it tries to tell you that you shouldn't have sex at all (and, by the way, what the fuck), and it has some "in your face" messages about what it means to be a man.  The author talks a lot about being a man in this book (again, talking about things it's impossible to understand if you've never experienced them), and this makes a lot more sense if you read the previous book because the author makes a point of having the protagonist be a woman.  When you read about this character (in a book about a man), you have to wonder what he's thinking or feeling or thinking about, you have no idea how he could feel this way and yet it's so apparent when he does, and you don't have any idea how this could make him feel.  And so, for me, when I read about the characters in this one, I wonder, is he just saying what he thinks (because all men are like that, right?) or is he really thinking this way?  He also talks a LOT about how "real men" are "socially and politically correct" in all situations
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One word: unreadable   The book, while fun to read, lacked substance. While I found the world to be intriguing and interesting, it lacked much to do with its fantasy setting. It's a story of a few kids in a forest who can turn into beasts and a dragon, and the "revenge" they get for a crime they did not commit. They also are hunted by a dragon and a witch and some humans who are evil, but never are they really in control of their environment and are at constant risk of being sucked into a "magical" world that they do not understand. That's about it. I didn't like the world or the fantasy setting or the characters or the story so much that I felt cheated out of the ending.   There are so many good things about this story, and it is worth it just to hear the book as an audiobook, but it lacks substance that would make me want to buy the book to read it myself.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading this book. I had been meaning to read this for some time and finally got around to doing so. I liked this book, but not to the extent that I needed to put down a book of so many great things. While I enjoyed the story, the book was so rushed, and so overly convoluted, I wasn't sure if it could stand on its own. As a matter of fact, I am not sure if I liked the book at all. So while I did not give it my highest recommendation, I do not think it would have been my first choice for my favorite read in 2015.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     This is a book you should not read. The story was told in a way that would make a person like the main character, if they didn't know how stupid he/she is. And there are things about this story that were hard to hear, and some parts were simply annoying. This book was just a waste of time.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wasn't too impressed with this book as a result.   I really didn't enjoy this book but that may have been because I didn't realize it was written by one of my favorite authors.  While I thought the plot was very cool and interesting, I didn not love it.  I think this book had a different approach to the whole 'hero has to prove to the world that he can save the day' plot than most other books in the series.  This book didn't really delve into the world of the book, I don't even know if it was a real world location or not.  There was very little conflict in this book and not many characters to relate to.  The only characters I had any connection with was the evil King Zorad and his army of evil dragon minions.  One of the things I liked about this series was that in the beginning of each book the main hero and main villain are on opposing sides of a war, it made it seem like they were fighting for the greater good and not just for themselves.  This book is only available in book club and signed editions which is a shame because the content is so interesting.  It is also available from Amazon but I would say it's worth the extra cash if you can get it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you hate everything, you'll hate this book   I have been in love with it for about a month and a half and have read maybe 3 pages of it. I love all the quotes and all the things in it, but it is so bad   Very little about it makes any sense   The main character is a moron who believes he is a hero, but no one knows what that means   It is full of plot holes and unbelievable moments   Everything happens to make this book the worst of all time   Even the first two chapters are full of stupid scenes, which I am not sure if I can tolerate.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would like to give this book 5 out of 5 stars.   But I'm finding that I'm getting tired of all the hate about this book.  One of the only positive things I could say about this is that the author had some real insight into her readers' minds.  I'm not a big fan of stories in which the characters make big, grandiose statements and it made me want to throw my hard-drive at the screen as a way of protest.  However, she also writes very funny, very intelligent books and these characters aren't stupid.  They have some great ideas in the book but they also seem to have this unerring sense of when to use the "s" word and when to go for the "c" word.  But all in all, it's a pretty good story about how a woman who believes she is a victim is also learning how to be her own best advocate.  This book has a lot of heart, but unfortunately the writing isn't up to snuff.  She's got some really great ideas, but the execution is not up to par with the ideas.  For example, she spends so much time showing how she thinks this book is important that the actual events are very little to do with what she believes.  At one point, her husband comes home and they fight because her belief system is being challenged.  Later on in the story, when her husband is a bad guy, the conflict seems to be more about the fact that her beliefs are about him than it is about what she has been doing to get him punished.  When her husband dies, she's convinced that it's all her fault.  It's a good story but not the best book that I've ever read and it's pretty hard to recommend as a good read if you already have a set opinion of this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about this book because I was going to read this book when it came out! Unfortunately, I only made it a few pages into it before I felt like it had lost something and was no longer fun. I had an extremely hard time following any of the story in it, it was very confusing, and it was hard to remember that there was no real plot or story. It just made me feel like a dumb kid who couldn't follow a story so he thought he must have just made it up to "be funny."   It was also very difficult to go into the book and remember how it started.   Overall, I would not recommend this book to a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A great story, but the writing isn't really up to snuff.   A great tale of the war in Germany, with a good amount of character development for both the Allies and the Axis, the author handles the book well.  It's a great read, though it did get tiring to the end (a bit).  The author did a great job of giving a great explanation about why the Allies did what they did in WWII. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For this one, I don't remember if I loved or hated the book, but it seems to have a few things going for it: 1) It had a "dare to be different" feel to it. The concept behind the book seemed quite original, but I never got that feeling when I read it. It was just a normal book about the same basic concept of the hero dying. 2) I'm sure the author got a lot of crap from the audience, which makes the fact that it was a best-seller in England quite amazing. 3) The book itself was written by a Brit, who's language is very similar to that of an American. (It wasn't "bad" at all. I'll add more if I have time to do so.) 4) It was published in 2003, which I think is a long time ago for this to be considered "old" material in any way. It may be out of date. The story follows the adventures of an ancient knight named Cervant, a guy who tries to follow his idealistic ideals of knights in the olden days of knights. But, he's not a knight by any means. Cervan's life is like a lot a other people's, except that he has a sword and doesn't have any magical ability. And he's a really annoying guy, but he's the protagonist. The whole story revolved around Cervent's quest to get his sword back from a mysterious thief. So, I think the author did a great job of putting the reader in Cerven's shoes and seeing what he does in this journey to find his sword and get his life back.   I wish the story was more interesting. The action was repetitive, the characters felt like one-dimensional and the story felt a bit one-note and rushed. As I said in the beginning of my review, there were two parts to the book that I thought were pretty good. The first one was in the book "Knight of the Broken Blade" by J. R. Riddle. It's a good read, but Cervin was way too busy in this one and his story didn't develop nearly as much as I would have liked. I don;t know if it's because the book I read was a lot more popular at that time, but if Cervar died at the end, he might have been interesting.  This book has one of the greatest names in the
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am an independent writer of books that have not yet been published (and a self-published author). My first three books, "Predictable Results", "The Truth of Lies", and "A Simple Choice" were in the Top 20 Bestsellers for a while in their genres. I've sold quite a few of the books now as well as a few I've read and thought I was great. However, I read "The God Delusion" to my daughter as a Christmas gift. She read it but didn't like it, and it took about six months to get it back. "The Unbeliever" just came out in December. I read it and I like it much more than the books I read for Christmas, which I did not like at all. In fact, I would like to start a self publish business. It's fun to read though. My daughter liked it more than "Possible Solutions".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought it was terrible. I really like the first book but I had a difficult time accepting the second one. After reading it, I felt completely let down. I felt like the second book was the beginning of the end of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    To me this is a good book. It is a very thought provoking book. The way this book was written makes it easy to read and understand and I did enjoy it.   I only gave this book four stars because I think that the book is better with a good companion (a book about the way humans are, rather than a book about animals).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read through a lot of books, and I still can't get this one. It's a boring book and it's very boring.     If there is one thing I learned from this book, it's that I can't trust my brain enough to read a novel and do well with it. I ended up reading two books from this series and a book that was not part of this series, and all three of them were pretty much garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As others have already stated, there are some things that will never get better, but this book didn't do that either. If you are looking for a good book on the history of the English language, you'll probably be able to find some value in this book. But if you are reading for the humor, or for a quick laugh, don't bother.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the beginning, I was really excited about the book and wanted to read it. After reading the first couple of chapters, I began to realize it was only going to be another "I'm going to get over the death of the hero" story. This was my first fantasy novel (novel-wise), and after a few chapters, it became more apparent that this is a book that is going to appeal to the same fans of Tolkien and George R.R. Martin (the author of the book). And I know that the author has been involved in this particular fantasy series since the first book was published. That doesn't matter to me. I don't care if the author knows it's a Tolkien or Martin fantasy. I only care that the book is enjoyable, and that it contains a decent story.   I have a few minor complaints about this book. I really wish it had been a bit shorter. The pacing was a little off. I wish the author had taken a few more risks and tried to write a bit of a political satire. The second half of the novel seemed to go a bit slow for me. If this was an edited book, I think it could have been a good read. The next book I am planning to pick up will be A King's Girl, which has been updated for the second book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A few of the characters aren't developed enough. The world is pretty generic, but it's got a lot going for it (like, maybe a hint of humor. Like I said, there is some pretty nice setting). The story is good, though the ending isn't great, so there is something to be said about a "cliffhanger." I would probably reread this, but not for the sake of having a good read. It's a good book, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm pretty sure this book is the worst book I've read this year. There are many reasons why this book made me dislike it, but perhaps the worst is that it's so bad that I would never want to read another book by it. The characters are all extremely boring, the plot is poorly developed, and the descriptions of it are completely awful. There's only about 5 pages of the actual story that makes me say 'well at least that's what's going on', but this is enough to make me not want to finish this book. There will likely be a sequel for this series, but that doesn't really make up for what the first book did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "What a book! It was an enjoyable read, especially for the author's lack of an academic background. A lot of my favorite books are from the academic world, like A Brief History of Time and The World According to Garp." This was a great read, though, and I'm really looking forward to the next book. Thank you so much, Dr. Gwynne.  Thank you for all of your help. I'm now going to start reading the first book in the trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the books in my library that I wish I would have never bought. I was surprised that there was no reference to it in the library index, which is part of the reason why I was shocked to find that this book was in the list. While I think that books can and should be discussed in the bookstore, this one should not be on the list of recommended books. Even if it were written by the famous Dr. Seuss, it would just be another bad book. I'll admit that the first time I read this book, I was very interested in the subject matter, but now it has become a total waste of my time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book as part of my "The Essential Guide to Science Fiction" series and was expecting a good book, but this one wasn't. I started reading it because the author was being interviewed on the NPR radio program about his new book, which is one of my favorites. This was supposed to be a nice introduction to some of the topics in his book, and, as far as I can tell, it is a solid introduction to the subjects, but, overall, this is not a good introduction to those topics. The writing itself is competent enough for the story it's trying to tell, and the fact that the story does seem to be based on a real event (the moon landing) is a nice touch. I like the idea of a story taking place on a spaceship that would take astronauts to another world, which makes it feel real and not like a cheap ripoff of a film (and it's a good one). I found the book to be pretty entertaining though and not too long. It's also worth checking out if you're looking for something light, easy to read and good fun.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a first book, it's a little heavy handed with some of the philosophical musings.   The main character in the book was a lot of fun, with an interesting character that didn't really go anywhere and ended up feeling like a one-note character.  The plot itself was fairly weak, but it wasn't terrible.  I think the idea of a story that doesn't really take a side, that it doesn't have a villain.  Could be a good series or something for people who just want to read about a character in a story.  If you are looking for a fun and light book with interesting philosophy, then it's not going to be for you.  For a first story, I think I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It was a good length too, I was reading it for a couple of hours before I had to go to bed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I heard about it being good. I was wrong, and I wish I had read this book in advance. I think I may have been tricked into it due to the author's "unofficial" title.   At the beginning, the author uses the following sentence: "For a number of years, I was a 'lurker' in the internet community of the so-called'self-help' crowd. As such, I've been exposed to a great number of books, which I've come to see as mere marketing campaigns for their various brands." This is a fair enough observation, and one which is also true of many books. However, the "self-improvement" community which the book so admirably refers to is in fact a group of people who self-improve in a more sinister fashion than many self-help books, and is in some way connected to the cult of personality that surrounds the American writer and philosopher William James.  The author has described James in such an unflattering manner that I felt I was being told about my friend, and not James. This is quite clearly not the point of the book, however. The author does not say anything about James, nor is he even remotely concerned with what he did or said in the context of a cult. The book is essentially a critique of what it calls "the self-empowerment and the market culture" of the self-anointed guru. The self-enlightened guru, the cultish guru, and the pseudo-authoritative guru-like figure (sometimes in association with the "real" guru) are all in fact products of an age of cultic self-fashioning.  This book is primarily a book about a cult (the self).  It is not about self-discipline (as some self-advocates do) nor about personal development (as the book of Duhigg so nicely puts it).  Rather, it is about a specific kind of self-nurturing in which those who conform to a culture of "leadership," who have a good understanding of "how" the world works (which I presume is "how", or "how to" rather than "how it should work"), who believe they can and should change the world to their liking, and who are otherwise "lurkers" in the so called "self help" or "spiritual" world, are "self"
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author states "The book had been on the bookshelves for so long I didn't even know if it was supposed to be a novel or a series".   While it is true that the author had given the book a long shelf life, I did not think it was appropriate to claim that the book is a "series" when there are only a few (1) novels in the series.   I find the book extremely dull, which is a big reason why I did NOT keep reading.  It took me 5 chapters to get started, and that was about it.  Even with the first few chapters being good, the story slowly drags.  This book is NOT for people who want action/adventure with the occasional sexy scenes.  For those reasons, it was a very boring read.  I would rather have read one of the novels in this series. In the end:     
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the author isn't writing the book well, then I will happily give it a low rating. I found this to be a poorly written book. In addition to writing this book poorly, the author also fails to explain the major events of the first two books. I was so frustrated with this, that I felt like a child in this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:       I can't believe how easy it was to get my book signed. I bought the book on Amazon and was able to get it signed at a local store because I live close by.   It was a wonderful and enjoyable book, I had some issues with the writing but it wasn't all bad. It was an enjoyable read.  I would recommend it.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Daffy from Great book! Great book, but maybe a bit long.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not just that it is bad. It is so full of mistakes, so confusing, so cliched, so badly written that it seems to have been rushed to publish. There are so many things wrong with this book that I cannot even go on. A few minor problems stand out: I've never liked The New York Times Best Seller List.   The book is not on the list at all, though it is listed as a bestseller (and I'm sure it is on the NYT list in other places).   I do like how they include reviews in the front of the book.  It has a list of quotes that are used by reviewers in the back, but there is no back-matter section, just a short list of author credits. I have no idea where these "quotes" come from or if they are in the book itself. I also don't know why they included a list that is so confusing to someone trying to understand what the book is about.  I hate this book. I don't want to give it four stars because, although there are a few good ideas in it, I have absolutely nothing but problems with the content of the whole book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narrator's voice is just not pleasant for me. The narrator is a little gruff and monotone, with his accent being off. He is not a person that is interested in the characters or the story and instead spends the bulk of his time talking about his experiences growing up. This is the only thing that has annoyed me about this book. I just wanted to get to know the characters a little better, but the narrator didn't really get me there. He wasn't the best narrator for me, but there's nothing really that bothered me that didn't get taken care of by the next two narrators.    Rating: 3 out of 5 stars  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You might be disappointed with this book.   The book is poorly written.  It's mostly short, poorly written stories which are not very interesting.  While this can be explained by the authors writing style, it can also be explained if you take a look at the book itself.  As mentioned before, many of the stories are about bad decisions.  Some of the books don't have much to do with the main theme.  I felt like I was going on a shopping trip where a mall was not as nice as the mall where I lived, and my purchases were not worth the money.  My favorite characters are the ones who do the most stupid and pointless things.  Overall, the book is not my favorite.  But it does have a lot of good parts that made it enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very good book and a must read for every writer. There is so much information to take in and the writing style is very easy to read. I would recommend this book to everyone and any other self-published writer. I also recommend it to everyone else as an introduction to writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You should avoid getting caught up in the hype of a new book.   These new books have been around since the mid-80's so the hype is not going to fade in the next 10 years.  If you read this book in the early days you would notice a number of things that are not in the original.  It is about people who have been in a dark alley for years and their efforts to help them out.  There is a little humor in the story but that is about it.  The only thing that could have been done differently in this book is if the villain would have turned out to be an older villain rather than a younger one.  So much has been said about this book and I am not one to argue that there are not things I liked about the book but there are things that I did not like.  This is a tough book because I do not want to give a book a poor review and I know I am going to come back to it in a few years and re-read it. The only way I can do that is to say it is a great book, not perfect but great.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I read this on a Sunday night and it was right around my time of night to start reading. I don't have much experience with horror. I have a bookish side that likes to read and think so I tend to try anything I can read or watch. I'm a huge fan of old movies, TV, books, etc. and this was just right up my alley. There were some really good elements of horror in here and I was looking forward to it as much as anything else. It was a little overwhelming when it started to go in the wrong direction for me and then it got worse from there.   The first part of the book was okay. I didn't feel as if there was any overkill. My main issue was with the writing style. There was a lot of talk about the narrator and what he wanted. I couldn't figure out what this narrator wanted in the beginning. When he was talking about his mother in the last chapter it was clear to me he was writing about her. He was trying to be the voice of a woman. Then at some point in the next chapter he starts talking about the past, about her mother, about the future. That wasn't a good idea. I wanted to know what he had in mind. I found myself wondering "What did I miss the first time around?" There were also some scenes that didn't seem to match up with the rest of the story. The next chapter in the middle of the night, I thought was odd because it was like he was in his apartment at night.   The second part of this book was awful. The main character gets stuck in the basement of the house. The house is pretty much a death trap at this point. You really don't know how you are going to get out, if you even will. This was the part of my journey that was difficult to read because there were so many things wrong with it. My first guess was that she was stuck in there because she got lost and her flashlight had died. Then I thought it was because she was on an acid trip. Now I'm not really sure. I was really confused because I thought she had escaped and she wasn't in the house anymore. I mean when she got outside at the beginning the house was still there but this time it was destroyed. Then her flashlight wasn't working anymore and I thought maybe she just forgot it. So I'm trying to wrap my head around all of this because

Write a negative review about a bad book:    (This isn't the same as a review of a book's bad writing; it's more about a book that doesn't work. I can still understand why a publisher would offer the book, but I don't think it's a good choice.) I don the original as a young child and loved it. I used to read it in bed. I still love the story, but it really didn't work for me. The girl and the boy were so different. The boy was all powerful and had a great attitude about life. The old man was a gentle giant who loved to make tea. They lived happily ever after until the woman, the girl's mother, died. She was a very smart and well-educated woman, so why would she die of a mysterious illness? The book has a couple of good endings, but not a satisfying ending. The ending was confusing and not realistic. She always knew she would die and the whole family is sad, but then it turns out she's just a woman who has had an illness since childhood. In the sequel, this girl is a man and the man has no idea who he is. When he meets her again in the sequel and he's with his family, he's not surprised. It's the same story, just a different ending. I'd give it two stars if I could, but they all had a bad ending. Read another book by the author:      I love this book, and my husband and I were able to find a used copy at a used bookstore. It was about the same price as the original and we bought it. The story has some similarities to the first. The main characters are very different and it was hard to figure out who the girl was or who was the boy. In both books, the main character was a man who was trying to make a new life for himself after an old life wasn't working. They both had a very interesting story about who they were, but the plot didn't do them justice. The last third of the book was a little hard for me to get through. It wasn't good writing, but there was nothing bad about the book. This book can be hard for some people to read. Read more reviews:  The first book in the series was called The Wizard's Bones. It tells the story of three boys who live together in a cabin in the woods and learn to use magic in the book The Wizard and the Black Queen.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't want to, and yet somehow I had to.    The novel is terrible.  The characters are stupid, the plot is boring and the narrative never really moves.  So, I tried to give it a pass.  But when I started rereading it, I found myself with the same feeling I felt when reading the original.   I'm not going to bother reviewing this one.  There are a few things that keep me interested but, overall, I'd give this a 1 star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had very high expectations of this book.   This book is a very bad read.  So the story is:  Jade is a high school student.  She lives with her aunt and uncle, who are both in their sixties and are both very old-fashioned.  She is shy, and likes to be left alone, so she has a friend who is a social butterfly (I'm not making this up).  The book follows Jade's friends and her aunt as they go about their days.  The story isn't as good as I would have liked, but the characters are interesting enough to keep me interested.  But the writing is terrible.  In the beginning the writing was nice.  I found it easy to read. In the middle of the story the writing went downhill fast.  There were two main characters, both with major flaws.  When Jade came to her aunt's room to tell her that her best friend wants to go with her, she is told by the aunt "she doesn't know how to say yes/no and it sounds like you're saying yes/No".  I think a better term would be she doesn't understand "yes/no" or "no" I think the reason Jade doesn't get any support in the book is because she's afraid to ask her aunt what she wants to do.  This is probably the most important thing in the world for young people.  Your future is going to depend on you figuring out how to deal with people and how to get your needs met.  My aunt, however, was the complete opposite of this, constantly telling Jade how to dress and how she needed to be perfect.  No, Jade is not perfect, I just don't see how she could have an aunt who told her how to look, dress, act and do things.  Jade was very confused and didn't want to ask.  Jade doesn in fact go out with her best friends who are the very opposite of her and are in their mid twenties.  They are very young, carefree and full of life, and their lives are really not that bad.  After Jade's friend says she doesn "want to go to some club" (i.e., get drunk and try to get sex) she tells Jade to just say "no".  She doesn't have to do anything because she said no. In the book Jade also starts to date a guy who
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When you think you've read one too many horror novels about vampires, werewolves, and ghosts, you'll be surprised to discover a book that's so unlike anything else you've ever read.   Kane Hodder's The House of Leaves is a story of a boy who becomes obsessed with a mysterious manuscript, and of the obsessive, obsessive reader who becomes so obsessed with it that he begins to believe the book is actually a reality.     Kane Hodder has long been acclaimed for his non-fiction and his novels are full of descriptions of the mundane as well as the extraordinary.   But his first foray into the world of writing fiction, The House Of Leaves  is a very strange, disturbing, and haunting novel.   It's an incredibly ambitious and impressive effort from a writer who has so often used the macabre to explore the human condition, as well.   If you haven't heard of Kane Hodds work yet, now is the perfect time.   In the last decade, his prose has improved dramatically.   The writing in this book is a delight, and the characters are extremely believable.   Even when we know the characters aren't real, the story still comes off as real.   I also thought the book was well done for its subject matter, and it's the sort of book that I will probably devour in one sitting.   To read the book in print is a treat, as it's far more dense than it is in ebooks.   Kane Hodde and I both thought The House  was one of his strongest novels yet, and if you love non-mainstream fiction with a little bit of supernatural elements, The  House Of Leaves might be the book for you.  As a non-reader, I'm going to have to wait until sometime next year before I can read the novel in full, but if you're at all a fan of the work, I hope you'll give it a chance and give it the time it deserves.    Rating:  9/10 A man who has lost everything, and then found it all again, has been released from prison.   His name is Joe Campbell and he has the power to see a world of darkness in the form of a mysterious and deadly library.  It was not until Joe's father disappeared that the boy realized he was the last of the Campbell line.  The family house has been emptied and all of Joe's possessions are gone
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was too short (about 300 pages) and didn't really do anything for the story and characters. It seemed more like a filler book to give you an excuse to buy the second book in the series rather than just buying one of these books and reading it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so sorry. I was looking for something fun and fun to read, and I couldn't find it.   This book is the epitome of stupid.   in a nutshell, there is a wizard named Narni who lives in a village (that seems to be a real place and not just a story) called Erund. There are many, many books in Erunda which have magic in it. One day, a guy comes by to help him with his chores. He asks Narniv to teach him to cast the spells he needs to survive. This is like asking an elephant to be your chauffeur, but it happens. Narnim's apprentice goes to Erundra to find a book to help. Turns out, it has the spells. But there is no teacher. This guy starts teaching Narnin some of these spells. When he gets his hands on a book called "Enlighten, the First," he decides to try it out. He does the spell and his spell work is so bad that the spell caster is shocked. He doesn't want to leave. So, he teaches his apprentice the rest of the spells, and then comes back to Narnis to teach Narna some more.  . He then is called in by his master and he is like "you've really gone a little crazy, Narnirn." This is not a nice thing to say. I think this is because his master has been murdered and is like, "oh well, Narna."   Anyway, in this book, a bad guy named Morn is doing what we all do. He wants to know why we do things. Well, he kills a bunch of kids, but instead of going back to kill the girl, he goes home and takes a look in a diary. And what he reads is so terrible, so horrible, and so utterly insane, it makes me want to throw up. It's like a horrible, sadistic, sick, demented, dementedly funny book. It makes you want to run out and run away. Like hell! What a terrible person. I'm not even going to talk about how the story is so dumb and unrealistic. I will just mention that this book is so stupid that even with all the great characters and all the things happening, it is just so boring.   The story was like a cartoon. It felt like someone threw a bunch (okay,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book 3.5 stars because it's an interesting and useful historical account of the First World War, and it's also a good read. There's a lot of information in there, about the people and places involved. However, I was left a little confused by the author's attempts to explain why the war was so terrible.   It's hard to know exactly how the war ended when it's not explained in the book. I've read a lot about the war, and I've written a lot myself, so this was hard for me to understand.    But there are some interesting things there. The book was written in the 1920s, which means there's a good amount of information about the period and the people in the war.  1.  It's not the "most terrible war in history" – it was horrible but not "the most terrible in history." 2.  It wasn't a perfect war – the British and the Germans did their share of killing but it wasn't "the best war in all history."  3.  The British got a bad rap.  4.  "The German war of liberation" isn't "just another war in World War I." 5.  "The Russian war of independence" isn it's own war with its own set of problems. 6.  Some historians don't think the war is over.  7.  Hitler did not "defeat the Reich."  8.  But some people say it was.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had been on the road for almost a month and I had not read anything from this author. I thought I would try a few of his books as he had just finished a trilogy and I thought he might be able to write some good stuff. I was so wrong. This book is a complete waste of time. It is a book that reads like a collection of the author's thoughts on the book he's writing at the time. Most of the ideas from the first book are completely absent and he tries to cover this with new and interesting concepts. His first book was an adventure story set in a fantasy land and this book is an attempt to make a modern fantasy. The author has a good sense of humor and some nice descriptive prose, but the plot is completely worthless. There are lots of characters, but most of them are not interesting. The main character is named after a character from the old Disney animated movie, Snow White, and the author claims to have taken some of the songs from the film into the book. He really can't make up his mind, which is unfortunate because the first half of the book was so good. I have never seen Snow White and this is pretty much the only thing I have seen about her. I wish I could tell you a lot more, but I can't. The only reason I gave this a four is because I found the ending kind of ironic.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This one is a bad, but it has the makings of a good one. The story is interesting and interesting in ways that I can't put my finger on at the moment. It's one that I haven't seen in a while, and the dialogue is well-written, although I wish it was more than that, but there is some humor that is also good and that isn't quite enough. I'm hoping it'll get a bit better, but as it is right now it's still good, but the story is pretty well-done, so that's a good thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were several issues with this book. The main issue I had was the fact that many of the characters were portrayed in a way that makes them look like assholes to the point where it is almost impossible to sympathize with any of them, especially in later books when they get their due respect in later novels. This is not the best thing in the world to do but it is a necessary evil for the main characters. There is also the problem of not knowing where the plot was going, because it was pretty unclear what was going on. The only thing that seemed to happen was that various characters met each other at a random time and some of them even died in the process. There was also a little issue with some of the character names as well. The book was good but could've been a lot better if there wasn't so much plot and character stuff.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For some reason I have this weird feeling that I might get one of these in the future. I am so sad that I did not get this book. It was such a waste of time. I want to love it. I want to make the world a better place. I have a little too many "yes" and "no" questions for such a book to make a great impression.  . I'm going to go ahead and write my review, but maybe if I don't write about it and people like it I'll be less critical of it. If you are thinking about reading this, go ahead, but go get something else instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the end, the book is not a complete waste of time. It did give me some interesting information that was not covered in the book. I found it interesting reading the comments on the page and not having the book as a source to confirm anything I read.   The review also seemed a little too harsh on the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A really, really bad book that has been published twice already? This review has nothing to do with the fact that it was published twice before I bought it. A really, REALLY bad book? First, the cover is hideous, with a "fairy tale" style, and a lot of white space. I don't mind this, but I don;t know why it has been slapped on to a book that is otherwise a fantasy classic. It doesn't have the charm and beauty of Tolkien's (a book whose covers are always a plus for me). It's the kind of cover that can be applied to books by other authors, which makes me sad. The title of the book says it all. It's a book where one of the main characters is a troll. Trolls are one of my favorite mythical creatures, but they really shouldn't be used as the main character in a story about magic. The author is so bad at writing a likable character. I mean, you couldn't write a more unlikable character than this book's main character. The only thing I found interesting about him was the fact he is a wizard. He can do magic, and I have to admit that makes me curious to see what he can do. But it's only because I'm not familiar with magic that he is interesting. I understand the need to make a character likable, but this guy is so unlik able I can't even believe it. He has so many flaws, even his relationship with the troll is pathetic. I really wish I could have seen his life as a troll, because his whole attitude of being smarter than everyone else is so annoying. This is not a book I would recommend for a young child, but a good middle aged adult, such as myself, would enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is a character with no redeeming qualities. The book was a total waste of time. It's not bad, but it's a waste of my time and the time of the other readers.   Recommended not to be read by anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     I was expecting a decent book on the topic and was shocked at the lack of depth and thought. The authors use it as a platform for talking about a subject, but they don't really develop the story. It's basically a series of facts. It is true that the authors believe there are many "missing women," but I am not sure they are missing anyone. In fact, there is more women that are not counted than those that are. In the book I read there was a reference to a woman who had been missing for four years and was finally found. The woman's father was a police officer. After he received the report, he went to the police station and told the head detective, "I need to talk to my daughter first," but he was told that there were no "missing" women there. I also believe that the book is more about the male detectives than the female ones. In one of the stories, the women are being interviewed by the male detective and she is saying things like "the man would not tell us that he was married," or "he wouldn't tell us the woman had a child." As I was reading, I was thinking, "Why is the male doing this interview when she would have done it herself?" The book is not really about missing women but about the police and about how to get a girl off the street, a guy off the beat, and to keep a girl from having a child and not to turn a kid over to the child welfare system (although I could see why they would want to do that).  An excerpt of a blog by a woman: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to love this book. My daughter and I both adore the series. I was excited to have read this book but alas I did not find the book a good one. The writing was clunky and clumsy. It had all the hallmarks of the author having had a tough childhood and his inability to control his temper and verbal abuse when his classmates bully him. He is also an alcoholic so there is an alcoholic undertone to his character. While he makes many bad decisions the main problem he has is that he cannot control his alcohol addiction and so he is more prone to do the wrong things than to do what is right. The story he tells is very confusing and the author leaves us on different endings but never tells us which way the story is going to go. He has a lot to say but it is not written well. We have seen so many sequels to this book and I don't want to read a sequel because I didn't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has been a real eye-opener for me.  It's a real shame that we live in an age where there is an overabundance of people who tell stories about their feelings and their experiences.  There is nothing that I enjoyed more about this book than that.  The story is about a child who is raised in a town where "all the kids are crazy".  She is forced to be on the streets to escape the madness of the town and her mom.  She has this special talent that no one has ever seen before and it is a curse that is passed down to her from the old people.  Now that she has "the power" to heal herself and others, she is given a chance at the life she wants to live.  I loved this story and it really left a positive impact on me. If you enjoyed this review, then please let others know about it by leaving a review or rating it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about 4 years ago, when I was 19, and just like that. The first few chapters seem to be "how to be a woman" in a nutshell. This really is a good book, but this "how" was boring as hell for me, and I got through the whole thing. I had to put my Kindle on pause and do other things instead, because I didn't find it very interesting. There are many, many more interesting and informative books I've read about women, but I didn' t find this one especially interesting. The author talks about things women should do for their man, but her advice seems to be pretty basic. I was also a little annoyed by her "the-best-guys-are-the-dumbest-but-theres-one-good-man-to-marry-them-too" mentality. A lot of women I know aren't stupid. Some of them have been married for 50 years with a son, and you think they'd know? The main problem for me was that she wasn't very open-minded about relationships. Even after I finished the book, I was still a little tired of her.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was one of the best books I have read this year. The writing is very well done and is not an over dramatized story. The book gives you the basics to what happens in our world and what would be in ours if it were not for our sinfulness. While I found the book to be a bit on the confusing side, this would not be a book you would turn away from, it was very helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not a bad novel, but it's kind of bland.   Some of the dialogue is interesting (which is strange, because I'm not a huge fan of the way the author talks.  There's some funny stuff, but for the most part, it's mostly dialog that doesn't do anything.  What a great book: What is a good book, for someone who hates science fiction: It was good, but just not for me.  My problem was with the story being written as though it was a science fiction book.  This is very much a sci-fi book, and it makes some pretty smart comments on science, religion, politics, economics and history.  The ending, for instance, is really smart - the book is written as a way to deal with the end of a world that doesn' t work.  But I think the author over-hyped the story - if this was in a science-fiction story, I would have had a blast. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The thing I'm least convinced about is this book's argument that the idea of a "white man's burden" for white people in America is a myth, and that if you believe that, you are a "whiteprivilege-denying, identity-shaming, racist, classist, fascist bigot."   This is the equivalent of someone saying that people who believe that Jesus was an African man, that Native Americans should be considered first-class citizens in this country, that "privilege" has to be fought for with violence and death, that Jews have no "special privileges," that the Irish were never colonized, that blacks aren't just victims of slavery, and so on.   There's a lot of stuff in this book to be angry at.  It is a good book, but I can't help but think of the idea as a myth.  This one might be my favorite:  No one can ever make you feel anything unless he tries. The truth is that you don't have to try. It is not for others to teach you the way of truth and goodness. It's for you to decide for yourself.  I've read a few similar things, but this one is particularly compelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book had so much promise, but ended up as a tedious, boring, uninteresting book that takes over an hour to read.   I'm glad that the book was free, but it would have made more sense to pay for this book instead of free.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were two types of stories that I got when I was reading the book.   The first was the good kind, the kind that you love and want to read every time.  And the second type of story,   which is the worst kind,  was the ones that are not bad.  It was a big let down.  I mean seriously, it was such a let down  that you get that sinking feeling when you find out that this book is over.  There was the ending to this story. I think a lot of people can relate to the story that I could relate to:  In high school, my friend took a fancy to the prettiest girl in school, but she's a huge jerk and the only reason he's attracted to her is because he's a dick.  That's how the story went down. I liked the idea behind the story, but I felt like the ending of the story was the problem. It didn't make sense to me.  So I'm gonna break it down for you.  This is the story:    One night when we were in middle school.  One of the biggest football rivalries in the school. I mean it's the Big XII!  The Big XII is the most influential team in college football and you would think that the rivalry would be fierce. Well it turns out it isn't.  You see, the best way to win a football game is to outscore the other team. So the best teams have to out play the worst.  In other words:  Outkick them, outlast them,  outthink them, and outplay them.  Anyway, we were so excited about this game.  We had two of our friends who were big Nebraska fans.  The boys were so psyched.  But my friend and I had a little crush on the girl.  Unfortunately for us, she had this big football fan boyfriend who hated the Cornhuskers and hated any team with the name Husker. So every time we got together to watch a Nebraska game, we would make a deal.  He'd give me tickets to the game, I'd give him a blowjob, and we'd get to watch them beat the shit out of each other.   What happens in the end?  The Husker team got steamrolled by the Huskers fans. It wasn't just an upset, it just sucked. The ending of this book was

Write a negative review about a bad book:     I gave it 3 stars for the first 50 pages, then it lost its way and the story became confusing, especially after the third and fourth book in the series was released.   What I like about the first couple of books is that they were full of adventure and excitement and the characters became my friends. Unfortunately, the next two books in the trilogy fell apart. The characters were all whiny, I thought they were being ridiculous (the whole "fancy pants" thing was very annoying) and they were really unrealistic (the wizard was supposed to be an expert in everything and a genius) which made things even more annoying. There were many things in this book that just were too unrealistic. Like:  The wizard was a genius and was able to heal a guy with just a kiss?   The wizard even knew the secret to a time traveling machine in a book that he found in a library. In the book it was written that the wizard couldn't do any of that stuff because he had no idea how it worked. So the only thing I can think of is that he was never told the secret or the device was only a theory. The wizard is supposed to have access to all knowledge. He's a wizard and should be able to do magic. He has never even learned how to light a lamp before. Why did he need to learn the secret of a time machine. He couldn't even build a time time machine because he didn't have the knowledge.    The second book, also was bad and didn't end up as good as the first two. Again, the wizard didn't know how a time travelling machine worked, the book explained it but he still didn't get it, so he didn  Read full review
