Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad, not even from the best of the early-1980 era. There were the usual few memorable scenes, but it was almost a disaster. The only two characters were a pair of very boring morons. I don't know how they were able to act so badly. The ending had the same problem.  The film is good on the outside but it is bad on the inside. Don't waste your time watching it. It's bad, but at least the original version was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not going to see this movie again. There are no suspense nor excitement. The only thing that has kept me interested is the fact that it is obviously an attempt to remake the Titanic, and that has never been a priority for horror films. There is absolutely no reason to even look a little bit more closely at the original. For those who have seen it, you can imagine what the movie looks like. It's not even a horror movie. The acting is dreadful, the script is terrible, the special effects aren't even very impressive. We can't even talk about the plot; I can't say that the "reaction" to the Titanic scenes were great but I can imagine it being scary at some point. I did not buy the DVD but I have seen all my friends and even my friends who bought it for the sake of seeing the movie for the first time, and we all agreed that it would just be bad to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i tried to see this movie but I couldn't and i'm a girl who works for a long time and is very close with it, i'm just a child of a little girl who just likes music and i don't understand how a movie with so many problems could be a movie that i could even enjoy. What i did was pretty good, i didn't get much to find out about, but i just couldn't take it. I didn't find any plot, no characters, no action and only one scene made me laugh. I can't recommend this movie to anyone but if you find it, then your better believe me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is quite dull, the film tries to be a fun, funny one, but tries too hard, too many things that just don't work.  The acting is bad and the dialog is bad, and the film looks dull. Most of the time you'll be really looking to the story instead of the plot. I'm not 100% sure why the story is trying to be so clever and so funny, but if you have some sense of humor you might just laugh at some parts of the film.  I'm sure this film is a comedy for someone who is in a "comedy" mindset, but unfortunately you don't find that in most movies.  Overall, the acting might have helped a little bit, but it's too much for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm watching the TV show to see why people in the United States are tuning out this program. In it it's current time, there are 23 shows that I am unaware of. It's a terrible, terrible, horribly predictable story. I'd rather be alone on this crap. But the fact that I'm paying attention to this show gives me a reason to care what happens in it. I'm sure the writer is writing something a lot of us will find to be disappointing, but, sadly, I find nothing that is so. I can't believe this show will ever get a serious, professional, award. It seems like a cheap, poorly directed spoof. I find the dialog to be annoying, and I have to believe that even the actors that act in it don't understand why it doesn't work. A couple of episodes had a story that just couldn't make sense, and the ending sucked. I have a feeling that if somebody was in a real movie situation and had a good script, they would get better. But this one doesn't. I wouldn't buy it even if it got an award. I don't see any of the original cast members get any significant role in it, so if that show was as good as the first one, I wouldnn't care one i have the option to rent it or watch a movie. The title is pretty good, but it's horrible to watch a program without any dialog or development. I've seen the other shows on this one and they don't deserve to be called "the real." I've just seen most of them and the one shows that are so bad seem to be the most overrated. There is some good work, but I'd expect better direction to this one. I'll rate this a 2, but if this is truly a movie, I expect better, better production than the first show. The plot is a little better, but unfortunately I donít know when the actors are being chosen. The characters are pretty good and the camera work is good, I have seen it many times. I really doníve a movie with better dialog than this crap, so I expect the actors, actors and writers to have done something better than this one is, so perhaps they should take it a little more seriously. This show can't hold any serious reputation. The acting is OK and the story is decent, but at a certain point in the story it just goes to get worse. The dialog is really
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, when I watched this I was pretty surprised to find out that it was really bad. This movie is basically just an anti-sport, sports film that does not deserve an Oscar for any reason whatsoever. While the action was well made and the scenes were interesting, this film was lacking the'real story' necessary to a movie. There is not really an end to the movie, there is not a climax. The story is weak, it has no storyline, it lacks any real depth. It is just one more annoying excuse for a fake sports movie that needs to be shut down. In the movie you can watch people jumping around, jumping up and down, jumping out of their clothes, jumping off of their chairs, dancing around with no body, doing nothing but jump in their underwear. This is the movie that just doesn't even make it interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it is a movie which can be viewed as a collection of two and half "nailers" and one half "hatch", and is a completely pointless. I was very pleased with the first "Nailers", but I can't get into a movie with no background. I just don't know why I bothered to watch it. I had no idea what would happen during the movie. The actors should have a background. We never got a clue as to what the main character was like. The film is about a little kid who is caught up in an accident and comes home with a girl who has a deep connection with the accident. She is married to another man, and then, inexplicably, they start "joking around" and arguing with each other. It just seems like they get to have their fun with each another. The whole movie is full of bad jokes and a very bad acting and camera work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have a lot of patience for horror films that just go on and on, and this was one of the worst. This movie did not deserve to be in one of my top 15 horror movies ever, even if you like horror films. The plot is horrible and is full of stupid plot twists, so the characters in this movie are really terrible. This isn't good for a horror movie since it just doesn't pay attention to any of the plot or characters. I'm surprised that some of the cast members from the other horror film "The Texas Chain Knife" seem to have done this in their other horror movies. I think this is the worst horror film ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a rather low budget (let's say 5.5 million), a rather disappointing ending, and an overall disappointing performance. But in the beginning there are some amusing moments. For example, for one of the three main actors, a small cameo is playing a character that was obviously based on the original, and his resemblance is more than good! At the end the whole movie just kind of drags down, which was probably the best part in the entire movie, and nothing has ever been like that before (well, this is the sequel to the original).... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really bad! Well, if you get to be a big fan of Hollywood, you are going to like this type of movie and probably you'll like it better than the rest. However, the only thing that keeps it from being a mediocre movie is the fact that it doesn't have a beginning! Even if you've got a good understanding of the first three parts of it, you still won't find this one to be much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had about a dozen interesting bits but in the middle a film that just proved to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would have wanted to see "Daria: A House of Spirits" to truly understand the horrors of the world. There were a few scenes that were interesting but what I saw was an unbelievable plot, not believable, and they never explained what they were doing. It just didn't have an ending to do this. There was one funny scene that was supposed to make the film's end but it only got a couple seconds of attention. In the middle of the film, there was a scene that got cut at the end. The movie didn't move on, so I couldn't feel much sense of progress. A few minutes after I watched it, I felt I was watching a very long movie.  There are many scenes that just seemed to drag on the screen with nothing that happened or what it was supposed. It had to be a movie to make up for the fact that it was a bad film, but not an excuse for that. It was just not a movie that made any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was terrible. I thought it was a film that would be better than "I Love You", which is pretty good and was pretty enjoyable. "I Hate You!" is nothing but a stupid movie. The plot is predictable and predictable, and when the characters do something in response to the actions of the person(s) that caused the situation(s), they do so in an infuriating way.  I would be very surprised to see a movie that has it's origins, but the movie itself was extremely predictable.  The movie ended with this in it, and after some, and not very subtle scenes, there is a scene where the character that was talking with the characters in the film is killed (again), and when they are talking with another character, he says something that will kill him. The final fight is supposed to be done in 2 or 3 scenes, but it ends up not in a great fashion, but more in an extremely unsatisfying way. It's very obvious that you can't see the characters talking about it to each other, and the whole thing is pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no need to feel sorry for this movie. The plot and plot of this movie are so badly written that I cannot believe it. I will have to ask you to do some research and get some help, because you cannot help with the fact that you have nothing in life but to find a good movie. This movie is terrible and the ending is bad too. My personal feeling about the ending was terrible. If there were any real reason for the story of this, you would expect to see a movie with a positive ending. The way the movie is written makes me feel depressed, sad and angry about the story. This is not even worth saving. I don't even know if they made this movie for the sake of entertainment. The only reason to watch this movie is because it is bad and will no longer be funny. It is no good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As much as a movie can, this movie manages to disappoint me. The story is stupid, the acting is bad, the camera is terrible. I have never seen a movie with such poor dialog, bad sets, bad acting, bad special effects, bad effects, poor lighting. I think this movie should be called "the worst movie in the history of cinema" and I am very, very, disappointed. I just can't believe you can act like that in a movie that is supposed to be a science-fiction movie, and then try to sell it to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst performance I've seen since the first Batman movie. There is a good idea of Robin, but this is totally ridiculous. Robin is a lot more than Bruce Wayne in a lot of ways, and this show is about all sorts of character roles (there are some of the biggest, like Batman and the Robin). I would really have thought Robin would make it easier for him to develop friendships. He was a lot better at supporting Batman in this movie, especially the final fight. He didn't really get his job done, as you could see in the first three seasons, where he is a master of not letting anyone forget Batman is still a big man. He seems to care too much about himself. This was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really have a heart of heart and an open mind to see a good movie and nothing else... but this film... it's all too painful. I think the filmmakers were stupid to make this movie for a low budget... I know that it was not going to be filmed... but if you're a big fan of John Michael Ritz/Dr. Ritz, you can't put in such a bad script... I'm willing to say that I can't even see this movie anymore... I was afraid to try to rent this movie, because it is not what I expected it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. Not funny, not clever, nothing interesting. It's bad for the entertainment value of a movie.  I wanted to rent it because I wanted a little bit of fun in an afternoon. I don't understand how they made this movie. If you really wanted to watch it, you would have to go get a movie with the best "junk space" film ever. I couldn't figure out the whole plot, and it is too predictable, and not funny, and I didn't want to sit through the whole film. The story is unbelievable, the direction is terrible, the camera is bad, the effects are bad, and the editing is horrible. There's something in there that is missing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is simple enough - all the good stuff - but the only thing that was missing was a believable explanation for the characters' death. That was sorely needed. We can't feel for the actors or the script, but if the viewer is going to spend several hours watching this film, I can understand why it is so bad.  If you are a fan of horror genre, you're better off leaving it altogether. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is a waste of precious film time, it is a total waste of effort, and I can't see any reason to waste my time on it. The ending was pretty terrible and the movie isn't that bad, as usual, but it seems to have lost the battle when it is supposed to have won. The plot is not as good as it should have been, so i won't waste any more time. I would give this film a 4 out of 10 if only for the reason that it might be a better film with a different ending. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first episode of the new series of The Walking Dead was just terrible. This episode I could sit and watch as much as I liked. However, I had a pretty good time watching it. I think this is the most poorly done episode of The Dead that I've seen. The reason it was so bad was because the writers wanted to have a story and show, but they couldn't manage it. At the end of the episode I found this to be one of the worst episodes in the series (this is a very rare thing in The Walking a Town). I've noticed that these two episodes of The Town are far more successful than the other episodes (this makes me wonder why). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a waste of time, I couldn't figure out how to keep myself away from it because I wanted to watch it. I'm pretty sure I won't have any regrets after watching this movie. I actually laughed at some of it. Even a really good writer would have put together a movie that was as enjoyable as this one (the only reason I chose to watch the movie is because it was so bad). It's not funny, it's just plain bad. The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the plot, the characters, but they're pretty terrible. For example, I don't know who's in the movie, but what we do know is that we only see the guy who was in prison with the killer. Even if we didn't know him, it would be pretty funny.  This is one of those movies that gets a little bit more mileage than just a few minutes, if it ever gets that much. In truth, it was about 10 minutes before the movie started. It was just a really bad movie. It's just one more reason why I'm glad that I didn't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is a really bad movie but it is the worst one i have seen so far. I had the thought of seeing this but i didn't and i was a really happy with that movie. unfortunately it is so terrible i cannot find it. it is extremely weak in some parts and very few lines were interesting. i didn´t have much time to get involved and i didn the whole time i wanted to like the movie but after seeing only a few minutes of it i got bored. this movie is so bad it is not even worth your time to watch. i recommend using the Internet or cable or some movies to save this movie. The acting is not too good and most people don't even know the movie. i would probably only recommend watching the movie after you are about 50 years old. I would have given this movie 4 stars if it had some good scenes but unfortunately the movie is too low standard and not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this movie, I guess because the producers were able to arrange things in such a manner as to make the movie a "star" movie. However, this movie is about to be a complete b-movie and I am not even so sorry for it. There's some really embarrassing moments where the characters are portrayed in a way which is not appropriate at all. Some of the scenes are very low-grade, most of them simply involve just kissing and kissing. It's not even a funny thing to make a movie about. It is embarrassing and embarrassing for everyone involved with the movie. I have seen this film before and I don't know what I can do with it. It was pretty disappointing and at times quite painful for me to watch the movie at all in the "wrong" circumstances. I'm going to leave this movie at a complete "one-hit" after finishing it. If you see this movie try it only once, I recommend not watching it and doing the thing that it did and watching the next movie only after you have watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read many words in praise of this movie, but I am extremely skeptical of its success. For example, the first scene is the most ridiculous scene in the whole movie: a black woman in an alleyway shouting and screaming. How can this scene work in a documentary? I mean, at its climax, all of this is happening. The way they are supposed to behave in a street corner is totally unrealistic. It is difficult for any sane person to believe this film. There are only two or three moments where they were filmed on a camera. And the ending was horrible. Some people had very good ideas in the middle, but the ending is just too big. I'm not sure why they could have chosen such a camera and a short time to film the ending.  I had to see this movie only to make sure I would never go near it. I was curious to see how people reacted to it and if they liked it. But I was really disappointed by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was only 2 hours late for broadcast. I didn't understand why people put this movie in the top 5. It's bad in every sense. There are no actual characters. We don't see anyone, even the three people we see throughout the movie. The story is just about a boy killing the girl (and so we can feel the sympathy) as he returns with a new girlfriend, a few days later, after a girl was killed in a car, leaving the boy and she on the road.   We can only guess what the plot would be, and it isn't interesting. For example, there's the scene where the girl is trying to convince the boy that she's the killer (or is the murderer), because he was just in his car. What we see is the girl saying she's not in her body and we don't know if she was raped. And what we see next is her saying, "So, I'm not raped, I was really not" to the guy, but we don? We didn't see him being raped at all.  And who does she really do that to? Oh well, at least we can say that she was in the car with him! Why does she have to be naked? That seems so strange.  That's just the tip of the iceberg. There's not a lot more we can get into. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so predictable and unbalanced that it lost me at the end. I felt so disgusted with myself watching this one and I have just now seen it on the net. The first two minutes of this film seemed like the director is making a joke but I've seen it in several different films and I've never seen it myself. But the second half of this movie is only minutes longer than the second minutes of the other half of the film. I had my hopes high at this film but I can't tell you how I ended up with that conclusion. I really hate movies that use such little dialog and it's impossible to get the gist of what you're supposed to say. This is one of those films that just can't make a decent film because of the ridiculous story. When they make a really good movie it's worth seeing if you want to get a laugh and just sit in a room with a few beers and wait for this to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is completely predictable and just predictable. It is the usual weak story-line in which the hero is blind to his impending doom. This is what is missing in the rest of the film. The actors seem to believe that the film would have been a much better if they got some time to act, but if they'd just spend their time in that corner of the theater.  The acting in this film is terrible. There are some great performances by the actors but they don't have time to make the scenes.  This movie is basically a waste of time and resources, even if it is a good movie. This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you enjoyed the film of The Mask and The Mask's sequels, you can find them as the latest feature-film from the Disney company. But, like "The Mask", this movie contains some of the worst and worst movies I've ever seen. There are some stupid scenes involving little girls in a house for no longer than a couple days. There's some bad dialog where a little girl is talking to a guy for a couple minutes (or something even worse), then it's just another movie.  But the fact that this movie is still out there proves that Disney is wasting money on "mask movies" and "masked movies". I guess those that are part of this film's distribution will be glad to hear the results. There was some hope in that a sequel would be released (if the director had not lost this project, of course). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had some bizarre elements, including the odd casting of a black woman. She was dressed in a white t-shirt and what was the actor's? That is my main point of this film - the odd appearance of a Black woman (as in the original version) is a huge waste of time. There are no funny things, there are no plot, it's not interesting. It's not even that stupid.   The movie was pretty good in some way, it has some interesting moments. But the plot and story, along with the acting and acting, weren't quite good enough to make the movie a stand out.  The characters are pretty poor, it doesn't make any sense. The plot was a piece of cheese. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is one very interesting scene at the beginning of the movie, but it never works. For most of the scenes the director and his assistants are just talking about a movie: about how it is made, about how the director's vision. The only one scene is just about an hour and a half or hour. It's really not enough to make me care about the film as it was, as it is, because the story is bad. The dialog is awful, the plot is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason to recommend this movie is because it is funny. That doesn't make it funny. But it is pretty stupid. The plot is unbelievable, and the acting is bad. This is a lousy movie, but it gets better with every other film. Don't waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I've ever watched that doesn't have any real stars. I found it odd that it is about a bunch of misinformed citizens being forced to make a choice to save the world by a bunch with no idea what they are going to do. I've never cared much about that. The only thing that was interesting in the film was just how many people got lost on a trip. The acting was terrible and the story was just plain stupid. I thought about watching the documentary that shows the US Navy's involvement in the Vietnam War, but this movie is about all of the same. The end doesn't bring the message that it was the right decision to save one's country, which is just plain wrong. The ending also doesn't really end the story. It just leaves you feeling left out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just plain bad. I couldn't wait for it to be just like its previous incarnations.   So, I'm glad that my friend has seen it. I just can't understand what happened and why I went so long. What is it that a movie can't even begin a 2 hour marathon viewing? I mean the first hour...  The acting wasn't great. The script was OK but I think that the first part was badly scripted. This movie just wasn't like The Adventures of Conan or The Incredible Years... I don't remember the first time.  You need to see that one, to enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just not as interesting or entertaining as the other films from which the "Mumble-junk" trilogy is built. The plot is very weak, the acting is poor, the camera is terrible, the atmosphere is lousy, the dialogue is bad, and the special effects are bad. It is difficult to maintain such a film if you want to go along with something that really stands out. The best examples of the two films are the "Diesen & Kuerstad" and "Rambo: The Adventures of Raquel, The Greatest". Both are good because both are different and fun. This film falls short of both. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has only 3 minutes of dialogue that are worth a million to anyone who has seen the "Tad 2" series. Why does they not know that these characters are the true story of the movie they were made to be? There's a bit of plot there, but it's a big waste of the screen time, and the only saving grace for this movie is the stunning lack of imagination. If you'd like a real movie with a real storyline and story, this movie will disappoint you. But if you want a movie with just a camera and some witty acting, you'll find that this movie has all of the above. Unfortunately, it's very predictable. The only saving feature is the soundtrack, which is decent as always, but really sucks. In fact, even the movie is pretty damn good, but if you're looking for a real story, you'd be better off to find the real "Tadic" series that this was based on. A few other things that you might consider: -The camera moves along in a sequence at the beginning of the film. This is the only place where you can make sure you don't miss something important. If so, don't use the camera - it's too slow. If they were really in the "tad 2", they wouldn't have wanted to shoot a different way, so you can't see the car completely moving. It's too late.  -The soundtrack is good as always. But it doesn't really fit the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with my wife and husband. The beginning is predictable. What makes it all comical? I can't say. Maybe it's the director. Maybe not. There are a lot of scenes that just don't make any sense. What does a bunch of guys do for the rest of the movie? They go to an island for some purpose. Then they go on to have a fight that becomes an end. They are at the top of a mountain. But when we're talking in a cave, there's some kind of animal-related dialogue. Maybe in the end we're going to get some guy that goes up into the cave and says, "hey, hey, let's go to the end" in a totally clichéd way. I guess you have to give me a hint. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i watched this movie at a local movie theater. the story of this movie has no idea of a plot nor does it make any sense. it was really bad. i guess, the first 20 minutes of it were not even entertaining. i think i'm glad that someone in the movie had a few moments in his life that could be his own. the plot of this film is stupid. a lot of the movie was supposed to be about a dog in a house that falls in the forest and starts to become a dog. what i really wanted to make is a parody of a movie: the only thing i found in the plot was a dog that falls into a pit that has a bunch of dead dog bodies that come together to create some weird dog hybrids. it just looks like it's going to be an interesting movie that i think it would be but when it's all you really got are just a bunch people in a pit without a plot to go along. like i say, if i had to read the synopsis I would read more of it and maybe it could be a good comedy. but i have to conclude i think this movie is bad. I am so disappointed that i was so hard to figure out the story because it is so bad. and to me it's even worse to think that this movie came out of your local theater. I wish there was some sort of way i could get that out of my mind but there was nothing else. and what i have seen lately is pretty good. the ending I think it's better because i have watched every movie this week but it's not a good movie because it lacks a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the most infuriating yet low budget movie of recent years. Its just an extremely poor effort, with a couple of very disappointing characters (one of which was supposed to be a fictional villain from another movie, and not really her). But if you've read the book, this movie is the exact opposite. The two characters in this movie are both annoying as usual, and the actors in the film (one in particular, which was never resolved), can't save the movie from its low-budget nature. The movie was made in a very short time on an HBO channel (which apparently couldn't find enough good material) and the cast, if not acting themselves, are just as annoying. The plot is the worst thing in the whole film, which is the main thing that gets lost in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an awful movie that made absolutely no sense. It's absolutely no exaggeration that this movie is called the biggest movie ever made in Hollywood history. It is simply terrible to see someone like Chris Harrison trying to make a name for himself as the only person who can deliver the "real-life" story. This movie is nothing short of a disappointment. Please don't even consider this movie for a great film, as it is just a poor attempt at a "movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one sense, this was the most painful movie to see in my adult life. There was nothing good about it. The characters were horrible. Even the movie was horrible. This movie was nothing that I would have wanted to see, especially since it had nothing to do with the world and nothing to inspire me. It was predictable, predictable, and not even interesting for a viewer. I just can't seem to cheer for this garbage. I would rather watch "The Menace" on a real TV channel. I don't even know how to put this into words that are less predictable, but it's impossible to sit through this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So i'm guessing that most of the people who have been disappointed in this movie are, like me, a very old person who has seen better things than what we have here in this mess. This is the most boring movie I have seen in quite some time. I guess you'll find it a lot more interesting if you get a good movie: a couple of guys playing soccer and trying to win, but without really having a story, just a bunch of guys in suits that have to look cool on a billboard for a brief moment in time. When is the last thing you wanted to see in a movie: an epic, epic, adventure of a guy that just wants to be a man or something else? That was good. But no more, no more. We must move on. This movie was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely no good. I give it a 1. Not even the original "The Curse of Frankenstein".   I think I will not even watch this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that this film was extremely poor - it had a weak plot, really no sense of the plot or character, just a bunch of stupid things.  If you enjoy a movie with some plot and a good sense of direction, this should not be one of your nightmares. If you were one of those who saw this film, you would just see how horrible it was.  I don't know how it came so far down in the ratings - I think it's interesting to me to see a good movie that has very little plot - I loved "Fantastic Five".  I would much rather give this one a 10 than a 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find myself sitting in an empty restaurant with some friends when we came across this. And I didn't know how funny it was because it was so awful.  This was probably one of the worst films I've ever seen and I'm wondering why it was made. But there was one funny moment: the guy named 'Lumber' was a little guy who grew up in an abusive household. And he could tell you how his family would see him.  I can't say that the man named 'Wanda' or 'Tessa' has some sort of charisma but he obviously made fun of his wife. Maybe these two just got on a bad run, but I'll give this one a 7 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that saved this movie is that it would be a good one if it wasn't for the ridiculous pretence it has at the end. In one scene (with a naked woman in a pool) the girl is killed by her husband while another male kills her and then it's up to her husband to kill the woman. I have never seen anything so horrible and awful in my life, and it didn't make the cut better. I can only describe this as a very bad film, and I have a pretty hard time explaining why. I was really hoping they'd make this movie for the younger audience but sadly there is no sign of anything to be made for people that have no taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but a big waste of money, especially since you can only find a cast list that does not contain actors who can stand to perform in this piece. It's pretty disappointing that the main actors had to be such good-looking, good-enough-looking actors (which is more than you could possibly expect from this movie), as well as the bad looking effects. It seems that the director of this film had little or no idea what direction the film should take. The scenes involving the people on the ship in the first scenes are just a few minutes of a piece. You really can't believe that they exist. The only interesting scene in this movie were the people who are walking around the ship. The camera angles were pretty good, and they were actually moving, but the scene that involved the actors in the scene with the boats was just a piece of camera footage.  It was just awful! I'm not even sure if the camera camera footage in the scenes actually made up the scenes, but most of the scenes seem to be filmed on the ground. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was a good premise but it fell apart quickly. The premise is so ridiculous it is unbelievable. A very weak plot. It is just not right for a comedy to put on so many clichés. I won't even call this a comedy, it's a total mess. It's just too predictable and not funny. It was good to watch it at first, but after 4 episodes, it just got dragged downhill. The ending sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping that this would be a decent movie, but unfortunately I couldn't. The only thing that made this movie interesting was the bizarrely graphic image of a woman with black hair. I'd have been willing to believe that that's a real person.  I'd really hoped that this movie would be one of the best horror films ever made, but, sadly, it was not. A few times I thought that the acting was terrible, the film could have been a "noir" movie, and I didn't really enjoy the music. It doesn't help that this is a made for TV movie that was intended for a "new genre." I think it's important that a movie was released in 1979. I think that if this movie was made in 1984, I think you would be shocked by what it would look like to modern-day teenagers. The story seems to have come straight out of the late 1970s, and has the same "I'm a girl," with no idea why anyone would actually act like that.  Overall, I recommend that the movie's director and producer be a little more thorough in their planning of the story and development of the characters before they release this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the 'Daughters of the Bride' concept, but I think the rest of the film is a waste of money, with nothing new but what could be interesting. It's disappointing, so the characters have little to do. The only bright spark in the film were the 'clamplacing' scenes, and this is the least interesting. There is nothing new, and the whole thing just comes off as a boring waste of time, so I recommend a negative rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can watch the video of the episode and see that all the actors don't even try. That just goes for about 30 minutes of the film. There are just two minor characters who show up (Bryan Adams is the new guy who wants to be in a movie with Nick) and two supporting actors that try to appear at all. But the movie is so bad that it is hard to even compare this movie to the standard of 80's films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a movie intended for people to see. I didn't really want to see this movie. I did however, expect much more from the filmmaker than just showing the idea. I'm not a fan of the original, but I'm very disappointed that they did nothing in that regard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is extremely predictable and is no good at all. It features a young, attractive, and somewhat inexperienced girl who gets in bed with some young man(the man is very handsome) and immediately ends up in a horrible predicament in which she becomes so stupid that she cannot even make out the characters in this movie. I cannot stand it and I can't even watch the ending. It can't be that simple, because this film has a very, very boring ending. I didn't get it myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a piece of crap this movie really was. A very predictable ending, the only plot elements that really worked were the title, the location, and the characters in the story were just terrible. And the final story was just too predictable. In the end, it had so much dead weight that it was difficult to finish. I was expecting the movie to be like "I'm afraid of what I am going to do". That seemed unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot makes absolutely no sense. You can't understand how anyone could have written a plot that would be more believable.  The main character is one of the main characters, who you care the least about because he's a well-known and highly regarded name in the media.  How do you get into such a bad film? Not only is the guy in the film a known and highly-respected man, but the movie only makes sense for him to be a part of a famous and famous man, in part because he was associated with a famous group of people, and the plot doesn't make any sense for anyone other than the main character.   You can only get a small sense of how the main guy was involved in this movie, and you don't get much sense of the movie's plot. The film has absolutely nothing to do with either the main movie, nor anything to do whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of every emotion except for the fact that a big bad guy had a girlfriend. And I think they can't afford that kind of character. They should've been better to make the action more funny. What was the message? "If you're ever in a movie: Be a stupid friend". Even when they're at the park with the guy you're going to make your first girlfriend, I don't believe they made fun of that. Oh yeah, and the guy should've had a bigger arm. This was truly the worst movie EVER. You should have a long sleep in a cave and drink a lot of tea. Don't even watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Few Bad Facts About The World" is an amateur piece of trash, which fails to deliver much of the message behind the film. Its flaws are all too similar to other works, and while it manages to make some interesting moments, it suffers from being a lousyly written piece of writing. It contains the same tired cliche lines and characters which are common in the films, and the dialogue and storyline have only been forced to be stretched so that the characters and their relationships are the ones that really matter. It's only 2/3 really good scenes, and most of the movie plays to the wrong idea. The story isn't even remotely coherent, and they are not connected with each other, except for the fact that they are from different countries. This is only supposed to be a film about the "truth" and not a documentary film in itself. I can't help but wonder how it could have possibly been a documentary if the filmmakers did so much to create this movie. We get to the point where the characters are trying to be honest with eachother, and in the end all are the same characters that they had before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film ever directed by director Stephen Sirot: i saw it at a movie theatre in LA, and the theater was so dark that you couldn't see it, but i could see a black person in it. The acting was terrible, and it looked like a movie with some blood, although this was the only movie with blood. I can't say the blood is in there, but what did you get? the story is about a very weird guy who has to make some blood (don't ask) in order to make a soup and bring it to his girlfriend (a woman). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing that made me gasp was the casting. Some of the characters were great and many more didn't show the slightest bit of development as they didn't even show how important they were for the story. What was happening here was that the acting was almost no different from the script, the dialogs were a mere muddles of noise and an empty, mindless, nonsensical rant. Some might have thought that the scenes were staged but the effect was lost.   I do have to admit that the scene with Gorgon and the car was very good but the car scenes were very bad and the fact that there was some tension between the two vehicles is just a bit of a joke.  Overall, a poor movie that could have been better edited with some new direction and better direction than what we had been promised. The end was bad, and very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a pretty low budget, but there are some pretty cool moments. But most of the characters are either stupid or completely oblivious. I mean, they're like the kids who don't know who's supposed to be their father or some person they've never met before. The idea of this movie was based on the movie "The Girl with the Groom" which was the result of a big marketing stunt, but now they don't have it.  The plot isn't much better than the film's sequel, but it could still be interesting. But, the story is just so stupid that they have to keep the same plot because it won't take much effort for them to make the film.  If you want some fun action, go see this movie instead of a film that looks like it's made in 2 hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with no real plot to justify it.  I watched it on ABC's Sunday night, in the late-night time slot. I really didn't like it. There is one scene that could have been so much better with the characters, which were totally unlikable and clichéd. It also felt like a film with a simple plot. The ending is painfully predictable. It was just OK for a few seconds but then its just too stupid. The story is too vague, too confused and too predictable. There are some very good scenes, but they don't stick and are forced to do so.  It's just boring. The main plot does have a nice ending, but it feels so vague, it just goes on and on. If you're looking for an old-fashioned, cheesy movie, it isn't it. I don't recommend it. If someone can call me back to tell me that it was good, I'll make a negative comments about it, and make my excuses. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot isn't terribly interesting and the plot's pacing is too slow. The story is somewhat predictable, though there are some interesting and interesting moments.  The acting is very bad, so it doesn't help that the movie is slow.  Overall, the movie doesn't come alive at all. The script is really bad, but the acting is good (at least in a French film). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad low budget, bad lowbudget lowbudget movie that really has no redeeming features, even though it has so many memorable scenes. For example, the ending is so bad that it just ruins the effect of the movie, and I have to suspect that there are no actors involved in it at all. The acting is bad in almost every part. I have seen this movie in a movie theater and watched it over a few minutes only. It's just bad, I really cannot stand it, even for this silly movie that makes so much fun to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought the movie from a video store in Santa Monica for the price of $20. I thought it would be a decent movie. I expected a fairly good movie. However, I could not find any positive review about this movie. It's a stupid movie...just horrible. I guess it's made for a video shop...I didn't watch it and I just didn't want to watch it. I was embarrassed about buying this movie and wasting my time. But, the truth is that there are some very decent horror films out there. They're funny, but sometimes stupid, but very scary. But this movie is bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a movie, I suppose, and you may know that you've never seen it. In all of its elements, "The Monster" has the worst horror movie ever made. Its story is poor, its characters are lousy, and it lacks any originality that makes it worthwhile. The plot, though, is good. But the story is bad. I can forgive some of the characters, especially the creepy guy. But you want something original that doesn't suck, you're going to get bored. It's about as boring as a monster movie. The whole thing is about the monsters and they have an uncanny ability to do whatever they want. They are not the only people who have that ability. The only characters who have it are the monsters, and there are very few. There are only a few (outstandings) who actually make the monster act. It just becomes boring when they want to have a storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not really sure why I made this movie. I don't remember when I saw this film. I am sure I watched it once and was left in my seat with no further clues to either end. I'm sure I only watched it, in that way. I have since that time, I have never watched it again.  I'm going to have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of this movie, but I was expecting it to be good. I thought the premise was fun. Unfortunately, this movie was really, really bad. I found it to only be mediocre. I had flashbacks of some movies that I thought were good; this one didn't. My rating was 1/3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts out with a beautiful story that you would really, really enjoy if you had to sit through it. It really isn't. This is a horrible, bad movie that is not capable of making an entertaining, fun movie. This movie, instead of taking chances, is full of bad acting and bad dialog. If you want to watch a movie that has a storyline, you'd better buy a movie with that same story (like "The Road House"). The dialog is awful, and the plot is stupid, but it's also boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie as a teenager on the back of a camo set. I loved it when it was first released, but it was an embarrassing mess when it finally released. The plot was completely incoherent (some parts were interesting but poorly written, the sex scenes were poorly directed and the supporting characters were dull) and the plot failed to find the real emotional value it was supposed to serve. The acting was really bad, and the ending was predictable. The film could have been made in half the time it took to see this film. It's not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You are in the movie business, aren't you? Then you're in a film-making business. Well, you're a screenwriter or creative director or creative in a way, you make movies. But movies are not made for you and they are not designed to be made for the viewer. That is why a film with no clear storyline, no story to help with any of the characters, and no actors that are not part of some kind of movie theater (at all) does not work.  So what is this movie?  The plot is a vague idea, that can easily be confused by the viewer and viewers. I am only going to say that the story itself is a little weak, and the movie does not really help the storyline in any sense.  If you are a fan of the James Dobson, you can watch the first few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can not say why I had so much to watch. I don't remember how, and I've never watched. I was watching "Sister" when I was in the room when "The Outsider" was on in my house, and neither do I remember how it was on at the time. I have not read any of the book, and, it's probably not the type of movie I normally see. Even as a viewer, I think that I would be smart to sit it down. The script is nothing I've ever seen before, and it's really bad. The acting was the worst I've seen before. The camera is terrible. I think the director must be a real jackass. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie would have been a movie about a bunch of hokey teens with big dreams. The acting and acting was too bad to be real. They sounded like they had some kind of retarded dream-story. The fact that the ending (with all the ending!) was a dream, the fact that it made no sense whatsoever, the ending was a bad dream. I mean, I know what dreams can do. They can bring something to happen. That is all that happens in this movie. The ending is just a bunch more pointless things. The film was pretty terrible. It was just like the movie "Stuart Pack. And it was similar to "Guggo!" at school. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to this film as a teenager, and it looked as though it would be well written and directed. Unfortunately, it is a rather disappointing movie - nothing more than a poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted film - a truly disappointing low-end horror movie. The acting is very poor, and the gore is bad and very much in the background. I couldn't bring the movie down to 10, it wasn't that bad, but I would recommend watching it as a child and just see if your kids might like it and not see the parts for adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie on countless occasions, and I have NEVER seen it before! I just recently finished it and was very disappointed to find it "resolved" and what it was.  The only saving grace was that I did have to sit through the whole damn film. The acting and camera-work in it just weren't up to any standard.  I knew it was stupid, but it certainly is not a great story to entertain. The plot was, to say the least, predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something so much wrong about this movie. It is the same boring "reaction" movie I see most of the time and it seems to take the same time for me to jump right into it. It just seems like they just want to sell copies of my book and then wait for me "to change the story". It just is a total waste of money. When I watched this movie I had to read the book on my Kindle because I wanted to find out more about it. I can't give a negative rating of it, I can only give a positive review: it doesn't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main problem with this movie is that it is not interesting enough. The movie is obviously filmed at a really low budget. The good part of the movie is the idea that this movie represents a very unique environment. It could have been done with a cheap budget to do some cool shots, but it doesn't do anything so good. The supporting actors don't make an appearance. This is just one of several low budget horror films from the last decade. This film can only be considered as a bad and pointless movie. This isn't as bad as, say, "the Silent Night" (as some have claimed) because it features some very good actors, some good special effects, and some great special effects. Even though it does look good, it really doesn't come up to be good, which is sad. In fact, this movie should be a comedy movie (and it would have a much better rating if the stars had more talent in their roles), but instead of that, it is just plain bad. Even with all the best possible effects, it lacks an effort in making a memorable movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Ladies Cry" is a bad-movie starring Amanda Dallas (Jennifer Lynn McNulty) in a costume that looks like she was a hippie chick and a dame. It's really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the film was meant to be a straight off Oscar Award nominee, but I'm not sure if the director had any plans. It's bad, but it is a comedy, so it goes on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am one of the few people who have seen this movie and have not watched it enough to really understand. I can't think this is a movie that deserves to be on the national television program.  It is just plain embarrassing garbage. The actors are terrible. They're just looking for attention! The director doesn't care to try to put this together in proper order with decent acting. The characters are horrible. They are terrible, but the characters are pretty good. It is a bad attempt to make this into a decent film, but it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm the biggest fan of "Turtles" and have always wanted this to be a movie with a compelling message that has never been done. But, in spite of any other movie "Turtle" has to be, it just ain't. It's terrible. It just is not about the turtle and a good movie that shows how good people can be, but when people are forced to watch it, the only thing they can do is scream and then turn to the opposite direction for the rest of their lives. I'm sure some of their viewers might even enjoy watching it, but only just if you're dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is a complete waste of entertainment for children who do not know what they are. I have no sympathy for the kids, I will admit that I have never heard of any kind of horror film that could possibly be worse than this one (especially if the horror is something like "Rats". This is simply a dumb, pointless film with a poor story, an incomprehensible plot, an inept characters, a ridiculous characters, and a few stupid scenes. The story is supposed to be about some sort of evil monster who feeds on the souls of children and the child's "survival" is nothing but a completely idiotic and ridiculous storyline. I've seen far more mindless horror films, with the "children" being treated as "heroes", and I expect none of those films to have been so crumpled as this one. This is the only reason I've turned off watching this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has been released since this film's release, but it's still not released. I am glad I saw the film because I've heard of this film a few times on previous occasions. I have only watched this film, so as I watched it I have no idea what it is. The film is just about a movie which has some pretty awful acting and a few odd twists.  I think the production was a little bit better, although the film was so bad I'm afraid I might rate it worse than the last movie I saw.  Overall this movie is terrible, but a lot of things I can't say for sure. The acting was so terrible that I can never forgive myself for saying this film has to be viewed as a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no time to get to the point where this movie was made, and I would have thought they could just get a good script and shoot it. It is no fun, no laughter, no plot. No actors, no action, no dialogue. Just mindless violence. The two characters are so bad, the only thing I can say is that their actors should be put in their shows better. I'm sure my guess would have been better, but the filmmakers just decide to go with the script, and not anything else, and nothing else in this movie works. The characters were obviously in place, and the plot was just too shallow, with nothing interesting to talk about except a couple of scenes of violence which I think were meant to be violent scenes, but I didn't find it. I just wanted to see a real movie: more like a comedy instead of a film based on a stupid thriller. This is just a very disappointing film. It was fun until the plot started being over-the-top with bad acting and stupid dialogue, but now I just hope I don't get another lousy movie with "B" actors and a stupid plot. I don' t see any real message here, but a lot of others are saying it has real value. Maybe it's time to put some real talent back on it and get some real entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first watched this movie, I thought it would be a fun time to watch a couple of comedy movies and I knew it would not be much. But it is no fun for an average family, no matter what family, to watch this movie. I felt very nauseated. I watched it twice, I wanted to see if this is really what we had wanted to watch. Then I decided to shut my ears and not watch this show. Then, when I watched the first episode I said "it's pretty cool". I couldn't believe it. The last episode was the most awful episode I have ever seen. There is one joke that comes true. It was just unbelievable. When I had a chance to finally find the video at the store, I found another movie called "Nahyackah!". I tried to find one where it was advertised. I was unable to find it. I thought I was missing something because it wasn't a movie. They made this show out to trick people with all of the horrible things that go on in their lives. I don't remember what happened but I was sure it had to be a horrible movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the equivalent of "The Boondy." There are very few "good" moments. There are lots of scenes that are extremely boring. Very little humor, very little action, and very little actual entertainment. The plot is predictable, but we don't care too much about it.  I guess you'd have to read the book to know why. The end was not only terrible but the movie had absolutely no storyline. The ending was predictable and we knew something about it would happen. The characters had very little life or character development. The chemistry was lame, the plot was weak and the ending was just awful.  "The Goodies" is a very bad movie. It's about as bad as a movie could be. And if you find it, I highly recommend NOT giving it more of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a bad film I guess the word is. It can only be the worst film. There is no plot, no characters, no laughs, no action, nothing else. The director is so poor he doesn't even let the camera into the theater and even fails to make a decent impression. He tries to make the viewer sympathize with every character (even his own) and then you wonder why. He also tries to show that this is all of his own fault. Some might say it's not his fault, and that it's because it's just not like him to make movies like this. They should be a real-world movie and not something that's just supposed to be a comedy. This is nothing but a waste of money and time. This isn't a satire of the US, it's simply a hack job. This film has so much material but has been put together in a very poor way. I expect better when it's making jokes, not at a low budget. I think it should have been a comedy if it wasn't a slasher piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My expectations for this film were based on its name and the cast which were good. But the acting was horrible. The only good part of the film was the film itself. It was the only part that we cared about.  My only complaint is that the film seems to be out of production now. This could be because of the movie's popularity. I'm not sure. I think it was made as an after-though film because I didn't want to see it if it wasn't. The acting was okay and the film didn't feel like it was in a documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty good in the beginning, but it slowly becomes weak and then it becomes even worse. At the beginning the film is good, but after the halfway point (which was also the way the story played) you become just plain ridiculous and it becomes almost impossible to suspend your attention from this foolish plot. The film is full of bad actors, and bad actors are good actors. But when it's not so bad, you really can't complain too much. The plot, which is pretty predictable, is very weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a laugh at the first few minutes, as I suspected, but it was too bad to continue. Even though it was a very disappointing film, it still managed to make me laugh.  But the worst part was the ending. I don't think I should have seen the entire film just to get a laugh. It would have been a better if the ending ended and you could finally forget all the crazy plot.   A lot of people were expecting a movie set in a hospital, but this just was a waste of time.  I really can't believe they just made it in a few minutes to fill in one of the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, which is so pathetic, that it's only slightly amusing to watch. Unfortunately there are so many dumb stereotypes that it gets tedious.  The film has some nice images, though the characters aren't particularly good.  But there are some glaring missteps of the film making.  Firstly the story is the idea that it was a bad idea to make a film on a planet of aliens. That the film has a protagonist (some guy named "Kai") who was an alien for thousands of years (probably around 5) gets lost. But in this case the protagonist doesn't even try to defend his decision, and the rest of the characters are just like him. So if there was a story, it could have been interesting.  Also the movie features a giant robot named "Futal". It's not an actual robot, because it isn't in fact designed to do anything. This robot is a very primitive robot, but it has a huge collection of extra equipment that we only see on some of the alien species that we come across. What do we do with a robot who has such large equipment? That's not even hinted at the reason why the creature in the film is so ridiculous. This may be due to some of his alien alien friends who made the robot.  Oh well. So, this movie's only problem is that it doesn't really add any interesting value to it, and has a few very strange characters. In one of the previews, there was one scene with the "leader" of the robot, a very stupid and childish-looking guy.  This would have worked better in a horror movie rather than it's a film about space, or aliens. It doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to learn more about one of the most mis-used movies ever made, you should find a copy of this movie and see if you can learn anything about it, like the original story. Alas, the "propert" version of the movie does not include the original plot. Instead, the movie pretends to be a story of murder. No one could have been that stupid. For example, where did anyone get the idea that the killer in the movie had a heart? The killer was a millionaire, and he used to kill people and was very proud to be the "King of Hand. But that guy was just a little dirt, so that guy actually had an heart. But not the same way we suppose it was, is that he murdered a woman and then he was just one guy in a house. And we also learned that the guy was not a millionaire. This is extremely ridiculous, as the movie depicts him getting rich, and a millionaire at the same time. I don't want to get to know anything about the killer's heart. I want to see if it was possible to convince people that this movie is a true story and not just another one of two dozen stupid movies. Even though it is ridiculous, this is a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there is any humor in this piece of trash, then it will be a few laughs. Otherwise, this piece is a complete non-comedy debacle. As the actors attempt to make the characters seem like a typical teen/college drama with a plot that isn't even remotely related to the fact that they are college graduates and thus don't even make any sense to anyone involved in the film. They act like they're acting like their college friends, rather than playing their college-spadad-debunk-film-complex-slash-poster-sucker-dumbard-pige-pulifier-boast-dollard-clown-cater-dentate-dementation-nihilate-vivifying-sick-vibration-dirt-wack-goddard-guzzles-drip-vomit-lumber-for-vog-wob-dunk-with-bull-dump-stomping-for-. This film is like watching a bunch of old movies (or like watching most, but don't let them be like old movies) that you just don't care for, but instead watch so they're entertained. Instead, I found that the plot seemed like a big fat blackhead. If you like old school horror films, then this is about as bad as they get. It's no different than anything else on film, really. A shame because I have seen far better horror movies, and this is pretty low compared to them.  The plot is very simple and just a bunch out-of-order-making-fun-and-crazy-things-that-can-be-fun-. I guess I don't really like how it's trying to build a convoluted plot that is so "in your face" and only exists in one place. At times, I was thinking that the film would be really hard to find. It could have been so much better than this movie. It just seemed to me that the whole movie was some kind of poorly put together college comedy and a bunch a really old, stupid story. The story was very predictable and I didn't even feel involved.  I didn:  I have no feelings towards this movie: not really caring, not seeing enough reason to agree with it, not feeling sorry, no matter what it has to do with it. I don her all my best intentions and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, if I could call it, was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is so badly written, the acting is so poorly done, and the plot is so lacking, the filmmakers have never really come to the depths of their imaginations. A lot of the cast were incompetent at the job. I'd like to see them perform better. The dialogs were not nearly as good as in the other films, and I think the director has got lost a lot of money for his antics. The plot has a certain point-counterpoint that does not go along with the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen this movie, so I can't say too much about it, but if I read any negative review it would turn into an argument about my opinions about it.   This movie was about a couple of people who have a lot of money and have a bad habit of shooting prostitutes in the early 20's and taking advantage of them, with their sex-filled lives as a motivation. I find that this movie is about sex acts that are not even remotely entertaining.  There are two instances where this movie would have been interesting, one of which involves a girl that tries to kill her husband and the other where she kills him. They do nothing that makes me feel better and nothing that has any real value.  It's not a movie about the people and life that it aims to show, the fact that it is about a sex-and-drug-related movie is just that it can't have it. The sex act in which they are making love together is what's upsetting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a woman who, aside from a large collection of personal tragedies, are always in search of an escape from another miserable existence. As I watched this film in the hope of a similar escape I found that I was going to die. What I thought of was not worth watching. It was a shame to waste my time on it. I had hoped it would be a worthwhile adventure but that was a very disappointing conclusion. The only positive thing I can say is that the director, Mr. Cazareffi, is a nice guy. He knows the movie is bad but he is very talented. This is a shame for a film that is nothing but bad. I hope the director would rethink his decision to produce this piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the kind of movie that I don't want to see. It's boring, it's terrible, it just makes you sick. I've already done several rounds of this movie and I've never thought this was a good movie. In fact, it was just awful. I'm going to add more negative reviews to this movie so you can make your own conclusions. I am sorry to say that it was filmed in the late 1990's and it was so horrible that I had to turn it off! I can't even watch it to watch it because I've done several of my movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just one of those dumb movies that are just awful. You know, I don't think you get to sleep through it and see the story the way you want to, but you don't want to see the way the movie goes. The way you get that idea is to watch it with other people in order to see how dumb it is.  What's funny is that this is the only movie with real stars in it. Most other movies don't even have actors. In a good way, they make a good movie, but as they are, there are really no stars.   I don%T give this one 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest mistake of all time and the most disappointing piece of trash I've ever seen. There are three people and a bunch of people who have got this. It's a horror story that features a homeless man who gets dumped by a friend, and is then followed by a woman who makes out with him, and a girl whom he falls in love. It has nothing to do with real relationships, nothing to with any logic. It is stupid, pointless, pointless and ridiculous. Don't watch it. Don anything. It doesn't matter. You're going to lose sleep if you wait. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Lonely In The Dark" is, like "The Matrix" of the Matrix. Not even the best of the two. The plot is completely irrelevant, and the characters are dull. I can't believe that anyone in this film is able to pull the most complicated job possible.  I had a lot of fun with the old series, but this film was simply horrible.  If you're going to watch it, don't! Don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. I have not seen many movies that were so utterly depressing that we just can't stop watching them.  This is a really awful movie and I wonder why anyone gives this film any real meaning or merit. I don't even have the sense of humor to have laughed. The only thing that keeps me from turning it off is the terrible dialog that it has. The plot, even the actors that make it up, is pathetic. The acting is absolutely wooden.  I can only hope that the director of this film had the patience to turn it into something resembling something that exists. But I'm afraid that it will never be anything more like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is a movie with a storyline (or one involving two actors with a "stalker" situation) then it gets much better. What we get is nothing, except an awful plot and the fact that it is a horror-movie.  Why bother? It's just a movie that looks like a made-for-movies with no substance whatsoever. A terrible one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's the difference between a good movie and a bad one? How do I define that difference? I can't think of any common characteristics to each of these types of movies, and only a few things are common.  In the end, these two movies are about the same thing. Even though they are different, I can tell them to be similar. This can't be explained. I guess if you are going to review this movie as a horror film, it's going to be pretty grim, and I can only assume that the two horror films we are looking for have similar grimness. What a tragedy is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has nothing about a character who gets away and continues to steal and murder at the local cinema for his own fun. There's an odd feeling in the film when a small group of people suddenly get a movie that turns into a slasher flick.  When the villain, the head of the movie's gang, finds out that this was happening, he kills everyone in the theater by driving a stolen car to the theater that starts in front of the theater he planned to kill. He also kidnaps everyone in front to make sure that everyone is dead.  The ending is about to turn into a murder film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Weird" is a movie about a gang of evil thugs that kidnap a girl in order to torture her for her pleasure. That is pretty much what it is. It is very predictable and the script is not even very good, except for a couple of actors who can make a couple lines, but unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this film. If you are not familiar with the film, then you will lose all of the plot points. The dialogs are terrible and the story is absolutely ridiculous. I was disappointed that this movie was promoted by people as being original and entertaining. There is absolutely nothing original about this movie. The only thing that is original about it is its lack of a plot. The plot is totally predictable and just one person (the "Lord") plays a key role. Even the characters are not developed enough for their characters to have any other role. If there are two girls who kidnap each other in order, what happens in the story? The story is so basic that you can't tell anything about it. I highly recommend watching this movie without seeing it again. The movie has quite a few interesting scenes but there is no payoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, that's it. No wonder if someone had a good idea and some good actors, the story would be great but it's not. What makes it a "thrizz" is the awful camera direction. The entire plot revolves around the story of an old lady who takes off her underwear and shows off to the camera. In another bad movie of a girl who is forced to take off her clothes in order to win over the "bad boy" (not to mention the "good guy" who she wins over), a little girl is kidnapped by the police and forced to have a role in a movie that contains the word "bad" and thus forces her to have an emotional reunion with her boyfriend. And the ending of the movie is awful, as well. It's a very silly and unfunny ending, it's a bad plot and it's just awful. A horrible movie: 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this one, they tried to create a plot based around the killing of some sort of serial killer. The plot was very predictable, and that is not helped by the characters acting in them. I found it extremely disappointing. Even when the killer was being a part of the plot, they just couldn't do it in a believable way. The fact that the killer would do a few more murders and then get arrested, made the entire thing more disappointing. I was looking for a movie about the killer, and this was one of the most disappointing movies I had ever seen. In spite of that, I was willing to watch it, but I think I would have done better if I had gotten a copy of the DVD instead of a DVD. It is horrible to hear how they put this together. I've just about finished my own personal collection of pictures of the genre, and I cannot imagine that this movie will ever be worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really just a bunch of garbage. Its a waste of time to watch. I wouldn't even watch this if I was in the mood for watching comedy!  My recommendation is to avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is not even remotely interesting, unless you have seen it in other movies and think you have never seen it before (though i did not see it before, i saw it in the cinema and had no idea of a film with a plot or the like). if you have watched it, you will just be annoyed. I know it has gotten better since it was released, but this has a ridiculous rating, which i wonder if it has a real message.  so, to keep the same rating i am leaving the original "2-2-3" rating, I will leave the DVD of "2" and put it in a DVD on the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was so terrible that I literally couldn't even mention it until I saw it in a local cinema. The plot is very weak, there are no plot-motions, no real plot-plot-plot, and the acting wasn't much better than a punch line to my face.   What is this movie going to teach? Who will say that this movie is a really good movie? Some movie producers (including the producers of the movie) might call this movie a romantic comedy. Well, I've read this movie, and it's not exactly that, but it's so bad that I can't really blame them. This movie can only be regarded as a terrible movie - so bad it is!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is bad...bader than the one before it. The acting was bad, the dialog was bad but the scenes weren't that interesting... I couldn't really see it's storyline. And the best thing about this movie is the ending. It doesn't really make the movie better and it doesn't make you care. I'm not sure how much I could watch this one or where I'd even go for it.... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a simple "BULLY" plot of a couple who get married in a couple of months and end up having a sex scene that takes place in the shower... well, they're both married, right?!?!?!, and that's why the movie is so terrible. The acting is terrible and the story is weak. It's hard to believe that a movie that was supposed to be about a couple that got married and then a sex romp is able to create a plot that is so badly written, not even capable of making laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have never thought I would be interested in a movie with this horrible plot, but in my case it just plain plain sucks.  It's bad for all of the characters except for the villain (not the evil one), and this villain should never have made it to a film. In fact he should never be in a film with him.  There are few things in the story that make this movie interesting. There's some good humor but the movie is so bad that it was no fun. I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a bad film this is. I really thought that the film would be a film which would be interesting and have a good plot. But the acting was terrible, the plot wasn't even remotely interesting. The script didn't have much flow and it seemed like a bit like a series of short scenes.  I would have liked to see the return of the original character as he is now. I could easily get into the film and see if the actors would take advantage of the new environment in which the film has been created, but they just seemed like another thing that was not quite fit.  The only way I felt was that the new character was developed was to replace his character in the original one. The original character didn't seem like an anti-human person and there was plenty of fun where they had fun with the old guys, it was just a bit boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a truly awful movie in an uninspired horror-movie genre with the unfortunate (or to me) villain (that was in previous versions) as a necromancer. The villain does a lot of horrible things in the story that just doesn't make sense or work. For example, one of the girl's friends is raped by his boss and then gets in a fight with a bunch of monster thugs. How can they take so many people at random and put them on one side to fight them. The vampire is also supposed to be the daughter's sister. This is obviously too much of a horror-film to be a good movie but I guess the director had an idea for a horror movie and didn't want to stick with "the formula" which would normally take a lot more. The rest of the film is basically a rape sequence which has nothing to do with the actual sex involved. The plot is OK, but I think it would be better if they didn't be like that. If you're going to see this, try a good horror movie: I won't be responsible for the name but this one might actually be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had originally planned on watching this film so I'll be happy to see more from it. But after the first 25 or so minutes of it I started to think, 'What the hell is this movie?' And before I started feeling the film was just a bunch of scenes for my little collection and then I saw the ending. After the ending I couldn't believe it was just an ending. The ending seemed to drag it all out and not even the ending seemed like a thing. I know I'm not alone in this kind of movie so I didn't want to waste my time checking out and checking out all the minuses and minuses. But I did just find this film worth a couple of hours of watching. But if you are going to watch the movie in it's entirety then you're going to be very disappointed if you're not going to enjoy it. I don't want you to be disappointed. So, if you want to see this film then take your time. But don't expect too much from it, and certainly don't think it's a good movie. The acting wasn't quite as good as I expected. The story seems to be a bit too serious, but it really is the typical clichéd plot of some of the older movies I find to be the kind of clichéd stories you might find. I think they have it all wrong. The movie seemed to have lost most of its intended purpose. And there were a few scenes that I wouldn't even give my attention to just because they were part of the plot. I thought they would be interesting but it wasn't. The actors seemed to be getting more and more involved, the movie was just not as good a film as I was expecting. The scenery didn't quite fit the plot, I thought there was some scenes that seemed more interesting to me than the ones where the movie showed on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is some of the worst film ever produced, the worst movie ever made! A lot of actors/actors, stupid story and lousy acting, horrible scenes and bad film. It's not that bad...it just got bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well it was alright, I don't think the first season of G-Noon was bad enough to make it an interesting part. And I can't fault the movie for taking it as a comedy, but it didn't deliver anything worthwhile. It looked like a lot of dead or missing people were in the movie and the plot was a flat one. The only good thing was the special effects, although it was pretty terrible. It had a lot more depth than it could have been in that it was good on some side of the story, but the cast were so incompetent it just left me wondering whether it had ever been like that. A lot of the acting was good but the script was very bad. It just got me so annoyed I just wanted to punch the director. I think you would probably go for one of the sequels. It was so bad that it just shows how bad Hollywood can be. If you watch the first series, you will be left feeling that it wasn't funny, that it didnn't have a good script and it had a terrible plot. The plot was OK but it just didn't have enough depth to go far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is no "B" if you want to make a horror flick, and you don't want to see any. But, "B's" is not one of the better horror films I have seen. It's like you're watching a movie made on the road and then you watch some of it...and then you realize that you don`t know what the plot is.   The acting is bad, the directing is terrible, the sets are terrible, and the director is bad.  If you enjoy a little gore in a horror film like this, you can watch it once, but you don\'t want to sit through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is as bad as the rest of the Saw films - I mean I know that when we made the Saw 2 we were making a sequel and all the sequel was a waste of my time. It's as bad, even worse than the Saw 1. The plot is so vague and confusing that it doesn't make any sense - I've never been that kind of person to be convinced that the film is interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. The ending was so bad. It's like a drunk chick doing a bunch of jokes. Just one of the countless examples of this crap that i saw in movies, none of which seemed interesting to anyone. The acting was really terrible. What happens if you get raped? The only reason i watched this movie is because I watched it twice. And i was disappointed with this movie. Even the actors who played the two characters in it seemed flat, with only one person saying anything more than his lines, and one person singing the song for the "girl". It seems more like they're acting like two little girls who are on the run around the corner. They are basically trying to make the film "sympathetic" and then they give you an idea that it's not. There's some weird moments where they make the characters in a kind of torture to see how they got the idea, but instead of showing some thought that it was, you just see the horrible, horrible characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie was about a plot, it would have worked out better. The main problem is that it is totally ridiculous. The protagonist, a woman with the very best name in the world, goes on to save the world (or, we assume she is the best person in the whole world) but it seems that the rest of the movie is just following her lead and being dragged into the absurd situation.  The movie is about a bunch of teenagers who go on to steal a boat in a desperate situation. One of them dies of a mysterious illness, and she finds a corpse on the side of the boat. She then proceeds to steal the boat in order to bring her mate, also a teenager, to safety. A woman with a perfect name and the best name ever happens to die on the boat and then starts a relationship with her brother, which starts out sounding weird and then becomes unbearable. The rest of this movie is merely filler, with each scene needing a different premise.  I'd like to think this movie would be a bit better if they changed it up and gave it to a bit more interesting people. Maybe the original film was intended to be more interesting, but this is just bad. The idea of going to the "Cargo" movie is OK, but I'm afraid it's too much to bear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a laugh, I couldn't take it. It is the worst I have ever seen. I watched it at the Movies Club and then at the local supermarket. What fun was there? I had fun at the movie theater, but I couldn`t wait to see the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, like this film, lacks any meaningful plot. The characters are simply caricatures. It seems so strange that the movie was written, and they're the two lead actors. What was the point in that? The characters and the dialogue are so poorly written, that you're convinced that they weren't even actors, that the characters are just actors with a costume and a script. For example, this plot hinges on the idea of a female vampire hunter named "Elven," which seems so ridiculous that it's almost almost funny. The plot's premise seems so absurd that you wonder why it would even be possible to use it as a movie, as it seems that the writer is an idiot.  What? The writer can't even write a negative critique about a movie: the characters, all of which are cartoon characters, are just caricatures that you'd like to see instead of actual people. It would be so funny if they'd make more of them.  I couldn't even begin to make jokes about this film: it's just plain bad, the characters aren't much better, the story is bad, and the plot is bad (it really takes away all the magic, and then gives a plotless story). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why I was so stupid to rent this movie. I knew I was going to spend a few hours viewing it as I sat through the rest of it. I thought it was going out of my reach at a local movie theater. I can't imagine why I ever chose to rent the movie after reading the review to see if it was truly. This movie was a complete piece of crap, the director should have left it to the trash. This story is extremely stupid and could have been made better for by not wasting the time on the movie. If you want to rent a movie, just rent one of the classics! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, if I'm being honest, is pretty bad. For some reason, I like the storyline that involves the characters getting into a "trouble with the gods". The movie was nothing like that. At least the original storyline (the gods have a lot of money) was cute and very interesting. Unfortunately, the characters just got so lost. That's okay if you like a bit of humor, but a lot don't, and this is all too bad. In fact, the script is really bad, but not as bad as I originally thought. I had a bit fun with the original plot, but now I have to decide whether or not I'll watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title says it "Wanna What?", but I can see no reason to see this movie. This movie is so bad, it's almost the only way to escape from the Matrix, and that's all I can say. They should have added a title that says this movie is awesome, and this title has to be the most ridiculous title that I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Pemulvigar" is a very poorly conceived movie that goes nowhere. It starts to be a pretty entertaining comedy but has a very shallow and uninteresting storyline. At the beginning, the movie is a pretty decent one, but once it's begun to become a completely lame movie, you'll start laughing out loud. Even when the plot is good, the characters don't care too much about them. Even the scene with the tiger has been incredibly bad and disappointing. It's too bad that a few actors had the same kind of characters as the ones in the first, which was more exciting than the sequel.   The movie itself is really awful, the dialogue was pretty funny, but the direction and camera movements were too long. The shots have been horrible, the scenes have been bad, and the cinematography is terrible. You have to really think about the movie. In this movie, it's really hard to believe that the film is a "documentary". Even when it was pretty interesting and funny at the beginning. The characters are just terrible actors. Don't go see this movie if you have no expectations. It really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are three reasons that this film is so terrible that this must be made a TV show. First of all, the lead actress can't act. Second, it is completely incompetent. Third, the script is poor. If the first two aren't bad enough, then the third is also bad. This is simply a waste of money, but at the same time, I can't blame the filmmakers for having to put so much time and money into the film. I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, but what the hell is the number of actors who can actually act? I was expecting something better from them, but this is just a slap of paper excuse to do a bad film, and I think this is the only thing I can say they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for something interesting in the first episode, when I found out that the other part was the first one, I was a bit surprised. The first episode was interesting - i found it fun - but was the second episode not. The third episode (with a totally predictable story) proved to be nothing but a boring one. The movie was only about 4 hours long, and it is so bad, I never found out what could be done with this movie. And I've seen so many good horror movies, but I can't believe I'd be paying for this one. And worst of all, this movie was not made with great attention - you really can't see it all. You can't even see how scary it is. I'll give this movie 4 out of 10, if you want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad it is almost impossible to enjoy watching. The story line is very poor. I thought I could have found some clever lines if I read about the war and its origins. Instead, I kept watching and waited for hours. I was too tired. At one point during the movie, they showed a very similar picture to the war-inspiration that had been in the war of 1940. Not only was the plot not original, but there were a lot of very predictable situations that I didn't understand at all. Also, they kept showing the same scene over and over. What? Did they show the same same scene? They should have. There are plenty of reasons for this, but it just seemed like it was a very stupid idea. They have got better stuff out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I can't find the original source for this story, so I will just assume that its a documentary, i.e. not broadcast. I think it is based on some kind of misused footage and some of the actors, but not necessarily the characters. What the film tells is that the story revolves around the kidnapping of a child in an abandoned house and that the parents were not aware that the boy was missing. I thought this was a stupid plot at first, but then after I was satisfied by the other parts of it I began to think that it was OK. However, I quickly noticed that it is a rather pointless plot. The story is not about finding the kidnapper, it's about finding your kidnapped child and it tells nothing about what happens when the kidnackers arrive and it leaves out. When I was looking through the story I noticed that the kidnappers (the father) are not shown on camera. They are in a house, I suppose because the police are involved in the investigation. The kidnapper(probably the father) is shown in a couple of scenes that you can see on the television. I do wonder what they are doing because there is not enough background to show the kidnacher. This film seems to be very much like the original.  I do recommend people not bother watching this film. It's extremely boring and pointless. The acting is horrible, the photography is bad and the camera is not consistent. I would recommend a second or even better option to watch this film, i am just so bored after 15 minutes of watching it. You need to be a grown man to believe that this film is a documentary! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was very predictable and the film had very disappointing performances, but what were the reasons for such a disappointing film? I have to confess I found this to be extremely disappointing. The whole movie was filled with an awful set of characters. The story seemed to drag on but I don't know if it was. The ending was even worse. The director had all but one idea that was the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was incredibly horrible. The film would have been better to watch, if it weren't for the endless plotless dialog. In this film, you want to sit down and read a book on the same side of the bed, just so you can say you're not watching this movie.  This movie is really the opposite of the book, because in the book the characters are all a mess. In the movie, the characters all seem to be, at best, very naive and trusting people. In fact, it was extremely irritating that the characters would get so involved in the plot of the film. In one case, the protagonist would fall for his girlfriend's love in an effort to save her life. In another case, he would fail to understand that his relationship with his girlfriend would end in a horrible way. The worst thing in the movie is the final sequence. It is only a handful of scenes where the characters manage to escape a horrible fate that had threatened to kill them. The ending is extremely unsatisfying, considering the complexity of the storyline.  The scene with the girl was the only time in the film that I found to be entertaining, but overall, the film failed to deliver. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a ridiculous idea. I watched it at a video store as a kid. It was a complete failure, but I didn't understand why I kept buying it and it didn't make sense to me. I was expecting the story of a family of "people with very big guns" and a woman who was trying to get rid of her wife's gun. The woman could not keep her gun in her own hands because she was afraid she would accidentally kill herself. A couple of older women were there, and they seemed to be trying to take advantage of a gun. It just turned out to be just another stupid stunt to be used on the kids. The movie ended up with a bunch of actors (including the actors from "The Air Force" ) who try to go ahead and film some action. But then the film started getting a little bit better. Some actors had some neat scenes and scenes, but most of them were lame.  The only interesting parts I can remember were when the guy finally gets out of his car and runs away. I thought he looked really good. But the fact that he was in a car and wasn't wearing his body armor and was able to shoot at double speeds only added to the boring plot. I don't know how he made it all up. The best thing was that they made it look as though it was a real movie. It is not.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really disappointed after seeing this movie...I didn't even care if I was sick or not to see it anymore...there was nothing to make me want to see this film. The movie had just one or two moments that were decent. Now the movie had more of a "feelgood" scene and then nothing and then a few minutes of "good" drama but then, well, the acting was bad. And there was nothing that made me want even to see the movie. The whole thing was just bad...I don't remember what they were thinking with the idea of the "WOW" storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea of this film is that "a girl is a lesbian and she wants to save the boyfriend". So they're all mad, she needs to go out to find them. It is really just a pity that this film wasn't developed properly.  This film does not present the situation accurately. The lesbian wants to meet her boyfriend, as a straight guy, and while he isn't, she does not want to be with him sexually. The story was just too stupid to be developed, and even the best "gay" movies do not do so much justice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When i watched this movie i thought that it was like some of my old high school years. I watched it thinking it would be interesting but that the movie didn't seem like it was fun or interesting. The idea of this movie is that it is a horror movie where all of the people are scared by a black vampire who kills everyone and everyone else in the city. That wasn't the case at all. The vampire actually looked very normal. I mean, it looked like he was wearing a mask that was made for somebody with very long hair and in very few was able to remove it. The guy was pretty creepy looking like a normal vampire but was very little more frightening than he looked in a mask and mask. The only good thing I noticed was that the person was a black and they obviously did not go through the whole thing alone. This movie really had a bad plot. The thing that made me think of horror movies was the way that the vampire went through the entire story. It looked like some person had been stabbed in the throat, and he had started stabbing the person as a baby or at some point while he was still in the womb. The person in the head wasn't even dead. There wasn't anything gruesome in it. I was pretty surprised to see it in a movie. The acting was very low and the story wasn't interesting. It was a really bad movie but unfortunately didn't have much to say. I don't know if it was a sequel to a movie I had watched 10 years ago but it looked so close to the first one that it got me to do some research on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a good movie but this one is terrible. It's just like when a cartoon is released, you know it's bad but when you are watching it you can only tell that it's too bad.  If you've been watching more movies you know that they usually do something more than mediocre, I don't think this is true in this case.  This movie is a bit of a "solution", in that it is not really even a movie, but you're left to make up the story yourself instead of relying on someone else's story, which usually can't even tell you how the movie works. Even if you're doing a comedy and there are some comic situations that make the movie better, it's simply about having a horrible situation.  I'm going to tell you the best movie: "B" by the Red Cross, which I never saw because of my lousy taste in seeing people, but I think it's the best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is pretty simple. One guy kills another person, and so it's really a murder. The murderer is a big guy. What does it take a small guy to do that?? I think it's fairly obvious that you can see the guy committing the murder. But, I'm surprised to learn that the killer's inebible blood was in a black suit. He has to be the killer.  If you have a good sense of humor, you can't see how this is going to make it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If a movie like this was made for the public to watch, I'm surprised that there are no trailers.  The fact that this is essentially a cheap and unfixable movie is surprising. Not only is the plot a waste of its meager points - the dialog is weak and the plot is too vague. A good story would involve a simple but straightforward example of an old man that tries to escape from a bad prison and get into the criminal's inner circle. But then this movie is all about how he and his wife were murdered in the same manner and the ensuing divorce is a re-boot of the story, in which they decide to get rid of the dead husband and live together. Then they decide how to get the body back. But there is absolutely no sign that they were murderers. The film is completely self-contained with no real story.  Not only are the characters poor, but the scene when the body is pulled out of the garage and then tossed in a pile on a pile of dirt that has been thrown away for more than a decade has been shown on previous DVD sets. The first scenes were just about that.  My guess is that it's not even a horror movie. I mean, that is not too strong a word. The title says it all, and you would think that it would be a horror film. But I think it was just some people with no common sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm on the fence with this movie. I've seen it before. It is simply bad. It's simply bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is as bad as a lot of bad movies. In the case of some movies, it is the movie of the worst movies ever. If you enjoy movies, you should be aware that you should not see this movie unless you are a serious fan of James Bond and you know who he is. This movie is nothing more than a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a total waste of some of the characters. I think there should have been more. There was only a brief and a one bit more scene of the day that really helped the overall plot.  I was looking for the 'Lennon & Friends' TV show and I got a bit surprised that it got two stars and a bit of a decent performance from Christina Ann Merino as a character named "Pucko." But the movie only got 2-3 and not even a full-time supporting performance from either of the two stars.  The best part of the film was the ending. It really was the worst. I will admit that the ending should have had been a much better one. I am not the type that goes for the typical "I won't accept any stupidity" movie. It is simply too predictable and it got really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen, I have had it before and it was worse. I have no idea why this movie was even made. In fact, I had just returned to the old "St. Varnadone" at some point, and I am guessing that that is the reason.  I guess what happened to it - I do not remember it. I do however think that there are some people who have seen this movie and have enjoyed it, as it is no less predictable than the standard films of the era.  The story begins in the early 1960s and concerns a group of youths who were trying to get to their own room after being bullied by their parents, but they are interrupted by the intervention of an ex-boy friend who is supposed to be protecting them. They soon arrive at a party where another strange woman joins them. The girls are then put on the bus, and at the first stage are led to another place which is the residence of their parents. This movie also features a rather odd plot. There is a mysterious creature, and there is an old man who has stolen a little box of insects and intends to make it into a bigger box with insects from the box. This box is located in a small building with an alley, and then, for some reason, it is locked. When they get there, they find it empty and some insects are released. They are immediately attacked by one of the insectoids, which the group has decided to keep a safe distance from the other girls. This is also apparently the only movie in which a girl was attacked by insects. There are some scenes that are not shown, and one of them has a woman in the room taking her underwear off and showing it to the others. She is not wearing any underwear at all. The main character is a woman, and it seems like she can only be in a short skirt.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a terrible mess. Don't waste your time with this one and don't watch it again. It's bad. Please don't waste a time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing to come from this movie was the ending which was really quite interesting. Unfortunately, this is a waste of precious time and money on a lousy movie.  Overall, this movie is a pretty terrible waste of time and resources. The acting is awful, the storyline is bad and the dialogues are really weak. What the hell is happening?? The movie stars a very over-worked actress who was obviously made a lot of money from this film and wasted it in such a poor movie. The script is OK, and it's not bad by any means, but the fact that the movie does not take place in the real world is sad. In this case it features a female co-star who is clearly supposed to be the lead but the only movie is made in a movie set in a completely unrealistic environment.  I really cannot recommend this movie to anybody. It's just bad. The end of the movie was extremely over-written and the ending was so bad that it really spoils the quality of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a bad slap in the face. The film begins with a young, skinny, bald man named Jackpot (Tim Masterson) and his friend "Johnny White" (Rory Masterson). The story of these guys is something I have never heard before. Not a great film but the premise is a decent premise if you're a serious film maker. Unfortunately, it falls flat. Not only does the character of Jackpot suck but that character is ineffectual. There is nothing that you can even say that "Johnny" is not an asshole. The characters are flat as well, there is little plot and nothing really makes sense. There are two guys with different sets of sex and personalities but the movie is only half successful. In the end, the movie revolves around a female in a bad mood. What a joke...  The dialog is also awful. You are just a few moments ago in the movie where you realize that you really want to get to the end of this movie. So it's a bad case since there is no payoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those films of a bunch of people (including my wife) who want to read something stupid but like a silly piece of nonsense to entertain their brain with but just like a dull movie that you'd like to see if the person in it had some brains. I'd be willing to say that the entire film is a waste of good entertainment. The plot is pretty stupid, but in the end it actually manages to be funny and quite uninspected. It's just another dull excuse to avoid the idea of a serious movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are terrible, they are horrible, it is really terrible.  It is impossible to see anybody as interesting as the characters. I am really feeling disappointed in the direction this movie went, not really sure what it is that is supposed to be.  I will admit I went to the movie on Friday because it was recommended that it would be an interesting movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver anything more.  If you want to see a movie with a good storyline and some decent acting, this is the movie for you.  Don't see this movie! It is the worst movie I've seen in awhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just a waste of precious resources. The story is really bad, the cast is bad, and the ending is awful. I was looking forward to this film when it was released, and it didn't deliver. I didn't like this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was absolutely predictable, with predictable and predictable actions. There was one plot that actually worked, but that was far too predictable. The movie could be viewed as a serious statement of how the future will look like. We had all the answers and we could take for granted that the future would be the way it is now. The ending is about to come and it's a shame to see such a movie with a storyline that could have easily been put together. The idea of a computer system is just so bad, especially coming from someone who thinks that it's not really a computer... The only thing that works is for the actors.  This movie does nothing but a big shock to anyone who has worked in a computer department or a computer game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a mess - a collection of non-sense-saves, plot-tricks and no-nonsense special effects - but it does have something, in the end. You might say that it has something, but that just is not enough.  This is the only thing that got me to watch. The script is bad, the characters are bad and the story is bad. The only thing I can find in this movie is that it doesn't even manage to deliver what it claims it does.  In the end, I have to conclude that I just sat on this and tried to force myself to buy it. It is a horrible waste of time and time - a poor movie - but at the very least it has a point. This movie needs to be a much better piece of work - I just cannot recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this film is that it has nothing to do with a movie: it doesn't have any character or plot or anything else that really does anything but throw together and then there is a huge plot involving an alien race whose name is "The Hive." the movie features a bunch of little aliens that are so little it almost doesn't seem like they're real people. The "Hive" looks very like the Aliens from The Matrix, and the characters look like their counterparts in The Alien Blaster! Oh, but this is a movie about a bunch more aliens, who are forced to hunt down one of their own species while they try to exterminate the "Hives" before their very long, very long time, life.  The only good thing in the movie is the special effects, especially for the "Alien Blaster" which features some pretty cool effects including a huge red alien that is about to vaporize all the aliens. I didn't realize until I first saw this film that these effects were in the original Alien Blaster, but it's so much worse than it is today that you wonder how they're done. The only other special effects in the film were "the ship's hittles," which were, in general, only for the aliens who were, apparently, not infected. There was also the huge, slow-moving ship which I thought they used for a few scenes, which actually look very good. This is where I'd like to start the discussion of the film's lack of originality, and my suspicion as to why they used that effect.  This film was, in my opinion, very bad because of the fact that the story has so much of the beginning and the end to its story. For example, you can see exactly what's happening before the "The Hives" invasion, and this film doesn't tell you anything about it. This movie is just a bunchof mindless, dumb, dumb aliens who try to destroy the other people that you might not want to spend time looking at, unless you really feel like watching a movie. There's also a "Alien World" which seems to be the same as the book, but with a completely different tone. The film is mainly just boring, not even good. If you like this type of movie, you should be glad that it's not about you, and not you can find anything to add to your life with, because it's hard to say you're a real "Science Fiction" fan
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched this show, I didn't know what it was. I didn? And it turns out I don't either. I think I know what this show is but don't have a clue what it is. The movie is just like that guy and his cousin who get involved in a crime that turns into a kidnapping scheme? No. No. How did this work? The ending just leaves me wondering why the people were killed. I've seen a show like that before, but the ending of "Crimpers" isn't as bad as it seems to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is bad. It is only about 2 minutes and a few minutes and the story is completely unbelievable.  I do not believe that this is just a movie for fun. If it were a movie where you can escape to the future, it would have some interesting scenes. However, it really is not. The acting is very poor, especially the young male actor. The story line is poor too.  All this is bad, except for that I found this interesting for the "guilhers" storyline and the love storyline that it was trying to portray.  It is worth watching only if you want to watch some of the other movies on the TV Channel. Otherwise, you may as well waste your time trying to read a boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a collection of clichés and crummy things, like a movie with "the big bad guy" who is stalking some women for months. It's bad.  The big bad is a big bad in every way, making it difficult for the actors, and the story is too long and poorly developed.  I've never laughed so badly before. The end of it is just dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bad Dog" is a terrible film:  This film is a complete rip-off of the original film. It looks like a car accident and a car crash at a motel. The whole plot revolves around the fact that an old man makes a deal with a black girl. While being chased by the car, he loses her and gets his daughter.   This movie was made on the cheap side of the Hollywood stage, and it wasn't that cheap. The acting in this movie is appalling. If the original movie had some redeeming qualities, the script was interesting and entertaining. The problem is that the movie is so bad that it can hardly be believed to be a "movie". The characters are so poorly acted that they become virtually nonexistent. The film sets up all the things to be so predictable that no one could make a serious assumption about who was really involved in the car crash. I would have laughed in the face of this movie if I had known what it was going to do.  There are some interesting twists in the movie, but the plot isn't what you would expect. It isn't good enough to be that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is extremely predictable. Everything is predictable...except the plot. The film is a very simplistic tale. In what sense is it to expect an intelligent woman to have two boyfriends and the resulting drama is very simple.  The only thing that happens is the two end-story subplot and this really is the worst part of the movie. This film has the same dumb, predictable plot for every film. It is so predictable that it is no wonder it is so disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not quite good, but it made the movie even worse. There were times where the characters got lost. A lot of the comedy had been done already, and there were times when the movie just happened and the characters were just stuck there, waiting to move on. And the movie seemed to lose some steam. I didn't really understand it and there wasn't a good reason for this movie.  In some respects, this movie was similar to "The Last of the Living" (as opposed to "A Place Among the Gods"). But it was still lacking in what made it so good. Maybe it would have been better to make a more coherent film with a storyline. I think that, overall, "Pete's Mind" should be a better movie. But the plot is pretty dull and the movie suffers from its lack of direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As it stands, I think it's all about 2 things. One, it is about people trying to save the world (and for some reason, it makes no sense). Two, it's about stupid people who want nothing but sex with people that are really not very nice. The film is about a movie starring a blonde named Amanda Messicane who, as well as being married, is very dumb, particularly as she is forced to get pregnant in order to have sex with her husband. It does not help that she looks pretty good, and in a lot of shots is shown as a young girl. The problem with this movie is that while she is young, she is extremely annoying as the two brothers find each other. This is not a bad film - although I was very tired and annoyed with this film - it can not help but make her seem like she is a stupid person. All in all, if you are a child, this would probably make you angry and unhappy. As for the two older brother and their father, it doesn't help that the film is also about stupid things. The father, in the middle of his family, thinks that he can use this time to "save the world". It is a good idea, but only for a small child like Amanda Messacane. When they do that, they are left alone with each other - that's it. Not so much, but in this case, they had also put Amanda into sex with each of the other (and her sister). This is the only film that I can say I didn't like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I had to find out that the plot was nothing it was supposed to be and it took me about 10 minutes to figure out why. The fact that "God of the Movie: A Woman's Story" is actually a documentary is not worth considering. The script was lousy. There was a bad "story" in it. I cannot believe I paid $150 to rent this movie and I do not remember anyone ever saying that it was great. The camera is poorly positioned and poorly lit. The only reason that this film gets better than "The Naked Truth" is that it is obviously not a documentary. The story is just the "story of a lady in the movie who goes into a hospital in order to find a pregnant woman who had fallen pregnant and was very pregnant. I just cannot believe the director chose this story. The film tries to have a storyline where the "movie is about" and fails to do so. There are a lot of clichés and clichés in the film including the "visions" made by the actress who is obviously the director. It was almost impossible to figure which was the "ninth and last film of this movie. In most instances it seems as if someone is trying to make a documentary instead of a movie. This must disappoint many people, because this film is just about a woman who goes in search for a pregnant lady and discovers that she was pregnant. The ending is predictable. If you are looking for a documentary about a pregnant pregnant woman, this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was just a waste of time and there is no way that this movie could have worked.  The plot was really stupid and it just wasted a huge time on the story and the plot has become so convoluted and convoluted. It is a huge waste of money on this movie. It was a waste because this movie was nothing more than a money grab. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When "Frog Wars" comes out on DVD this year, it'll be a lot of people wondering why there's a bunch of dumb villains. Some of them are very good, but this one really just can't sing. I've seen most of the sequels, and the two that are "The Expendables" and "I, The Phantom Men" are pretty good, although I find "Fahrenheit 115" to be rather dull. The problem is that "Froksy the War" really doesn't fit the story, although it does manage to deliver some pretty good action. There's only one person who's ever killed a cartoon robot, so it's pretty silly that the other ones can just ignore it and move along without a great deal of trouble. There was a lot more to see in the film, but it didn't really get there. The acting is quite bad, the plot is extremely convoluted, the characters don't make any real appearances other than to be a monster, and there's really only one thing that happens. The movie isn't all that bad, but there are some pretty bad parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people think "Deadwood" is a really good movie, but they can't say it's a "good movie" due to the fact that it's nothing like a good movie. For example, there's the infamous "The Man" (I'll get the last name) and a very boring movie.  In this movie, there are three dead people who go through a series of death scenes; they are all in bad conditions, but the characters do not seem to act in a way to make them seem like people who deserve to die. This movie does the same.  This movie just doesn't know where it is. The acting is very bad.  I guess you might watch it for horror value, but you might find it boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's no wonder why a film set in New York would have a theme like this. In this case, the theme is a little too obvious and it's not even a plot. There is absolutely no story, no character, no supporting characters. What happened is merely a ridiculous and pointless tale of a serial killer whose victim is a serial cop. It's an effortless waste of time. Avoid this film at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an extremely pointless waste of the entertainment value of any other movie of it's type. The most disappointing piece of cinema is this movie, that's all. For the first two and half of the movie, I was really bored, but after a couple of hours, I realized that I had the time to watch it. Unfortunately, it isn't a movie I will ever watch.   What a lot of people say is that this movie is better than "The Matrix", or any other movies that aren't related to a computer game or movie. For a computer graphics oriented movie, this movie was extremely poor. It had nothing. It was nothing I would want to see for my own entertainment.  I can't blame this movie for being bad, but to be sure, I can say that it's one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. In truth, it was even worse than the worst of "The Singularity", which was a video game, but even that was only an hour and a half of fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is one of the worst films I have seen in my life.  I first heard of this movie via a movie forum website, and I thought it was OK. But after seeing the first 3 minutes of it, I was totally disgusted. After the first 5 minutes, I didn't know what to do except walk into a room and find myself sitting in the bathroom and staring at a pile of porn, then sitting in a room, and then staring at the naked breasts of a girl who had just finished getting her breasts shown to me.  If there was a real story, the plot would have been at least as interesting. But if the story was just about a guy in the room with a bunch of girl-friends, it wasn't that much different. In the beginning of the film, they were all about in a big cabin in the woods that would have a real kitchen, a real house. But then you see a guy getting killed by a bunch topless girls. If you've seen some horror films, you know the story. So if the plot was a big plot, the characters would be so much more interesting.  It's a little weird. If there were real action scenes, the killer would have some kind of story. The killer would try to make some kind a big exit after the girl would turn herself into a naked and hunk-like corpse. Then would try and kill some of his girlfriends. There would have to be some way of getting a lot more of the killer's blood than just throwing into the room for days. In most horror films you get one or two scenes of blood as a bloody zombie. And in this movie you can only see one. The real killer would turn into a huge bloodthirsty monster and would try out some kind way of making some sort of big death of a monster. But he didn't do anything except kill the female victim. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see now that there is a major plot-line in this film that is, well, irrelevant. Basically, in fact, I believe that one of the characters is based on another. In this film, you see a young man who is not really an adult, but he doesn't quite want to die, so he kills himself.  There's another character who kills another person, also, who was a minor leader in a cult, who is now going on a rampage.  I think it's hard to get to the root of this film; it is simply the failure to really go through to find and analyze the "true" plot of the film. I had no idea I could get so far lost in this movie. It just seemed like a typical "stripture", and I wonder if the filmmakers would really give this much as they have given this film. It's just another strange and unnecessary story-line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie because it was supposed to be a comedy, and after seeing it, I was really disappointed. I did not realize that it was about a car-wrecking. The actors all in the cast were not very good, and the story is just a story about a woman who goes crazy over a stupid accident. I have seen it before, but I can guarantee that it will never have any good acting. Also, I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a plot to be so stupid that it made me lose the ability to even begin to suspend my disbelief. The only thing that helped was the camera-moving action. There was nothing good in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I would be watching it in the middle of the evening on Sunday night, but I left to be satisfied with my own opinion. I ended up watching the first half of it, and I found that a good part of the film was actually pretty good - very little dialogue and quite good drama, but it had a major problem.  The fact that all the action is just so slow and boring, while the plot was more interesting than the usual, that's pretty hard to put into a good film.  I think it got a really bad rating, but if you're a film buff and you like a lot of actors, you'll see this one at the most. If you don't, then you might as well see one of those other films that are so bad that it doesn't make any sense.  If you didn't enjoy it, please find another movie: I guess it's a pretty bad one, but there's really only one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So this is supposed to be an adventure, I guess, somewhere. But it isn't really one. In this episode, a bunch of people (somebody you've never heard) start killing each other. So you have to sit there and watch the carnage.  I would have done the better thing to leave the "action" in the original, but the story and characters were actually pretty good. In other words, they weren't ruined as much as the "actors". But the acting was really awful. I didn't like the director either. You can't understand why anyone had the idea to bring in the killer with the knife. It was just the fact that the girl had the knife in her hand at the start. She knew exactly what would happen to her body and why it had been brought in. The thing that made me most angry in the entire episode were the kids. I mean, I'm pretty sure that the killer was a kid who was killed by another family at the same time that the "Action" had begun. I think it's the most horrific scene I've ever seen in a horror movie. I can't tell you what made him murder another person. The fact that they kept making him more and more in the same scene was just ridiculous. The director had the best idea. But the story failed, and in that, we lost any part of that.  But what did the other kids do next? How can a child have any real purpose in her life? I wonder why they ever do this? And what the heck did they do that made them go on to slaughter everyone? I think the parents had a way of doing just that. They had the knowledge that the people in this town would want to see the deaths for it was just not there to be as fun as it is.  How is it that the director believed that the massacre would have to take place? Oh, I think I am glad that the kids actually had a purpose. That was something that I couldn't imagine for a while. The only way I could imagine it was was that someone had a role in it. Well, I don't really think there was a role for the kids in this show. Well they were pretty much just walking around with guns and shooting, you know. And I can tell there's no point to bring the killing up. The whole thing had nothing that made it a horror show. And it doesn't really matter that someone has the best
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just laughed at the first time I watched this. This movie is like two pieces of plastic put on a canvas and then you have to attach it to your body and put it into a movie theater (like the original SIX series or the last, the sequel, or the upcoming "Bubble". This movie really doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's horrible and has absolutely nothing to do with the genre of the genre(as it doesn't fit the genre in any way whatsoever) and the storyline is extremely predictable. In fact, one of the funniest scenes of the movie was when the protagonist meets someone who has a heart fetish. It just really seemed like some of the guy was pretending to be gay. This is an absolutely awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a feeling of frustration when I watch this movie. I watched it on the PBS and was disappointed by the lack of substance to this movie, i couldn't care more than what happens with the story. The plot could have been great, but this movie couldn't manage to accomplish. I had to watch it several times to really understand the story and see that the characters aren't so flipped in these scenes. I didn't enjoy the plot in any way. In some scenes it didn't even make sense. I thought that they would make the ending, but what's that if you're not going to add a positive ending? A lot of my friends thought this movie was interesting, but I didn`t think much about it and I was scared for some of the characters. Some scenes were like the "clowns" getting into a fight, but that's not exactly entertaining. I don't think there are enough characters for there to be a movie. The story didn't quite come together in a complete circle. I would like to be shown how this movie goes. I think they were better off on a DVD with a DVD of the "Muppet" show. But unfortunately I won't be able to get that. I'm not a fan of these movies. The only redeeming factor is that a great movie would have been so much more interesting than this one, but it failed to deliver. I give this movie a '2'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie to go out of my life. I'm sure I'm wrong for calling it "The Unbearable Girl"  The film seems like a complete failure of creativity from the actors. As an example, one of the characters plays a female singer. The girl's boyfriend was so bad that it almost seemed he was going to be a porn star. I would have been willing to overlook him as a character in this movie. At least the actress is pretty good. I guess a lot of the kids in this film just want a big laugh, and this movie is no joke. There were some nice moments where the movie had a good soundtrack, but the characters weren't too memorable. For example, a lot could've easily been taken out of the film. The "music" (the songs, music, and the camera movement) didn't make it. One thing I can do to help my view of this movie: Don't even watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story goes that the bigfooty lady named Nanna is a little bit mad at her fiance who kidnaps her husband. She says "I can't take it away from my husband" which is supposed to be a hilarious line but just goes on and on. What a loser these people are.  The director seems to be using this line in every movie they make. I wonder why these people think it works to work a line if they have already made it. The lines "You can't escape my hands" make the actors sound like they're about to be kidnapped!  The actor I think is the worst in the film is the little boy who plays the bigtoe named Naylor. The film has a really lame beginning with a bunch of "claw" in some parts and "claws" in the middle that just don't make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst thing in the movie universe... I thought it was very funny in the beginning but then I got sick. I couldn't tell how it was for the rest of the movie but it is really not worth a second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the synopsis with the assumption that the protagonist was a psychopath. However, I did not see much evidence of psychopaths in this film. I found the ending to be incredibly weak, and had no idea why. I was looking for a more believable story, and the story seemed pretty lame. The director's tone was extremely weak, which could have been a better idea for the plot. I did enjoy the beginning of the movie when the characters became more realistic, but unfortunately this was a completely weak story. I only found the end to be good because it did provide some interesting things. However this is a really poor ending, especially considering the story was told by a very accomplished actor. But then I must wonder why they had to leave the movie before the credits were done. And then I wonder why the director didn't bring more stars into the film. So instead, the director ended the film with a little bit of nudity, and this is really bad in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely pathetic. The way it was written made no sense. The acting was terrible. I was the only person in the movie that was not being insulted. The movie didn't make any sense at all. I guess what happened to the actors. I don't remember. I'm afraid to think that the director had to put in a lot of extra training and special effects to get something like this into a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first week or two I thought this was a very interesting film but I quickly decided that it wasn't all that. The film was nothing like a decent film and really only a bad film. I couldn't even figure out who the guy was and I think it made the most of the bad movies out there.  The main character, "The Kid" is actually really bad. The rest of the characters were like filler but the story is actually terrible.  I was scared for the rest of it and didn't enjoy it at all. The only reason I gave it a 10 is because the first and last 30 minutes of it were really interesting and it was a cute little movie. But it didn't like any one else and it wasn`T too interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really can't believe that people are making this over a movie about a woman whose life has been forever changed due to a massive brainwashing from a cult based on what they believe. How can this movie be made?!   The movie was completely awful, and I couldn't really find the end. I was wondering if the movie was really made in the first place, because it had little to do with the characters except for the fact that they don't understand them. It was a piece of garbage that didn't take the time to do anything.  I can't recommend this movie, but if it is meant to be a movie, I would highly avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a rather pointless plot (at least in my opinion) which only serves to annoy you. Even when they're at home, they're so indecisive, dumb, and bad that it just doesn't go there. There is an effort to make sure there is something here. There's a scene where they have to read the same book the day before they get it. Why? The plot is too long, as most movies are nowadays. They don't get any real plot. The story is too convoluted. There are so many scenes in the story which are just recycled scenes. It really doesn't make much sense either. Some of the characters are so dull that you can't really care about them anyway. They just try to fit in their lives and have some nice music in them. Some scenes were also recycled. That's also the same with the actors. They can't make this all happen! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i like the original, and have thought it fun for a while, but when they made the remake, it was not that fun. The movie seems to have been made in very few hours. the acting is extremely weak, especially as the young girl. It was really hard to find out who she is or where she is. there is some creepy guy in the movie, who is always a little boy, and his face doesn't move. this person seems to be a real freak. I really could not stand this movie. The acting is not in good quality. I can't believe it was made in that style. I wish they hadn't put anything about the movie in it, like about the real "Mountain Girl" or the real girl with a green hair. They should have had a similar story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen anyone put a negative rating in a movie: There are no movies that can deliver this type of badness, and I cannot imagine how a movie like this could be seen to be enjoyable to watch. I watched it and saw some of the actors in the film (that I never thought I would witness) do not make that sense. The characters are just boring, the acting is bad, and the plot is plain at the beginning. I was expecting some action to the character's fight with the police but I was disappointed after seeing the other actors and their role in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a horrible attempt at a movie, I don't really like it but after a couple of weeks of watching it I felt completely robbed of hope, it was so disappointing. The plot is pretty vague, it's so bad that it got lost. And I thought the cast was terrible and the ending was weak. It could've done better than this, I think it is just the worst movie ever made. It was only 2/3 of a bad film, but it was pretty disappointing anyway. This film should be banned and I would recommend a better sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is, sadly, a classic piece of crap. We see what happened to the people in the past, how the gods killed them and how the world was destroyed. Nothing happens, and the characters don't really develop. So, it's not quite a spoiler. I have to say that if you like the first movie, and have some understanding about the "spirit of life" then you'll enjoy this one badly. The plot was really silly and I didn't really enjoy it. I guess it might have been good to see some of the cast in this film, but the fact that we didn't meet them made the movie unbearable. It was just really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie is bad because it's bad, I mean really bad.   As a fan of "The Secret" I can confirm, and I don't have to read the book.  As I said earlier, the actors did very good, but the film is just awful. There is one interesting scene and the rest are just really bad, it's just a poor effort on the part of a lousy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Big Break" is not a good one for a documentary. The film is a blatant attempt to tell people that a person who is a famous athlete (or a famous person, as they are more known in certain sports) has a great, winning streak. The plot, especially the movie "Big Breakers" with David Dory (who was supposed to be one of the most important athletes in history) is really stupid and the ending is pointless. The movie is based on the famous, yet ridiculous, and utterly ridiculous image of a guy named Jack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't get the same movie over 50 times like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After being completely caught in the plot, I thought it was very interesting and well done, but unfortunately, that's was the only thing that kept me from watching it.  I was disappointed when this movie failed to deliver its message to the audience. The plot is about a couple who live in a big city, and have been living for months after having moved there. They're at some sort of funeral of a dead man, that they have only a few hours in which to bury his body, but their main interest is to find out who and how their deceased father was buried.  Well, the plot is not what I expected.  The acting was OK in a few parts, but the whole thing was very weak and the dialog was incredibly weak, and the plot was a total waste of time.  But, if you liked the idea, you can find this movie on your own. This movie is a total embarrassment, and there is nothing to suggest this movie is even remotely good. Avoid it. If you like this movie, forget it. Avoid anything like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just a bunch of hooligans who felt a real need to have a kicky fight in the real world and somehow got a few bites in it. The best thing in the film is the lack of plot. Not even a plot. The movie ends up with some seriously weird moments like some sort of kitty and a guy in a dark cave with a dark vampire look. It just goes on and on. I really didn't get the point in the whole film because it was so bad but I guess that I have a sense of humor when I watch movies and it is bad to have nothing to do except a dull and pointless story. That is all the worst in the movie. The only good thing is the ending that it had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was just a piece of trash...I don't even think there was any plot. It had little plot, much of the film would have been a piece in the book, but was really just boring, and the director had very little idea. He got one idea that made sense and then he made another one that didn't. The film is about a car crash...that was completely irrelevant to the film itself, the protagonist, and what we see in the film. That was it. The plot was not consistent, the characters were poorly defined and there was no plot whatsoever. There were no plot twists in the movie, the direction, the character development was terrible, the acting was bad...there was nothing that made the film interesting. It's bad that I had to find a copy of this film to describe all of the crap in it. If you want to read the book or read the movie instead, don't. You have to read a book with words, words, and words that make sense. If not, then read a movie with words that don't make sense, such as a movie about a big car crash. The movie was just an excuse to see another car crash movie: that was it! I do hope it didn't hurt anyone. But, if you read it, you would probably get a different sort of headache. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad, and I can't even consider it a "Worst Movies Ever" list of movies: The original movie was actually pretty funny, especially the comedy, and the sequel is worse than that. Unfortunately, when I saw the first movie, I thought it was funny, so in some respects, it does not matter.  Now, the movie has some funny scenes, but the ones that were funnies are so lame, there is no real reason to get this movie.  I just don't believe in it whatsoever, and if you watch this movie, you will go right into the same place as the sequel.  In fact, if you don't care, you shouldn't give it a chance to survive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie with no plot, no plot is the result of a cheap, unimaginabble plot. If your own vision is that, you'll end up watching a "comedy" about an old, dumb, loser, who has never worked in a major role. If you're a true believer of the late William Sallone, you will not see any quality in this movie. The only real thing about this movie is the plot. The movie is just stupid, you can pretty much guess what it would be like if it were a "serious" movie. I mean, it really is just a plot, nothing like a movie. A lot of people in the industry, particularly older people, can't stomach it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to watch this movie because I was looking for something new and this one didn't look like it had any real substance. It looked like a pile of plastic. It was obviously over-produced. The fact that they tried so hard to make it look interesting is a sign of incompetence. I gave it about 2.5 out of 10. This movie has nothing else in it to make you care, aside from a pretty good soundtrack (which is about the best thing in the world), nothing else to make your mind think, nothing to save you from being left wondering what you should be doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i'm looking for some fresh and original material, and this is one of the worst. As with most movies, it's just some scenes that have nothing to do with anything. It's no good, it isn't interesting, and it's boring. The plot and the characters are bad. The characters are stupid. If you like this movie, you don't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is horrible. A guy in the lead role (George MacLaren in the main role) meets a girl who wants to break into a family of bad guys and are not that funny. At one point when it becomes a plot that the parents of MacLain are killed by one of the big criminals (Kirk McBoom in a big-name role), MacLaine is the one who survives and is able to continue on being a horrible character for all eternity. He is also annoying in this film as he is the only person in the whole film who tries to make the bad guys even harder to kill. The only thing that makes this movie great is McLaine as a big guy that keeps trying to break in to a family. But there are other characters who are in the film that are not in the original script that can easily pass the law of acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got tired watching this movie because I couldn't wait to see the other, but after seeing this movie I couldn not wait for the other. It is, basically, a stupid movie with bad acting and bad plot (more than one half of the movie is about a man whose father murdered his wife and father then killed her). The best thing that I could say is that the makers should not have made this movie. The plot is not good enough to make a movie, but it's not as bad as some of the other people made this type of movie, so I'll see it again if I have to. I won't really recommend watching this, but I can't say why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even worth a mention, if it is the case. When I rented it I thought it was going to be just plain awful, but then I was wondering why, well, maybe if it wasn't a bad film then it could have been really scary. I watched the first three minutes but then turned to one and five half minutes of it. I saw every other second as a rip-off, with nothing but lame things to do and a few predictable lines about a scary car. There are not so many characters to make in a horror movie and this one just doesn't fit. It's just a plain story and it doesn't have any action. I'm really upset that this movie had to be made. Even though it seems to be a clever idea, it just doesn�t have much of a storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the type of film that would never even pass the basic requirements. The most basic idea behind this movie is that the story will inevitably be horrible and the characters will fail to live up to expectations. This movie never made it out into a real story and that is what it lacks. I just watched this movie without expecting it to ever be a great movie and instead I saw some of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is a bad, bad movie that does not deserve to be in the hands of any serious film fan. Even after a good movie, it will never live up. The acting is bad, the plot is bad and the script is bad. The movie is bad enough that if you really wanted a comedy and a comedy, this would be that movie. If you want to watch some serious films that are more serious and have something to do in a time period, this is one of them. This could very well be a comedy or a thriller but it is simply horrible and does not warrant you buying it. In all of the movies I've watched, one has always been able to save a few minutes, but when you watch it you will not do anything except watch it for yourself. If there is any good reason for the film to exist as a movie of the genre it is only used to be a bad waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just for those of you who really enjoy the humor in the movie, you might be more of a fan of the funny comedy genre. Alas, I'm not really sure how they decided to include the other two bits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So the 'Binny Brook', has an awful script to do in every way, and the director tries to make it interesting in his attempts, but he is in that way only because it is his job.   I am sorry for having to read this piece of garbage. It should be good when a film is about something that's in reality. If you're stupid enough to be looking at a lot of crap from this movie, you will miss all of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think that this movie was intended for children, with a story line (of the villain's plot) that would make any child believe that the villain is an evil man.  When the children are presented with this movie, it's pretty clear that the movie isn't a kids movie, but instead is intended for kids who are bored or scared, or have a bad feeling about a movie.   What happened at the end of this movie is pretty simple.  In order to maintain a decent story, I don't like what they filmed.  If you've seen this movie before, it will make you uncomfortable. I don`t understand how the director thought this was going to be. The idea that kids could be bored by watching this movie (and I believe there was a very low percentage of kids in this movie) is just crazy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll say the same about this movie: bad acting. The story line is pretty good, but unfortunately, it doesn't last long. If you like sci-fi movies, then you'll love this one, but you will not. I gave it four out of ten. I don't even remember the name of the "pre-made" versions of this movie. They were pretty terrible, and if I had a negative opinion about them, I'd give it another 10 points. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film stars a guy (Josh) who was a big girl and now in love with his ex-girlfriend (Ella) but she doesn't understand why he's back with her. When the two meet at a car park, they have to sneak around and try to get past security to sneak past security guards. The acting is horrible, the story is bad, and the movie itself is bad. But there is one scene that got good and I think it is a funny scene. But this is just a really bad movie, I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you are a total idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a waste of crap. This is why I gave it a 1 out of 10. The acting is so terrible that it is difficult to watch. I was wondering why they even bothered to put this as a movie: 1) People who want to see a movie get so much money for this movie. 2) The plot is pretty good but the acting is bad. And the director was really bad. I gave this film a 1 (and I did not really give it much, but I'd give it a 10). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this on a Saturday afternoon and I've got no idea how a film can so poorly explain it to a casual viewer. There's a big name, "Bubin", that is apparently very talented and one of the better known people. I think it's probably a bad idea for her to make a movie with her name that's only the name to this bad movie.  This movie was just bad because it was boring. Everything was about a big girl with fake breasts, she just pretends to be a boy. It was only about a woman who thinks she has fake breasts. The only thing that was interesting in this movie was the fact that it was just a girl. She had a couple of boyfriends and they wanted her to come over, so why not do she go with those guys? I think if you have the feeling to watch something interesting with a female that isn't really about the actual human body, you shouldn't be on a movie like this one. It's nothing special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has a good theme, a good cast (though most of them are terrible), a good plot, but the script is lousy and the story is totally incomprehensible. Even a "classic" horror film like "Rash Bollywood" could have helped this story to succeed. If the film had any substance, it would have been interesting. But the director of the film, Robert deBlind (who won best acting awards at Cannes), was so terrible that it was impossible to find out why he was making this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The scene where Jennifer Aniston's character comes up in the hotel room and finds her mother sitting there is ridiculous. It does not seem like she was a person of ordinary intelligence, and for her characters to suddenly learn she was an idiot she didn't have the brains to make it happen. Not only that, but in the final scene that we see, it is clear that Jennifer Anotonate is incapable of acting in a believable way. Just let her go! If it's a sitcom, I don't have to make up the difference! I have to admit, I didn't buy it until I tried it, and I only bought it because I had the opportunity to see it again and see what horrible things Jennifer Anetonate can do. It doesn't make any sense, and you cannot have sympathy for anyone who watches this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and the script are so badly written, that one can't feel the slightest pity for these characters.  The cast is also awful. The plot has so many twists that it is difficult to tell whether one can believe that one would actually take these characters so seriously. The only time I saw the movie was when it aired on "Saturday Night Live", and the last time I watched it was during a commercial break in the evening. There is no suspense whatsoever.  Overall, "The Outline" is a bad film, but it doesn't really have any real depth to speak of. A lot of people might like the film, and many have done good reviews, but the story is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was completely predictable and only a predictable ending. The characters were bad, the story could have been great if they had more twists.  The dialog wasn't good and the plot was terrible. I didn't even care for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was shot in such bad light, with such little attention paid to most of the interesting parts. In a nutshell, it is all the same as the previous two films in the series (the first and the second) of "The Walking Dead" and other zombie horror series (both of which were made by Lucasfilm), and it is, by comparison, the worst film in any genre ever made in the world.   This movie was nothing new. The premise of "I'm not a zombie!" (or "I've got my eyes burned!") is absolutely meaningless. It had nothing to do with the characters, the story, the scenery, the characters' motivations, and the film itself. If you were to take the characters out of the plot, they would make a lot more interesting than their "visions" as undead beings. This isn't an argument for any "hardest zombie film" out there, and I don't know if any other writer made such a story before this one. There were many people arguing that this movie was about zombie hunting and how they got infected (as we did in "The Dead"). It didn't. The story was not even so much, and in the end the film just fell apart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see this film when I rented it from Film 1 in New York. It was a very weak film, but it did have some interesting parts. This was only one aspect that could help it make a case, and it didn't, even though it was about the same subject matter as the first one. The fact that the script was bad, especially the way the movie was written (some of the story is told of events that happen in the movie, and the film didn't stop there, instead it became completely unbelievable. I won't say this was the movie so badly but it's bad enough that I was almost unable to continue watching it. The film has no depth whatsoever. I think the people who wrote it did a very poor job, and there were some things that were amusing but they didn't occur in the film. I didn't have anything to do with the fact that it was set in New Jersey, because I had no idea what it was, but the whole town scene was only a little more realistic than the one in the previous film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete b*tch! I mean you would expect to see some pretty good pictures of a movie but you do not get that! The story is really bad! Some might call it "the best" movie, but that is just not enough. The actors are awful, the story is not great, and the story isn't even pretty good, the plot is just lame. If you watch the trailer, you will see the actors are good! But if you watch this movie, you don't even see the acting and you'll get mad enough!  The plot is also extremely bad. The characters are poorly developed and there are no characters that are good for a movie. The story, the acting, and even the plot are OK, but there are just so many stupid things that you will wonder why they even bothered to make this film. The only good things you will find are the great music (in the trailer), the great images. I can't say too much, because I have seen it twice and I am sorry to say that I will never see this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It's absolutely terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film really has no storyline of any sort. Just a story with one person, one girl, a dog, and a few scenes that have nothing to do with anything to happen.  The whole plot is a waste of time, which may be wasted by some actors.   There is a lot to this movie, but very little. While I thought the scenes were good, there was nothing to make my attention jump and I left it at a few minutes.  This is a really terrible movie for the casual viewer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dark Sea" is a stupid movie that is nothing more than a rip-off of some of the "Sister Babes" movies. The plot is very simple but nothing more, it's just mindless plot that has no plot. For example, it tries to make the same story with more ridiculous elements and more ridiculous characters, so you end up looking like a movie that doesn't have any plot whatsoever. I really hated the "Dark Sea" after I watched it because it was stupid and pointless but I still really loved the last "Sisters" movie, even though it wasn't nearly as good. I also hated the ending, but that was the only part that made me like it. I don't know how it got past the screen. It was just a stupid ending. The movie had a few parts that weren't so bad but it didn't reach the level of "Dark Side". "The Light" would never have been such a film but it was more interesting because it made a lot of suspense and the ending was more suspenseful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Fancy Man" is a horribly misdirected piece of low budget Hollywood exploitation that falls on an absolutely amateur level. It looks like a series of accidental and contrived incidents, some of which are in the most embarrassing, most hackneyed, most stupid and most infuriating manner possible.  There was one scene that I watched through the lens, and what it showed was pretty disgusting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i just cant get over this crap. It has nothing to do with horror, its just stupid, and boring. Its not even that it was bad, but it is just bad. I think it is the same as "The Housewives" with "A Town Like That". I give them 4 more points than "The housewives" and 4 more than "Flexible Housewives". There is a lot of crap about the movie: crazy housewives, the movie is like "a real house" in the style of a movie, bad movies are so lame and stupid, it is hard to believe that people like "The Humble Hour" or "Hushy Girl" are even in the same position.   This movie should be on a DVD instead of being released on TV. They are making this stupid, yet scary movie so we are going to put it on our list of movies we do not want to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love seeing kids who have fun, but this movie fails so badly, you won't want to see it again. The story is so cliché, that it's better for me to see nothing else. The actors were flat, boring, and the movie isn't any good.  This movie is so bad that even a low budget film has some value.  I'll try and save my money and try my best to get my money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely horrible, and I was really surprised to find that it had been made for this movie. Even though the acting was decent, there wasn't much of the story. It was just a bunch of actors pretending to be a teenager, who looked like they were in grade school, and the plot was entirely ridiculous. And worst of all was the ending.  The movie was about a bunch that is very old, and you just know they will probably have the same story in their lives soon. That was the only problem with the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really bad, I thought this was like a very bad sequel to the 'Wizard' movie, and I felt so sick when this was made... and the only good thing about it is the fact that the actor that plays the Wizard (I mean, the Wizard is still a real person), can act, and it was OK to some degree. If you've been a fan of 'Wizards', you will notice that a lot of the actors in this movie were not that good in the 'original' Wizard movie. And to that, I feel like the 'Riders' actors were much better in the first one, and the 'Knight' would have been better if the 'Star Squad' crew had more actors, and thus they should have put more money into the budget, instead of wasting more on trying to make the movie a sequel. But it is still pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't get the last few minutes of this video before I'm left with no recourse whatsoever. The story I have read was the biggest garbage on the internet, and I was glad for the film to be canceled. What a movie is supposed to be I don't know. The director wanted to say something about the movie, but what would that be? Who cares. I guess I am a movie fanatic. And the people who make these movies are a bunch of gosh-cows, with no regard to the story and all the horrible acting, bad lines, and bad movie effects. The film is bad enough to make me weep. In my opinion, the first three minutes were the most disappointing of the entire film. The movie would have been better if the director had told me, the story, and the cast. The fact that I have to watch the movie and finish it is only because I know there will be another one.   In short, I am extremely disappointed with this movie. If I had been given an opportunity to actually sit in a movie theater and watch the whole thing, I would probably have done. As it is, I don`t have a clue what it had to say. In fact, I could not even do that. I am convinced it is bad because the director is making a joke about it. It was a shame that the director didn`t see the first few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only way I can feel for this movie was when it first appeared. My reactions to it are more embarrassing than anything else. The acting is terrible, the pacing was poor, and the storyline was bad. I would have even considered dropping the movie as a negative but the movie itself was so bad, the director felt he couldn't, even though he had the intention to make the movie a serious message about an extreme case of violence (I think he got an award for that). It's bad because it is so predictable and stupid, that it could not help but ruin the movie. There are some good scenes in the movie, including a rescue by a small army of human beings who rescue people, and some good special effects. But the movie just leaves you with nothing except frustration. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so sick of this sick thing. The acting is terrible. The music was lame, the script was bad, the cinematography was bad...  I can't say anything more. The film was bad in every aspect. It's a waste of the budget and not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen The Materiks movies before and I think this is the first one that I've seen. Well, even though it is a very simplistic film, the plot is just awful and even the camera work is not too good. What a sad comment about a film:  The dialog has too much padding (if we did that in The Lord Of The Rings, the orcs would be as good as the heroes!), the supporting characters don't come from anywhere like The Lord of the Rings and they can't act like a real gang of heroes, the movie is too predictable and, sadly, has very little character development, the supporting actors are way too boring and the action is just too weak.  The plot is a predictable story (as much as The Lord With The Dark Tower), but the film is not made for that. The scenes are not all-action driven (as the Lord With the Dark Tower has), the dialog is not like a great adventure (as in The Fellowship of Anubis), the movie does not make the best use of its genre and the dialog does not come from a plot, its acting is not great, the cinematography is terrible (as it has been in other Materios films, this is no exception), everything about it is bad (even the way the actors work with the director, the camera is poor, the way a scene is filmed is not so good), and everything about the movie sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I read this film, I was looking for something more interesting. I couldn't find anything more engaging. But I did find this movie on a list of "fun movies" and "fun-filled movies." Not much at all. Although it seemed like a "film" (in the end), it was really very boring. I was bored, but I didn't find a lot of the things that actually made it enjoyable. I felt like I was playing something for a bunch of strangers and had no idea what it was. The movie played out like a piece of junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed in this film because it was too bad to make. It didn't get the funny, but they were pretty good at making the movie. Then, once they made it into the script, it had a lot of the same problems as the original, with the big twist coming in the beginning of the film when I heard the name "The Devil", which was obviously not meant to be a Devil. It seemed like a typical movie made by a group of college students who can't think like they're on a school campus but instead just pretend to be members of a fraternity. There was absolutely no point in making the devil a villain like Jason Leibowitz was. I suppose he's made up for all of the trouble his movie has caused. He's a lot more fun to listen to the comments and discussions and try to find out what's being said about the movie, only to realize they're not talking to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a big fan of the "Crazy" series, but I was expecting a decent episode. Sadly this episode was the opposite. While some of the acting was good, it was very weak and very confusing.  I would like to say I would have put in more time, but it was only about two hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad, it's funny that they named it the "Zombox 2: Return of a Frankenstein". I didn't even watch the last film to this degree, because I knew when I'm going to see it in a few months. I'm sure I got some extra money and that the "Das" in the name means that it's a documentary, but what was this? It looked like a real movie, but instead of watching it like a documentary I watched it like some of the other zombie flicks. I think that they had to watch that movie to be sure that it was not real! It was so weak it didn't have enough action to keep my interest. My favorite zombie movie was the zombie movies of "Battley's Laboratory" and "The Last Guardian". Both of those were actually good Zombie flicks, so what a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first really bad movie I have seen in a long time, but I do think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's just embarrassing to watch as a kid. It is just bad, the worst film ever made. If the filmmakers had more sense of humor than this, they would make some fun films with some of the best people in the world. They have nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had quite some plot (which I expected) but its failure to bring any more drama was bad. The first half of the movie was very slow and it seemed to me that no one was really going to get the "good" story (which was supposed to be the main purpose of this movie) but unfortunately the director didn't quite realise that. I can't remember how they tried to make up the story for the movie (how did they know to stay on the same track throughout the movie?). I only remember seeing the last scenes and I don't know if they had to have something to go on to save the story. I would recommend watching this movie if your are looking for a simple thriller but that doesn't really matter. It's not a pleasant way for a plot to have an interesting story but that should really be a concern of the director and the producers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the movie was interesting, but unfortunately they just couldn't take it into their own hands. A lot of the scenes are just plain awful. For example, I kept thinking it was a really dumb movie, but then I just gave it my two cents. The plot is too convoluted and really isn't like what I expected. The acting wasn't great either. The story is weak. The ending, although I didn't care about it, I didn� I just couldn�t figure out why there would be a war with aliens. The production would make more sense if they didn�t try to cover up the fact that the aliens are able to abduct humans to study. In fact, the story isn�t totally made up. What is the point? To show a huge invasion of some aliens? If there is a war, it must be a big one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is not really believable. The story is quite weak. The main character is a complete piece of garbage. A couple of minutes of film, you realize that it has some semblance of intelligence and we forget what is happening in the story. I'm a believer of the idea of the "superhuman" story but it was done badly in this movie. The movie had some plot holes I never thought I would get into. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like to see the worst things ever filmed: see a movie: the stupidest of ever filmed...(a spoiler to the best of the year) The only saving grace is that it doesn't have a script. The only redeeming feature is the idea that it is based on real, or imaginary, facts.  A story is told of a man who kills a bunch of people. He wants to use his brother's corpse to help him sell a drug. He tells his brother to use him...but the story tells about some other people, so his brother isn't murdered for fun.  He can do all sorts of weird things and, in an interesting twist, be able to help his brother find his brother. He is forced to do his best and then, in a horrible, horrible manner, he is killed by a woman.   I'll let you guess how this is going. The reason this movie has a "name" is because it is so terrible that you don't have any idea what to do with it. There is no storyline. There are no explanation for anything. I don't know what is meant to happen. Maybe it will come on again as a TV show or DVD, if I remember it is something similar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had me scared to death. I just couldn't believe the storyline and storyline (if you watch the DVD version) were only supposed to be a "novel", yet somehow this movie became so gory that I almost couldn't finish it. The ending is bad, it just seemed like "somitronium", (the movie was made a bit later than the actual movie), and the supporting characters are uninteresting and not believable. I've never seen an acting like this in a horror movie. My only personal complaint is that I couldn't get past the fact that the movie was set in a futuristic town. And they finally showed us the way to find this town by shooting a bunch of people around it (including the killer, which I didn't remember watching). I guess this is because you don't like to be shown anything like the killer in this movie. The plot is really bad and was really out of the scope with the movie, I guess it has to be in a future time that I might want to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie's ending is simply the worst part of the movie. If you've seen a video from The Devil's Advocate, you know exactly what it is. The Devil (Giovanno), the main character (Tom Neely), is an evil little demon who creates a virus that mutates into everyone. People who died in the previous world are now turned into demons. We know the main villain (Gevanno) before it shows up in the movie, but we never see his face. He also has the ability to see the souls of all living creatures, and he can't stop killing people. The idea that everyone in the future is cursed and that it takes a few souls to put the person back into a state of madness is simply absurd.  How many times can The Devil get a virus in place to infect people (Govanno?) and then make them "infected" is never explained in the film. The movie is pretty decent and it's just awful... but not good enough to even pass on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film on the TV on a Saturday night with my kids. When the movie ended, they made me and my family sit in a small black box with a screen that was not used at the movie. When they finished, the screen looked like a little TV in a black box. Some of the dialog seemed like the person in a movie was acting differently. Then there was another woman's dialog. A lot of people in this movie got the idea they needed to be sex in some manner, although the acting seemed to have been directed by a "director." I think the movie would have been better if they had acted in a regular manner. They should have been in the living room instead of making a movie.  I think this movie was just awful, especially the female part. The movie had a lot of mistakes in a bad way. The story lines were not great. The ending is OK. But at least you get a little bit of closure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Wanda Melco" is a predictable, silly film that is so badly written it is almost meaningless. If you are one of the most talented filmmakers in the world, you will find this movie a little disappointing. But it does not deserve to be so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had the most ridiculous dialogue I have ever encountered. The characters were flat, unimaginative, and uninteresting. The dialog was so bad, I decided to turn my attention away so I could have a laugh. The ending was absolutely unsatisfying. I watched it at home, and the only thing that was good was the cameo by David Strickland. Unfortunately the movie was only made available to streaming on DVD in Germany. The acting wasn't quite that bad, but I thought the ending was incredibly bad, and sadly the movie didn't deserve to be considered.  I would recommend this movie to avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good thing about this film is that, if you are a person who looks like this person and you can even watch it over the course of a lifetime, you might enjoy it, but you also can't believe that it is.  This movie is, essentially, a comedy that never moves anywhere. Its like a bad episode of I Love Lucy that would be entertaining if you only watched it on its own but didn't, and therefore, it is a comedy which isn't even entertaining if it is confined to a small group of people.  In this film, the characters are mostly just there to make some weird noises and try to make the movie funny as they try to be amusing.  That means it doesn't have any life as a character, and the characters do nothing to make you feel real.  I was pretty disgusted, but I guess that's how you get into this movie. At the end, I really wished the ending was funny and had more time to get into it. There are a few moments that really made me laugh - the funny scene when they are getting drunk. They are pretty good, I guess. The only thing that bothered me was the plot. A bunch of guys are in a house and one of them is screaming at a woman, but he didn't talk to her until after she was gone.  How, I don't know if it was some sort of weird scene or just an accident. I guess it was just some sorta weird scene.  My guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie is in a genre of Japanese movies, it should be a movie that contains some actual humor, a lot of blood, and an ending that is not a joke. As it is, it is not.  This movie is so bad that it has to be laughed at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to watch a movie: it's interesting and usually a fun movie but it just isn't interesting enough.   this movie just seems to drag out a few moments of nothing but you know that it's just a lame attempt to get you to laugh.  The characters are a bunch of people on a trip from Europe. They're about to be arrested by a local police chief and told that they can only arrest the leader because they've caught them stealing some cash from another local businessman.  they are in this cabin which were just rented from another hotel. The people inside the cabin are also dressed in their full black gear. They look really weird, and are pretty boring. It is obvious that they're all dressed like their real person and nothing else. They don't act like humans at all.  there are some scenes where they act like normal people, but nothing like a real person.  in one of the scenes in the cabin there are a group of people that has a few kids. They act like they're real kids and don't seem like kids to me, I thought that they probably have some parents in the background. But the parents don't go anywhere and they don't talk to anyone other than their own kids. The movie had quite some interesting parts but the movie had just about 2 minutes of real action and nothing seemed like real characters. They had some good actors but they had so many people in them who couldn't talk in real life and they didn't act human like we're all on earth. This movie just really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just stupid, stupid, bad, bad and totally not funny.  If you thought the actors are funny, then you are wrong. The only reason you will watch this film is to see this film and be insulted by it. If the movie had a good script then you would laugh at its stupidity. The funny moments are pathetic, they only show two moments of humor and one moment of comedy that only a few minutes could have saved.  I thought this movie would be interesting and funny, but they all seemed stupid, especially the part where the main actor dies.   The only good part of this movie was when they were discussing how they killed the bad guy. Well, if there is a plot to this movie then what would that plot be? They all seem to be over-dressed in the most ridiculous ways. This movie was so bad I just gave it 2 stars because it was interesting. There's nothing to get upset about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film looks like it is designed for a certain type of "film" that is all about it, a bunch of people who can't act and have a "story to tell". It just doesn't seem like that and it's really hard to watch. The film is slow, and its characters aren't believable. The main plot involves an animal named "Lasso" and she is, as usual, very stupid and just plain stupid. While we're in it, we are treated to a "comedy", which, I guess, is going to be the main story. When she is getting a good deal with Lasso, we learn that she is in the business for a year. I was hoping that the "compertainment" aspect of the film was going to shine and make a funny scene. I thought she was going so far down the road in her character when she meets the "Bunny" with her pet. That was ridiculous. The "completion" aspect is absolutely unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film seems to be a shameless waste of time and wasted money on the part of the producer, as well as the stars. It just doesn't make any sense, even when the script is so well-written and well-executed it is so poor. If you see the final shot at the end, that scene is a big waste of minutes.  As to be an example, I would like to refer to the scene where some of the characters try to get into a car with an impossibly retarded "wash" on the trunk that they find on the road, while another of them is driving into a big barn, which is also surrounded by a gigantic wooden machine that is apparently running a bunch of cars by hand. While everyone is on the outskirts of a huge wooden box, the protagonist of the film suddenly springs on a bunch, which only takes five minutes to kill some of his enemies.  It's hard to believe that this film contains so much footage of cars and, if I'm going to make an honest comparison, it is almost an entire hour worth of action, which I don't know how they were going to get footage of everything.  There is no way for this movie to be considered any good in any other context. The actors were badly chosen in particular, and I would not have seen anything like this in a Hollywood production.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Myster: A Love Story" is really, totally stupid. It is just a collection of bad lines, lines of dialogue that seem to have a little purpose in a strange plot. The "Mystery" has a plot, but it is stupid and poorly written. This is all so ridiculous that I really can't see what was bothering anyone. You see, we spend almost half our time listening to a dumb line. I like "My Melody" more, but that line is only a half-hour. That's all the worst line of any movie I have ever seen. I was so dumb that I had to leave my house and look at what I had in mind. The story is a joke that has no real meaning. It should not be expected to be an important thing in a movie, or even a big story, but they did that when they did a lot of movies. I think they should have just made one movie and gotten out of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was totally disappointing as the previous. I thought it was a little too serious. It seems like the director didn't realize how much time and money could be put into this thing. I could sit through the movie for about 20 minutes without wanting to watch it. The characters were so stiff. I think the characters in the movie were all stiff, and the acting wasn't quite as good as the first movie. The only good things in the film were the music and the photography. I really didn't like the way they portrayed the movie. It just was too pretentious and fake. I don't really understand how they made the camera work. The story wasn't great. It wasn't all that horrible. I didn't even feel bad for the cast. The actors did well, though. I expected better. I have no knowledge of what they had in store to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on the TV set on video a couple of years ago and I didn't like it. The first thing I thought about was that it would be a nice little indie movie but it never was. There wasn't much that made sense. I was looking for an indie movie when I rented this film, and couldn't find one. It is a comedy but it doesn't have an end. It doesn't make any sense. It never seems like a movie made on a computer. It can't even act like a computer movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad, but it's good because the actors and other performances are funny and the scenes are great, but the plot is so awful that it doesn't work for me. The movie is just too much to bother to watch.  If you want to see some funny or funny film, skip it and let your friends watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film, I thought it was terrible. I watched the first half and just thought it would be better if there was a movie about the world's worst things instead of "Man" - the same as the previous movie and the one before. The acting was bad, and the premise was stupid. It is supposed to be about a family who are fighting to make a family but there is no connection with the main characters. They're so stupid it's fun to watch them fight each other like animals. But the plot isn't any good! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie was a parody of some famous British films. In this case it seems like they actually had some idea for this movie and ended up with a lot of false story lines. I never felt the story lines in the movie were in the way the director intended.  This movie was probably the most embarrassing film I have ever seen.  I'll admit that the acting was very good - the plot, and the camera movements, were good - but I think the characters were just terrible.  Overall, this movie is really a waste of any entertainment, especially the sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is an excuse to put this out as a film but it is really only an excuse. The director knew he had to be able to convey the horror of the subject, but he tried to avoid giving enough detail.   The film is essentially a horror-journey with a bunch of characters that are all played by the director in a very bad way.  It's only a horror film that tries to make a few jokes at the end but then decides on one final gag, and then jumps backwards to the conclusion of the film when the movie is almost finished.  There was the same thing in "Doom" and "The Ring". While "Dope" is a horror movie that works, it is a bad, bad, terrible one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not like they are bad at acting. Maybe they just don't like the idea of being drunk. But when I watched this I really doubted what they were thinking. The premise seems to be that it was a "lost" show that would not make any more of a home-release film for the "lost", and hence be a DVD of an embarrassment. I had to wait and see if I could see it again and realized it was not as bad as it had been portrayed in the previous versions I had seen. And after that, I had a mad little laugh as I slowly tuned the clock to look at the other versions. I didn't think it was any good, but I would still avoid it. If you see this, you will probably wonder why they didn't make this movie in their lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for something to make a statement about this movie, but I couldn't think of the "it's fun" type of statement. Not only is it not fun, it's actually one of the most boring movie I've ever seen. The actors are simply pathetic. What was the point when we were supposed to be in the most over-the-counteracting film imaginable? The only thing we get from this movie is "It's Fun" as a way to avoid the boring movie the rest of the time.  There are many words I didn't understand or understand, like "hah" or "huh" or something like this movie. What could they be?  It's not just the acting, but the storyline is just terrible. There was nothing for me to enjoy in this movie and I thought the title was stupid to think about a murder where one guy got stabbed. That was it? There is no way I could enjoy anything that is so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off of all, the title alone tells us that it is a horror film, and even worse it is based on a novel (by A.W. M. W. Miller). However, if there was any real intent behind this, the rest of the plot points out as if this movie were based on another book. I don't mean that it was an adaptation of the original book, but there was an intent in this film to make the story more believable, which would be impossible in the context of the novel.  After seeing the first film, it was easy to pick that apart. The plot is nothing special and nothing else is made terribly convincing. The story is so poor that it's hard to believe the story will ever get to grips with it. The acting is bad. The cinematography is bad and the sets are bad. And while the plot is good, the characters themselves are boring and completely uninteresting. So why would anyone make this? I can't help but wonder why the producers chose to spend money on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film about a bunch of people who are completely unconcerned with the fact that they don't know the facts behind the deaths of the children. They just look on as the main plot contrivances, and some of their actions are just so obviously wrong, that you can't help but wonder if they actually think they are doing something that they obviously haven't.  There are two more things worth mentioning about this film. One of the characters is a small child named Olivia, who was killed by the parents of the three victims.  She has some connection with her sister Olivia, and she is the sister of the other victims. She, along with Olivia, is also a teacher of a class that teaches at a local school. This school is also the school that Olivia works in. In the very early part of the film, Olivia and Olivia's teacher are having their own little argument, and Olivia is talking to the principal. It turns out that Olivia and her sister have very serious and violent problems, and apparently one of Olivia's neighbors is very violent with Olivia. Olivia, in turn, is afraid of this person, because he has some connections with this person (I guess this guy is the "killer"). The "killer" seems to think she wants to kill Olivia, but Olivia doesn't seem to mind. Why would Olivia do such a horrible thing? Because she was an adult and she had no desire to harm anyone.  In the end, Olivia discovers that the parents have had made some serious mistakes, and that the killer was now planning on killing her. I guess she will try to get the killer and get back to her way of doing something. I find this very odd, considering that there are only 2 people who had that desire for Olivia, Olivia was not one of the killers. The killer seems to be completely oblivious to the fact he had also made some grave errors in this movie, and it is very obvious that the murderer is an utterly inept person who doesn't care about himself.  I cannot believe I had the opportunity to put the killer down, and all I did was to see what was coming next. I am sorry to say that I really thought of this movie as a horror film, but I think it is not one, and I don't think that is really the case.  This movie is the lowest I have ever seen. It is the only one that I have never heard of. The plot does not make any more sense. It
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a waste of time and that of course, is the chief reason I gave it such a low rating.  I couldn't find any plot, storyline, plot, or characters to relate to anything else. I can't see how this movie is supposed to relate with any other works. There is no story, no real plot, no storyline, and the whole movie just makes no sense.  To make the characters more interesting, you have to go out to look for some real world situations and create some situations. This movie has no real story and it isn't interesting. A lot of this is just a collection of people in a house, who talk to each other and talk to others that make no sense in any form except that there is some kind of sex. The plot is lame and just made no sense to anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this film at a video rental store in NYC. The acting was horrible, and the overall plot was just stupid.  It's really bad to watch such a bad piece of film making.  If I had any faith in this movie, I would have never believed it was real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to hear about a movie: "Dance With Monsters" is so bad, it is so terrible, it's so bad that the movie made me cry.  You can't even figure out how bad it is.  A movie made out of words and made out to make you think you should really be in hell.  But, what you do know, "DANCE WITH MONSTER" is actually quite good.  If you're a little interested in making a horror film, don't pay this one.  It's not like "DANCES WITH MONSTERS" that it's only good for "Dancers With Monsters". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most pathetic movie i've seen. It is so bad, it's so embarrassing and the only thing to be ashamed of in this movie is you should never watch it, it ruins everything your life. My wife said she wanted to throw it out because it's too bad and I was the only person that was scared to see it. Why is that, because I'm not even a fan of movies that are as bad as this one?? No. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad, it is hilarious to anyone that is not a "star" in his or her job. I don't know if anyone, besides friends or family, should even see this movie. This is the type of film where no one can do anything they will have to say unless the director is also a star. The "star's" name must not be kept in the film to be an "star". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked some of the new indie films from the UK, like The Pursuit, True Lovers, and others, but The Grunts was a totally amateur piece of film making. Although it doesn't really develop as I expected, it is definitely more disappointing than others, especially The Pursuer.  But it is fun to watch in the dark, when there are no lights on.  The Grads has some pretty cool actors in it, but this really isn't too good, nor does it have much action. I didn't even like The Grids very much, but I think you would just have to watch it in a dark place. There were some moments of humour, which I never really felt in The Gruts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so terrible it almost comes off as a documentary - i've seen worse but this one really does suck. The acting is terrible, the sets are horrible, the script is totally incoherent and the only way this movie made any sense was to do a really crappy comedy. They really need to make better movies, not something like this. The only good thing in this movie is the soundtrack (you know what I mean, i don't have any songs). If you're expecting something better, don't go there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very similar to a lot of movies of the last century, but is nowhere like a "good movie". In my opinion this movie isn't that bad, but I guess it's not as bad as I expected it to be. The acting is awful, and the plot is very predictable. I felt like the plot was being put down in a couple of days, and I was very disappointed when the ending came out of nowhere and gave me a good ending. I was hoping the movie would be better than the one that came before it, but in the end I think it got lost. I will give this movie 2 stars for entertainment value, but 1 of 1's really lost a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, the acting was terrible. The story was lame, not that surprising given the level of effort put into the movie. The acting was bad, the script was bad and the direction was terrible, the story was bad. I couldn't help but think that the director felt too big and couldn't find the time of the plot or when it occurred.  It was impossible to see this film if you had one. I gave this movie a 10 because the story of a person who has a girlfriend and has to break up with her because of her being in his apartment is pretty cool. Unfortunately, this movie is nothing like a movie made for a documentary or some sort of documentary series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had nothing to do. I thought it was stupid to "star" and then go on to have a big movie with "famous" stars like the rest. I was disappointed that they wasted the money on this pathetic movie. It could have been a movie for children, but the actors are completely amateur. I'm not saying this because of the acting, but just because they are really bad and very poorly written. The script really isn't good. Some of the scenes are almost impossible to understand.  This movie should be turned into a movie of "My Favorite Movie:  This is one of those movies that people can't get into. Why waste money like that? I have to wonder why people waste it on anything, but I'm sure it's not because people enjoy making movies and movies that don't have any real meaning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is obviously made out of the backwoods by a bunch of people who have no idea what a movie should be like. It is so bad, in most respects, that I decided to give this one a go... and give it 10/10: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie and really was sorry to see it. I knew I was not going to like it. While I would have liked a good film to watch, this one was too bad. Not only is it ridiculous for a female to act like a man, they don't really go for a man with a beard and they do not seem to do anything. My friends just laughed at how the 'guylines' that you'd be forced to wear seemed so ridiculous.   The movie is about a man who is in the basement, and who is supposed to be playing a little game with his little beard, that was a bit too unrealistic. It was pretty difficult to guess what would happen to him if he was in the attic and all he had was a small beard. Then, the man would just disappear and his wife would come down to get revenge on the old man. The whole movie had a little bit of humor to it, but I didn't understand it. It all looked like a film set. It just seemed really silly and very silly.  The acting was OK though, the camera work wasn't terrible. But the movie just wasn't very good either. I don't want to waste my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love my friends and have always been proud of my husband, but this film really put me into the pit of despair.  There was no thought-making, plot-development, or thought-tearing...  I have seen it twice... once on the Internet and once at The Crows' theater! I thought the production was awful, but the actors were good. This movie was completely incomprehensible, with a bunch of weird stuff happening in the theater... like a weird zombie virus. The acting was bad, but, at least, the plot was good.  Unfortunately, I was pretty sick of watching it... but I decided to watch it anyway, hoping that it might save my mind.  I was left alone in the middle of the theater watching it.  What a total waste of a film... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole plot of this movie is the worst of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is not funny at all. I cannot believe that these people have the nerve to go through the whole thing. This is an attempt at humor that does not even have the slightest idea of a character, a character that has a name and an idea to go along with. It was completely amateur. I am thinking you should not waste your time watching it, unless you are a comedy fanatic. This movie is an excuse to waste your money on the trashy movie "The Dog's Basket" which I rated 7 out of 10 but I just couldn't go by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it was made out of money. I laughed so hard. The movie is about a couple that gets pregnant and a girl that takes it into her mind that this is her fiancé, even though she's only a couple of months older than he is.  When you watch this movie, you're thinking, 'this is a movie that took money away from me. This movie was so weak I almost laughed out of my pants.'  I didn't see the ending. It didn't help that there was so much drama. And the movie was such a big hulk it had to be filmed in a big studio. The ending is just boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a classic example of bad cinema, with no story and no direction, the characters are flat, the cinematography is terrible, it's horrible to listen. I watched it at the end of my senior film studies program. I don't even remember how it turned out to be the movie I had. I can't tell how I missed it because it doesn't have an ending to give you closure. I was convinced to watch it because I knew it would be a better way to express my disappointment. I knew I was wrong but I couldn't care less. I've seen bad movies before and this was the worst of them.  I guess you can see it in a few parts in the "Cinemas Of A Teen" series. It's got a bit, and that's why I chose to watch this instead. The only saving feature in this movie is the special effects, which are cheap (especially the scene where the guys turn the camera's lens into a big window); they do make some good light effects, but the special effect is poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was terrible, it had too much going on and a horrible plot. If it was a film from "Titanfall", I would give it a 3 out of 10. But this was really a "Tomb Raider" film, I cannot believe it exists. I'm going to laugh at the idea of a tomb of a fallen empire...I don't know how it got that name, but it certainly is similar to "Tiger".  This is a movie not aimed at any type of fans, but only one. The only redeeming trait in this film was the director. He knew nothing, he had only one clue, and that was to not waste his time.  The characters were terrible, a lot of the shots were not accurate, and most of the acting was bad. The story of the people who died...it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very strange. Very strange. I have never been a fan of these types of movies, although I have seen them. However, this movie really did not turn into what I would normally expect from a film, so I don't think it worked. The characters are just horrible, the plot is unbelievable, the story is extremely convoluted. I just could not believe they were the actors. I never expected anything like that. I can't imagine anything happening! I just don't know how it works. The acting was good. But sadly, it was very poor. In my opinion, the ending just made me angry. If you want to watch something interesting and like acting, this is not it. This is just a bad example of an awful movie. I hope that people will decide to turn this into a movie of a mediocre movie. We can't have that sort of movie, we need more entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not that bad for a movie, but very disappointing. The film is full of clichés (in my opinion) and I can't find this type of acting anywhere else in the world...  This is a typical "one-act, one- shot, two-camera" movie that has absolutely nothing to do with reality.  I can hear it's ending pretty quickly. I watched it because I had a feeling of embarrassment. I felt that the film was bad. There was no depth to the story, no one was convincing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't quite qualify for that title. At least the plot is supposed to be interesting, and the acting is generally good. But the movie isn't that good, and there is the unfortunate tendency of this movie to get the two-trick. If a movie that was made about a serious businesswoman and was made for a comedic-intended comedian could be seen as a serious movie (at least) and be made by a professional filmmaker (at worst) and made out of professional quality, a movie which looks like a professional effort but is obviously amateur. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see if this movie was directed or not based on a story. It's obviously not. If you'd like some other options, you might be able to pick some from "Lord of the Rings" and "Lord Of The Rings" or "The Hobbit" and go from one to the other. If these movies were real, you would get a little bit of a thrill from the story of two heroes who are destined to lose their lives or something similar. That's not how "LordOf The Rings", the only movie that has been created since it's sequel, will behave. This movie is bad, bad, and bad is probably the only way I can describe it. A major flaw of this movie is that it is slow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not a hit at all but was a disaster, but I still had faith that it could be salvaged. As I watched it, I kept thinking it would make for the great 'Tetopia' series. Alas, the idea was ruined. Although it had some good moments, they were too little to make the story itself. As if the whole cast of the actors were cast by a mad writer. This made no sense to make it more than just a movie: too many characters, and too few dialogue elements. You just can't make such a terrible movie. The acting was also too low. The story was poorly written. I was looking forward to a film with some substance. After the first half of the movie, the only good thing I saw was the music. I would like to see the movie again and hopefully be able to salvage this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, what are you? A big big fan of a bad film: I am the biggest one. What happens? The ending, the storyline, the plot, the direction and the action scenes that have been worked in, are all pretty much what you would expect and they aren't. Well, the ending is nice, but the plot is just plain bad. You don't get to see the story, you don't find out why the man is in that hospital or why he is left in a hospital? Oh, well, what happens, is that a man is left alone in the hospital with a little girl, he comes in a strange way and, we don't know where he is, but he is able to go without seeing his wife and the girl on the hospital bed. Well...? He's in a lot of trouble, but it's pretty good that he manages to survive a few days, so what? The doctor there, what do you do? Where is he doing that? That's the mystery. That's why he goes there. Where did the woman come from? Who is she? And why do you care? Why do you want to see this movie? This film is a complete waste of time. Oh, I guess it was good because I enjoyed the first 2 minutes and I thought that the ending was OK. Oh well, it's OK because I had to find the answers to the questions I had? OK, OK, that's OK, I'll admit. In the end it is OK to make a film, I suppose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Gina Carigno's Love Lost" is a disgusting, boring film that really makes no sense. The title has a catchy name, but the fact that it has a title at all, and the "clarity" of the film is just so bad. I've never seen one more boring or insulting "movie" than "Gara Carigne's Love." The film is obviously trying to steal the thunder from the "Dusk" title of director Luis Cora's "The Secret Mission." The dialog is wooden, stupid, ridiculous, and really makes absolutely no sense at all.  The whole movie seems to be a big money joke. I can't think of another movie where the characters act this bad. "Gonia" has a similar premise, but it's obviously much worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie of the film "Pete" tells the true story of a young, awkward person from the town who discovers a woman who wants to kill someone who she thinks she is. This girl can't believe that she is the killer and that she has no idea why. I must admit I like the girl in the show but not the show itself.  When the girl says she is a killer I think twice if she wants to be killed then why should she go with her and what is her motive?  The movie was directed like a big waste of time because it doesn't even come close to the true events of the real life murder. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film set in a dystopian cyberpunk world, it plays out like a sitcom, but with bad plot. I can't believe that this movie was made, and I don't understand why it was made in the first place. I won't watch it. The plot is stupid and the story is bad, but then there is something else that this is supposed to be. You want to be entertained by an action film in a futuristic world, but when there's something that you need to get involved in, you don't have any idea what you are going to do. The acting is poor, but they are obviously trying to make the film so they are able to pull it down. The story is good but it is lousy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original theme of this film is based on the fact that it's the same story that has been re-worked every time a new movie is made. This movie, by the way, doesn't really do anything new, nothing new, no new message or message, nothing interesting. It is just a very predictable story. The only plot twists that you have to follow are predictable. The ending of the movie is really bad, especially the way that the main character is murdered by the mob. This makes the murder a moot to me. It's not funny or interesting at all. This film, though, is far better than most of the original Batman films and is definitely a bad choice for the "Batman" franchise. The fact that they are "Batman" is also bad. I've already rated this movie: 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is like a typical bad movie. Very little, very slow, and very predictable. I found myself nodding with annoyance the entire time. I finally decided to watch "The Menace" at a local theater in California, and was promptly thrown into another movie with some random name actors. I laughed at the first scene and I think I might have laughed more if the director and a co-producer were not so terrible. I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen, not only because I was unable to find any way to watch this movie. I am absolutely certain it is no excuse to say that this is a movie for kids, because the title of it makes it seem that kids like to play with this type of stuff. They don't play with that for very long. This film is so bad I cannot believe that I am watching it. I just give it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie ever made. The plot is weak. The acting is bad, the directing is bad. The movie is terrible. The script is weak, the story is weak... and the ending sucks.  The good ending is that it delivers the perfect ending; the movie was good, but if the movie had to come out of the movie making, then it would have been better. But this is not the case.  I have never really seen this movie in a movie theater, but I would expect it to come up in a Hollywood theater at a movie convention... not at home! It is just a bad way for a "classic" thriller or horror movie to develop a plot. The only reason why I went with this movie was because I have seen many of the movies that "made similar" to this one. There are some better movies out there.  This movie is the complete opposite. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, the characters were good. I have to say they weren't awful, in fact I thought they were better than most of the other characters in the film. But the movie wasn't as dramatic as they should have been. The script wasn't good. There was too much wasted time on scenes that were not important, and I couldn't understand the storyline. The acting was bad. The camera scenes were terrible, they just weren't good either. But then, at the end, you can always expect the final push of the movie to bring the viewer to the edge of what was supposed to be a cliff. The ending is pretty lousy too. There is a scene where the girl gets stabbed in the back of the head, and you can almost see it in the room that you are standing in now.  I think the reason that this movie is not available is because it is not suitable to be released in a proper theatrical production. I would rate it at 2 out of 10. I do recommend this film to avoid. You'll most likely miss the ending of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first film I can recall that I don't remember. This is really bad, and I couldn't even care less. There are some good performances. It's bad for this film. I'm sure I'm not being unfair. But I do find it hard to blame the writers. There was too much action in the film, and too much acting (especially acting) was really bad. They put the characters in situations they didn't intend to, and you'll get bored with watching it. They just couldn't get all the drama they wanted. The cinematography was very bad, but they could have made better films. I won't see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only film I have seen with an anti-religious message. The film is completely lacking in plot, in character and in acting. We all knew that the main character's religion would be the main driving force behind all of his actions. And the characters were obviously anti-religionist as they gave their lives away for an afterlife. The movie isn't even about religion; it's about lust and the pursuit of money and sex...and not even religion. I'm sorry to say that this film was made by a group of people who don't even know what they're going to do with their lives.  This movie is about how one man, a Christian, is having a relationship with another (one of his former lovers) and wants to kill another man (another of his previous lover) for their own reasons. This has to be a very serious and very serious concept that people need to be taught about how to be free. Why this film ever got made is the same as "The Day After", which was completely unnecessary and senseless. This is no excuse for anyone to try and convince people to change. It's not just the film was bad, it's worse for all of us who have had such a horrible life or anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to seeing "The Naked Beauty" because I like to read this movie. I had to know the title, but the book was so obviously a sexless, shallow, and just plain bad.  The sexiness is too distracting to make me spend half the movie in watching this movie: I'm really not sure why it even ended.  My opinion of this movie is that it was just terrible, and nothing interesting. It doesn't have any real feeling, nor real value in itself. It just shows you a bunch of women who are pretty, and not very attractive. The only reason I chose to watch it was because it was the first film with Marilyn Monroe. The reason I waited until now was because I was certain that she would say some interesting things in her film, and then she would surprise me again. I just don't see any value in this movie beyond the title. It's a waste of Marilyn Monroe's life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just got caught up in a circle and that it is getting harder to follow and I'm more certain it isn't that bad. But that makes the movie bad for me, it's not funny. Not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only redeeming quality in this film is some decent performance from the characters. Unfortunately the characters are dull, with a few too many bad twists to make the film worse. I had to look at the DVD and see how badly it was written to make this film. In the case I would give it 4 out of 10 but the film itself was rather decent, though not really that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film, the whole theme of'super-heroes' and the ability to use any super-hero is just a big waste of time. The movie itself has very little substance. The only 'heroes', in this movie, are the three who have all but lost their lives or their loved ones in a similar movie. Not only is this really ridiculous, but it is a very annoying waste of money. The storyline is just so weak, that you feel like you're wasting money to sit there and see the actors, like the actors in the previous movie. They're just a waste of movie time and money. I gave this movie two stars. I just couldn't stand the fact that they used a whole lot of other actors, who are all the actors and actresses who are the stars in this whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some parts that are good and some parts are good, but they don't really go that far. What's the point of a movie like this? You want a better movie, don't waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. Don't let the plot and suspense die in our hearts. The idea is that a "crime" is perpetrated on a woman who kidnaps a young boy. That does not make any sense at all. The ending is painfully predictable and makes you want to leave the theater.  The acting is very bad. All the actors either struggle or are simply stupid. All of the lines were written but just don't have the actors' courage to carry them through.  Avoid at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title says it is a "classic," but it sure isn't. This is the only movie I ever saw that was a waste of time. Not even the one that I watched was fun.  The plot of the movie was so terrible that it is actually a spoiler. If it were truly a plot, the entire movie should have been directed by the writer. The only thing that was good in the film was the scene where the kids learn how to read, but nothing else. It was a boring scene.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing that I'd like to say is, don't waste your money! You'd have spent $5 on this movie: you would have spent more time doing research, researching, and watching all the horrible things that happen on this plane.  I'd be grateful if the plane would do not get destroyed or fly out of the air! If I had the chance to get a chance to escape and watch it, my jaw would be open. However, at the end, it does not stay in a position, where you can escape. It does not land at its destination. The movie doesn't give you enough time to watch it and escape.  The other movie I watched was about a bird, and the way it ate. I don't know what it ate, but I can tell you what it killed. I was just disappointed.  You can see that you're better off spending money on something that you can appreciate like "Wander Island" rather than "Aviation Quest". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I am feeling up for a movie to watch, I'm usually drawn out of it in a similar way. It is the kind of movie where you are expected to spend 30 minutes in some sort of bizarre situations. The way it played out, it made no sense, and I think it just went on and on without much more direction. This movie is pretty bad. It was a pretty slow-paced film, but at times the pace was slow enough to really get lost in the strange scenery. I would have expected better from such a movie, like a classic 80's Sci-fi movie. The characters were very predictable, even the ones who were meant to be killers were stupidly predictable. And the acting didn't have a great effect, except for the plot. It just wasn't that interesting, I suppose you could use this for a film that is more about people having a personal story of life rather than some weird sci-fi action. Perhaps if the plot were less interesting it would have been a more interesting one, and a fun one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is like a "fishing" for an idiot. It is boring, stupid, completely unfelevant and is devoid of any feeling that makes this movie a movie. If you get to like that type of movie, you'll like it. However, you won't really enjoy it as a movie: it's a movie that just doesn't make much sense. You don't know what's going on. It just plain sucks.   If you are looking for a good movie, go for it. There are plenty of those.  If the person reading this is a writer, or director, or producer or producer, then you need to consider yourself. As an example, here is what you want: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie only because of the awesome TV show The Walking Dead. But after an hour and half of watching, I decided it was just too dumb to wait. Even the actors got a little better in this one. But then the acting and acting were really awful. For example, the guy who played Aaron at the farm in season one was nothing like Robert, the man that portrayed Aaron in season two. The man had an extremely annoying, ridiculous voice. He sounded like a baby. In the episode where he was in the hospital, he was yelling at the ambulance, even with the ambulance driver driving down to the farm. The acting wasn't nearly as bad as this movie, but the acting was horrible. The villain for the whole episode is a guy who thinks he's a child and is about a week behind in age and is supposed to be a child murderer. In this movie Aaron had been acting more like a child killer than his regular self. I just can't believe they even put him in the movie. He looked so stupid. But I guess this movie was about an actual case of child abuse. Even for a movie where kids played a little bit, this movie should have been put in a "Children's Channel." I mean, you've got a kid who has an extremely stupid voice. The fact that they had gotten the actor to sing a few songs is ridiculous. And the fact that everyone else was so horrible is beyond me. I know how dumb that actor is. I have seen it on TV, and I can't imagine that. I'm not saying he didn't have a brain. Maybe he was a real person. This movie should only be on a DVD so that the people can't get to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is bad, so bad, bad, that the plot is good but it's not made well enough to bring even the slightest interest into the movie. It's too long, too convoluted, too unbelievable. It is too stupid and, at the same time, too stupid. I wanted to see the ending, and it didn't happen.  I thought the best part of the movie was the ending. It was too predictable, too ridiculous. I just did not feel any connection with the characters. There's no reason for this movie to happen. It isn't very good. But I can't blame the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't help with the idea of "gutty" and its use as a synonym for "junkie" and "humor" but it's hard to say.  I guess what people will call this movie, and it's not my fault. They say that it's a comedy but it isn't one and I can assure you that if you go to see it, you will find it a comedy. It isn't funny. It's a waste of time to watch this movie.  And what a piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the reason for people to despise this movie. If you want to watch a movie that would have been better if only the story would be better, I don't recommend it. If only the actors were good, the story wasn't bad. If there were a real plot, it was just bad.  There is absolutely no plot. The plot, except for some "twinnies" as "twins" and "twin sisters". Nothing happens. It is just a movie about a lame teen girl going out on a trip with a male stranger to Mexico. And the movie is about a bunch of people leaving a bad college town. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major problem with this movie is that the fact that it is a film is largely made of words that are very predictable. And the "propert" actors just don't do enough or well in their roles.  Overall, this movie was a complete failure.  The acting wasn't really good enough for this film to be made. At a point, it is worth a shot of the nearest window in the film and a couple of hours in a car, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Red Rock" is a classic example of what has been dubbed as "a film designed by people who had an idea but not a script" for years. It lacks the kind of plot or character that would work in any real-world film. It's just a collection of people acting in a circle. In other words, "RedRock" is about a bunch of people who are stupid, incapable, and clueless. They are all trying to catch others who are trying to make others mad. They have to make sure their friends don't catch them or anyone else. They're all trying and failing to make any real sense. They act like they're trying to get people to stop doing something. They can't even make that up for themselves.  The characters are pretty good. But none of the characters are anything good. Not enough of them are interesting, and the ending is horrible. The actors are pretty poor, and there are too many clichés and contrived scenes. The premise is ridiculous.  This isn't like a film that I would recommend as a film. But it's just bad, so bad it should be thrown out immediately. It doesn't have anything to do with real life. If you are going to watch this movie and see it for yourself, I hope you don't have to do anything that will make it worthwhile. The idea that you could call it a "movie" is just ridiculous. At the end of the movie there are two really ridiculous scenes, which are pretty ridiculous and stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a hilarious scene where a group of people find a new sex-shaping-machine in the garage. The movie follows a predictable plot with a bunch of people getting a little bit of action, the only problem being that the "action" is predictable. And since there are a bunch more people in the movie, that doesn't matter. I just sat there and laughed at the scene of a guy running around like a chicken with a car. It was just too ridiculous. I also couldn't figure out why there were any girls in the film. Maybe they wanted to be a girl or something, but they couldn't get along with me. It's not worth seeing for people who actually have a sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those "Bats" movies I find with a film-making style that really doesn't deserve the title.  It just isn't interesting to watch in a cinema.  What was interesting was the way the characters were treated by the characters in the film. I just can't believe that this movie was made in America. The plot was stupid and unbalanced and the characters had no real life except for their appearance in the movie. The music was weak and the plot didn't help at all. This is about as bad as movies like "Punch Up" and "The Expendables". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was incredibly boring and just made me want to kill myself. It would have been better if they put out a movie of the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can get a sense of how badly things are going at the beginning of "The New Year" as it goes down a bit by the end. Even the best of "Tresham's Legends" would be more effective in a story-line in that place. But if it does indeed take place in London, I'm sure that it would be worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a hard time watching this movie because of the predictable and predictable things that came before it. It was very predictable. The story lacked a lot of plot, which is what people seem to expect from a dramatic production. In essence, the storyline, especially the plot to the movie, is very boring. The dialog is bad and the characters are completely unlikable. The film doesn't present any interesting characters. It's very predictable and the ending doesn't really make any sense. I've seen the same types of movies: a predictable movie with a predictable story. However, I didn't mind watching this one. The acting and the plot was OK. But the film failed to make me believe anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years ago I had stumbled upon this movie in "Fusion" and I didn't even know that it was a bad film at the beginning of it. Now I'm wondering why it had ever been released at all. This movie was the only real movie I had ever watched. I can't even fathom why anybody could actually sit and watch it. How on Earth was this made?! Did they actually think they needed a film to be made for them? I don't know.  This movie is basically just a fat, mean looking teenager trying to steal a movie he's been making for years by taking some obscure jokes from the Internet and watching them in a ridiculous way. This film is like an old car-making machine. The only thing that saved this movie was a few moments of extreme clarity which could have kept this movie a little more interesting. If you want to make a film, you can put whatever crap you want on your film and I highly recommend that you don't. It doesn't have any redeeming qualities, and you'll just want to watch this so you can watch it and then get into some boring fights, and watch people get punched and slapped and killed. But I've never understood the message this movie is about. I have absolutely no idea why this is called a "movie". I mean it's a horror film, not even an adventure movie, and it's not about an actual movie. It just pretends to be a horror movie and nothing more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie for a long time, and I can't seem to care about anything else in it. I am a big fan of the Mad Men movies, and this is one of those movies that just can't believe the bullshit in it, that it seems so much like a movie I am sure would have laughed at it if I didn't get sick at the end. It just feels like a waste of my time.  It was not even funny. The most important aspect of it was the idea of a married guy, and the fact that it was an unrealistic idea in itself. For some reason, the idea was never developed. At least one of the characters in it had his wife in the film.  And when you think of this movie, you really get the idea that the people in it don't have a sense of humor. They obviously didn't. At all.   All in all, this is a shame to my eyes. At the end of this horrible movie, I will never go back. But I am glad that I was able to watch it to the end and see my mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was awful, but it was okay. But unfortunately, it was very stupid, and it didn't make very much sense. What made it all so is that the acting was so bad. They didn't get a chance to do something for the enjoyment of the audience. It just doesn't make any sense. This is probably the worst film directed, filmed, and published on the year.  I recommend you avoid this film if you get a hunk of money from a good movie: it's so bad that people won't even see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that I couldn't even watch it, and so I had to go to find a DVD: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Locked In In A Shelter" is a bad, awful movie. It's bad, but it's not the worst kind of bad.  The plot is not as horrible as the other movies starring actors such as Matt Damon, Al Pacino, Edward Kain, and Timothy Zephyr, but not so bad as "Locker."  "Dramadango" is the only good movie in this bunch, and I would like to say something about it but I was just too fed up with its stupid, cheesy, and pointless plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I had the pleasure of watching this movie on TV, I watched it with my friends who wanted to see it as their favorite. It ended up being something very disgusting, but not to mention. It seemed like a made-up show, made-ass, a ridiculous number of times. It did seem to come out of a place that had nothing to do with reality, which I think is a common problem in reality shows, but this movie was no where it was. I'm sure the production team was aware of the issue and tried to make something to make fun of, but sadly they got so wrong. I can't imagine what they were thinking or why they put so much effort into making something for their "documentary," and this only made it worse. They should be making more money, not trying to make an absurd comedy with a bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is no excuse for this lousy movie. They knew better and should have done something. This is a movie for the little boy and girl who needs a little bit of entertainment in their life. Sadly, you don't have one in the film. This movie is just about a drunk old man who has problems with his wife and can't even make out with his little one. That's the movie's only similarity to the book, and that's where it should have been. No, in this film you get a drunk who's just a bit pathetic and thinks he's going to die. Oh no, not that. The reason this movie isn't any fun is that the story has been a bit predictable and the end of it was too predictable. The movie starts out with a predictable situation, but ends right there. In the end, the person (the man) decides what would happen next and then tells his wife that he's dead. What's more? The woman is then drunk and goes into some really scary situations. I thought the scene of the dying husband and the pregnant woman was the most gruesome and shocking scene that ever came out of this movie. In short, there's really nothing interesting in this movie at all. It was just so boring that I didn't even get to laugh. This one is no better than the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if you have been put into watching this. Maybe it was supposed to be some sort of horror movie, but I felt like this was nothing but a pitiful piece of trash. I was thinking for myself "it was all the same as every other movie I've ever watched, and it was nothing more than a waste of a good idea."  If you really are a horror movie fan you know the genre, if you're a slasher fan then you are just getting a little more of an excuse to waste time on "The Boogie" and just not that bored. But if you just want to sit around, you won't be disappointed.  Avoid this movie at all costs, even if you think it's good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen it before. People say it is a great movie, but it is the worst comedy of a movie. I don't understand how any of the actors in this movie can have given such a horrible script, as the plot was so bad it was impossible to listen to, or feel like they are actors, in a movie I could only see once in all. There was no story. And the acting was bad, as people said when it came out. I also couldn't even find where the actors were actors in their first performance, so the funny scenes are completely fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in a video store at the store, not a movie for sale, and a DVD had a label in it that was only about the movie: "A film about a car wreck that goes crazy." So I thought maybe the video store would be a little different. And I thought if it was a movie, it should have a lot of violence. But I couldn't find this in the video stores or at home. I didn't even find that label. And my wife said that it had some blood in it.  I watched it twice, and thought "what is it? Is it like they had in movies? They made movies like that before?  I had a little bit of hope from this movie that it would make me like this movie, but I was completely disappointed. The acting was horrible, it was horrible. The story was too convoluted, the camera shots were terrible, there were no good photography, everything was just bad. I have seen better movies than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, the first thing to ask me is that it's all too slow and very predictable. Secondly, it seems as though the actors were so badly rehearsed and that the dialog was so badly written that it seemed like a poorly rehearsed play. My guess is that the actors and the director are just simply not as good as in the first movie they are in the sequel, but they are talented. I am a real fan of the original series, and it is not that the story itself isn't as interesting but the story just isn't worth it. There's no real reason why anyone in the "twister" should go into this crap again. The ending is so pointless and predictable that you can't wait to see it just to get the last few lines. The director can't have that many actors for everything, and the fact that he tries so hard to recreate it in his movie is another excuse for the rest of us to watch it and see it again without seeing the end. Even the director himself admits that the ending doesn't go far enough, and that he has to rely on his best actor to save himself. This movie could have at least a couple of interesting characters - I'd be happy if the actors had some more time and effort put into it. At the same time, it doesn't really make any sense why anyone would spend money on this crap. There is only one thing worth investing in and that is the director, but he's done too much of his job in the making of this movie - he's not that talented or that creative. If you've seen the first "Twister", I'll guarantee that you won't get quite as close to the story as you'd like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors do little or nothing except a series of very bad dialogue and bad directing. The plot is quite good in most respects and the performances are terrible. Some of the dialog may be good or even good but the characters are horrible. There are some good moments but they are so bad that they never come together. If the actors were good enough I could overlook most of the horrible acting, but the writers, as usual, fail miserably at getting the right combination of actors and settings. It just doesn't work. It is a bad excuse to rent this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie I have seen in an over 50 year time. I have been watching movies all my life and this was not one of my favorites.  I do not like the fact that this movie is for the younger generation of youth and not really for the older crowd. This movie was not really about how things would be if there were real people in the way the movie showed. What happened in the movie was about how the teens went into a situation and what people would do if there was real people involved in the situation. There is nothing like real people out there in this movie and the movie had nothing but bad scenes. Some of the acting was good but most of the actors were bad. I did not expect to be so bad in this. I can't believe the plot was supposed to be what the movie ended. It seemed more like the plot in the beginning. I thought the movie would make a movie about a teenage girl who was taken into a similar situation as the teen in the first movie. They just made a story to see how to do it. And it just turned into a pointless story. This is bad for the movie. It can't happen, it is impossible to be made because they did so little. The movie had to be a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that I could have gotten a higher rating of this film than I did. However, this movie was very disappointing. The story line is the typical stupid cliché (though it is a cliché, to be fair, i'm not complaining about it) of a young girl going to university, which is usually a good thing, but unfortunately doesn't go too far. I also found it extremely slow and dull, even during the opening scene. There is also no story or any plot line. I had expected some better actors (maybe) and it didn't. I'll be very surprised if this gets picked for the next "Shakespeare" film (if there is one) because there was a much better storyline and a much more satisfying ending. The worst thing of the film was the story. I would say it wasn't horrible but it wasn; it wasn the same, but it just was extremely stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this was the worst movie I have ever seen,there was nothing special and it was just boring,all in all made no matter which way. I could of barely keep myself to watch it. the only thing i do find interesting in the film is the fact that it's based on a true story and it tries to do that in an uninteresting way. It doesn't even make any sense. If you want to see a movie that tries to be realistic and that it deals with problems then you will enjoy this movie,but don't expect to see it as a movie. It was just a waste of time,one reason i was so angry was the fact there was only 2 or 3 actors and if that were the case the movie could have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care for anything about this movie. But this movie is bad, bad, and bad. The only thing I'm expecting from this movie: a sex scene. I'll be surprised if anyone has the gall to put out this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about an abandoned house with a small child in it. The child is kidnapped by the big bad guys, who want to turn it into a zombie movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a bad comedy movie but this is the only thing that bothers me. I am a fan of The Love Doll Show and The Love doll Show is one of my favourites but this has nothing in common with any of them. I found this movie to be totally lame with no story, no plot, no characters, no laughs, nothing except some stupid little girl-child (who I was looking at for all time) with an annoying haircut and an annoying accent. I have seen some comedies that don't go through the motions for much longer and The Last Seduction. This was nothing more than the usual crap but I thought there was plenty of it in The Love dolls. That was the only part of this movie that made me gasp. The only thing you can fault in this movie is the script. The movie tries to do something which it couldn't. It tried so hard and so hard to make you believe it is a funny movie. It failed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no money to waste, and I have nothing to do with this movie. Why, I do not know. My friend, who actually got money for a movie about a bunch of dead friends, thought it would be a good way to get a lot of money, and he got so involved. Well, I say, let the actors do their own thing. They can't do everything by themselves, and they need help from the "people that were there". I think it's just plain bad to see it so quickly after seeing the movie, and then not really see it until later. This movie is horrible to me. I tried not to see this movie if I had to. I hope they can do better. But this movie is not for kids. I am tired of having to see movies that don't actually teach. This is probably the worst of all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to read a movie: 1. "What is this?""  If I can't, then you should read the book. And if you still can, then the words will appear in the next moment.  If the book and the movie do not have enough knowledge to make you laugh, then they are a poor effort of a bad film.   The only problem is that the plot is so boring it doesn't stick.  In "Who Are the Monsters?" (Kerrigan) has a girlfriend, and he is bitten by the vampire, that is only slightly more entertaining than the movie, but even worse than the other movie.  This movie is basically a story in which the vampires have made many friends and have developed a network of contacts. This is pretty much an old story, and the actors do not add a great deal to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of the horror films I watch now, I find this is simply a waste of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible.  The film stars a young actor who is a little bit annoying to his co-star and has a bad chemistry with his co (a man who is annoying and a man who doesn't want to be a little boy), but at the end of it the movie tries to make up for his wasted acting. He is obviously a poor actor but doesn't act like himself at all. The first thing that struck me was his acting was very poor, and it was in "one of the worst movies ever made" - the first time it's ever been like that. He was just a stereotypical "good guy" - he was very much like the average person he is. The only funny thing was his supporting characters. He had some pretty good parts (the best and most annoying one), but the rest of them were quite awful. I thought the one guy's wife was like a "normal man". She was in every way hideous and creepy. The woman who was in the video had a little more screen time and a lot of money to do what she was doing in the film - she seemed so fake. It seems like the people were getting their money back for the film, and they were getting some kind of money from the "compsits" in order to get a bigger paycheck and a bigger salary. They hadn't been working with this for months, and the production seems to be in the middle of a recession. Also, the cinematography in this movie wasn't that good either. The images look like they were from a really old movie. That was also the first thing I thought was creepy.   I've seen better than this movie - but I'm still unable to take it. It's really just bad in it's general direction - although the script and direction were good, the story was bad.  If you're looking for a really decent movie: I have two choices: one of them is about a documentary or documentary that has a good story, but not much more. Or I guess I'll watch this film for comedy... but I don't know how you're supposed to even watch it. The acting is good in a way, but I think it was bad for what it was going to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first guess is the writer had something to do with the title, but the title was already very different and the plot was fairly convoluted. Maybe it just seemed like they never found a suitable title? It's difficult to believe the movie was even remotely like this in the first place. It's too hard to figure out how you could possibly make the case for a movie that lacks a plot or any explanation. I mean, for example, why the title is a metaphor? The main character is a big-wielding man who just seems like a god. It seemed so ridiculous to me that he would have had to be really a god to build a big, multi-layered city. What he needed to do was to create a god-like city, and I just can't understand why he was so insistant. He is like the big man from the book-The Wizard of Oz, and he was responsible for getting a message to "the human race" (or something like that?) to "hurt the world" by having his son killed the big guy, and you can't assume anything that was important to his son. The funny part is that he and his son get into contact and then, in a way, go into a battle as he sees a giant with no more than his body. But there's nothing in this movie that is even remotely humorous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie on DVD and was just a little disturbed. It is just so bad that it was pretty scary and I think the director had an over-hashed eye in his hair.  The acting wasn't good and the dialogue was just really bad... The story was terrible, with only 1 good moment in the movie (the moment in which they finally decided to shoot the man), and the ending was just OK, not really too shocking. I won't spend my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a little bit interested in this movie, but decided to turn it off when the opening scene got too nasty and I couldn't understand. The film is a typical B-movie of badness and nothing happens. There's a guy (played by Jack Karger) who starts taking on job for a company called "B-Team", but later finds he has to work with the employees to "solve a mystery." A little bit of extra money is made and then we see a mysterious figure at a mall and we end up with some weird footage. The movie's action is pretty lame. Very bad. It's just so bad it doesn't happen. It can't happen that way. Also, this film would probably be better if it were a straight thriller instead of a film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie at a video store so I don't remember it but I can say it was a terrible film. It had a weak script, a lame theme, no depth of action, a terrible acting, terrible effects, a ridiculous cast. The acting was terrible. Some of the actors seemed like they were from different movies or was acting in a short scene.  I think some of the better movies are like "Pellet the Match." (I haven't watched the TV series, but I watched this movie)   If you're a real movie lover like me and you're not too afraid to rent this movie, then you might like this movie a little bit of a shock to your minds. Unfortunately it's too long and not a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a break, I found a video that was one of those I'd most enjoyed. I didn't know if it was just another guy, a man, or a woman, but what the hell was this? I'm so, the director is one of the worst people who ever lived. It's boring, it's predictable, it can't make up it's life, it is like a person driving around aimlessly, without a hope of anyone having enough intelligence to make the trip. I can't say this because I know what it's like to make a movie like this, but it's bad no matter what genre. Even if you're watching "The Day after", this was just a bad idea to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Tina: The Music Video (Tina) has been, well, bad in every possible way. This is because the actors in the movie were terrible, the movie is completely incomprehensible, there's no music, no life or characters whatsoever, and the movie's endings are even less coherent.  This movie is actually a really bad movie, but it doesn't really have any interesting things to do. The movie features a young couple named "Tania" and their little son. They decide to have him "tamed", so they can visit each other's home.  The son, Tania, gets a home in a town that is named "Oasis" and meets a lady named "Lina". The "Lanna" is very old, and this town is really hot. As she approaches the old woman, Tariens is very eager to be reunited with her.  Tania and Tarians decide to marry in the town that the husband and mother of the couple live in, but the husband doesn't notice anything about the couple and her new home is very, very strange.  After they marry, the couple decide to stay in Oasis, and all of the other things happen there. The wife is extremely bored, and Tania goes into a lot of things about the old lady, but she doesn't have much interest in the new house. As her husband tries to get Tania to come back to his home, Tina and her son are bored, because he wants to see his wife, and instead of finding her a "crazy" person, she instead gets a movie: "The Woman's House", a stupid movie about a bunch of boring houses full of garbage! As the movie goes on, the people in the house start to get mad, and they all begin to become obsessed with Tania. After some time, the woman has a bunch in a basement who is screaming and screaming about how she doesn the other actors in there.  And they all try to kill themselves.  If you're wondering whether the movie was supposed to have some redeeming qualities, I had to see "The Other Side". This movie wasn't one of my favorites. But after seeing it, I didn't really care what happened in it.  There's some good songs in the soundtrack, but I wouldn't really think that the actors had much to do in the way the movie depicts them. They were pretty bad in the whole, although Tania
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few very good performances (and this was the only one in the film), but this film is awful. It has a pretty good premise, but it lacks much of the "fun" quotient needed to succeed. The acting is so bad, it's actually painful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a movie about a couple and a couple getting together to fight demons from an ancient cult who had plans to kill their victims. But I couldn't find it. It was about an old woman and a little girl who were being groomed by the cult who were planning to kill everyone who hadn't already died, but in the end she gets killed by the real murderers. She later reapposes as the leader of a cult. The film is pretty boring, but its plot gets pretty scary. The girl is killed by a bunch of demons (who can kill people easily) and then in the movie she learns that they can't kill her. The only other thing in the film is the girl's father and a bunch who killed her mother. When his wife is in the hospital recovering, he and another priest are praying about the demons who killed his wife and had his wife killed in this movie. That is obviously an incest. The acting is pretty poor, but it's not that bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, you know what a 'pip-in' is: a film, of some sort, that tries to be an intelligent but ridiculous film for its own sake. This film is no one for anyone to enjoy. It's a piece of trash.  If you enjoy movies that are not so smart, then this film is one for you to avoid at all costs. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like the original 'Star Wars,' you'll love this one a lot worse. Even if you liked it in the 'Star Trek' days, you'll hate it in this one, even worse than the original Star Trek.  The plot of this movie is so bad that you can see it in every movie after the first one. It starts with an absurd villain named 'Lord Stark,' and ends with a truly ridiculous plot.  If your a Star Trek fan, and you want to be scared of a guy named Stark, you will see it anyway. You won't even find this in a movie with any real plot or story. It's just a lame attempt at trying to resurrect the Sci-Fi genre.  Even worse than this was the original, this one is much better if you watch the 'The X-Man,' but it has its drawbacks. This is mainly because it was made for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has been out for a few months and the only real thing on it is a scene that I didn't have the patience to see. It's a scene where a bunch of sad clowns are all screaming at each other and one guy decides to pick the one clown he can beat. I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years, but this one stands out as being absolutely ridiculous. I can't believe that this film would be a movie of "real people". It really seems like the guy was the head of some sort of cult. This film is about the worst type of horror film ever made, so much for the characters, but you might just as well be glad it was an old horror film: the same acting and the same ridiculous story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a piece of trash this was. Not only one out of the 50 (including my favorite "Mr. Bitter" Aloudeh) with a little plot (though that was OK), but it had a ridiculous plot. Even the "plot" was so bizarre I couldn't believe it had been written. You would have thought you'd never have had such a storyline. A "plot", as I understand, is a collection of things. Some of the stories are told in different formats, some have some more dramatic elements, and many are merely a collection over a few minutes. The result is that the whole thing is a waste of energy. If you've read an old "Star Trek" series, you know that story. But you never think that this was one of the bad ones. In the case I'm speaking from, I'd like to see the way they would normally portray this story. It's not as ridiculous as "Space Mission", it's far more stupid. They would use a "plotless" approach. I had only watched these two episodes as a teenager, and I knew the storyline was just bad enough to make me think they were OK to watch again. But even after I finally saw it, I decided I'd never get involved with this kind of "story." Anyway, that's the very last movie I ever went to. I was wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really upset that this movie just doesn't know the name of this movie. I guess that they just know how to get a movie. This movie is so boring it is painful to watch. Just for those of us who didn't know what this movie was like. This is truly disappointing. It's a bad idea from such a great movie as "Muckin' New Year" for kids, but I guess it can still be funny to some children. I really wanted to see the episode where Kermit the dragon got his tongue into the mouth of "The Oldest of Dragons". It was the most interesting part of the movie (the one with the dragon fighting a dragon). But there are several other episodes where Keri is a little bit lame and didn't seem to do anything except for fighting each other, while fighting in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this film from a friend and after watching it, I couldn't believe what it was. The beginning of the film is about a group of people who are looking to make a movie: a bunch of people (probably looking for a "movie") who get together and find a producer named "Mr. Money" and make him a director. The film, unfortunately, does not make an ending. In fact, "Mr Money" is so little bit creepy and self-help that it seems like I'm watching a short play. There's not much plot here. Basically, you spend a lot of time sitting around in the corner of a hotel room in front of the hotel room and you spend some time in a room filled with people and they all seem really weird. There are some scenes that aren't even filmed in front a hotel. This movie seemed really painful to watch in this situation. The camera was just moving around, not moving through it. The actors were just in there, there was nothing to interact with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad.  I've seen much worse things, but I'd rather waste twenty minutes to get past this. It is just a pile of overrated cheese, a bunch of over-hunked songs, and some silly dancing. When is the last musical that anyone in the whole world could really sing? This movie lacks any charm.  The first and maybe best musical performance was, in my opinion, by a musical comedian, Timmy Kidnawankowicz. But not Timmy. He looks like every other musical comedian in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping this would be a fun movie. However, it turned out to be a very, very boring movie. It had really been too over-the-top, even as an action movie. The acting had a lot of it just about as bad as the film. I had already made my own, which was pretty funny, and I enjoyed it. But this movie had some serious flaws. The story wasn't all that it should have been. The characters in this movie were not believable. I think that the way that the movie was directed was actually pretty good, especially in that the characters are able to survive despite being attacked by the killer (which we saw several times) and having to find out the truth behind this monster. But, this really did nothing for the story. The best part of the film was about the girl, and the killer. It was more about the killer than the girl. It didn't really help the story, although it obviously was about her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so bad that you are looking for something more to watch. The acting is poor and the director has no idea what he is doing. The scenes are not good either. A really bad cast. I've never seen anyone like this. If you watch a movie like this then you'll watch a very bad, awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just like the movie "Lobsterland", this movie is like some old trash that is made up and made to look good in a hurry. You might say it was made to get some laughs. But this doesn't make the actors, the sets, the locations, or the acting great. It just ruins the whole movie and the entire premise. And no mention about the acting, the scenery, or any movie plot is actually good. It is just one piece of trash that tries to be funny but doesn't come close to the original.  This is the worst comedy I have ever seen in my life. Don't get me wrong, it is fine if it is funny. But you have to keep it at a level which is not boring. It needs more than one person, a camera, a costume, a few extra actors to make it funny. Otherwise you will ruin it for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so awful that it actually resembles a car crash in the beginning. This isn't a film so bad, it's actually a very weak plot, but it seems to go on forever, and then the ending just comes to a conclusion. In what was a similar movie I saw at the local movie theatre with a very good cast, but in this case, there is literally no ending. What an awesome ending it got I am sure, but then the plot becomes unbelievable and then, the plot stays there, with no real message whatsoever. It really is hard to make a coherent plot without a story.  I have a feeling that this is only the last movie I'll ever have seen, and this could have saved my life. It's such a shame to watch this movie after seeing so much good cinema. Maybe the sequel will do something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the worst films I've seen in an hour of daylight. The story is the most predictable and the plot is poorly developed. The acting is too predictable and only a few jokes go by. There are very few moments of genuine excitement. The fact that this movie is set in a hospital is also pretty ridiculous. It's like they are trying to make a hospital, not a hospital but a hospital of course and the ending is unsatisfiful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. The plot was quite interesting, but it didn't reach the level of "honest" we would expect from an unperverted Christian film... but sadly it doesn't go that far. It just pretends to be a comedy.  This was just too much about sex... well, that's it. The characters were annoying, and it had no depth whatsoever. And they were not portrayed in the way we would be expected. They were just there for money and laughs. The actors were, sadly, too pathetic to carry the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the type that gets you all fired in films: not so good, and no good at all. But what does an 'ad' movie do with its ridiculous plot? What does an ad do with such low stakes? Nothing at all! This movie is nothing but a ridiculous attempt at a plot that can't hold any real meaning and really has no reason. If you watch this movie you will soon realize that it doesn't make sense and your brains will die. If your going to see this one then you'll be sorry and will leave without a penny's worth. I give it one stars because a decent writer and director can make this movie funny. But this movie doesn't have any sense of purpose! It's just a comedy and some trimmings around the idea of a bunch of people and they're going to call out all the people on it and make you laugh and look like a bunch crazy person. If this movie was a movie they were going for a movie that was so important to the world then it would be worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a sickly, disgusting waste of film that isn't fit to watch. The story is extremely bad, not a story at all. The actors should have put their talents into it. The dialog is really bad, most of the songs is completely unfunny. I just felt the whole film was terrible. And if you don't get along with them, you'll probably never get along to this mess. And I had to say, I really don't see much in this movie that could actually even be seen by anyone. The ending was totally bad, too much of it was unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was completely unnecessary. I mean, I think it was almost too big. I had to laugh in it more than half the time. Some of the dialog was better, but I have a feeling that this is not that kind of movie. I give this movie a 0.3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but a waste of your time, and is no excuse for not making an effort to do something with this movie...  It is a waste to say that this movie will make you lose your appetite for the other films. I think I am not sure of which characters will be cast in this movie, and only hope that my colleagues will be able to be in it. I give this movie one more, and you'll be the only person I will see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie, I decided to wait to see if I could, or even if I would, find a movie with an interesting plot and a good plot. I watched "The Big Life" just one time and was so sorry to lose half of it. The film is like watching a dog in a car. The dialog is stupid, the director is inept, the characters are terrible, and the plot has got to be better.   If you want to see a movie that tries to connect two seemingly disconnected aspects of life, and doesn't provide any clues about why it's connected, you'll pay a ridiculous amount of money for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has many flaws that make it a complete waste. First, there is no good story to begin with (this was the case), and the story is so weak that the actors and the screen play do not shine in the scenes. The dialogs are poorly written, so that the characters do not seem believable. There is also no good special effects, not even a big splash. Even a very decent cast, such as Elizabeth Dornell, as a priest who is the caretaker, does not add any value to the film. It was supposed to be a horror flick, but that did not work. In its attempt to get a movie, the movie instead created a terrible one. Avoid it at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, the director said he wants to make a film about "an emotional experience", but I think you know better than that. What the hell? Well, for starters we are not looking at a funny guy or a funny movie for sure. This is about an emotionally unstable woman who goes to a hotel and kills her sister while she is going to have a real-life-saga.  Well we might be seeing a real girl, but the whole story is just about a sad woman who has a girlfriend but is totally crazy, then she kills the girlfriend and leaves to get a "life". The ending is so bad, I couldn't even believe I was watching this movie. I thought the end was going to be just a really funny movie. It looked like it was going somewhere else. I guess I should have just waited until it got dark and then watched the final scene and I thought it was hilarious.  That's what I thought of the entire movie, but I couldnít believe this would really be a movie like it. It didnít even make sense. It just became so annoying that I couldnīt take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie on TV I thought it was a bad film. It was not entertaining. I saw the ending as the first episode but then I saw an out-of-context flashback with a couple of dead people (one in each arm and the one in the coffin and one in each coffin), so I went on to see the first scene. The ending to the episode just left a few minutes later, after the movie was over.  I thought this movie had very predictable plot (all the scenes that were not shown during the first half of the movie were shown at the beginning of the episode) and bad plot lines were reused between scenes that are not relevant for the movie and were not even mentioned at the end of the film. And the ending did not end the movie. It made it look like a car crash, and just like the ending of the first episodes, it ended the movie, even though I thought those were two scenes were about the car crash and had been shot during the movie (for the movie) and they hadn't been shown during any scenes.   I had this movie in my hands and I was expecting to like it a lot, but I just didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had the chance to watch this when I was younger, and I've never forgotten it. Now, I'm pretty sure that a lot of people in this world think that this is the best movie of their lives, but when I have seen the film and watch it for someone who knows nothing about it, I don't really understand it. To me, this movie is bad, but I also understand that the "documentaries" that I've seen, and the people who have made comments about the movie have the same views. The plot is painfully absurd, and they're completely clueless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a stupid movie. It is not even a good movie. I had to turn to the DVD player after the first 2 minutes. If you get the movie, you will probably vomit. The acting is terrible and the story is bad. It's not even the first time I have read a positive review about something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really bad. Even though it isn't an awful film it's awful. Some of the acting was good in the earlier films of this type of movie and it got to a really scary place. Even the villain of the film was quite good, but what is the point of doing this film at all? If you like horror films, then this is not your choice. If you want a horror film you'll watch "The Hostage", and you'll love it. Unfortunately you'll only get a few minutes of horror in it and your brain will completely shrivel up and be ready to scream at the TV. But if you want to see more, you'll do better with a horror flick: "The House on Lake Ave". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like every other movie that comes out in the summertime. Except for a couple of people that seem to have a sense of self-possession which seemed to be forced upon them. I'd never seen anything like it. It was a pile of useless, cheesy plot lines and an obnoxious, ridiculous plot device that made no sense, at least not one which could make any sense. I give it 2 out of 10. I can only conclude that this movie is one of those things that makes people mad. It just seems that this isn't the way that every movie made at the time. If you want to see the real Christmas Day movies, it's just those. If there are any Christmas Day characters in this movie, don't waste your money. If it was even the movie that I was expecting, it was completely useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a small group of people who have no sense of self-esteem, but instead want to be entertained for some time, I had a bit of a heart palmily about the premise. However, I found that the characters seemed very predictable. The actors were horrible, the acting didn't fit the story, and the movie lacked the originality that would normally be expected.  I think the movie is bad, I won't say anything negative about it, but I thought it was too predictable, and I think that the ending was just too predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not worth a look, but I will mention it for entertainment value. My biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it was written at all. This is something that doesn't happen on any of these movies that are available in the US.  My second is the ridiculous casting. Some actors even used a "male" name like "Willard" which I have never heard before. They have also cast "male", but I have no idea how they knew "Male" or "female". There were some lines of dialogue that were clearly not meant to be spoken in the normal "buddy" voice, which felt like a stretch of a new language, especially in the beginning.  This is the first movie I've seen that made me laugh so much that I couldn't put in a double-time movie with one of the actors and a bunch of lines. I would have been happy to see the ending. However, if you are looking for a real, good movie: The Silence of the Bible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the other comments to suggest that these movies are a waste of money, and that they are poorly made, with an uneven rhythm and some pretty sloppy performances.  This is the opposite of the kind of entertainment that was previously released with the "Worst Movie EVER!!" and thus, must be considered as the equivalent of the "Beverfest" movies: The biggest problem with them. The most important feature of them is their over-indulging of sexual content to the point of making out all the characters with their "clot". These movies only serve to break the viewers's heart. They fail to deliver an unifying message and are a total waste of time and money.  I agree with this, but since I never saw them myself, I don't want to say much. They had a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A total embarrassment of the most unimaginative and unappreciated movie ever made. The story is predictable at times, and the cast is completely inept.  In truth, this is the worst film ever made, with so many predictable characters in it that you can pretty much predict the story in advance, just like the "Game of Dog Moon."  If this is how the movie was made, it would have been a disaster.  The last movie was more interesting, but this one just is awful. A bad movie about a movie: a really bad movie 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so terrible that you can see the screenwriter's face when he is driving around in his Audi.  The only redeeming feature is that it is so annoying that you have to sit through the whole film to see how it is funny, and then wonder how "The Office" had to find jokes like this.   It is an excuse for a movie: a "story told by a comic." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film last night on TV, and I didn't get tired, and even though I thought the movie was a "classic", I just couldn't believe that this movie had any story to tell, or even that it had an idea. I mean, if you want a simple, boring and predictable movie, this is the movie for you, and you'll have the same trouble getting to know who's in this movie. While it's a simple story, it's not really any fun. For example, the ending of the movie is pretty predictable, and it is boring as well. That's about the only thing that makes this movie interesting. And honestly, even after seeing a decent movie like "Elysion", you can get bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie at the theater and the only reason I purchased it is because I wanted to see "The Ozzmoit Curse", one of the worst movies ever released. I didn't care for any of the plot and it didn't help.  The plot revolves around the fact that this is a documentary, the narrator is an older man and there are ghosts in it, none of which are mentioned, you have to turn to the DVD and read the subtitles to know what is going on. It just wasn't my favorite of movies, but I thought it was quite stupid and the acting was bad. I thought the "spirit" in the movie was a bit weird. The ending was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie the other week after a movie: the director, Michael O'Brien, was actually directing the film. So after watching this movie and watching it as a kid, I was annoyed that I didn't get the full effect of the film and a movie in the future, I'm like a parent and can't help but be disappointed at this horrible movie. The story is extremely predictable. For example, at the beginning of the movie, the "child" is the "mother" and she and her family had an affair. Then at the end, they have their new child. When the son has more than one father (the new child), he goes back to the family to find his dad, even though he doesn't like him. He doesn't seem to understand what they're doing and just sort of agrees to the new child's adventures with their father. I have no clue what happens and when he finally gets out, he wants to go on a trip to the ocean for a trip with his parents. He's supposed to be a marine biologist, but he doesn;t know that. He can't swim and can get into a lot of strange places. He also doesn't have an opportunity to do any scientific work. The movie was not even very good. I can only conclude that the director was simply wasting his time. It's bad not because it is a true film but rather a film for people who like to make a lot, but even worse is that Michael O`Brien was so terrible that I had to go and see the movie again and I think I should have been turned off of it. It was so bad that I couldn't even make it through to the end and I just don't know why. The director had so many flaws in this film that I was pretty sure he was trying to make something great. If I hadn't had the benefit of knowing I'd just read that he was a filmmaker and would have done better, I would have laughed at his ridiculous attempt. I wish he had at least done something better and the first 10 minutes of this movie would have been much better. But if there was a chance to do anything better than what Michael OBrien has done (and I haven't seen one, other than his effort here), I'd have done so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My biggest complaint is that they decided to remake the original, instead of using new footage, in order to make the film more appealing. This film would have been more appealing if they had new footage. They used old footage on all of the characters, only for the actors. It is extremely difficult to find out who these actors were in the original.  I think this film was a bad choice because this film would be much more appealing without a huge budget, as well as having a big name in the cast. I will never forgive it for this failure. The movie seems to be about the people who made the original film, but I can see that there are very few supporting characters in this movie. The acting was good, but the scenes were horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was, unfortunately, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not a fun movie to watch - the acting was flat, the story was flat and the acting seemed really bad. However, the plot seemed interesting. But this movie was too slow. It lacked tension. In a way, it was a story about a very stupid character. This plot was really flat, too slow, but the acting in it was really bad too. I didn't care for the characters. I don't know how I can even take this movie, that it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film with my wife at the local Cinema last week and was horrified at the acting. The fact that a documentary was made on the same set of a giant dinosaur, that was the only thing that made the film seem interesting. The acting in this film was horrible, the editing was terrible, and the music was lousy. All of this is pretty disappointing seeing how this film did not get a bigger release. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some decent stars, a couple and a movie producer (Bartender) in it. But the story is a bit vague and badly handled by the director. The story is unclear and the characters are flat, lacking any depth. There is a good scene, but I couldn't believe the ending when the movie ended. There was some good bits and some dialog, but it is too much for the film to be a good film.  If you liked a comedy movie and not a serious movie, you would probably like a sequel to this. But not in that context. The movie is a waste of time and it is just a bad idea for the director to have put a lot of money into this film. I really didn't like the ending and I think that there is a lot more material out there to make, but there will be no profit for this movie, if you got the original sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A recent article on the internet has been criticizing the so-called 'Funny Movie' for being so absurd that it does not deserve to be seen. In reality, "Funny Movies" are, as comedian Jay Leno once put it, a collection of dumb, terrible jokes about misfamiliar situations. There are some movies that are so bad that we just have to laugh at them. It is an easy joke for those who know it's a dumb movie to see and laugh at. Not only can it not stand with what this movie is about, but the premise is just laughable. In fact, this movie would have been funny in itself if one had made it. If one had to read it, there would have to be a good reason why this is so terrible. In other words, this is a movie that relies on the silliness of the premise and that the funny parts of the film are just so bad, it is no good.  The plot is a little bit amusing, but that's all the way. As a bonus note, I was able to see the first 15 minutes of the movie (without a DVD!) and this just makes you cringe. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have been willing to write this review about something good - that is to say, I wouldn't mind the comment on this movie that it should be rated as 'Dance' - but I'm afraid of being embarrassed as they say.  If there is any truth in the matter of seeing the real dance, you won't care for it. It's a complete waste of the time.  Even the dancing is just not that good - even though the dancers are so good they're funny. It isn't like that. I couldn't even imagine it. They just couldn't have done anything so dull. A shame.  The other dancers in the movie appear very nice, but they're all terrible. They don't even have the decency to have the dance, although that's what they're so good at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a sad little movie I've seen! The acting is completely terrible. The only good part of this movie is the ending. However, the ending just sucks the entire story and leaves the kids out on a few years later. I'd be willing to bet that no part of "Ramp" will ever be released on DVD. I know that the actors from "Ramps" and "Rumbels" are pretty good at their respective roles, but if they weren't, they'd be like the actors of "Zumay" and their "Rag" counterparts.   The "Rambos" movie was one of the better ones for kids and teens. I would really like to see the kids have some fun with a real family now, but this one really does nothing but waste time. Avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this film at a very large local movie store when I am a movie buff.  To make the film look so cheap I was really amazed to find out that it was made. This film was the most painful thing ever to watch. There is no real story whatsoever. The plot is just ridiculous. What was that film's message? To me it was that it did not even know what was happening, like the other movies that were in the same category. I mean, just where did this movie get the idea of a woman becoming a pregnant? The story of her becoming pregnant by using a contraceptive method is completely pointless. The movie just shows her drinking water while having a baby, but I don't think that is what was going to happen.    To top that, the movie is about a guy named Mr. Jumbo(Michael Jumbo) making love with a woman. Of course the movie tries to convince us that it is impossible to make love because of his love, but you can almost see it isn't all that. I didn't see the "movie" ending as much as I would have liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is no more interesting than watching a few episodes of "The X-Files." If only one episode were interesting. It's obviously low-grade, so low-budget filmmaking and low-scripting in every way ruin this film.  I watched this film, hoping to get something out of it, and it didn't. The acting is, at worst, mediocre. The plot is weak, and so are the characters. It doesn't make any sense.  The scene in which the family had the phone in their hands was simply horrible. It made absolutely no sense. And I didn't see any sign of the scene in the car which had the parents driving to see the police. I didn are any sign they had something to do with the phone.  In a series of movies, it had so much potential but wasted so much time to not show anything interesting. I wouldn't even watch this movie, but it is not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In what other words, can I say that this film was bad? When I'm at the movie theater, it's always been a case of an embarrassment. It's not that they're bad in the same way. They're bad but not necessarily bad as a documentary or movie, especially a documentary that lacks the necessary ingredients to build something interesting. They can't build an interesting documentary without having a human face to the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised I watched this one. But after it was over I knew that it didn't deserve to be seen. There were two really horrible actors in the movie. And this is a movie where a lot of bad things happen.  This movie really isn't about a couple getting together, but a couple are stuck together, and both ends of the story are horrible, because it wasn't even a true story, and then the two end of the plot (the divorce) is terrible. The only reason I wanted to watch this movie was because it had a bunch of interesting and interesting topics. But, sadly, what was shown is nothing but the bad things I picked out at the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was about as bad a horror flick as one of the few people who still seemed to like it...the premise is, 'the only person who kills people on a lake with a little girl'. Then it shows a girl who has been murdered and killed by the killer, who is, on his way to get revenge, and is now being pursued by 'hiders' from the cops...so he must kill his victims...and there is no plot. Well, I guess it could have made the film a bit better if they actually showed some of the murders they did. Instead, it just showed the killer murdering the girl and then 'the girl's body disappear'. I'm just glad that the murderer is getting caught and killed so he doesn't get to go through life in prison. The other movie was decent, although the 'hider' played by the woman was more convincing than the other actors. Unfortunately, it's not very realistic. They're all 'human actors', so it's hard to tell how well they were acting, since the characters didn't come from any real person. If I were a horror fan I would have liked this film to have something that it wasn't afraid of. It was just too bad and not terribly interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the new "Morky's!" but unfortunately there were too many mistakes to make it believable. I was very impressed by the movie, it wasn't the worst I've seen, however this was the biggest disappointment I've ever seen. I just wanted to save the "Shelter" from the hospital for myself and all of my friends who could see the show if she was taken away so she could see if she could have a future in life. The movie was awful, the jokes were ridiculous and the camera work was bad. The ending was way too predictable and the acting was bad...I've seen so much better TV programs, and that show was way better. This movie doesn't deserve an honorable mention but I just can't give it enough credit. Maybe someone could come up with a better way of doing this movie...it's not like the other, a little bit better but not perfect either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in the theater with my wife when this movie came out. I was watching it on TV and I couldn't decide if I was going to watch it or not. I laughed at the beginning of it, but after a while my wife thought we might die. I can't blame people for that. I also think it is extremely disappointing that it didn't seem to be a "horror" movie because it wasn't scary. This movie is just a waste of time to see it. It's a horrible mess. I want to stick out there but this movie was worse than anything I had ever watched. I'm not sure if the director got fired for that, but it was so bad, it made me sad for my wife. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a poor effort to do justice to the true story of the young George Gage and his family, but has a strange twist in the plot. For one, there is no way to find him in the original book, but rather he finds him in some other book, which turns into a horror story about some of his family's past. Then he comes back into it for a moment...  And while this story is supposed to have started around the time the family had to move to New York, when it is told a little too late it just doesn't really do much, in fact it doesn't make a sense of the story. There is no mystery that he and his parents were having some sort of connection with a mysterious woman who is somehow related to his dad... The movie doesn't establish that there ever was any connection, the movie only establishes that she died around 3 years after the story is about, but the plot never really develops anything about the characters, and the film is too convoluted to figure out the connections with her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some highlights that make this movie seem interesting, and most of them are pretty good. But I found myself wishing to keep the movie short and focus on the parts that I don't like. But the story isn't good enough to make me want to see it.  The rest of the story is pretty bad and just about the worst thing that I've ever seen from this movie. Some of the characters are annoying. And the ending isn't very effective.  I'd like to point out that some of the scenes are very good. For instance, I enjoyed some of them. However, there's too much in the movie that makes you like the actors in it, and it's just a flimsy excuse to avoid seeing it. In any case, it isn't really good enough for a horror film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a crap film this was, I have to assume the writer had some idea of plot and had something to happen. If I hadn't read the book and seen it, I probably would have given some thought and considered I would have had the same reaction.  If not, I don't know how people that are very savvy and intelligent can find out that a movie like this is no more than pointless.  In fact, I am surprised that they got so much as to actually make this movie. At the very least you can get a laugh out of some of the things in this movie, but not a lot. Even if there is an interesting way, this is far below the standard required to make the film.  I thought this film was poorly directed and it had nothing to recommend. The acting was good on certain scenes, but nothing about anything made. I think it is obvious that the writer wanted to write a positive review about this movie but failed to do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie a little confusing and it isn't that good anyway.  The acting is a little too slow, a little bit childish and the story is pretty ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no surprises in this movie: they are boring, they do nothing new, they have no surprises. They just pile more of trash onto the screen and there are no surprise surprises in that. But what does surprise me is to see that in all the movies I've ever seen, they only appear to be interesting on the rarest of occasions. In this case the movie is so bad, it is no wonder it is at all so cheap, I won't even believe that it was made. It can't be anything else than a cheap movie: just dump out as much trash as possible without a plot, leaving you with nothing but your brains.   I would much prefer to see this movie. But unfortunately the director didn't realize that there is nothing to surprise you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been called "a complete waste of a film", but I thought it was the WORST one in all of cinema, with nothing original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely no plot and has a bad plot. It can't even make a joke. I would like to see better, but unfortunately it was made, and that makes this movie a truly awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented the movie because I like the first movie. I didn't care about the sequel. But I do love the first one. The movie was so terrible that I didn'T see it again, and my friend kept asking if I could go see it. It didn't even look like a movie. The writing was so bad it was barely a decent action movie. And the acting was horrible, too much like the movie was written.  I wanted to stay awake only to check the mail.  After the rental, I went to a movie theater with my friends and they didn't see this movie, so I rented it again. It turned out to be bad and very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is bad at best. It's not a comedy with funny things, it's a sad waste of film talent. Its very predictable. I was expecting something more creative and funny. It didn't deliver. Maybe you can get it for cheap or even free with a copy. My only problem is that it doesn't make a positive impression of itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Dinner For Two" is bad. The movie was absolutely worthless. You might as well do it by "The Best Heist" (as well as the same) without knowing that the acting is bad too.  I have to believe that the actors had a brain and brain on their shoulders and wanted to make this movie even worse. I believe that they just wanted to be the most outrageous action picture ever. However, the way they were making this movie was too stupid.  The movie started out cute and then became a nightmare. The actors were just completely terrible. I don't believe that actors like that are able to make a movie like this.   This movie is like another movie from "The Expendables". Except that it doesn't look as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a mess. Some of the best films of the past 20 years were made like this one. The problem is that when this is produced in 1999, it was too big, too long, and so badly written.  The plot is pretty good but really bad, especially the idea that an evil person is going to kill the leader of the tribe that is being hunted by a bunch of hunters who are all infected with the virus...it was just stupid. I wish I could say more but it wasn't really worth listening to. It is so bad, I don't know why I chose to watch this film: if it is, then, please watch the first 2 hours of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be a complete bore from start through the final ending. It doesn't really have much to do with a story except to add some color to the proceedings.  The characters are the main thing missing.  And it is hard to make this movie even remotely interesting. There are the usual cliche plot lines and a few interesting scenes, but this has nothing to do or nothing to make it anything else.  Oh my gosh! I really can't stand seeing the whole thing just sitting on top of my tv screen! I am left feeling like the world is just going to get to see my husband again! It's about time I'm getting out of here! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie. A plot that doesn't have a reason, a bad story (I guess that's the plot) and a bad character. The only redeeming thing in this movie is the idea of a giant robot, that unfortunately doesn't come into a film with the same chemistry (I can't remember why I chose to make the robot the lead). I was hoping that I would like this movie. But I couldn't. Even a little bit, i would really want to see the robot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My comments about this film:  This is not even the worst horror film I have seen in my time. In the beginning it was OK. But this isn't it. I cannot afford to rent the movie, nor to pay to see this movie. If I was willing to pay for this movie I would have paid a lot. The plot, although very interesting, fails to connect, especially the main protagonist. Not only is the protagonist completely oblivious of reality and not aware of anything, not only does she never realize that her actions are wrong, neither does she see the consequences of her actions, nor do she ever learn anything from the tragedy of the disaster. This makes for a dull movie, with the story and dialog getting absolutely meaningless. The only saving factor in this movie is the very creepy "The Monster of Fear" TV series. But it is so dull and completely insensual, I cannot even recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I really dislike movies, especially when the lead is "good guy". They tend to be stupid and childish, and just not funny or funny. So for example, in this movie, a couple of annoying moments are shown where the main guy has a crush on another girl that then falls for him. He then starts having sex with another girl, then having sex in a car. This is really pretty lame. Now I am glad to finally watch this movie since I love movies that show people having sex and are usually funny. They tend not to be a funny movie unless someone can actually show a decent plot. The story is basically like a stupid one. It really just lacks in a few things. You know what I mean. The guy who has sex with the girl has his hand in a sling when he's taken up by the car he was in. He's not even wearing gloves because he's really trying to hit on another chick. The car crash was pretty funny, it's just like a car crash without a car, and it wasn't a car wreck in the car it was on. Anyway, I'd recommend avoiding this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, even at a big premiere. I don't really know why it got made. The "documentary" (which was supposedly the story's premise) was apparently filmed in front of a studio, but the actors don't appear there.  The story is a sad little tragedy. It tells about a couple who rent a new apartment to try living there. That landlord, the two tenants and their neighbors (who we only meet at the movie premiere) are basically portrayed as evil guys (who keep stealing car parts, and getting the new apartments). I'm curious to say that the mayor is good-looking (he looks like a teenager who just got a few months old, no?) so he won an award at a charity's convention. He's not actually bad, but he's an evil guy in love with the landlord.  There are some interesting scenes but they aren't in the story. The only scene that gets attention is during the fight, when the guys are in the cellar on a night. They have to get out of the cellar and to find the dead woman who killed the cat in the basement. I didn't want to find that scene, but I felt the scene is extremely boring and badly written.  It's not all that terrible, but it's pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really horrible movie. If you are interested in movies, this is not for you. This movie is too bad to admit. It is just plain bad. The acting is bad. It's just too much to have even seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you read the negative review (like, this is all in a nutshell, if you will not) you will get to know about some of the worst things that could be seen in a film: the awful cinematography, the horrible sound effects, the boring, slow pacing, the hideous, fake (and often fake) story lines (like the "We have no idea how to be a murderer) (and that's why I just couldn't watch this movie), and the totally terrible dialogs (this is a particular bad case). Even the acting was bad, and the story could be interesting but the film had no sense of real character development whatsoever. As for the "story" which was the main plot line of the movie, the fact that it was filmed in India means the lack of action sequences. They had to have some action (or at least a good action sequence), especially in the beginning when the gang's mother was introduced to the killer. Why a woman would allow such a monster to kill her is a real mystery.    This is an insult to film fans and to the intelligence of people who actually made this film. I am not going to recommend this movie to anyone, and if you really are one of those people, you might want to do something to see this movie. I wish you do not waste your time watching it because it is no more interesting than a normal murder mystery. It is a piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very poorly directed, so bad it is funny. It is boring and unbelievable to watch. In most movies this type of movie would work, but this one just doesn't work. The story is really weak and the characters were just very bad. I can't even think of how many actors could make this movie. I'm going to be really surprised if this movie was even made. I have to believe that no one thought this was a comedy or even a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie was a romantic comedy, it would be enjoyable. But it isn't. It's just bad. The dialogs are awful, the acting is poor, and the music is bad. This is the sort of movie that comes out when you're hungry and hoping to have some meat to eat. This movie isn't cute, it's really, really bad. Avoid at least one for another movie: one where you're tempted to think you've gotten your money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that seemed redeeming in this film was the ability to capture the feelings of ordinary, honest people, who have nothing to do with a film. But then, "Lincoln", the sequel, made me look like a monster. And then, I found out that it was actually a monster, that it's been the whole time that it wasn't just a monster - it was an evil. The story was stupid and made me question whether or not it was just the idea. It was simply the idea that it happened in the year 1890s.  The film itself didn't make much sense. But, the plot did make sense. I didn't find much of it that I couldn't understand. But the acting seemed convincing enough to make me think that it had happened. But it had nothing to recommend. It also had something that no one would expect. There was no real story. The actors seemed like they weren't acting - almost the opposite. It had no plot, no "hits". The story seemed to be about how one man was killed and had no forethought. The ending, however, did have a bit of a plot to it, although the conclusion was vague.  If I was to sum up, the only reason I gave this film a rating was because it was interesting. But not, the whole film had nothing but one redeeming factor. And it didn't even redeem itself. The film failed to be much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friends and I laughed at this movie. I just couldn't believe how bad it was. It wasn't even funny. I'd put in that kind of comment but it's better not to ask because it's so bad that I can't give it any more attention. I didn't want to see the whole movie but I guess I'd rather just say that it was bad. There was one thing I really enjoyed. It had a funny line and it would make a funny movie if you liked to see one. I was hoping the other movie would be better but they really just didn't make any more. This is a movie that has no funny lines, no funny words, no humor, no real point. And that it had a female co-star. I don't know if she really deserved an Oscar or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so sad I can't sit through this movie. Its so bad it doesn't matter when we finally get a plot. The acting is terrible and there is absolutely no story, direction, or interesting images. They should have a better script or at least better photography. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of the worst scenes i have ever seen, ever. You get a woman who just wants to screw over a couple of people, for fun, and then having a woman just fuck an unsuspecting guy. Then this movie is all about having fun with someone who doesn't know what's going to happen with her. Then at the end when you've had fun with this girl, she decides to have sex with you, and not even let you finish the movie, so you'll never even get the chance to see if she will have sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but a typical example of an overworked, poorly developed, and over-worked film. Aside from a handful of gory moments in which a female monster is being fed to hungry crocodiles by a priest, this movie is a piece of trash that will not have any redeeming value except for the satisfaction of the sickening spectacle of its death. It does not have a title nor does it have a storyline nor does a story. If you're expecting a "Fantastic Fourteen" film or a "Ride the Leader", you can pretty much expect this one to be garbage. In fact, it's pretty obvious that this is not worth the time to rent - I know it's not too risky to rent because it is so bad it couldn't even be pulled off to the shelf.   The first thing you'll notice is that the acting is generally awful - the acting was terrible, the cinematography was bad, the directing is bad - the sets are poorly drawn, the scenes are bad - and the soundtrack was terrible. The film does manage to do an extremely weak story. That's all.  For those with a decent taste of gore, this film will appeal. But unfortunately there is no way to save this from you. If I were a movie expert, I would say that it's more than mediocre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I ever watched in the first two years of my life (or any other, in my opinion). Not even that I have seen. Why is that the only thing a writer can do with a story that has little plot. The plot of the movie is like I have never read a plot in my life, but I think I know how to read a good plot. When I first see the premise, I am sorry to say that I was not that interested in this film. If I had ever wanted a plot, it would have been "The Girl in the Mirror", which I had watched at school, but it was so bad, I just couldn't take it.  It's just sad that I'm allowed to watch movies that I don't know what they are and then watch them with my own eyes and I don´t know why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a fan of a series, I usually prefer watching the episode after being forced to sit down and finish. This was no exception. This episode is simply a bad episode - i.e. bad, awful, bad, bad. This is not because of any inherent flaw in this series, but rather the sheer incompetence of the production. What we get from the director or writer of this episode is this - a story that is so convoluted and so stupid, that you want to be sick and have a screaming nightmare and scream in a bathroom. The idea of this show should have been the plot, not the characters. They just can't act in some of the most disappointing movie ever created. This plot should have a "movie-story" that you can look at and know the story within it. Instead, it's only a bunch of people. A handful of lines are said in the beginning, and then they suddenly stop and then you hear a few words in a few minutes that appear to be part of a story, but then you just wonder if those people just dropped in there, and it is impossible for you to guess where they went. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story follows a few thousand people from a mysterious cave and there is some sort of "god" living at the bottom of the mountain. The "God" is very human, which is not the case with a good plot. The acting is poor, the plot is bad and the whole cast is totally wasted.  This is probably the result of a lack of direction from a writer. There are a few decent stars and the film looks interesting, but this is an empty, pointless film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just an exercise in failure to put together a movie that has been put together for 20 years, and it is only in the hope that it might be made good.  But instead of putting into some semblance a plot, it's really just a collection of random scenes, some of which are pretty good, and some of them are really dumb. The premise seems to be that one of the characters is going to be at a particular local amusement park and is going away at some point in that time. This is no different than a lot of TV shows, but the writers don't seem to care. A couple of supporting characters are given the opportunity to get their heads on straight (and in reverse) before the whole thing is about to get started. A lot of it's like a bad made cartoon "A" with a lot more bad things happening before it becomes an actual movie. The only thing that may be saving this is a very small cameo of the "A"-designated actor. The rest is just boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame because this is a movie about a young boy who gets drunk and kills his family. Then a priest tries to help him.  There's not much plot and no story line, it's just some drunk man making fun of his friends.  I had quite a laugh, but I can't give much of what I was thinking at the beginning.  If you are a teen, this movie is not for you.  The movie is a horrible waste of your time.   I'm not going to write a positive review about the movie: a bad film is about a kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know from the first episode when I read that it was coming out as "one of the most overrated movies ever made in Hollywood". But I guess it was actually so bad, because it isn't that bad and it's a comedy and it isn'' in the late 1990's and it certainly wasn'' not a spoof and I think most of the people that actually are doing a comedy are either ignorant or stupid. And I believe that the people who are making this stuff are clueless.  In this movie they have a huge girl named Lena who is supposed to be in her 30's, but she looks like she is in her early 20's. The problem with this movie is that the film is not actually funny. It's very weak and very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just not worthy of consideration to be a film. It is simply a cheap, one-trick movie with no plot, no direction, no storyline, no character development. All of the characters are stupid, stupid, ugly, stupid. The plot is very weak. There was a point where I felt the characters could develop a storyline, but this movie does not make any sense.  I can't believe that this is truly intended to be satire. In the first and last few minutes of the movie, you can hear this voice on the screen and you can see the "tough" guy talking. The characters act like puppets, and that was the only "humor" that I thought this movie had. The "humour" of this movie is simply one of two dumb-assed, trashy "flicks". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Adventures of Fera" is a pretty horrible film: it's just a waste of all of the dialog, it's nothing original.  A major problem with this movie is that the director of it is too good to be allowed to make it. The director is so talented that he is allowed to keep on making this film even if he is a dumb idiot.  The acting is horrible. It's simply not there. The dialog is bad. The cinematography is bad and it's not there at all. If you're a little girl like me you won't get fooled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film, thinking it would be a fun parody of the "Godzilla" series. But I had to find out the truth.  The "God" movies always feature the biggest, most annoying creature in the world (usually in Japan) and the least predictable character that ever comes along in any Godzilla movie. This is the same with the rest of the characters (though not really the "evil" monsters). This is probably the most disappointing "God," movie I've ever seen. Even though this is a different movie from the "Kaiyuh" series that made it to the American market, I still believe that the film is an insult to the genre and of Godzilla itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to be original as a child. But, the plot is SO terrible, you won't like it. The main plot line is that little girl was supposed to go to college and she was not pregnant (for real) and she didn't know what her plan. The man and woman that were "thrilling" at the beginning, they don't get to know the person in front of them. The ending leaves me feeling like the characters are acting like they were a couple who were having sex (probably an actual couple). The plot is really bad, but the ending is interesting enough to keep you busy. But just give this one a 10 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty stupid movie. People with no clue what is going to happen in the future decide who to follow, and this movie is full of nothing. When the person is finally getting into his mind and doing some weird stuff, the person with the crazy name of "Brent" is attacked by some thugs and their followers. The guy goes in to get help from some people so they can save their lives. He also kidnaps another man who is in danger of being kidnapped by these guys.  This movie seems to be getting much better by now, and it still is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending is so badly written and directed, I couldn't believe it was supposed to be a true romantic romance. It is really just a very dumb and pointless movie.  How was it made? The idea behind this movie was very good, but the way you can get to the end of the movie is very poor. I'd have liked to see more and more songs from the record and this movie. If you want to see romance in the way that this movie is meant to be, don't get the soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not the finest movie of 2013, but it was just a collection of a few interesting moments and bad writing that made the movie so shallow. I was expecting a film to be as visually stunning as most Pixar movies. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean much to the overall quality of this film. The acting was pretty bad, and the plot was very weak, but that's all I have to say.  The story was interesting, although, I think the acting was weak. Maybe the script was a bit better. It's bad to have a movie made only about that one movie. I think it might have been a really interesting movie if it wasn't made for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only real value here is that the ending can be funny.  This is the only film that has ever made me laugh so badly. It's very disappointing that this movie was able to capture some of the laughs that the rest of the films that are just about to ruin this film from the very beginning.  The best line of the film is to say that it doesn't matter how funny the jokes were. It doesn't make any sense, not like anything even made in the US. If the jokes make sense, then the whole thing makes sense.  I can't believe that this film has a chance to redeem itself. It really does not deserve it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As always, I have seen it before. As usual, it has been a big letdown, and I think I am more than a willing participant. I'm ashamed of myself for watching this movie. Not only did I think that the movie was a waste of time (or too much) but this movie did not take much time. It is only a bit more entertaining than the previous one. I am afraid to say that the story and its characters are a complete waste of life, and the script is poorly written. I can understand the intentions of making a movie, but it is too weak to succeed. I was looking for a movie to "win" (at least in my opinion) and was hoping to see this movie because it would be so beautiful, but unfortunately it didn't, and there is nothing else worth paying money for. This movie is nothing but a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was a bit better than the previous one. It wasn't so bad, but it didn't turn into a movie I want to watch again. I don't have a lot of patience for movies like this. It takes a while before they will find something that works. The ending is bad, too much of a story to make me stay on the couch. The good thing about the first one was that it was so good and well filmed. The problem is that the second one is pretty much about a documentary, not a movie.  But even though it is about a movie, it doesn't have the same kind of magic that makes movies and has little to no suspense. I think it was bad because I didn't like the characters. They're way way too predictable and don't interact with anything. The last time I watched it, it was only about a half of the time, and I've never seen such an uninteresting characters before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is extremely bad, the story is bad, it's horrible, but I would like to see something better. It's bad but I did find something interesting in the plot. Perhaps I missed the whole point. But the fact that it's a horror movie doesn't help. If you want to see "the best horror film ever made" this film is bad no matter how. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the movie is going to be about a young couple, and you decide to turn it into a film, you have got to make it something special, something to make, something interesting, something funny, something which has been forgotten over the past thirty years. But this is a bad film. The story is predictable and the ending is horrible. Why are we even talking this down? What a lousy movie does that has so much plot and characters that it makes a movie which is so predictable and dull? And it has to make a movie that it's about something interesting. But if you're going to make something more entertaining than a cheap movie, you should do something better. I gave this film a 5, not because it's actually good but because it contains nothing else, and nothing else makes this film seem anything like its trashy and boring appearance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a very brief break during our holiday celebrations, I was put on a screen with a movie called "I Hate Hate!". I had to see it before I read anything, as there were a few pictures and one line left on the screen. I knew it was bad. And when I read the story of this movie, I knew that it was really bad. This movie contains some of the worst scenes I've ever seen. I'm sure I will enjoy seeing the sequel to this movie (it's already a huge hit on TV), but I'd be shocked if there were ever two people with such lousy taste for this movie. This is probably the worst film I have ever seen... but I know it's not because it's so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Town" is a bad, awful, and horribly over-developed comedy that would make it a "must-see" for the sickly misnamed "The New Year's" movies. When this film was first released, I was hoping for the best. Unfortunately, the entire idea behind it has been lost.  I went out to see the film with my wife and laughed all the way through it. The beginning is silly and stupid, and the movie revolves around a few women and a man who are getting married, with no idea what they are going to do or even why they are married.  Now, you have seen one of the worst films ever filmed, so don't waste a second of the time.  If you think the film is good, you can see the rest of the films and I'll tell you, they're all a waste. It's not an enjoyable film, and if you enjoy it, do yourself a favor by sitting back and watching it as a result of its failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have any sense of decency, you might consider checking out this DVD before the DVD was released. If you don't, your time will be wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like this show, even the best shows are good but the episodes I watched were not like the shows I watched in high school or college. I would've just gotten the rest of the episodes after the show and would've been happy with it if the show was only a half hour. But it has become a typical Saturday night afternoone show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like a 'Twilight Zone' scenario of a zombie attack. A small group of people (maybe a secret team) has been killed off, the zombies that are now running around have the ability to kill all the people...but what happens is that a small group becomes zombie zombies AND they can kill all of the humans that are in their way. There's some fighting but all of those people are really pretty ridiculous...like zombies, zombies have to eat their own brains or anything else...and the zombies are still really stupid. There isn't really any realistic plot, aside from a few jokes. I don't really think it had a message or message so they put it in a movie where a bunch of people die. The main reason for the film was that the actor (Tolie Hawn) was a famous singer and there was a rumor that she could die and not only cause the apocalypse. He had some funny lines but was really bad. The actors didn't seem to have any plot in their performance, they were all over-acting it so it was just a really bad movie. It's not like a horror movie but like a movie just for cheap thrill. It just didn't work out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not sure if this was the "Star Wars" series, but I liked the characters in the first one. They were all pretty good, although you could easily just watch some of the characters later, and the premise is pretty predictable, even if you were expecting. This movie is just awful. While the action is pretty good and some of it can be exciting, none of the actors in the film are capable of acting this sort of way. The plot is bad, the acting is bad (although it was good in the early days of the franchise, with George Lucas' talent) and the story is bad. The movie is bad and is not a movie that I would recommend to even rent for a couple of minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing that this movie was a musical, musical performance that I would have never heard before. I was a fan of Michael Jackson and have since lost interest in any of the old albums. However, the plot was predictable and nothing about it made any sense. What is it? A film that is completely useless for it's intended purpose, which was a very pointless plot that it seemed to make. It was painfully predictable and it felt like they were trying to make some kind of plot. It just seemed like they needed to make a plot and put it in place, which I have never done before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to rent this, then do not do it. I cannot guarantee a high rating, but the acting is very poor.  The movie is a predictable tragedy, devoid of any entertainment or action. The story is not much of interest except for the characters' bitter views.  All the supporting actors who played the roles did not have very good performances.   The directing is poor, but that also shows the fact that the script is so badly written that you're never sure how people actually get into it.  There is one funny bit, but what funny?   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, from the start. It is like a bunch of actors from a bad film: i'll give them a credit for not doing too much, they are good actors, but the whole thing is awful, especially the end. The whole story of the film revolves around a stupid murder, some guy who had an ex girlfriend who was pretending to be a boy, so he killed his girlfriend. Then the guy who killed his boyfriend in the end is the one who gets killed in the movie. The scene was a bit annoying, because that guy was supposed to be the real killer. In the end, he was killed so the girl killed him. This movie was absolutely awful, all of it. I give this movie a two-star to. I gave the film a 2, but that's not enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have seen this movie just one time, and have to confess that it has been bad ever. I know that this movie was meant to be a documentary but has gotten so bad that i just couldn't understand the point. There was no compelling message, and the message could not even get me to sit there and watch the whole thing.  There was some good documentary material about the natural history of the world, and had some interesting scientific images but the movie had nothing to do with the real thing. I didn't understand why that was necessary. It's not really worth paying attention to this movie, and unfortunately this movie is an utter waste of time and money.   This movie was really poorly directed, it lacked the needed elements to make this a worthwhile viewing. The story of the woman was not portrayed correctly, but the woman herself wasn't quite believable either. The characters had no reason to be in the movie. I think you should go and see this movie with a lot of friends who are very knowledgeable about it and do a quick look-up yourself if you like to see some real American horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of anime films and this one was bad. This movie is like a half hour long commercial and you can just see it when the video is on television. Not only that but I have read the book, it is extremely slow and the actors are absolutely awful. There are about 4 minutes of dialogue that you can watch, then you need to wait 4 minutes and 10 minutes to watch the beginning of the movie and then you can wait the same 4 minutes until they're done. At first the actors had the courage to try and make some comedy but they couldn't. They just went on the big fat jokes and laughed at people for no reason. When the movie had started, everything was pretty funny. But then, towards the end, the acting got really bad and everything else got really fast. At the end there were some of the big gags that were left and there was only one thing that was left for them. It would be difficult for any of the actors to be honest and say anything about this movie: you cannot tell what happened after the movie is over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is not a little bit interesting and has a few interesting and scary moments but after the 2 hour long finale the movie has nothing to do with the "evil people" storyline that it tries to establish.  You get the story about a group of killers and a woman who gets the only chance she has to survive. The movie is about an evil man who kills his girlfriend in order to keep him under capture and that this man does not use this kind of reasoning nor has anything else to do but say.  That's pretty much the whole movie, except that the protagonist is the killer, a killer who has the most important thing in his life and his daughter. The only reason this movie makes you pay money is because it's a horror movie, not a horror drama. The killer was the only villain in it and I don't think the story itself has anything to do except with "evil".  The movie does a couple interesting things but those are only the initial ones, the killer gets killed, but you already know who is in the movie anyway.   I'm really looking forward to the sequel but I really do not want it to get much more interesting. In the future I'll have to watch the original movie and wait for it to happen. If it wasn't this bad it would be a pretty good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was boring. I really didn't understand why they bothered so much to make this movie. This movie is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very badly written, badly acted and the directing was poor. I have a sense that there's no way to go through the rest of the movie in a short time without watching the previews (like I did with "The Terminator"). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst of the badest movies that I have seen. It's a shame that I don't have any more horror films to recommend than the likes of "The Last Drop" and "The Haunted Ship". I was expecting better films, like "The Hostage", or the new "Under the Sea" where the monsters have turned into the flesh. And this movie does nothing but trash some of the genre I love, and most of the people involved in the film were pretty bad in it. I mean there was no characters who came into the film, but it's interesting to watch those guys in their new roles. But, the acting is lousy. The special effects are lousy, the camera is poor, and the director couldn't care a thing. The story is poor (for lack of an excuse) and the dialog is bad. And the plot is very bad. For example, the protagonist has a big brain, and he's scared about getting a big head in the head, but the head (and I think the head) falls into the fridge and that becomes the main source of the fear. I thought he could have at least made a little more suspense and excitement about it. Unfortunately, that is not the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so predictable that it actually hurts your brain. But for those with a conscience, it is hard to give this movie what it contains. And I have not seen an original line of a movie that was so bad. The acting is awful. The plot is weak. If you want to see something original, go and see The Devil Wears Out (a better movie). The original line about this movie that would get a pass for its originality. The dialog was horrible, and the acting was bad. What was the point that you want it to be original? If you were watching it for its entertainment, it might have made some sense. But if you're watching it just to avoid wasting your time, then it is a piece of garbage. And if you didn't see the original line, then you can't go in it because of its failure. I will give this one 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with the plot of this movie: I really believed that John R. Johnson was the man that portrayed John R in the book and was a truly talented man. The only reason why I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 is that he was the first person to appear in the film and was so awful that I never even tried to find it anywhere else. It's just disappointing that so many people, including myself, are willing to believe the truth and not take it for granted. I cannot believe that so bad a movie can get so far in so long! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A plot with so little thought, a plot with no intention, no purpose, and no purpose. A movie where nothing happens. A film with no real purpose or meaning. A plot that is so convoluted, you can't even find it. I think you can watch this movie, and watch it again, and not even see it again. The plot is a waste of a movie, a waste and a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read in a number of articles about the 'new' American foreign language "American film" and its relation to the movie "Sinoza's Madness" (also an incredibly bad movie, but with a good story). If there is a question about whether or not you can get this movie from France, or what it would take to get the same feeling. Firstly, let's consider the fact that the English words in the story are correct for English-speakers. They are not English in the general meaning. They had never meant English, the movie is obviously not English, but if the words were English, you would be looking at the plot.  The 'American film' only serves to promote the "foreign language", while the plot is about not being in the United States. If the words are wrong, then the movie isn't bad, and the story is still a true story.  I won't even go into the plot, although it contains some of the best elements of the movie, like the plot itself and the characters, and it certainly is not the kind of story for which the movie was supposed to be. This is a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friend saw this movie on the television for a few weeks and I decided to give it an honest review. I didn't expect much, but I got it wrong. The plot was so bad it was actually better to just watch it on television and not the movie theater. The acting was terrible. The direction was bad, the plot was awful, the camera was bad. The cinematography was bad...  I have a feeling that if this film was made in a different time period, it would probably not have gotten more than 7 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the history of independent cinema. The acting was really bad. The characters are very flat. They do nothing. Even though the actors are decent, the whole movie was about nothing. The movie could have gotten a rating of a B- if they had the right stars and the right script. If you watch it, you might just go like a bunch of people doing a lot of drugs. The only positive things I had to say was the soundtrack by Chris Haysley. That would have been nice if this movie had been a real film. The editing was so terrible that you wonder if the filmmakers even knew what they were making. There were only a few moments when the actors were alive and in the scenes. They should have used more. In the end, they did a real good job. They had the original songs on top, but the rest of the movie was just horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of "True Love" and the film was the biggest waste of that kind of movies I have ever seen. When it came out in the late '90s, I wanted to watch it but the problem was the dialogue and script were very slow and the characters weren't developed. If anything, it was a pretty lame romantic comedy and the funny things that seemed ridiculous were just laughable. I just don't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the James Bond movies, which I watch every other season, but this one just doesn't even deserve it, let alone have it to be one of my favorite movies. Not only is it terrible and ridiculous but it's too long to be a "hit" film. It takes place where it doesn't really matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that this movie was pretty bad, but I did enjoy it. But I couldn't say what is going on, so I decided to avoid seeing it.   For those who like a little bit of action, this movie would be better. But unfortunately, in this movie, it just isn't really all that. The movie is a mixture of mediocre comedy, and awful slapstick material, with a twist that only works if you find yourself smiling. I have heard a few friends of mine and friends of a movie friend say that this film is just like a carousel that falls apart as people are moving around on it. This film does not fit that description. In this film, the people don't know that they're moving around.  For that matter, if you like it for that reason, go ahead and see it. You might miss the humor if you're not used to it. Just don't watch it, or else you might ruin the enjoyment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horribly bad movie for anyone who expects to find anything new and inventive. There are no "subplots", no interesting, no surprises, no creative plot, no dramatic twists, and no dialog. I was bored at all times. The "new" part consisted of a bunch of naked women in an old farmhouse, who have probably seen it a hundred times, and their naked bodies, which look like they're in a '80's college setting. I mean it, the fact that the old farm houses had a basement that was dark and had a big wooden door, as well as a wooden bed that had a lock to lock in, that made the movie interesting, was just an ugly waste of time. The scenes were so unimaginative, that I felt like I had been watching the same things for years. Some of the actors were so obviously bored that they just gave up.   The movie is probably better than that, though, but I couldn't stomach it. I give this movie a 1/3 because it's decent enough, but not the kind of movie I would normally want to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible, it really shouldn't have been one of the biggest releases this year. It was bad to watch. It made no sense at all. A movie that has nothing to recommend, I can't recommend it at all... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really a big waste of money in the hands of the studio (and the director, too), this film does nothing but try to come across as "fun" and is nothing but a collection of pretentious trashy comedies of questionable quality.  The movie is obviously based on a very simple premise - the idea of a bunch of friends who fall in love in a big city - this is clearly false. But the movie does manage to find a good balance between the "cool" theme (the title) and the ridiculous "cooly" scenes (the main storyline). Unfortunately, that doesn't help much either, as there are some terrible scenes, and most of the plot is not worked out like the film would be. The only good thing in the film is the opening scenes, that are surprisingly funny, as the actors play their roles as a mad dog and a housekeeper. They aren't a lot of jokes, but they're funny enough to be a joke. In the beginning of the movie, the joke is that the whole town is going to be ruined by the movie's protagonist, who apparently is some sort of psycho. That isn't much different from the rest of the film, but it is a bit disappointing.  But the whole plot falls apart when the movie is over. It starts out to be about a bunch in a small house, with a lot in common. Then the movie sets itself down as the end - it's a small town, and the main guy is in love with a bunch who happens to be in it. The movie isn't very well written, though. What you see is pretty much a lot like a bunch more things you've seen before, although the "adults" start doing pretty much the same thing. It goes downhill as the movie progresses.   The only thing that does a bit better than this movie are the scenes that are shot by a large crew, that is the only reason that this movie survives. Most of the dialog is pretty good, but at some point you'll just go "that's boring", and there'll be a funny moment where you'll laugh for no reason, and then you'll suddenly think that you've just laughed at yourself.  If this was supposed to be some kind of movie that "fun". It wasn't very funny.  I don't really recommend this movie, but if you want to watch a movie that's just a lot better, try something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is really, really bad. I had no idea the characters would be so shallow and insubstantive as the actors in this movie. They are basically made with no direction from any kind of creative person. They just go around and make no progress whatsoever. I have to say that it might be a good idea for a short film with a plot, but I just think they should give better lines and a better direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit I thought this movie was better than I thought it was at first. A couple of things that were not right, including the ending - and when you see this movie on HBO you will think that the ending is right, not the worst of the film and not even the worst. This movie, while not bad, is just so bad - it is not even as bad as the previous film, and I think I've learned that just too much time has gone by. This is not a movie for "the adult movie fan" like it is for a film with a plot. This film really doesn't deserve its 10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in a theater when I visited the theater for the first time. I was baffled by the lack of story line and the lack in the story. The movie had no action but it had two horrible scenes with a bunch of people trying to try to save the little girl.  The first scene was where the woman tries to save her little girl who was being attacked by some men while she was at the hotel. The second scene had a man try to rescue the girl by killing some of the man's friends. That guy was so bad, I didn't even know why he was doing that.   The movie's ending wasn't even worth a second. I gave it a two and a half. The ending was way too cruel, the dialog was too dull, the villain wasn't very scary, and the ending wasn had nothing to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After viewing the previews, the only thing I can say is, don't read it.  If you are a fan of this movie, then read it only when you're bored, it won't make much sense.    If it's anything like, say, an action movie, you'll like it. But this is bad. The only way you will like it is that you will not be bored, that you'll miss what this movie is.  I'm not saying this in an argument. This movie has nothing to make you feel any stronger, nothing to save you from feeling any weak or tired after it. You won't feel any real emotion, you won't even want to have sex with anyone, you will need some more of a reality filter to your mind.  In fact, what you should actually find in this movie instead of watching it is the most painful part of this lousy movie: it's boring.  It just plain boring. If it were a movie, it would have to make something real, and that is the only way that you can watch it. This is nothing.  And that's not what it is. No, I am not saying that this is a movie made by a bunch of Hollywood directors (a bunch of people who make the best movies) but it is a complete waste of time, with no real relevance to a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible movie. This is one of those movies that is only to be laughed at when you consider it in the same light. There are so many scenes that just can't hold one attention. If you're familiar with it and are able to pick out the parts that make you laugh, you might be more amused than me. But if you're just a film with a very low budget, then this will probably annoy you. In fact, I laughed all the way out of my stomach. I actually laughed at the very end when I realized that it was not a movie, it was just a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen, even worse than the terrible British TV remake of The Bourne Series (1991). It is not that bad.  This is a total waste of "Bollevers" to feature so many scenes that nobody ever gets any work. This is truly nothing but a piece of a brain-numbing film, that has absolutely nothing to do with reality.  It features the worst carwash scenes and scenes of all the worst movies I have seen in the history. It is just a pretense of something that will make people scream and ask why it has even been allowed to get made. In one scene I can't remember exactly what happens, but the most disturbing scenes are involving an unnamed woman. The movie is so full of pretentious humor that I'm pretty sure it is going to be shown on a TV show somewhere in the world, but I'm not that sure. If you don't have to see this film, go away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure why this movie made it, but it is certainly disappointing. We had many fun times with the movie, but I never felt as much involved as I did with the story. And now when I see the movie in a new light, I see why I'm so annoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only was it OK, but the acting wasn't that good. In fact, some of the acting was bad, and the plot, while still moving at a normal pace, had the plot collapse at the end. It was like a bad attempt at a comedy movie. And I've never seen such a crap comedy like this before. Some of the humour was OK, some were pretty funny, but none of them got the edge that is a comedy writer, and you can't expect a movie to be a serious comedy comedy comedy, not to have some weirdly absurd parts.  And the ending didn't provide much in the way of a plot to a movie.   And I really don't know where this movie is going. I'll add: it's worth checking out if you've read one. But if you decide not to read it, don't waste your time with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read the book and think this movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is bad in every possible way, even being the best part. I was even disappointed that this movie was made and not only that, I got really bored. I didn't even want to see this movie, especially when it came out. I thought they should at least try making something that is more interesting than a standard action movie. I am not sure why it even has this level of attention. The acting is terrible. The director obviously should read a dictionary and understand that the characters in this movie will be boring and boring. The direction is awful, especially because it looks like a real computer-generated. There's no excuse to making it like that. The scenes are boring and don't even have any suspense to bring us to the ending. The only thing that is good is the editing of the scenes. When they finally reach the ending, they are obviously there to get more money in the "profit" of the movie. If the movie was more interesting, they would have done it. The ending is way too weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was horrible because it seemed like they thought this was the movie to be made for. Not only in what makes it horrible but in the whole of this movie it was so bad it was like a piece of bad wooded sand. No plot, no storyline, no plot! What is the point of having a good plot if it can't even have a plot? The whole thing was just a waste of money... I thought it should have been a very good movie with a very interesting storyline and good acting. It just didn't do anything. I am sure I don't know exactly what happened and that is the main reason I'm giving this movie a two-star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So many problems start with this pathetic, self-destroying piece of crap that's the only movie i know of that takes it for a serious entertainment. It's a bad film but I'm really not sure how people got it. I have to assume that the writer got to choose the direction he chose and then he made it as a documentary so, I suppose it would be impossible for the director to get an idea out of itself.  I was expecting this to be a pretty damn movie, and I was hoping it would have some depth and humor. Unfortunately, they can't get that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Star Trek - Vixen" is the worst Star Trek film of all time.  The story and the characters are awful, all at once. This film is not about space or aliens.  There's nothing to keep a villain in a one-star movie; they are in the same position as the characters in "Star Wars".  All this is made possible by the fact that there is no dialog.  All the actors don't have a sense of the characters. Most of the scenes are so poorly written that they are virtually meaningless.  This is, essentially, a sequel to the famous "Star of the Rings" and "Return of the Jedi", not to make up for the losses that made the first two films. The ending is OK, and is probably a good one, but the plot is not much good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's difficult to read the book of it. The film is so weak that you wonder why they could actually put out a movie about a true vampire who is really missing his identity as a vampire. If I hadn't read the Book, I would have thought this was one of the biggest horror films of all time (and probably some sort of "Livest Christmas"). It's so bad that it's hard to find a good place to rent it.  I just hope that my friends and my mother won't have to see it. I cannot believe that a movie called "Mandraay" would have a similar message to this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a good way to make movies that tell the real truth of the world, but this one is absolutely nothing like it. Even a bad film like this one cannot hope to get into the mind of those familiar with the genre, and this is no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit I love movies, but when I watch this one I just was out of my mind. The movie is a bunch of guys who can't even find the girl he wants to bed. And they are all very dumb, not even able to act, with a bunch just as boring as a normal person would. For the sake of suspense I thought they could find a real girl in a movie, but that was just not happening. There is a movie that would work for me, like "The Girl With the Black Hair". But I would never rent this movie, I have seen "The Boy With The Red Shoes" a thousand times, and I don't think you can get that formula to work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. A lot of people don't understand the meaning of this movie. It is not meant to be a "documentary," it is just a film that uses a lot of recycled footage from a TV movie. The movie does not show any real meaning except for the message of the movie: people think that it was a documentary about a documentary and nothing else. It contains very few (no actual documentary) scenes. We only see a few actors and a few scenes. There is no story. The main plot is based on a documentary which is obviously not about the true meaning of the documentary. This is why you think this is a documentary: the title makes no sense. It was the result of some poor planning and an extremely poor movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest example of the "fantasy" genre which has come since 1990. With no story or action, it has a few gags and many gags, most of which are either not true or completely irrelevant to the plot. But this movie is so dumb and terrible that it really ruins the fun of the movie. At one point the actors were so oblivious that they were oblivious to the events that the movie was about. I have to confess, I didn't really believe the entire plot for much more than the fact that it had a plot. Some of the gags I was expecting to have in the movie were not just completely out of place. The movie didn't even have a plot to help the characters. I could've spent several years checking out the plot of "The Munch Man" and it would have been more entertaining than this stupid movie. I would rate this movie a 1. But sadly I can't give it a 1 because it is too bad to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I liked the first movie when I was a child. But they completely failed when I saw this one. It is simply a film that tries to be cute, but it just doesn't work. I've seen it four times, and all I think it does is to make you want to punch yourself in the face, while you're laughing at the ending.  I don't want to see a movie with this name, or one that relies on a catchy title like this one to lure in so many "thrills" or "jokes" from their fans. I like "Pantra: Harkoor" better than the name of the movie. In fact, the story is actually very simple. But "Panda: Hinkie" is just as lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie was supposed to be a clever one, but there was just too much effort put into it. The movie was just completely lacking a lot of charm. The actors were not great, either, but I don't remember too much of the special effects for it.  A few things helped keep it from being a complete ripoff of "Sister." Some of the actors were good, but they were not nearly as good as their predecessors.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the title says, this movie was so terrible that I felt like I'd like to throw it out of my box of DVD and let everyone know that this was bad. This is one of those movies where the plot is a stupid movie. There are a bunch of annoying characters and bad acting. What did they do in "American Pie"? They put out a fake Christmas movie, and it ends up having a little bit of fun as they get along with all sorts of annoying people (see above). I mean, they were pretty good actors, but when it was over, the movie just spiraled into a flat, predictable mess. In the early parts, they had an interesting plot. But when it progressed, the story and dialogue became predictable and the story fell flat. Even if you weren't looking for plot, you could have guessed how it would go. They also seemed like they made it for kids, so it's difficult to say what they were doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see the first and second installments of the original Star Trek movies, you'll pick up a copy of the first. You'll miss the second, which has been made a decade, because you've read the first, you don't get the second. The second is no worse than the first - just not great. The acting is so bad, the plot is so shallow and poorly written, that you will only laugh if you're fortunate enough to see some of the second feature (you have to see it, anyway). The story of the film was so bad that I really couldn't care much about it. I can barely recall the details of it. One example is the infamous scene where Spock asks Captain Kirk to fly her to a planet of some sort or something like that, but it's not as funny as you might think it would be. This is the case of Star Trek IV, but I won't really see that movie.  If this is going to be your choice, at least pick up the first film. Otherwise, my recommendation is to skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film of mine was conceived so that I would see it to make me see the movie in my brain after it had been shown to me. I don't have the guts to do such an exercise. I can't blame the people that made this movie. They obviously knew nothing about the concept of this film. The idea is to promote this film so that people will see it in their heads and decide to rent it or see it as a movie. The fact that they sold it to a major US distributor is extremely disappointing to me and really hurts the message of a true film making. Why is it even being released in the UK and then being allowed to be shown on TV in the US? I am extremely disappointed. I give this film a 0.3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this film on the back of a bargain ticket, and it turned out to be another awful slasher film in which a group of thugs try to rape a young girl.  I'd be grateful if the director gave an extra 45 minutes to make a little bit of this movie, but instead, he just cut it out of it, leaving the movie completely unsatisfiable.  The only thing that is supposed to make this film interesting is a disclaimer.  This movie is "not really meant for adult audiences," although you can find it in a bargain store for cheap entertainment.  If it were any good, this movie would be much better than it is now.  There is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a bad cast, but what could possibly be the worst part? We can't blame this movie for having bad acting. I'll give it a 3. The plot was good in a few parts, and it was very clever when the camera moved around the city, but the only part that really got good was the scene in the pool, which is also the worst thing in the movie. The story was weak. There was only one scene where the main characters made it possible to jump out of a swimming pool, and that was pretty lame, so everything else in the film seemed to be like a big joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so terrible that it isn't even funny. In fact, you can even see the actors acting like they're playing the opposite sex roles. There is absolutely no sense of humor in this movie. It's a real laugh at the beginning, but once the story gets going it's impossible to keep up! The characters are totally unbelievable.  The only way I can laugh at this movie is when I see my own parents in this very film. They were so stupid and ridiculous at that time that it was funny. They are the ones that made this movie funnier. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a bad, dull, predictable story of a man who falls in love with a woman, and then falls in his house and is ready to kill everyone in the house with a shotgun. Then, we learn that this man is, in a flashback, going back to the beginning of the movie where he killed his wife at some point in the past. I have to say that this isn't even the worst movie, because it's one of the worst I've ever seen in my life, and I don't really even think you're supposed to have "fun" with a movie like this. You'd think it'd be a fun movie, even if it wasn't a murder-murder, since it can't stop the murderer from doing the murder anyway, but if we're paying attention to this story, we're not doing anything.  There are a few small moments that bring this movie together, but after the story begins, everything else is only background, not the real plot. It does give a nice scene between two women, and the scene at the end where the guy is on the bed with the girl that he fell in love (I guess he's fallen for her?), but I have no idea how they were together before they were married.  The director of this movie tries to make this a "true crime drama," with the guy getting his wife involved in a murder scene, but the scene is pretty poor, so the scene really isn't worth your time. I'd be willing to suspend this movie a few times, but it just can't really make you feel for anything. It was pretty dumb and really painful to watch the guy, and by the end of it, the movie really had nothing to recommend it. I really didn't enjoy it, and was totally disappointed with the direction.   The ending is about a man, a man that is caught in a fight with the woman and killed by his wife, and in some scenes, we see him sitting at a restaurant on the night of his wedding ceremony.  I am surprised that this movie didn't do a "normal" scene in its conclusion, since the movie had its ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "B" is a very bad movie, I mean really bad. It is only slightly more interesting than the other entries, but this one is just boring. In fact it's a very disappointing movie. The plot is totally unbelievable and unbelievable. The idea behind this movie seems to be an excuse for people to make this movie. I am tired of seeing people like this in my favorite movies. The premise is extremely naive. The characters are bad. And they don't even seem to care about the people who are in the movie. If you want to be a movie with a plot, don't make this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a movie writer, like me, you probably can't read this review. I've seen the trailers for the movie, and I've read the book, and it's not like I'm gonna say anything else. This movie isn't like the other "The Game of Elginor" films, and the movie is horrible. I'm afraid if you have to see it, you'll just get a bunch of angry kids. The movie is so bad, it's sad. The acting is extremely bad, the story is a flat one, and you really don't get to know the characters. You will see a few moments that are so bad that you want to turn the channel off.  I wish I had no idea who this movie was. If I had the chance to go to see the movie I would watch the scenes from the first scene in the theater... And I wouldn't be able to make this up to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was quite good when it started and the ending was interesting and, unfortunately, quite unhingeworthy. The lack of the character's motivations made the film's failure apparent, but it's not really difficult to find someone to sympathize with. A lot of the scenes were drawn out of the characters's predicament, and the fact that the film never really tells how one feels to themselves is pretty sad.  I had hoped that this would be a movie that had some redeeming quality, but I didn't even see a movie with this in it. The acting was pretty poor, and, of course, the direction and lighting was horrible.  The movie's attempt to find an identity for the characters is pretty hilarious considering the characters' situation and their situation, but what happened to them. It's just not the right thing to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this film at a local movie theatre in Atlanta, Georgia. The movie was just about 90 minutes long, so I could only sit and watch the opening sequence. The first thing I noticed was the lack of any plot. The only thing I saw was "The Lost Tribe". I couldn't even figure out the significance of it until I saw the TV and DVD labels. The plot had so many inconsistencies that I was completely bored the whole time.  The movie made absolutely no sense. It was just a plot based on a true story about a couple of lost Indians who traveled in the southeast United States. They met up in some bush area in Georgia and set up camp for the Indians. A couple of Indians in a tent on an island came to see their strange tribe and then supposedly left them for dead Indians in the region of Georgia. Then, some time later, another tribe came and set the area to ruin, and then the people in the area of Georgia set up the new community. That tribe had no story, no sense of people, nothing to do with anything, and had nothing to comment on in the film. It just happened. It's a shame I had to sit and see the movie. I just couldn't see what the purpose was. The film obviously has nothing in common with "The Tribe" and couldn't be worth showing, even if I could. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I watched this movie in an hour. It was only after I watched the first 5 minutes of the movie that I realized how terrible it was. I thought the director of the film was just a little bit naive, maybe even a bit old, for the characters to portray their romantic, romanticized lives. I can't really fault him for that, but if the director wanted to portray them as romantic, she should have done so much more than that. The scene in which the father, brother, and brother were all portrayed in an unrealistic, unrealistic manner made no sense, and was completely lacking in any realism. The most annoying thing was the fact that the brothers could make a complete connection with their mother, and then, when the mother was trying to make a connection with them, they tried to make that connection by kissing her, making love, making it a couple times, and so on... and so far, the family only continued to be in a romantic, unrealistic way with the brother and sister. It had no effect at all on the characters of the family.  I think this film had nothing to recommend to anyone, not even the family, since it was nothing that we would want to see. It is not a movie that anyone would recommend seeing for people who are looking for some fun, but we all have seen too much to recommend. What do we think? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even worth watching at a horror movie convention... I mean this is the movie that made The Secret of Bigfoot and I'm wondering why?  The story has nothing, nothing interesting. It's just a bunch of guys hanging around a local cave in the woods. They decide to rob the cave, but they are killed by a giant tiger. Then they try to escape and go off to investigate the cave but they end up dead. The final ending is only about 4 minutes long.  The plot is bad, and the ending was terrible... and worst of all, it's not scary or scary. It doesn't leave you feeling any emotion.  My Rating: 2 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My son, who was very interested in this movie, didn't like it. It made some mistakes. While the plot was very good, it was not true to the movie, and I have a feeling of how much the movie could have been taken. There was no point. The characters were not interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought "The Secret Life" was one of the worst movies i've seen in my life. This is the equivalent of a car crash. There is no suspense. The acting is poor. A couple of very boring scenes that are set in a hotel were only to attract a few. I guess the director wanted to add to the movie and it didn't. There was only one scene that wasn't even filmed in one of our studio; the entire movie was only about one person, which was pretty annoying. There are two very sick and annoying scenes involving an old man who is blackmailed and made a lot of money by the people who kidnapped him. I don't even remember the actors. The scenes were too much like a movie and too boring and were too unbelievable. I really think this movie is about having sex in some way. I thought the scenes were very interesting and that it was interesting. It wasn't like we used the word "real" in that way but it sure was just about having some real time and money and that's it. When I was watching the movie I didn't even see that the director knew what his purpose was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film begins with a fairly good plot but the acting is terrible, especially the parts that involve the protagonist, who is not good either (like, he is very annoying but then he is obviously not good). In the beginning the actor seems like an excellent actor who was the person to ask people to look at in a new way and that it was all over for him because he is so easily put in one scene by the audience, in a movie like this it is too easy to see that the audience is going to watch and think "why there is no real world"? Even if it was like that, the characters are not interesting or interesting in anyway.  But the plot is better in the first part with the fact that the characters do something that we do not like (that is, the killing and the destruction of the buildings) and that is why they are forced to act together and act alone. That's OK but then the film loses the audience after the end because they just did not get enough pleasure and there is hardly any sense of having a personal connection with the characters. They don't talk to each other. No one talks to each person. This is only a consequence of the weak plot. It has nothing to do with the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was so bad it was bad to see it in the movie theater in the theatre as one of my first film experience. I can't believe what people are saying on this website! If you are a movie lover then this is a big waste of money.  I'm not really interested in seeing this movie as it is mainly bad acting, but it is entertaining to see bad movies for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no reason to see this movie. You would never get to watch this movie, nor any other. Why would there be a movie with so little depth? It is so bad, but not even that! If you are even remotely interested in music music, you'd be left with no chance whatsoever. If you're not, you might be interested in a movie that would contain some plot, but with no depth whatsoever. This movie is very, very disappointing! A man was the director of a failed movie: an anti-nuke movie with little regard for the music, and without the music. This is the only reason I would see this film. It is probably a good idea that it never was released. I would never buy it, if it wasn't like this! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was like another "B" film based on "The Walking Dead", but somehow, this one has a very high standard. I don't understand the story at all. It is so bad that you wonder if there is a person who can handle himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as stupid as a sitcom would be. A few days after I had just bought my book, I looked in my library and saw the movie listed on TV. It was a very good one, but then I didn't find the last few minutes necessary for me to buy the book, and I have seen movies like this one before. I'd been so ready to see it, but it didn't deliver. When I'd looked into it, it wasn't even funny. I'm sure that a movie with a female protagonist would be funny, but this one didn't even come close to the real life, let alone funny. The story is basically a pointless exercise. The characters in this movie talk to each other, but only about a dozen minutes of conversation before they decide to talk to another character and start bashing each other. It's like they're watching a movie that shows nothing and yet there's a story that's over so much time that no one can get into it. They can't even say anything. It doesn't have any suspense and no humor. It has no character or characters. There are many strange things, like a female character who kills the guy's girlfriend without showing any remorse. Then there's just some random shots of a dead corpse. The plot is just as pointless as the movie, and nothing new. It would have been better if it was a movie about a dead person, which would be much more entertaining. I had to wait about 15 minutes before I even finished watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of movies that are made about the same movie genre that I've been in for most of my life, and I was interested in seeing some of these movies as a kid, but this movie wasn't one of those movies.  The plot, although pretty good, is just a horrible attempt at a comedy. No matter what the number of laughs or laughs, this movie is pretty bad.  Overall, I don't recommend this movie to anyone. It will make you angry, and you won't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little bit of trivia about "The Dead End" is in that it contains a plot. In an old movie studio where all the new characters are made (in this movie the main character is the daughter of the family and is not the daughter in the original).  The main character of the original movie is not actually the daughter's mother, but only her daughter. The movie is about a bunch of widowed people whose wives were killed by a zombie virus, and who came back as soon as they died. The film includes a girl who has to keep herself away from the zombie virus which is causing people to die and she tries to avoid getting bitten.  I have been looking at the DVD for a long time and I cannot recall any specific scenes. But I think they were trying to be an original zombie movie with a very low budget.  This movie doesn't have a lot of depth in terms of the gore, but it's not as bad as the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that doesn't deserve to be dubbed as a cult movie, although I wouldn't call it a "cult". There are several flaws that are clearly not intended to be "cult" or anything even remotely that should be a cult. The story focuses on the character of the "evil twins" (one twin, a teenager, a woman), so it seems like a story that doesn`t really have a proper beginning or conclusion. The "evil twin" is actually the girlfriend of another female, who is obviously the main figure in the movie. The female protagonist is, a member of the very predictable and completely amateur movie director, who just doesn`T know how to act. The movie is just a sad excuse to some person with some serious acting. I would give it this title for someone who has seen it for entertainment. But if you do not have that much patience, you may want to avoid it. The film's title is so bad I cannot see it as a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see this movie for my birthday, and after seeing this film, I decided that I would never pay money to see it, but just look at some more serious things, like a movie about a movie: a movie that is very boring and badly thought out. You can't get away from a poor script or direction. There are only two people in this movie who actually manage to make anything interesting, and they're not even named, and you get two lines of people talking about something interesting to someone who, without seeing them, you'd probably never be convinced there's any funny thing about this movie: the lines that make it possible to be funny or make you laugh, but the actors are pretty awful. The story is basically about a woman who goes to an empty parking lot and finds that she has to deal with people.  Now you might be tempted to ask what happened after that. I'm guessing that it was something like "the woman who was raped by a man". You can guess. But after that, the movie is just boring, even more boring. The only funny thing in this is the main characters who are having some fun and make you smile, and, unlike the main actors, the main character didn't have a single line about what she was doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is as bad as the "B" on "B", "I" and "A" from "B". In the film, the "M" is not only a bad actor, but it is also the biggest waste of money in this film of the last decade. The only real plot is in the second part, a woman in a hospital who kills everyone. The woman's boyfriend tries to kill her in another hospital, but the woman gets her boyfriend's body back by "the police". This is completely ridiculous, even in "The Adventures of the Fiery Eagle". The story was too unbelievable, as if it were just some strange events in a movie, it had nothing to do with "The Fiery Eagles", nor any real connection with the characters, except the "family" of the movie. In "A", the woman has a "friend" with a man who has a mustache and red hair. This was also ridiculously fake. There is absolutely no connection between the woman and the "fiery Eagle", who has the same hairstyle. The plot has to stop. Even the "F" in the movie isn't a "normal" movie in which you can die from getting cancer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was no fun - like a piece of plastic. It's not interesting in the slightest - nothing new - nothing dramatic - nothing like a movie, unless you like the big moments of chaos - just an endless list of stupid actions that were not interesting. I'm not saying that this is the only film to waste one's time on, but unfortunately there are a handful of films that make this look like a successful effort.  I'd really like to point out my other favorites, I have to admit, but this one does not have any fun or real value to it.  There is only one moment that you can't find anywhere in the film. It just shows that a few people at the beginning had been put on hold. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story goes to one weird direction and it fails to make any sense. The plot is only mildly interesting and this leads to a rather predictable climax that leaves the viewer feeling bored. I am not even convinced that it could be a serious work, but I am sure that it's not without a little bit of self-awareness and a certain level of self confidence.  Now, if you are going to do this, you want to do it for fun. The story is about a man who wants to get into the secret world of sex. The movie itself is about getting into the dark world of lust. There is no fun. If your entertainment is based on "guilment" then you'll be bored but bored too.  If you are interested in movies, then watch something like "The Joyful Evolution" and that will be much more entertaining than this movie. The funny scenes are hilarious, but they're just not that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still surprised to find this movie in our store.  I didn't even find it in the DVD rack and it didn't have any subtitles in the theaters. It doesn't do any of the things you would expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. For instance, the characters look like they're sitting on a plastic couch. And then there's a ridiculous scene where a group of people are talking behind a desk, saying how horrible the other guys are. I'm not going to see that in a movie, even if it was a film:  The acting is OK. It's OK to have an interesting storyline, but this movie didn't manage to go past its basic purpose. There is no way it could have done anything better than to put the movie in the worst possible place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not even remotely good, in fact it had no plot, no direction, it had absolutely no sense, and most importantly it had zero motivation. I watched it on a video tape in the early 2000. The only thing that was good was the editing, which was not as bad as this movie, it was the script and the sound. The ending had a great ending, but if the film was to be true to the original I wouldn't have enjoyed it.  Now this movie was a bit better in certain respects, the direction and some of the special effects, but it still wasn't a movie I would recommend even if I was younger. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this movie, i just found that the director didn't know how to tell a story. It's the most annoying piece of film I've ever seen, but this is the only film i have seen that has even a remotely decent performance. You get that sort of character, that makes no sense whatsoever. If you've seen the first "Iris" film, then you know that the actor is like a cartoon character. They get to the point where they act like this old movie. Then there's some sort of plot and characters are developed into characters and you really don't care about what happens to the characters. This movie just falls apart.   Not only is the acting bad, but the ending is too predictable. I'm sure my cousin who saw this movie watched the entire movie, and at the beginning of the movie i thought, 'why is there a part like that?' and I've never understood why people would go out and buy it just to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've tried many different movies, and I've read this one twice. I really thought this movie was good, but I've seen it once and it's still a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is absolutely no redeeming merit. It's not even funny. It doesn't even make the slightest bit of value or fun. The acting is bad enough to make this movie a total waste of time. If you want to know why a movie can have such a poor showing, I urge you to try it before you see it. You'll make yourself sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only episode that I think should be made off of the HBO series with "The Walking Dead" because I found it so unfelarming, I decided to watch it as a comedy, but instead of doing anything else, I went into the second season thinking that it would be interesting to watch the entire series. It's just not an interesting episode.  One thing that I'm surprised to learn is that there's actually a zombie on the show.  I can't blame the writers for the decision to leave the zombie zombie in the show, and I do believe that it was done because of the "wimp" that it brought to the show (if it wasn't so), but it did nothing to justify the decision. It makes no sense to let it go on. The episode is the usual "The Dead" type, and one that can make you feel depressed and think of people you'd like to see again after death.  The plot is so bad, in my opinion, that it really doesn't matter if you're watching it as an episode, because you can tell the story without having seen the entire episode. The only way I can say that it gets better is when it goes into the fourth "Discovery" episode. It will not be that much better.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what we call in our minds when we try to enjoy a movie. We know it is a "mature" action-adventure, but we get mad and want to see something more sophisticated. I am sorry to admit that the action scenes are not quite as exciting as we had hoped. I do think you can see some action in this movie that isn't the average action-movie. I guess I have to give it some credit for the idea. But the plot isn't that compelling, especially since we don't know how the characters from the original film will come into this movie. I really hope you will take it as a film with some sort of plot development, some action, a beginning or something like that. I'm sorry, but you don't want to find out that at all. The plot is really bad, but I wouldn't give this film a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of bad writing, bad movie-making and bad acting, and bad plot (not to mention the "good" direction). The movie was completely predictable. It's not surprising that it took the idea of "the good" guy from a movie: the first three movies were like a "sneaky plot" movie, and this one has the same "slimed-back" dialog-play. When the movie starts, I was looking at the screen with the lights turned off. This guy was acting like his character was going to be "good". At times I felt like I was watching "the show" and "the movie". I'm not sure why it was put on TV because it's about a car, and I have yet to see the car they are doing that in this movie. The director (Aas Tuba) and the writer (Dana) have absolutely no idea why he couldn't just make something that's not a car. I would have to see this movie in an actual car, with a real car. This movie sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find myself looking at this movie every day just to have an excuse to be mad. In fact, my reaction to this movie was pretty good. I was mad that this was a movie directed by a "fan" and then that it was a "movie for a TV series," and then I went into the film alone with my husband and then proceeded to think like I have never seen myself do it. I just sat there and watched another 40 minutes of it.  If this movie isn't made to entertain me then it simply isn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing all of the scenes from this film I just didn't like the end. It's simply one long scene of the entire movie (the big scene), and the rest of the movie is simply a series of scenes, and not a series in itself. While this is a disappointing ending to a movie that is good in the beginning, this movie has nothing to recommend in either direction or direction. This movie is just bad. Don't even get fooled for the first couple of minutes. There are two scenes which are obviously not where there should have been action. This scene is especially bad because of the lack of plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just plain bad. It is about a teenager named "Mr. Johnson" and an old woman who is the main villain. The villain is a big jerk who likes to sleep around the house and drink as much as possible while having sex with his female partner. But since they're both drunk, this really sucks. He has a girlfriend who can't cook properly. And, unlike most movies that don't have drinking scenes, it actually includes some drinking scenes. I can't blame this movie for being a straight-to-view movie. It's like a drunk high school girl who thinks that every time she drinks something, it's good for her and all she drinks is bad for her. It just gets bad. The best part of this movie is the ending. He's killed by his wife and she is in love with him, but they're not in love the whole time. It seems that he's got an abusive relationship with a girlfriend and she just wants him to keep his eyes from her. The only reason this movie gets an "8" in the rating is that it is a horror movie. There are no suspense or horror elements. The entire story is just about "Mr." and a drunk teenager who kills his girlfriend. The idea is that they're mad and drunk together and she has to have his attention. And since they get drunk together, they have to have some sort of a "relationship". This just does not make it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in the 90's when I was a teenager and it seemed like it was going to be a comedy. But instead, it became a movie about a mad killing of an old person. They had killed old people so they could eat the meat of their victims for the benefit of the "food supply", i.e. making a movie called 'Pleasure Island'.  The acting was terrible, particularly the way the murders were staged and how they came to death. It's like the acting of Quentin Tarantay in The Texas Chains. It doesn't make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been very interested in a horror movie. I'll admit that I have only watched a handful of horror films in my lifetime, and none of them come closest to being even remotely scary. But I am pretty certain that a lot of people, including the vast majority of my friends, do not consider horror to be a valid genre in their lives. This film falls short of that mark entirely. What was wrong with the movie: a plot, a story, a cast of characters that I've only ever seen once in my life (this is the only one that I'm aware of, and that was the only thing that I ever saw), a plot that was actually relevant to the movie, and, to be sure, some clever cinematography and some good effects. And there is absolutely nothing that was remotely relevant to this film that I couldn't see the first time I watched it. In other words, this movie was a total waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie at the local theater, along with the original edition, and found it incredibly disappointing to me. This movie had no special features that made the film any worthwhile. The movie was bad, in the sense that it was so much boring and lacked any semblance to have a beginning, unless you really felt like watching it. I really didn't like that it had nothing to do with the plot. It was really just a big fat guy with a big name, a big hole in the middle of the story, and a giant hole in his heart. I was left wondering why the "big guy" had such a long beard, I thought that he had hair like he was in a cartoon and had no body hair. There was nothing else to do in this movie, besides a huge hole in its middle. When the man had the hole in it, that had a hole in one of the characters, what would they do? The only thing that helped was the sound, which was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I have seen it before, I must have seen this bad movie in a previous movie: "Stray-Tielet" - the movie I saw a few years ago.  If this movie has been shown before, it must be interesting. It's not.  I'm just not stupid and sad to see this movie. It doesn't really have any plot, storyline, or any plot.  This movie was horrible, I could really feel sorry about it. All the scenes were horrible, the dialogs were stupid, the music was bad, the camera moves in slow motion, the actors were awful, and the effects weren't even good.  As a first-time film fan, it is really hard to say why I made this movie: because it was not an "film" like I had hoped. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are reading my comments about this movie: 1. "The Monster Killer" is ridiculous. It's impossible to predict which person will be dead. The best way to succeed is to be a good hunter. The rest is the opposite.  2. The killer can't be that easily guessed. This is no good for the movie, especially the plot.  3. The monsters are so bad that you're almost afraid to have them kill you.  4. The monster is too scary to act. The actors should have done something different than a Frankenstein monster.  5. The action is very poor.   The Monster Killer is overrated and no good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of movie that can't even be considered "serious". A complete failure, one that has to be seen only by its lack of depth. If that is the case, it is extremely disappointing. A movie like this will not have any realistic or entertaining content, making it merely a comedy video that has nothing more than a pretentious soundtrack and a very boring plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of this "new" franchise of the game, and was really bored with it. It seems like the whole "Dark Knight" genre has reached a plateau. The movie was boring in a way that it was supposed to be interesting. It just seemed like there was a whole lot of pretentious and pointless elements. I felt that the writer could have more patience to develop the series. I also found that a lot of the movie seemed childish. I didn't feel like it would've been a good movie if it didn't contain so many dumb characters. I'm really just disappointed that this movie doesn't resemble the rest of the franchise. I really think that it would have been an interesting movie if the actors had more screen time. They obviously didn't and they just didn't care. They got stuck in a box and there is nothing to do, just a random plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to keep quiet in the comments about this movie.  It's simply a horribly slow film with a disappointing end.  There's an effort to portray a modern-day person, but the film does not allow the audience to know anything except for the name, even the plot. There was no effort in writing, no effort to make the characters believable, not even the story.  If you're looking for a thriller with real substance, there is no attempt to be a thriller. The acting is lousy, the sets are lame, and the characters look completely artificial, with no emotion, no real personality, and nothing except the forced presence of a woman.   If this movie is any kind of movie, you will be sorely disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible...  I didn't find out how terrible the movie was until this one, and I'm glad that I had the courage to watch it. I didn`t understand the whole plot, the only thing I remember is that I have never been afraid of a horror movie. What really happens is the kid gets an alien robot that attaches itself to the body of the girl, and he is able to make a lot of money off of it! I was very bored, but at least I was able to laugh at most of the movie. It was just awful, I don't remember any scenes I could actually watch and I can't make the same mistake twice... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a hard time making movies like this when I have to watch it and wait for it to finish. I mean, I watch this one twice and then watch it over again. You know what I'm talking about when I say "bad". I mean you need a huge ego for a lot of people to take this movie. I won't go through to explain it if I don't want to but, if I'm so much like to see the movie, the worst it gets to be is bad.  The story is pretty good, but it doesn't have much action. Not very interesting either.   There is some good cinematography, but what you really got out of it is the weird look of the story and the ending of the movie. But there is nothing to make it all worth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. They get out of a real estate agent, a real agent, and a real gangster, and put the guys out in a real prison, where they do the same thing for a couple of years. If the guy is in jail for two years, what happens to him? We have all seen murderers in jail. Even the actors try to make that happen. I give it a 2 out of 10. It does not even have much of a plot or character development. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people in the media today (and it isn't me) call this a horror flick "because it doesn't have the shock factor". This is a very weak premise for a horror film. When I heard about this in the news-feed I was immediately thrown for a loop. The characters are all horrible. There's absolutely no way to make it believable that a villain (i.e. the killer who takes away the lives of people) is actually an evil vampire. The plot twists aren't in anyway believable. It isn't even a suspenseful storyline.  A horror film doesn't need shock factor because this is a typical slasher. That is fine. A horror is usually a thriller in which we expect something gruesome, but it isn% likely to have shock factor.  I would rate this as a D-S film, not a horror movie. If it is not horror it isn % should not be rated that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about an ill-informed, bitter, and revengeful Vietnam war veteran who hates the very people who helped make him a monster of a monster. I was disappointed with the movie, although I didn't care for the gore (or the gore) in it. Too old, I'd rather skip it and avoid it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand this plot. They just wanted to add something that is obviously an old film with a plot. Why? The plot was obviously not good. They wanted to go along with a "classic" film with some action, and to make a statement about the plight of the young girl. Well, I didn't get the idea. When I read the script, I understood that that the characters will have to overcome some supernatural powers, and that the movie would be better to do in this way. I am also not sure what the message is. Why the girl can control all the things she sees, or is she really that powerful.  I would love to watch this film with my 2 daughters and a couple of friends, and have my eyes shut closed while watching it so I could not escape the nausea that came after watching it. I won't make the same mistakes on another movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending is horrible. I just thought this was a really stupid ending for a movie. The first thing I was thinking about was that someone just got up with a bunch of dead people and killed them. That's just not fair.  The rest of the movie could have been better but it just made it seem more like a horror movie. Maybe if they would have put more characters in this movie like "Dr. Evil" or "Mr. Evil".  It just made me really uncomfortable. I'd like to see the sequel to "Glorious Dead" but I'm afraid of ruining my life again. I'm sorry I bought the movie because I was disappointed but I liked this movie better. I might do again if I could get it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and I have pretty much given myself the opportunity to watch them on a regular basis. This one was the worst one I've ever seen, and not to mention an incredibly awful plot. A huge number of people who actually believed what they said that this movie is about, and of course I know there's no way to tell them the truth, as they are really, to me, just plain stupid people. I was very shocked when the show ended, not only because of the awful plot, but because of how incredibly stupid it really was.  The only reason I bothered to watch it was because I thought it was funny. In fact, that was the only reason. But now my friends and I think the entire movie is just awful. And I really think it's a waste of time to waste your time on this nonsense. There are some people who think this movie could have been a satire. But I think they're just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that this is the director's vision. If it's not directed by a creative genius who knows the value of creative creativity, I'm sorry to say that the movie fails to live up to its pretensions. If I've ever heard that kind of excuse before, I'll repeat it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely stupid, it is not even funny, it shows no depth and only a few good scenes but the main characters seem like they have nothing to do with the situation... the end is stupid as well as the way it is written and filmed... If you are going to be in it you should stick in your back pocket and watch the original version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is some of the worst horror film I have seen. What happens if the whole family dies?! The actors are stupid, the settings are terrible, and the direction is awful. It's bad! But this is the only movie that I have ever seen that I can't stomach even after watching it, and I think that you should not even watch it if you like horror. This is a movie made for people who don't have the patience to even sit through it. The acting is horrible and the ending is just awful. I give it a rating of 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. It was a bad film but so did most of the other films in this genre. I'll just call it "the first terrible movie" because the title says it's a film, not a movie. It's the only one that doesn't really make it that way. It is pretty bad, but no matter what, it is not worth your time. It would be better if this movie was the first film for a movie to be based on a real-adventure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an excuse to go out into the woods for some action. No excitement and nothing really, the acting is extremely poor, but I don't know how they managed to get into the script. The plot is really bad and the supporting characters are OK. But as a whole the movie didn't really come to a point where I would like to see it, but to see the other side of the story, the one that is supposed to be the main villain is very slow and uninspiring. The ending was OK but I was disappointed not to see some sort of fight for the good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was extremely predictable. The storyline was poorly developed and the movie was very predictable. We got to the point where the movie turned into a "one girl with no boyfriend" situation. While the actors didn't do anything for the plot, it was the least interesting part of this movie.   While the plot is very simple and predictable, it does not deliver what it needs to deliver. This movie is very weak. The main plot of this film is the only plot of all the movies that were made this year. There is no suspense in this movie and the story of the movie is only two or three lines that are not even tied together.  Most of the characters are stupidly stupid. The characters are not very creative and the actors are simply terrible.  You should see this movie as a light exercise, or if you have no other movies to watch in your life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is simply awful. The acting is terrible. The plot was completely amateur, and the characters were wooden. There is no reason to watch this movie. The only redeeming quality in this film is the wonderful singing. This movie is awful. In conclusion, if you're looking for a real musical performance, I would recommend giving this movie a chance because it's a good movie, but if you want to see a bad musical performance then look at the music and music that is actually done for this movie and you will likely be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it's worth seeing the vomit. I mean, if you're expecting a story to be about a man's demise, you can't. What a piece of garbage this movie is. It has the worst dialog ever written for a movie and it sucks straight up!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really disappointing. There is really nothing that I can say about it... the only thing that I could say is that it has a stupid name, and it's not even a very good name. I was looking for the closest thing to like this film, and this was one of the two closest. This is a really poor excuse for a film. It was a real waste of money to even release this at all. I hope to find the original and release it elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad to see a movie that is so obviously not intended for theatrical, even though it's pretty good, but what can I say about it. Firstly, in the "story" that they told it, we can expect to find out exactly what the hell "Wanda" is up to. So they can't tell us what we want to see from her, and what we can't see from them.  Secondly, I have read the book (as many others have) that explains that she is so, so "wrong" that she can't "feel" the emotions that people are feeling, but they still can tell her what to do and what to avoid. The only thing that keeps getting repeated by their actors is that she says that she wants to stop doing some bad things, but in every instance she does that she's done "wrong". This is the only reason I can find to keep watching. And of course I can't help but wonder if she had an understanding of that, or why she had to feel so angry and angry in the first place.    So overall, I think this is a really bad movie. It's a bad idea, a bad storyline, a badly cast, and a bad story. It is not that bad, though, if we're going to look at the film as a whole, and it is, I'm rather inclined to think that it is OK. It just doesn't really have that much to do. So to answer this question, I'd like to read the comments that people had left about this.  I've read plenty of comments about movies:  They seem to make a lot of "thinking"... or "thought" about movies that can't be bothered with. I'm not expecting for any of them to make anything that has this kind of mind, but I think that's why people are so mad at them to even watch this. It seems to me that movies don't have as much as much imagination to create anything that will make us laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have come to think that this movie is actually the only film that is utterly bad. It's not even worth paying to watch it, but it sure is the shortest movie ever made, one reason being that it contains so few interesting material, and so many predictable scenes. The acting is flat. It is also painfully unfunny, the action sequences are slow and tiddly, and the story drags me through the whole film without any development. All in all I can't believe that this is a movie at all. I thought it was a movie based on a movie: "Mullin's Last Stand" - which I have never seen. I must confess that I never saw it before... and, for the sake of my sanity, I cannot blame this. In my opinion, this movie doesn't even make the grade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so stupid that it does not even make it to know how the producers have made the final cut. The actors seem to have been hired for their bodies and their mouths are covered in soap (like soap). I suppose that's the point. If you like a movie directed by a comedian who is a talented improviser, you do not know how to get it down. The premise is so ridiculous that you wonder how one can possibly be allowed to do this. I'm hoping that the producers and director have just not heard the criticism yet. But I guess they're not very smart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a surprise, it was a sequel. Well, it is more disappointing to say that it was made with the same crap. I'm not sure why it was even made, but the fact that it happened at all, and then to have to sit around and watch it in order to say 'what happens next.' I really don't understand why it got to air on TV. Maybe it would have been if they'd made it into a regular news broadcast or something, but it isn't. I had a couple of questions and a couple that had no real answer, but if it wasn't the kind of movie you would expect. They put a big fat woman in the story, who I can't imagine what she was, but I guess the fact she's big and scary has nothing to do with it. I'll be honest, I don't like the "big fat woman" trope. They really couldn't care to put anything that makes them so much. If this movie was made like this, it would be just another bad one of those movies where the writer/director has the nerve to put in a story. This one was just a really bad film, and not even made that way. I don are so sick of having to sit through this and see it again. There are some good bits in there, but you're paying so much money to see it. Not worth your time. I would really like to give this one 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had to read it, I'd like to put my finger on the pages and see the name of the "good" movie that I saw the other week, and to see the movie that was so many years after "the Greatness" to see how this movie could only end up being a bumble, a slap at the end of the old, and not a great idea.   First off, we mustn't blame director Victor Fleming for "the movie" being a "good movie". We have seen it many times before, so don't fault us for this being new. I can't imagine that this is the only bad movie that Victor Fleming made during his career. This movie is just bad from the beginning, as well as one of his very worst sequels. It really didn't begin well when he began to make movies. I really thought he might have added a lot to his movie if he had a good story. And he didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was very silly and the acting was extremely bad, but it could have been so much better. The plot contained some good moments but failed to deliver anything. The only redeeming factor is the gorgeous cinematography. The characters were awful, and the entire story is just a huge waste of time. Maybe a slightly better director would have made this, but they seem like a movie that's going to be about a movie about how bad a person's life was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the first Spider-Man movies, which are pretty good, but the Spider-man movies were always the weakest. So, I was interested when I saw the first two Spider-men movies in 1998.  I didn't care for any of the two characters anyway, but they were really stupid, silly, and really low-grade characters. I felt like they would just keep being stupid forever. I had also heard from a friend that the first one was an interesting, fun, and amusing character. I didn% care for the first movie, and I didn\\t care for this one. The acting is the worst thing about this movie. It is just boring, even worse than the first ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie very disappointing, it was slow, it lacked the charm that I would expect from such a film. It felt like a poorly put together piece of film. A good film should have been filmed in less time, especially one with real actors. In this case, the stars, and the director should be involved. The story line is weak, the cast is mediocre, and overall, the movie just isn't great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So much of this is a bad attempt at a sitcom. The main character is, of course, the mother, who, in an attempt to make comedy, becomes the "pamela" of her children, and who must constantly be forced to be at the center of everything to make everything worthwhile and to make the family behave. That's just stupid. There was a TV show I worked on, "Bachelorette", which had just arrived in the early 1980s and it got me interested in the subject. It is no surprise that when I watched this film it was boring, so bad did it manage to deliver. The only real highlight was the appearance of the "good" guy, as he had the appearance on a variety of other programs (including "Celebration", "The Living Dolls", etc) and he had a sort of "tourist" role in making their lives better. For whatever reason, "The Good Guy" does not deserve to be part of it's success. In fact, he was so bad that he was never made part of a major show. The jokes are pretty bad, the acting is very bad, and the story is poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is no surprise, I thought they might have put a little bit of money into the production. But it's not the film. As far as the plot goes it's bad, it's just terrible, even the plot could be an excuse for bad movie making. I've seen this one over the years, it is simply not funny, and there is no plot. I can't even think of a plot, it just makes no sense. They tried so hard to make a joke, it really ruined the movie. I would rather not even think this was a joke and I could care less if I saw it, but this film is such bad, I couldn't even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been disappointed for years that i have sat through this film. I finally found this film so disappointing it was so difficult for me to even finish it. I couldn't believe a director could have so completely misinformed his audience, it was just too dumb. I'm ashamed to admit that the film was not even made to be as dumb as this movie. Some of the characters in this film were so stupid that they made no sense whatsoever, this was a truly painful film to watch. It was completely illogical to see how this film was made. Not even the most talented director has been able to make a film this bad. I had some time to think of watching it again and was very disappointed when I found that it was no more than half of what I expected it to be.  I gave this film 5/10 and I will never do anything with a movie that this poor director had in common with this film... but now, I am a little better and will hopefully watch this movie again. Please, please, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film features so many "jeanie" clichés, such as a black, white, blue, white and green guy, but it doesn't matter how good you look on camera.  The film is absolutely terrible. The dialog is awful. It's so bad that we just cannot believe it could be made. This film is just the worst thing ever filmed! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the movie this is portrayed as a 'joggy' character who is being pursued by a villain named 'Gustal' (Mukio Pihana). The story involves a group of men who decide to break the grip of the evil and evil woman on a mountain. The characters have an incredibly ridiculous plot. They find a cave and a woman who falls into it and what happens next is that she kills the man who is in charge of the group and she proceeds to kill his friend. It does not get better until the man realizes that he will be killed and dies in his final moments.   This plot was nothing but awful, especially if you're a fan of this type of movies. If this is supposed to be based on a real movie, then there must be some thought or effort given to create a storyline and keep things interesting. Sadly it does not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie does not have the same level of special effects as found in the earlier versions of this movie. The special effects that made this movie, were only slightly reminiscent of what is usually in these type of films. The story of the "junk-robots" and the main antagonist in the film had an unbelievable ending. That was far too bad to believe. If it weren't so bad, this film could have been an action film like "Planet of the Robo-Robots". The idea of the robot would have had more depth than this one.  I was really looking forward to "The Incredible Adventures of Gobba". This movie was only marginally enjoyable, as the characters were completely wooden. This movie is no good for children, unless you want a cartoon to entertain.  The only saving feature of this film was a soundtrack, which was quite good. Unfortunately, the ending of this "movie" has a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You're gonna love the sequel of this movie, because it's exactly what a sequel is. As much as you can ever want, you're gonna be disappointed. There is no payoff for the original, and nothing new. I mean, "The Goodies" is a comedy movie, not a comedy. It's so terrible, I'm scared to death to watch this one again.   This movie has two main problems: one, the writer is pretty lame. He tries to make fun out of the original storyline, which obviously has no bearing whatsoever, and is too often mistaken for what is supposed to be funny. In the original the main character is a "smart, sarcastic, and brave" young man. But the way he's portrayed in the sequel is the opposite of that. He is lazy and incapable of having an intelligent reaction. He has a large brain with no nerve to the humor he is subjected to. He's not going to change. He will never learn anything from his friend and his wife, and will do nothing to help save his life. He doesn't care about anything other than his father. He can be a little better than a dull loser.  He also has to be a really dumb man because of the lack of any humor he provides. He lacks a lot of real intelligence. He'll get away with a lot, but you won't see him as intelligent. He does have a nice, but pointless sense of humor, and can easily be forgiven. His stupidity is so frequent, you'd think he's a man who has nothing more to do.  Two other problems: the plot is too contrived and is way too predictable.  The third problem is the supporting cast is extremely weak. They are so, well, so totally uninteresting.  This is an extremely bad movie, but not even worth your time. It is a horrible waste of a film. If you want a comedy, this is it. Avoid it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a weird setup in which every moment a camera was going to be moving to an extremely specific camera frame in a completely strange way and in that frame it was acting as if the audience wasn't watching the actual movie.  The ending of the film was ridiculous and totally ridiculous and the only thing that made this movie so ridiculous was the fact that one of the two lead actors was a big time travel photographer. The other main actors were big time travelers, some of whom had never even been to the country they were supposed to travel to. The plot was terrible and I had a tough time watching it but the acting was pretty good and the special effects (which were really quite bad) were OK.    Overall, I'm going to just go along with this for another reason, because I have read some of the comments on the IMDb page of the movie and there was a good discussion about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Movie" is a big joke on the death of a cartoon character. When the real world is not exactly what you think it is it really just a big, stupid, stupid movie made for kids, I can say that I'm sick to say this.  I would even dare to say that this movie is the worst of all of the worst movies. It is a bad case of bad movies I've seen. And the plot is really, really stupid and not even remotely interesting! Even if you are a big fan of the cartoon characters, you can still get better than this movie. The dialog is terrible, the acting is terrible and the story is just horrible.  If you can see this movie and say, 'oh yeah, I'll see it again' you will just be disappointed and you will wonder what your parents were thinking when they picked this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film stars a young girl who is desperate to find her father, but only she really knows the real dad. We watch his story, but at the same time, we are told what we really want to see. I'm sure you'll find the "story" very interesting, but the real question here is the movie's outcome. The end of the movie is predictable and painful, and we just want to go on with the real story. If that happens, we can skip to the beginning and see the real ending. The idea is that it's going to make you cry, so if you decide to watch this, don't do it. I didn't, and I know what I would have done with it if I hadn't. The film is a failure, not to watch, and a shame in your eyes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie had an end, there would have been a decent ending. This plot does nothing but try to make a joke out of every single thing it ever got its hands on. When the movie was first released, I was baffled by how badly it needed to be made. It didn't have to be done so badly, as the director did for several years. The script was weak. And the script was predictable. Even if you loved the movie, you would be sick to watch it. And it was very dumb. The acting wasn't even great. The supporting cast was lousy. The plot and the story were not interesting. The story lacked suspense. The movie is so bad, I didn't even stick around to find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen other movies but this was one of the worst ones I've seen. The first thing I thought when I heard the word 'Nah' on the title was 'Noah'. And when I saw this movie I was convinced that it was a film. I'm not really a fan of this movie (I would like it to have some action and a little humor) but it doesn't have any action or humor at all. You have to watch the first few minutes to understand the whole story but it does nothing for you. After the first hour you wonder what the rest of it is. I had a lot of fun watching this but I think it's just a 'naked animal' that was put on board. The ending is horrible and the plot is weak. It's just unbelievable that a man who was so handsome and so famous to many of the people watching the film would ever do anything like this. I wish I knew what happened to Nick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Star Trek" was very good if it was actually made. This movie was one of the worst movies of all time. The fact that this movie was a sequel of "Star Wars" means that it lacks the original story and doesn't have the original special effects. The characters are very poor, and there are no new characters. What was this movie: a sequel to "Star-Knight" or an expansion of "star-knights"? No, the fact that it was made a sequel does mean that it actually is an expansion, not an actual sequel.  What the hell is this movie? A guy named Ben Harrison and his wife (the real Harrison) are fighting to save Ben's ass. What does they do? They make sure they get the alien symbionary (and Ben's wife) on the ship, and that Ben is saved by them. How do we know they are Ben Harrison, and what is it that Ben Harrison will do to save the ship and Earth's existence?  Who would expect Ben Harrison to do something on his own and save the Earth's destiny by using his ship to save Earth's fate? He does nothing but a couple of women who look to him as their savior but have not worked out his plans before. There are no mention of the events which occurred on the "StarKnight" show. No mention of "Kelso", the mother of the planet and Ben's son. How does Ben Harrison know all his plans and intentions before he is set to go to Earth? How does he know he's going to stay there, and not to get away from the planet?  There are a lot of weak special effects which are good when used to depict the characters, but the special effects are horrible when compared to the actual sets and sets. The only redeeming factor of this movie is the story and it isn't that story.   As for the movie itself, the characters are fine and there aren't too many boring-to-watch characters. There is only one woman (the mother of Ben Harrison's ship) that seems to be a character of interest in the movie. The rest of the characters do nothing to make you care about their plot either. What is the value of this film? I can't believe that this was made for anyone who is in search for a movie to own, unless it was for some other reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a huge waste of plot and entertainment (which would normally have made this movie a "top" film, i.e. a top contender), but, instead of focusing on the good and bad aspects of the movie, it only showed you the bad. The plot was predictable, the acting was terrible and the humor was extremely weak. It's not an insult to the actors, because there are far better films in this world, so it's really hard to make the "wrong" movie. It is the same as the "B" film where "B", was just the "right" person (in a nutshell, a black-white person) who was able to save a little bit of money, so what was the wrong guy in that movie? Probably he was in an extremely dysfunctional family (a lot of women who don't have the capability to care for their children), and the movie was about his inability to connect with the rest of his family and his inability of maintaining relationships with them. It wasn't even about how the right person (the "B") ended up being successful and in the end, it was about a failed attempt at self-improvement. It has nothing but a bunch of empty lines and stupid humor. It makes no sense to watch this film with someone like me. I don't remember who I saw on the "The B" DVD, and if I had to choose one, I wouldn't even watch this movie again. I just give you the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie because of its lack of substance and the lack of any substance for a movie. The film was so bad, even I didn`t think I could pull it out. Not only that, but I was not impressed at all. This film was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this on PBS when I happened on. When it aired, I had to go to watch it. After a day or so, I realized that it was a piece of trash. I'm glad that there was a documentary about a documentary. However, I can see that it is not actually a documentary but rather a porn movie that relies on some basic assumptions such as the premise (which obviously is a key assumption) that the "clue" is from a true story of a true life tragedy (that's the tragedy).  The story is extremely flawed in a few parts. It's not true. And it's not real either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had really disappointing plot and bad directing. In the end, the two protagonists were just so bad that the other characters in this film had better things to do. However, the acting was surprisingly good. I was very disappointed in this movie, I only have 2 cents about it being worth watching, but the reason why I still wanted to see it is because my rating was so bad it really was about a comedy. I'd give this movie a 10 if it wasn't so bad. I gave it 10 out of 10 and I think I would prefer watching a comedy to see more funny comedic material. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film the morning after Christmas. It came on in the most annoying way possible: as a "movie about the story of the Titanic" (a ridiculous premise!). The movie seemed more scripted than the plot itself. The plot is based on the actual events, not actual narration; but rather a fictional story about the events, and there wasn't even any "new" information. Most people had no idea what would happen during the movie. I had to find a way to get rid of the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i'm gonna watch this movie because it has no redeeming redeeming in any way (other than a title), a ridiculous plot, the fact that a movie is set in an actual world, and the fact the actors are actually in their roles, and this is the only movie that i have ever seen, and it's not even a good one (i've never seen any that compares to this). I have never heard anything like this. I just can't imagine anything more disappointing than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people say that I'm an old boy, and it isn't true because I have seen all of this video, and I'm not as old as anyone else, so it's OK for you to see it. However, if you are an old girl, you will see that all of the things in this video are pretty disgusting. There's no reason for such a stupid video to be made, and if they were made by a mad young girl with no sense of dignity, the whole thing would be a complete and utter waste of time, and they would be embarrassed of having their reputation destroyed. I'll tell you all about it, and just say that if you see this movie, don't even watch it, because you'll never get to laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, if you want to see something like this you will, well, you can. It's called "Possum", which is really only the name of a film (the name of the director is "Pomisius", who apparently also had a "Possession" role in this film).  If you enjoy the pretense of being a "supernatural" movie that comes from a Hollywood that didn't even bother to make itself credible, you'll just watch the movie as a carjacking and an attempt to take advantage of this plot, instead of actually producing something like a "Supernatural" story. You'll be the one who dies in the end and thinks that you died in a car, and you won't even think of having fun and life as a human being. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a huge fan of James Joyce and don't want to waste any time or even let him see a movie. But this movie is awful, I just can't stand it. I gave this movie 2 stars because of the plot. But it wasn't good enough. The acting was OK in the beginning, but it's really bad throughout. I'd have even thought that it would be better if the acting was great all the way. In the end, the director had nothing to do with the characters and nothing to express. The plot had no idea what to do and no idea why. I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time we saw the cast of "Sisters" (and, this is just a guess, because my personal memory of that is the only memory I can remember) was in a small room in a very dark basement. The only actors who were there were Richard C. Reilly and the director. Not only did the cast do badly, but even if they had the good name to carry this film to the end, the result is very bad. The acting was good for Reilly but bad for the rest. There are two major flaws, which I don't know if they can or will be fixed. First, the characters were too stiff to be convincingly portrayed. There was one scene where Reilly did a line to a bad actor for the sake of an "I'm sorry, I couldn't believe I'm making up all the scenes!" in a scene where I did the same thing. Secondly, the scenes were very weak. I never even had the feeling like they were making up a story. It was just a collection of clunkiness and waste. I don'n even remember this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you thought that I'm a dumb guy, then read my review about "Harshon" starring Timothy Aversky.  I'll be glad to hear of a movie: it's the sequel to "Hush". It is a story that requires some background information and nothing to do. While the original 'Hush' was good, it just didn't work. There was no real story. While you're in the movie, you're left wondering how you can possibly solve it. The director just tells you that it is a simple case of 'killing' as in the original. So, if you're going to be involved in an arms-thall battle, and the main character(not the guy named Timothy Avercius) is killed by some terrorist and his brother (who didn't die in 'Harshons'), you're wondering why there is no plot. A simple case: you should never hire an actor unless you're good at directing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the whole movies from a very, very late age. The only thing I can say is that this one is very, a very old one. I found this bad but at the same time I think that it is a bad remake of some, I mean, one, or any other movies I have never seen or even seen before.  This movie is about some weird guy getting drunk and thinking of raping a woman while she is getting into the kitchen of his house. The woman, of course, is an incredibly good girl who has always done her job, but there is no substance in her, it does not even make any real sense at all.  Then she finally gets in, and he tries to force her into bed, which is of course not an advisable method, but unfortunately for him she decides to try it anyway, and the guy wakes her up, and then does whatever he wants.  I mean we see some, you know, sexual situations, but it never really goes to the point that they can get to a decent conclusion, because, unfortunately this movie is not one of them. The movie just lacks substance, and I can only say that it can only get there through some extremely stupid twists and turns. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read a positive review about "Gina" that stated it was well-written, original, and witty. However, the movie is nothing but a horrible waste of time on a stupid premise. I found it a little difficult to swallow, as it was overstuffed with dumb clichés. I have never felt the least sympathy for these people. I did not get what they deserved. If they're so mad they get so desperate to make a movie, they don't want anyone to make it. If you're truly crazy about something like this, you should see this film as an insult to your brain.  I won't even call this movie a "comedy", because it isn't a comedy at all. There are no laughs, and even the most daring attempts at humor are so weak they are laughable. There is not enough actual movie talent to make this movie, and the actors do not make it worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to say it twice:  "Bad! Bad! Bad!" And I say, the movie was bad! Bad!, bad!, bad! bad! BAD! BAD!" Bad, bad!, BAD!, bad!. BAD! bad!. bad! It wasn't even a good movie. The story was interesting but the performances were terrible, the acting was bad and the cinematography was bad. A lot of plot points were missed. Some of the dialogs were not even directed, the characters were uninteresting, some scenes were not presented at all and the dialog was a bit irritating. And the ending, I felt was just a lousy, bad ending.  If you like this bad movie, please don't watch it. It is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies which really got away with the ridiculous "story" concept. I don't want to see movies based on the original Star Wars, which are just so bad but this isn't one of the movies that had it right. The plot of the movie is about an alien spaceship crashing into a planet to destroy the whole planet.  This movie is obviously not the greatest example of a bad action movie but the other films I can't say that they're actually great but I find it hard to fault.  I give this movie 2 out of 10, but I'll stick with that one for the sake of the fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even an honest film: it's bad and stupid; stupid and boring. If you want to see anything that you can see in other than movies and TV, you won't get it. This movie is full of nothing except an old girl with a bad name for the girl's real name. The real girl should be the only girl's name that you would see in this movie. It's better to leave this movie alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a woman who can not get into a relationship with a woman in a relationship like they do in the movie I am in despair. How the director got this in is not what it is worth. It was bad. How this movie was made in a good way is what I expected from a female-themed film. I am not going to say too much, but, if you want to see it, you should avoid it and avoid the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is simply awful. A big dumb TV show about a teen, one thing we can't avoid is the sickeningly sentimental concept of love, lust and sex, with a twist, that's about sex with a vampire. The two women, the "good guys" and the "evil" are so ridiculously simplistic that I don't think they are capable of making a story, but they are very good actors, but it's obvious that they can't get past that as the title, "the Vampire's Curse". I can't find any plot details whatsoever, but I'm pretty certain that the "bloodsuckers" are the ones being used for their "evil", and I can easily tell who the "Bloodsuckets" are. I can even picture this in a bathroom, where they've killed the vampire's so that they would be taken into a hospital where the police find their body. That's not enough to make me feel sorry for this film, at least not when I have a sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I think that the majority of those who have never seen or read anything else about this movie will hate the movie. Even the most hardcore fans of this film would turn it off after watching it. Not sure what it was they had hoped for, but there's a lot of the people that don't know how much it is really like. I'm glad that it didn't get that much. I guess there were some fans who even knew that it was a really interesting piece of material, but I don't understand why they were so sure. It's just another example of that annoying, uninteresting plot. I was surprised that there wasn't many reviews, but in that case I don% who even cares. I can't blame them for having the idea, but just like I don all of the fans in this movie. Maybe if the movie was made on a DVD, perhaps you might have some ideas about how to make it better.   I was so angry when the movie ended. Why all those horrible things were shown. This was the only movie that was disappointing. The plot, the acting and the acting were all the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect much from this movie. I thought there would be some kind of plot or two that would be interesting. Instead, I just got bored. The director was like someone that you might find in a video store. The plot was boring, the direction had no idea about what we should be doing in this movie, and the dialogue was really bad. I'd like to see a better movie, like "Trouble in Town", for example. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main plot was pretty good. But the movie wasn't that much good. There wasn't much of interest in the characters and the way the scenes were directed made me nervous. The ending was slow and awkward. I was expecting the ending would be more interesting and interesting. It was just the most disappointing film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the fact that there is no story, it becomes apparent that Mr. Liefberg is the only person that matters here. He does not need to have been the biggest or the boldest man who has ever walked off a screen. He can not have that reputation due to the fact he is just one man who knows that his only job is to try to avoid being caught. The only person who can possibly overcome Lief's antics and lack of ability is the late great film maker, Nicholas Cage. This movie can only be viewed as a disaster to Cage. He plays his role extremely badly. The story is just plain bad. It is about a little boy who, in a school with no real purpose, has been taken into a world where he is being fed by Mr. "Liefberg". In this world he has a big ego with a big fake identity, it is difficult to imagine what he will do with this. This is a movie with just about 20 minutes of real acting and that would be enough to ruin it. The plot is very weak and badly made. The real story is interesting but there is absolutely no real reason why it exists. It has more twists than a little movie. The scenes and dialog are too simple to make the brain work interesting. It tries to create a fictional world where there are no characters. It does nothing for the characters in this movie.  The plot goes on and on. This could be a decent movie if Liefian could do it right. I would give it 8/10. But this movie does nothing but try to bury its head in a piece of wood and make a few bucks. Cage is his usual bad-actor character but is better than Lief. I am not going to mention this as a negative movie. Just a bad attempt at a comedy that should not have been a comedy but could be interesting if Lieveberg had it right for all the reasons it does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have ever seen. The plot, the photography is horrible, the acting is awful, the direction is bad. The best part is the ending. It is only a joke when I laugh and laugh at it. The most disappointing part is how it could have so easily and cheaply be turned into a film: "The Girl in the Sea". The only reason I have seen this is because the producers were so incredibly naive and stupid that it was irresistible for me to see it as a movie. But this is all too disappointing to me. I really hope they will realize this and do better than this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film at a movie theater in Chicago and it made absolutely no sense. I was afraid my life would be ruined by it. I did not even pay money to rent it and just rented it anyway. If you can find it in the Chicago area and it is not in any movie theater, don't even rent it. It is a horrible waste of money and your money is wasted on this movie. I give it two points because of the horrible acting and the horrible story line. I just wish that this movie was the worst movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, despite being praised by many critics, is a pretty bad movie and not even worth watching. It is full of mindless drama and little of interest. This movie was not even a documentary like that one in "The Wild, the Wild Wild". While I have seen it on the TV it doesn't seem to be too interesting. A few lines of dialog and nothing new are presented at all. It's just a movie with lots of boring dialogue and lots of action without much thought. The characters are in really poor situations. Even the actors don't do much except for the scenes when it is possible to act. The story is predictable and the camera are not too good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, so I thought it was a good show because it was supposed to be a comedy. The other problem was that I don't care for it. It wasn't that bad, like those shows like Family Knows How Things Turn Out of the Way of the Devil, The Big Five, or The Celebrity Sleeper. I'm not ashamed of that. But I guess they just felt like they were two men and they wanted to make the joke to go deeper into a very stupid situation. I don`t remember if they knew how to do it.   Now I'm looking at this on the back of my hands. The idea of a man who's in a hospital for a couple of years gets stabbed and killed. He's a pretty big guy and you can see him at a memorial every day. The reason the man is put into a coma is because he sees a picture on his wall. I think it was meant to be funny, but it got stupid. It seems like they didn't care enough about making the story. In fact, they were just pretending to make it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the actors were great in the role, but this is the first movie I've seen in my history where I was not interested enough to go to the theater for an actual movie. What a dork. I had to wait for the movie to start because the book was about to be published. If there is a good, insightful plot, the book would have been worth the time. I am afraid of what's coming next. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was very disappointing. The first few minutes of the movie were very exciting and the opening scene was absolutely horrible. The whole movie was a waste of time.  It was so bad, I thought to myself "Why is it being made?" I thought, "I don't understand. It's got to be a good movie?"   I would really like to see this movie made because I never liked it. It doesn't make any sense. I would expect the whole of it to be done well. What it seems to be is that it's a waste, and that it wasn't even worth watching. I'm sorry but I won't be picking up the DVD and watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, it's actually a worse movie than the movie "Saving Hope". This is a movie of a girl who gets caught in a car wreck and she thinks she's in a big conspiracy (she's the little girl who kills herself). Then there's a scene where it's clear the person who killed her is in a conspiracy.  The girl is obviously a psychopath, i mean she's obviously a mental person that has never shown any empathy, i don't care if she had to get killed on accident.  Then there are scenes where the person in the car does something and then it's a shock when there are no shots, i'm sure. It's also horrible that in one of the scenes that there is a car that pulls in and there is some kind of thing happening, it looks like there is an air tank. But there's also a thing, I know the thing, that you can see where this car was parked, it would be hard to imagine if it happened to someone on a road. Maybe it was around a road, i never knew. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a cheap, pointless movie with some questionable acting and a couple of questionable acting.  I have a friend with some of my friends who was one of the few people in town to see it, and he didn't have a good time. They were the type who just watched the movie and then waited for the movie to get going. They kept trying to find an excuse to go see it because the movie was so bad, but in my opinion, this movie is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "B" is the only movie that has been truly bad.  Not only does this movie try to be funny and it's obvious that the actors are poor. In fact, there is nothing funny. The dialog isn't interesting enough.  It's difficult to sit through a whole movie, especially one where the cast is weak.  But this is just the way I thought to call this movie. It doesn't have to be bad. In terms of the subject matter and acting, it was a success. But the plot was too weak and lacked a real point.  The plot was so bad I could almost watch this movie without a DVD, so I put it in my DVD collection. I wish it were that simple. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can't tell the difference between a bad film and a movie that just happened to be made, you can do without "B"s.  This movie isn't even decent enough to be considered a film. I mean, if you've got to, you've gotta watch "The Way of Life" because it's the best one.  But, the good ones are more interesting than the bad ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very pleased with my good wife, but this one is pretty bad. The first thing that made me angry was the fact that it couldn't hold any more than 8 or 10 minutes. You're really like a guy who thinks that he's got it. But it doesn't have to make the whole thing clear. There are some funny moments, but they don't make much sense. For example, when he wants to find something in a small village, he takes a long time to look for it. I don't know if he was looking for a horse, but he doesn't do anything that isn't even funny. This movie has all the worst qualities of an 80-year old man and an absolutely ridiculous wife. I think the best thing I can say about this movie is that it might not be in your top 10. The funny thing was that the director had so little talent and made such a mess that he couldn't even make a cameo in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really want to give this film away, but I just want to talk about it so I could make it out of a bad film:  This movie is awful, it's not a comedy, but a very stupid movie.  The first thing is that it is not funny. A lot of people can't get into it because it's so incredibly terrible and stupid. A movie in which the director is not that funny but tries to make you like it more. The second thing is the fact that you have no feeling for it, that the jokes are not funny, that people are not enjoying it like you do. The third thing is in that it tries to recreate a bad genre that doesn't exist. The fourth thing is this is extremely weak to anyone but you can't sit through it. It is a horrible movie and the only redeeming feature is that there are a few funny jokes.   So I give this movie two out of ten points, I'm not sure if they tried to make something funny out of something that is completely unrelated to its story. I'm pretty sure that the director has just spent his time making an extremely bad movie and he's got no more idea how to make a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few comments on a bad film:  A film which is so terrible, i will never believe in a Hollywood film. this is probably the worst film i ever seen. it contains a lot of clichés like "My brother was in the army, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person who had the same doubts as I did. This movie just reminded me of what I see as an adult, and that was the worst part of it. It was about the "clicorms of sleep" and the need to be "crippled" as a human. I'm an adult now, and I can't believe they knew this in the 60's. This was the least interesting part. It seemed like a movie in the 90's. I felt like it was in no condition to entertain me. It made me feel like I had been sucked into it, like I was a cartoon character. There was no story, or plot. I never understood the characters, or what they could do to make me like them. I thought they were all the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After seeing the trailers, I am convinced that this is a very bad movie, but I did enjoy it. In fact, it wasn't so bad that I couldn't give this movie a rating. What's really wrong about this movie? Well, it's a very predictable plot, especially the villain (I thought he should have gone on an adventure rather than being a man.) It also lacks a lot of action and is very wooden. I felt that the movie was so weak that I didn't want to stick with it. Not only did it have too much padding (which was more the problem than the plot) but also was not very good. I thought the actors made too many mistakes. The best movie I've seen in all my memory, "Nipodak" was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that is so bad that you wonder why I bothered to watch it! I'm surprised to find the same people watching the other movies that I'm sure is not the case. I think the premise of the film that the characters are trapped in a bunker that is the source of their escape is ridiculous. I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this. I know what I had to watch and don't blame them for it. I'm so sad to see these films as something that only a handful of people actually watch and only those who are a little bit clever with a computer game can find entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was obviously made to make a mockery of the "The Man With The Fins" series... which is really a lot of films you see in the UK these days. The film is a complete failure at all times... The "The Fins", which was so far out of all situations with any interesting story, plots, etc, has simply become "The Family", with predictable dialog, characters, and acting by people who don't know the show well, but have somehow made it work.  The story is stupid and pointless... the story line is pretty good - it's true that this is the first (one of the) series of US made British FINS movies, and there's only 2 out of 10 of them to compare!  The film was filmed with a number of amateur actors who supposedly worked so hard on the sets, but what a crap film this is. If you see this film you'll wonder why they agreed to work for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I would give this movie a 8 out of 10. It's just not good, not interesting. And I agree with the premise in every aspect. It is not an intelligent thriller. It has nothing to do with any genre of film, not even a mystery. And it lacks the complexity and originality to make it a great thriller. I'm sure that its producers, the director and the actress know what they're doing. They're just a bunch of guys on a video production company that are trying to make a low budget movie. And this movie just lacks the energy to make me jump into it. The movie is just like another bad movie that came out with no dialog, no plot, and no story. But then, there's some action to make up for those poor, poor, sad, people. But I guess that's not the worst thing about this movie. They have plenty of talent, but they just don't seem to be that creative. They need to get a little more creative. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie in which every female is a slut, the main protagonist (I think the main character) has a sexy girlfriend and tries to get her to meet him, but it only works so well as a sitcom. It's horrible. Why are there no other female in the movie? There are only male prostitutes, and they are a lot more sexist than usual. There are some other women who have more serious relationships with their boyfriends than the main characters. I can't even make this stuff up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most painful of all of movies to watch, ever, and to keep watching. It's not about the quality of acting, or the director, it's about the direction. It is about a film that takes away the ability to create stories. I have seen it ten minutes ago and thought, if I could really find my thoughts on the film, I would cry.  The acting is the worst part of it. This film has so many bizarre things and bad special effects, I felt like watching a film with a pretentious storyline and without any feeling. The acting was horrible, I just felt disgusted by it. There was no feeling or chemistry and the scenes just seemed stupid. I'm really not sure if the director intended to make this movie, but it's sad that someone would spend $250 million dollars to make it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not quite the best of the new wave of independent, self-promoted comedy films of the last decade. But I was hoping to find a decent comedy that could help me laugh. I didn't succeed. Forgive me, there are many movies that do it better than that. But this one doesn't.  I have some sympathy for the producers who are working, and also some sympathy to the fans who have no idea what their films are like. But the only reason this movie got green light was because it was filmed in a studio, in a place I know, the one that is in the right place to make it.  The whole thing is simply bad, and there is no sense of a good reason why it gets made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no good films: films like this just do not succeed in a realistic way. But in its most recent production, a documentary made by a filmmaker named, William J. HALKMAN, has a certain message to the American youth. If one of your parents would like to spend time reading this book, let them do so. Avoid this. This film does not take into account the fact that this documentary did not succeed with the other films of its making. The end results are very poor. It is only a half hour or less worth watching. If your looking for a good film, you might consider buying one of those films from HBO or Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a waste of the hype in terms of the genre, which has so many films to keep us busy at home. A poor plot, the acting and camera work put this film at a ten, I think, even an Oscar winner would have been embarrassed. The "feel" was a lot like the film of "Gattlin's Gold". The film was obviously so much empty (i.e. boring, i.e., a horrible film!) - a predictable script, nothing interesting, no depth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I was very impressed with the premise, in that it was the best piece of cinema to my knowledge, but the actual ending (if it's called a movie, I would like to think of it) proved to be extremely disappointing. The plot really only happened to the main characters and their families, with the rest happening to the local policeman, a little girl, a mother, a grandfather, and another person whose face is black but has red hair. Oh, and a guy who can see the face of the kid's father...  Oh, did you see the end?! No, you couldn't see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst things I have ever seen in film, and it's not surprising that it is considered by the highest standards as one of, if not the worst movie EVER! I don't care. The plot is pretty good but the pacing was very bad. The acting is so bad that I cannot see it again. It could have been better made a movie. But it isn't. What happens after the war is not the story of the war, it's a bunch of mad, mad people trying to catch an unsuspecting man who has been hiding in the bushes. They bring him back to their hide to kill him. So, it would be interesting to see a true story of war between these people and how these people react to the changing of the situation. But, that's not the case. Why do we need to find out this story? This movie is not about the war itself, it is about something else, and so we cannot even talk about it. The story is about a man who wants to be killed by a maniac in a jungle. That is OK, but I'm not kidding. That's not a good movie. Why is the story such? It's not like Hitler, is it about a crazy man who is trying to bring back his dead body so he can be put into a coffin and he dies from the infection. It's about something interesting. It was OK, OK, I guess. But why would that be the main plot of the movie? I have never watched this movie with any expectations. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to find any good things about this film, try to find an interesting one:  I didn't get the chance to meet Mr. Makhleh from Tehran. That would have been the most interesting piece of film i saw in the entire history of the film: it would have made some kind of plot and dialogue, but no one would have said anything.   This film is a complete failure for any serious film: if you have been a loyal fan of this film for years and even if you didn't find any flaws, you would be bored and disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that this movie was too silly to make me laugh. After viewing the whole movie and I laughed so hard I had to close my eyes. The scenes made me sick and sad. If you have a stomach with some serious film-making skills and are willing to spend some time watching this movie, then you might enjoy watching these parts but they just weren't to make you laugh.  I am sure there are some funny moments but unfortunately this movie could only be considered a B.D.M. movie. The rest of this movie is only marginally amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is bad. It is a total rip off of a bad TV show. But I have noticed that when I was a child I thought that I knew that this was one of those old TV shows that were the original ones and not even the "stars", or the "pups" which are now known. I still like these shows and even thought back then that the show was a "real movie" with good sets, costumes and acting (especially by the original stars) but I was wrong about that! This is simply not good. My main reason for this: the acting is awful and the only good parts are the story and the action scenes with the kids. I don't know how the actors can act, but they do very good in one scene. It's very disappointing that this film is so horrible and that it is not even a "star" movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first movie that I saw from my husband and then our marriage. We had nothing to watch except the first DVD when I was married and even now it seems we are not able to rent it. The movie consists of a poorly written story and bad acting. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It was a little annoying to see my husband being played by Michael Cimbe. He didn't even have a line about his wife's dog. He tried to act like he was in a rock band with Cimmezzine and was very convincing. The only good things that came from the movie were the ending, Michael Ciment's line, and the idea that it was about a rock star. That just seems unbelievable to me.  If you really love rock music, this movie is a complete waste. I rented it and not one of my friends watched it, unless it was my husband's cousin and I liked him. It will turn out that the first CD of this movie will come back on my computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about two young boys whose parents are so stupid that they believe they will have to save their lives by fighting off a gang of monsters, who really think they have a reason to live. But, as soon as the boys reach the real killer, they're too stupid to listen any instructions from their parents. They're not good at making decisions. They keep asking their mom who to kill first.  I mean, at this point in the film you would expect to find one of these kids, but instead you have to watch two of them for one reason.    The best part of the movie is in the ending. I wish it was there when it was supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first episode of "The Unusual" I began to wonder if there was something in it to make it work.  There is, unfortunately, no connection between the series and "The Natural" that would make either one a complete, or even a complete package.  I have watched these two shows several times and while the two are completely different, the stories themselves are remarkably similar. This is unfortunate, because both show are weak, unsatisfactory and utterly disappointing.  In "The Wild" it is easy to see that "The Great Outdoors" is so much better. They just have more story and more action. In "Unusual" there is no story but they had it first. They had nothing to do with the first one and the second one had nothing, and I would only consider that one as a story of the real world.  This is also true for the movie: it had nothing that made this series a complete or even package. It could be so easily made that it would never be a complete story. It does not even make a connection with "The Big Fish" and it can't be considered to be one of "natural" shows. They are both completely unrelated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply a poor excuse to the story of a true and true crime thriller. While most movies try to capture the "experience" of a real crime scene, the story itself isn't there. There's no "experiences" to connect with the movie's protagonist. We see nothing of the person who has killed the man. We learn nothing of a murderer's crimes nor his character, neither his motivations nor any relationship to his victims. There is no way to bring the audience to the "story" and let them "experiment" with the "plot". It's not a horror movie, but it just is a bad, ugly, bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no "spots" here. No real people and one weird woman is playing a lesbian. But there are three actors in this movie that were barely noticed. A lot of money can be made on such a movie, and the plot is obviously very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was good but unfortunately the acting was a bit weak, the story didn't quite fit and the whole thing was just a waste of money to me. The premise is really bad. The plot is really not believable. The story could be interesting if the whole situation was based in a small town. The movie has a few redeeming elements. It has a good plot, but really that's just too boring and not believable to me! I can't believe that it got made. The acting was OK, but the story was poorly done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was terrible. I mean, if there's a film that has to be called "cute" or "smut" then I'm not sure it qualifies. Not sure what made "Brundel" so funny but if they wanted to make a comedy film for kids then they would be so much better for them to make an entire "comedy" film with a single storyline. I have to agree that in most respects this was better for "B" and should have done the same film with "B". There was no real reason to make this film (it seemed to be a waste of time) in comparison to anything else in the world. This film has nothing about real life. It doesn't even have a story. It's just a bunch of people. It just a depressing look at the idea of making a comedy about people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is somewhat true, but I won't even let the viewer out of the loop. The ending is so far removed from anything, that I'm worried they could've thrown the plot away. I don't know what the author intended to accomplish with a rape scene. I understand that the scene is meant to build a strong character, and it makes sense, but what did the writer do with this rape scene? Why was it a rape scenario? There was some sort of story to it, but why did they put a rapist in a situation that is not about to be seen? I'm not exactly sure. I do not blame the author for the title, but it could've gone a lot farther. The characters in the film are just some of the characters we had seen throughout the rest of the movie. Why they had to go through the rest like a scene of violence? It just seems like everything else was put in the movie, instead of a story. If this movie is a collection of scenes, it's good, but that doesn't seem to be the case. It also seems very odd that all of the main characters from the movie can sleep through it, especially the rapist, even though she is supposed to be just a rape victim. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are more than a few times when I would like to say, "You know it's a really interesting movie. But this film was horrible."  There's something about every movie that just doesn't matter. This is an example.  The most important thing in a movie: it should be made interesting. Not funny, not dumb. If your movie sucks then you might as well as be bored.  I have to tell you, this movie isn't the movie I expected. A lot of people who are fans of movies are so dumb that they overlook this one because they're afraid it will be a bad one. I want to stop watching movies and get rid of this idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that made me lose faith in humanity. The scenes are extremely stupid. Some scenes are really painful. In the end I had to pause for a moment to see what they were, and they were all really gruesome. It was very disappointing. A lot of acting was pretty good, but the acting was bad, the characters were terrible, and the plot was poor. I don't know if any actors from Hollywood could pull this off, but if you like to see bad movies, you will most likely enjoy it a lot less than you would like to have this one.  If you want to see a good movie: read a good story: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a bunch of pretentious films that were made in the 1990s when most people believed that they were movies made to reflect reality, not to be dumb, not anything so pretentious. It's full of dumb things and just not very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people on this movie like the premise that the actors should be involved in this movie, but the result is a movie that really sucks. We have seen it a hundred times before, and I have never liked it. This movie is simply lame and disgusting, except for one moment where you can recognize the actors and see them at different places and watch the same thing, but that is just a small part of it. There is absolutely no suspense in this film, unless you think that the acting is actually interesting. It's just boring. There are so many glaring problems in this, and the movie is not only boring, but it's horrible to see this boring movie. If you are looking for entertainment, do not buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is horrible, as most of their films are... This is not even close to the awfulness that I have seen most recently. Although I'm sure the writer knew it would make this film a far worse than the typical slasher flick, I still don't think that this film was meant to be a slasher film. It is not. In fact, I think the film is probably the worst of all the films that I've ever seen. The story has nothing to do with the slasher theme. It only makes the film even less interesting. This is just bad, I mean, just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to assume that anyone in the movie business would take this movie seriously. A truly terrible movie. I'm sure it was a film made with the best intentions, but it turns out to be a very mediocre movie.  If you want to make a movie, watch some of the best movie ever made, like "Kitten" and see how it goes to hell!  The problem with "Kung Fu" is not that it is a horror film, but how it is portrayed by acting alone. The story is obviously very old and not that people will have the faith to follow the story. The script writing is very bad. The dialog is so bad it does not make any sense.  I give this movie a 1/2, but I wouldn't have it rated like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Sirens" is a lousy film. I'm sorry to say that it made me really sick and very upset. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been dubbed "the sequel to the original film "Gremist" but this was no sequel. A major point of this film was the "clue in a bottle" nature of the story. I didn't want to see the sequel of "Geveritt" as I had already seen it, and the only thing that made me go see "Gendy 2: The New Adventures". So, I don't really feel the need to read this review as the sequel has nothing to do with the original.  The movie's ending isn't good either. The movie ended with the death of Gremist, who supposedly had his daughter, and I couldn't find anyone to confirm this. What was that message? Why are there a sequel to this? Well, the "Gemini" series is nothing but a series of books, so why don't you just make a new book about it? I thought of "Curious Heart" from "The Wild Life" series, but I really didn't really go that far, even with the addition of another main character. And, even as I watched it, I didn`t find anything new that made the movie "Geminista" which was what I was looking for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was boring, like it would have been for a movie with no plot and no story. The only reason for its creation was to make money, which was never really the case. If a movie has nothing more to do, then it's not a great movie, not really worth seeing. The acting was substandard, with a bad story, with bad dialog and bad performances. If this was a movie made by Steve Allen then the movie would be worth watching, but it didn't. In the end it was only worth watching if you're in a hurry, but not if you have a life in a car, so beware. A major downside is the title. No more than a real movie, but this one just doesn't come together with enough words to make it any fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie from a movie distributor and got it for just $3,000. The movie had the worst title I had ever seen. The plot was stupid and the story was boring. The acting was poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the absolute worst film I have seen. If it was the sort of movie I might have remembered back in the 1980s. It isn't. The characters in the film are so dull that it is impossible to imagine what they would be like in the real world. That is simply the truth. Even if you loved the film, you would not think that it was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of years ago, I was in a theater theatre when the movie began. At the beginning of the movie, we were surprised that an Oscar would be given to the movie in this movie. Then we saw the credits. The number of credits gave us the following numbers. The credits were for only 3 minutes of the film. The actual length of the production was 17 minutes. I don't know why this happened, and I suspect that something else has been done with this film. There's not enough detail about the story and everything else in the movie was unclear. The movie is so bad, and it looks like you'd actually want to see it. Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to be entertained, instead watch the latest movie: "Taken 2: A Night With Denzel", starring Denzel Washington. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is sad to see the lack of effort on the part of the cast. The plot seems to be a typical film-of-choice slasher thriller, with a few bloodthirsty zombie kills. But then I realized that this was only a pret-scripted movie. That's all the more reason it is not great and an insult to the intelligence of the viewers. It is no real thriller. There are not that many people involved in it. There is not a lot of interesting or suspenseful characters or anything else. I am amazed that someone can get so out of a movie that I'm sure they did not even care. There were many empty scenes.  I was very interested in the acting of the female lead, but she was barely involved in the story. If she has any talent, I would have to put her name in my list of people to do her the job right. It was very disappointing that the zombie had a red mask, and she had no connection with the group that she killed.  The ending is OK but was pretty predictable. I expected that if the film ended, it would be like a typical zombie film. It didn't help much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is bad - too long, too much and no action - no suspense - too much gags and too much self-promotion. This is a film which cannot be made fun of.  I have to think of myself as a producer and I have trouble making them. I'm not sure what I had in mind.  And yes, my apologies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that people think has been the best one ever made. But it is so bad that I think it should not have been made. First of all, it is really ridiculous that it isn't a comedy. If it was, it would be funny and I would have laughed like I did in the first one. But then after the first 10 minutes, I am just sickened and I started crying. The story is very bad. This is not about a comedy, it's about a big deal of nonsense. It's just bad! This is one of those movies that just doesn't get made anymore. What a sad way of life it is. You cannot get a plot that makes you laugh. You have to feel something like an actual pain in the throat to sit through. It is sad to see that people that call this movies "funny". If you are a movie producer, it must have been really difficult in making something that you cannot laugh with. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Maybe you can call the director and director to work on it, and I recommend they make some other movies to make that happen. I'm not kidding! It's a bit of an Oscar contender, but it's a piece of garbage. This movie is bad enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not as good as one would expect a movie about a family of orphaned American siblings. However, the acting is very bad. There is a plot that just doesn't have any real content at all. This movie just tries to pull the lines of the lines where people are forced to live on one side of the world and then is told to return to the side of normal life. We are left with a few scenes that are nothing but clichés. I give this movie a 1-3, although I have to admit that I did enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty surprised when I found this movie and it was awful. It was so bad I couldn't wait to turn the TV off. I had to watch this movie because it was so boring and bad. I couldn`t believe that a movie was filmed like that.  Also, I couldn\'t believe the storyline of the movie. It made absolutely no sense whatsoever and was totally unrealistic. I wanted to see a movie with realistic dialogs instead of one with a lot of dialogue that just comes across to us and we don\'t even know what the characters are talking about.  I didn\'t like it at all. I have seen a lot more movies with real dialog than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an extremely awful movie that fails to be worthy of being in a proper film. Even if I did watch the original, I wouldn't bother to admit it to a viewer, even if I was interested. The fact that this movie is supposed to be about one girl and one guy who has to get a puppy does not make the movie worth watching. In what ever could be a good movie, the story does nothing but make the other people look stupid. The characters are so dumb that the movie isn't even a little bit like this. The only reason to watch this movie was because it was a "romantic comedy". If you're looking for something fun and funny, then this would be a movie for you. But if you want to make a movie about a girl who just happens to be in love with the guy and is then married, I would suggest making a movie instead. The movie is completely unbelievable and it isn't as fun as that could have been. If you want something to try, get this movie: "The Joy of Love" (as I just mentioned) "Funny Girl: The Joy of being a Couple." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a terrible waste of time. It's so bad it's almost funny. It is just awful! I've heard some of the actors talk in an interview and I'm sure some of them can't read the review. But, wait, there are some people who can't tell how the movie gets started. Why do we have to sit through it? The story is about a couple who have fallen in love, but the ending is unbelievable. This movie only keeps one couple out of the story. In fact, most of them are pretty good actors, though not the best. It doesn't have a storyline, it just sets out some fake action sequence, and then tells us where to look at the next shot. Why? Because this movie is so bad, I can't believe this movie ever really gets made. I can only hope that the next scene will be better, but that is not the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film, like its name, "The Menace of War" is nothing but a poor, boring, silly piece of material. It does seem that the director didn't see this film in a dark, desolate jungle. A few lines of dialog from the script are so bad that I can't help but to compare it to some real war films.  This movie is about as worthless as a war film, I can tell you that. It's weak, it has nothing to recommend, and it's just plain silly. I'd really give it an 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was absolutely terrible - everything about it made the entire plot of my own movie seem totally unbelievable - the story is really bad! it is really just a pretentious attempt to make fun of a movie which is so bad I can't even talk about it. The plot is a complete waste of time - it doesn't really make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a bad, horrible movie this one is. It is no more funny than a bad episode of "The Family." I am not ashamed to call this "movie" because I was hoping it would be funny. There are a lot of very stupid scenes in this one. And there are some really bad actors who manage to make a lot, but only one or two of them have really worked a major role. This movie has to be in a separate movie, not in a sitcom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty low budget film, but what a movie it is. Not great, not bad, not great. There are some very good moments, but in the end the movie is simply awful. If I want to see a good movie I would much rather watch The Godfather (or even The Godmother) with a cast that matches the quality of the film (or one of the best ever film ever made) and if I would not like the film at all, I would just watch a second, third film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no way you can blame "Kojima" for being bad. There is nothing to make this movie any more serious than a flop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a good sportsman and you love your good times, you will love this movie! It is a very bad movie. There is no plot, a bad actors, a horrible cast and a terrible script. If you watch it for entertainment value, you won't enjoy it, and you'll hate yourself when you go through it. I tried to get into it as quickly as I could, and I got nothing. Avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on TV a couple of weeks ago, I didn't really know what to do with it. The plot seemed to have some life to it, but nothing interesting. The cinematography was awful, I felt like my eyeballs were being pulled at the film's edges. It seems like there were no real plot, and it was impossible to find. The acting was bad and the acting was mediocre. I have read a lot of reviews about this movie and it's not even close to being worth watching, but if you are one of those who saw it and didn't like it, let me remind you: I don't know how anyone could expect to see a movie that can be so terrible. I will admit it was very entertaining and the music was pretty good, but at times it got completely predictable. There was a lot more scenery in the movie, but just to put the burden on to the filmmakers and just watch it once because it's so bad. If you like a silly film, go ahead, but don't try to rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film just doesn't do justice to the wonderful characters, though they do a lot right. But sadly it's too late to even try to make the film a true film. The story is horrible and the characters are completely one dimensional characters that don't even make up a few minutes. They're completely worthless in the end. I can't even see the story in any form because it was so bad it didn't even give me a chance to laugh. If this movie is meant to be a true spoof of some of the early 80s films this is definitely terrible. Avoid this one at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the least I've seen from a film: a plot that has no logic whatsoever and no reason. If this is a film, this is not. It is just bad. It appears to be directed by the guy who brought the bad movie "The Expendables", who was responsible for The Expendables: one reason is that it looks like the original film "Mr. X" which was bad. The other reason is the fact that "Mr X" is not set in England. That means no British movie with British people. This is about a guy who buys some land in Africa, and is killed by a bad army. This really just shows that the man is a racist. I guess that was just an excuse for that plot. I hope that this is never made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Materi is a beautiful woman with an appetite for revenge. But she is very poor, and her husband has been absent for years... And now she wants to make revenge to her old boss...The boss...is a very powerful man! He has a great reputation...But...  I find it hard to believe the premise of a plot to be a really convincing plot.  Well, this is a movie.  A plot with a very, very annoying, plot. The movie had to be some kind of a bad, annoying movie....  I gave this movie a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot makes little sense. What is the "star"? The "star" is the main character, and I would much prefer to cast him as a major player rather than let the director do this on his own. He's so bad that it actually looks like a plot! What was the plot? Well, what was the "stars"? I never watched this movie! But I did see the scenes when my brother took the role. The film has about 3 scenes where they find each other in the movie. But I'm not expecting any real story here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Stash Days" is a piece of trash that doesn't deserve a single minute of your time. The movie is an utter mess of a film. The story is painfully simplistic and without a plot, the actors are uninteresting, the setting is boring and the camera work is bad. The idea is interesting but is lacking in execution. The cast was poorly integrated and the movie has no storyline.  This is the worst movie that I have ever seen, one that will likely never be released again. I give this movie a 1/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was a bit disappointing. The movie was horrible. I didn't understand all the details of the plot. The girl in the story is obviously a psycho. What does she do? Why is she insane? The storyline of the movie was really silly and stupid. The idea of a killer that had no motive and just murdered a woman? I didn 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of all I think you guys should be responsible for the movie: this is the only reason I chose to watch it. The only thing that made me watch it was that the movie was so bad. They couldn't get into any plot line of the movie (that would make sense) and they really didn't make a lot of the characters fit. They made me really confused for the film, the casting was terrible (the only two characters made seemed like the same) and the acting wasn't as good as in the "Avengers" movie.  I think that for this movie was nothing worth of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw it on "Wizards" and was very disappointed with it. I didn't understand the purpose of this. The whole movie was based on a lot of the stereotypes I had grown up watching, that is why I felt it was an uninspired, predictable plot. The acting was poor, the acting had an overall lack of any feeling or emotion, and the plot failed. It also failed to make much sense. It was about an Indian soldier in search of an American female (I thought she was the Indian) who fell in love with another American woman. I'm not sure if the two people in love in this movie were actually in love, or if they were actually married, but the story was very predictable. It didn't develop at all. This was no mystery that it was just a two people, either. What we really needed was a different plot. Perhaps if it was made a separate movie it could have been that, instead of making out a one person to get a job, it would be interesting to see the idea of a soldier being in love and marrying her.  If this movie would have been made a completely different movie, and made something interesting instead of a dumb movie with no intention to make it something interesting, I would have felt a lot better. I would rather have the movie be a different movie. In fact, I think the ending had been written so that it had more substance. That could have helped the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good film, although it can be funny. However, this is a pretty bad movie that really has nothing but an excuse for a movie that has nothing to do with the rest. This one isn't really funny, but it's not exactly bad, it's just pretty bad. At least you could make a movie with a slightly good director and a decent cast, and a movie like this would definitely be good if it had a plot and a storyline. Even if it was a funny movie, it would certainly not be a bad one, and that is why this is the movie. At the end of the film it's pretty annoying that the people talk about it in a way that they don't even make it into words. This is obviously not the case with many other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a catty-trading movie, so it's not going to work. They have it in good taste, but it lacks the sophistication which a good movie would have. They were trying to put into a storyline, and they just didn't work. A typical "gambling" movie is not like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've ever seen. The acting is extremely poor. Most of the scenes involving the characters are totally absurd. This is a movie that doesn't need to be told the way it is made. I don't know why this is. There are some good scenes, I have read it. However, I am not sure why it was made. It is not a film with an entertaining story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has a few good scenes but the story is weak. It tries to have some depth but the characters are weak.  I'd like to say it had a decent ending but it didn't. I think the story should have a better ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I saw this movie was the title. I thought it sounded like a horror movie. I never wanted to see that sort of stuff, but if I'd have any other reason for it being a horror, I would have liked it. Not to mention that I saw it later on in the same week. The dialog seemed to be scripted, but I couldn't figure out any of the characters in it. The acting was bad, but the dialog was OK. I didn't like the gore.  The plot was pretty good, though. There was only one scene that was like a murder scene (and even that was pretty tame), so the movie had its flaws. I can't say the movie was awful, because it wasn't horrible. But, it still didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a poor effort, but there is something that can be seen in the way the actors manage the plot, but it isn't anything significant enough to make it interesting. But the direction is stupid, I think the actors do that in their sleep. There are two scenes which are so terrible that they are almost impossible to make the audience care about them, and the story is so bad that it is actually annoying. I couldn't help but keep watching the scene over and over.  I'm really disappointed and disgusted that I am not seeing much of a film with this title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the 1980's, when the movie was first released, some of the dialog was so incredibly ridiculous, the whole movie was pretty funny, but when I watched it in 1990, it didn't quite so funny. After I watched the movie in 1990 (about 8 minutes), my conclusion was that it was just the biggest waste of money and time that Hollywood ever made. If this movie had been one of the greatest films of all time, it would have been great. But, no, it was nothing. A couple of years after this movie came out, a couple of movie executives decided to go to another movie starring a very famous actor, and I thought that they might have just gone overboard. They were afraid of making movies with such ludicrous plot lines and such ridiculous sets and costumes (including a huge wall sitting right next to a car), but the plot didn't matter.  You really want to make a movie about a movie: I don't know who would have enjoyed it. But this movie is just terrible. I don`t know who is the two people who would see it. Even the producers had no clue about making this movie, because the movie had so many clichés and ridiculous scenes. If you want to see this movie as a parody of a bad film, see one that was made before 1990. You can watch that one instead of watching it as a comedy. But if you watch it as the comedy it was meant to be, you have wasted a lot of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely terrible. This is a poor attempt at a film from the late 1930s, it really couldn't make much sense and the acting was completely bad. The cinematography and photography was absolutely horrid. The sound had some good scenes and some fine scenes but this was just a bad excuse to put a movie in the big league. The scenes were absolutely amateur at least at times.  I am not really sure why this was even made but it seems like it was made in a few days without much thought and this film could only have been made by a very naive director who probably got some good money at some point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this film just to rent it. I wanted to rent and watch the movie. I thought it would be better with a plot. However, it seemed to have an extremely simplistic plot, even though the story is good. However the acting, especially the supporting characters, was extremely bad. The movie had a predictable plot. The plot was very simplistic and I was confused with the fact that it was a "set" for the movie and that it had a plot to begin. I didn't know what the movie was about except that it looked like a movie, but the acting was horrible.  I am really disappointed that this movie was released in the mid-late 2000's when it was supposed to be released in 2003. I would have a different opinion if it was released on "A Movie". The way I see this movie is that it should have been released during the spring of 2003. The reason why it was so late was because the film had so much potential to be good and the potential for the sequel would have been significantly increased due to the fact the release date was only ten days after the movie's release. This movie is bad enough that you could lose a movie by watching it. The only positive thing I can say about it is that they had some success with making a movie that had so few people, if you can believe so, that would have made it worthwhile. I wish the producers had released it in 2003 with a proper ending. If not, I can't see what was being used in the film. It was probably just a way to get a release date on the 30th of 2003 because it is such a bad, bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I just can't imagine that this is the kind of movie I had expected to see. This was just the kind they usually release. But it wasn't. It was nothing special, which is no fault in the filmmakers for deciding to put out a movie that was so far from reality. It wasn't even a movie made out of a real movie.  What I did know, and I will say that I'm glad I didn't pay attention to it, is that it seems like they have no sense of a storyline. The characters seemed so wooden, so shallow, and so slow to move. It didn't even have an idea. It had absolutely nothing to do with the characters. It felt more like I was reading a series of paperbacks.  But I couldn't care less for the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had one purpose and that was to show the horrors of life and the effects of a virus. Sadly, this doesn't do so. There are a few things to mention that might have been interesting if only they could show the effects on the real world. Instead, there is a very lazy script. The actors are very predictable, there are only two scenes (one of which includes some nudity), they're forced to act in a very boring way.   Most people who find this film will say it doesn't make sense, but I'd like to see the effects for themselves. The story is really bad, and it's too predictable, even for the small details. I only found it a slightly entertaining on some of the odd characters (if they were actually actors) and the characters seemed to be fairly intelligent. But this is just one of many terrible films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've just been thinking about how i read that one and its funny so I just decided to give it a chance, and I didn't even see it again. However, I did not understand why it was a big deal. I'd think this movie was so poorly put together, the acting was terrible. Also, I think the ending of the movie is really dumb.   Also, the music in this movie sucks, too bad to even talk about a good movie: i mean like a movie with a good music and a great musical score, but this was a lot like a really bad movie. I won't say that it was bad, i was amused by the songs, but it's not that catchy.  If you like this movie: don't waste your money, but don't see it, at least not for very long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen it on TV. It was bad and I'm not even a big fan of horror films. But, I have to admit, the acting was good. The scenes were very predictable and when I had trouble with them I couldn't tell why. I felt as if I was going to sleep in the middle. This movie is the only reason that I will not rent it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so terrible it's unbelievable. I'd like to see the producers apologize. I know for every movie this kind of movie would be, if only because it is pretty funny at the beginning, but it keeps on getting worse. I didn't even enjoy this movie, and the acting and script are just bad. The whole thing is just bad and no humor, making a sarcastic comments to the movie, as an angry old man gets to a woman and she tries to make him fall asleep, as he takes his gun and fires at her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible waste of film.  A few years ago, there was a movie that was released called "Mystery" which was about some guy who has special powers, who can only run a little faster than a normal human being, who is forced to learn how to run for fun. The movie is about being kidnapped and put in a hospital, where they decide to watch his torture and see him tortured. It is also about being released from prison and seeing people in the hospital. It contains lots of nudity and violence which really sucks in an attempt to simulate a prison environment where inmates are abused.  It also has a plot with a man named Jack who can read mind-reading in an MRI and then gets some strange medical treatment. It can't even be called a horror film!  I'm thinking of the movie as a film that would be a big hit if it was actually made. This is completely awful. This movie was made in a day, and I can't believe I wasted my time looking at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't really understand how so many people can so stupid to sit through this waste of brain-dead material for a few hours. Not only was the writer, a very, very talented writer (and an amusing actor in some other movies), making this crap. His other work, I like, is a well-set-up movie with an edge of humor.  But this one wasn't. If you read the movie and don't feel like laughing... you will feel like being sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a piece of garbage that had so little substance that it could have been filmed in a very short time. Even the most intelligent of my friends might have thrown this one out. It would have been an interesting little mini-series. But when the story of an impulsive woman with a husband and a mysterious "sister" (which I thought was the central character) was filmed, it felt like they had been set there from the beginning of the movie. I think it might have been a better story if the story had been shot in a more confined area. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love how the producers made this film and it didn't matter how badly they made it. It just felt like the writers gave a bad story. We're all aware of the worst movie ever made. The plot is so bad it is almost impossible to decipher. Even I'm bored at some parts of it. In fact, I'm ashamed that I didn't even see it and watched the first hour. If you were interested in a movie that was fun but lacked any storyline, I would never see it again.  The only reason I will see this film again is if it is ever made on television or even at some point in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot, and the dialog is really bad. I can't blame this movie because it's really stupid. It's a movie that makes no sense of anything. It would be funny to watch this movie, but this movie really sucked!  I can only conclude that it's a bad way to write a movie. I really didn't want to see this movie but I wanted to see it. I would've seen this movie for the first time if this movie was a first-time movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a terrible film, nothing more than a "punk" piece of bad writing (though they at least try to make some interesting, which is in a way less predictable than the first installment). It is the worst "modern", genre film that I've seen in a long time. It contains no characters in an interesting way, no action, no storyline, nothing interesting to discuss except a few few few clichés, mainly centered around a dumb villain (the two most ridiculous characters in the film). It's just a pretendy little film that tries to pull out of the genre while keeping it there only to avoid "cargo" (the real genre of a "punk" film.) But that's OK! There are many people who actually enjoy this sort of thing. But when people are forced to try it, they are sure that it's not quite as bad as it was initially. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As if i'm being objective about this movie, i'm not. I mean the fact that i loved it, but it really got me really confused. I'm not sure if you have ever seen this movie.  Now let me try to explain this movie to you. In the beginning of the movie the villain of the plot is "Sock-Tater", a sad and bitter man, but at the end of the film you see that he has returned. And then you're just like a little kid who sees it and then you've got to sit and watch it as you're bored.  Oh and did i mention that during the opening credits you also see "Socks & Socks" on screen?? Oh and i guess that was supposed to be a part of the opening sequence?  The only thing i noticed is that during this movie all the music and music are just that for the sake of "making the mood". I mean what was that supposed to do for you? And i don't even want to know the answer to that question, but i am still trying to get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major problem with this movie is that the acting is so bad, that it is almost impossible to find anything redeeming it. For example, it can't even convince a "hollywood" audience. One of the many absurd lines in this movie are about a guy whose wife is pregnant and trying to stop the pregnancy, while the woman is in labor, and he tries to make an announcement to the mother and baby, which sounds like something from a mother-in-law. For someone who cares about the family, this is almost as silly as watching a show called "The Marriage Law" and then trying to sell it to a public audience as "The Family". Why?  For me, that just illustrates how thin the acting goes on in a movie, and how much it has been reduced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of time. This film is terrible. I didn't even care for a great movie, but a film that can easily be as bad as "Celestial Abyss." There isn't much of an artistic statement, although the style of the film is quite striking, if they would get that respect from the world at large. If this is one of those movies, I have a feeling that it will be one of the worst movies that will ever be released. A film that doesn't have even any value to say as a film to be released for it's own reason. A great film would have value, but this is not even worth saving. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. I didn't even enjoy the opening scene. I just didn't find a lot to see. The acting was mostly bad.  The plot was so vague that it seemed like a piece of paper. The director should have done more to develop this movie into a movie. The plot is pretty good, but the action is so bad that I felt like the director had nothing to show.    The script is too big and too fast to get into. The ending is too predictable.  I don't think that this was directed by anyone else. I think there's no way it could have had a good ending, but that's about the only thing that I can say.  If you want a good movie: Don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I can't find any words for this bad film, let me say "the name" would be "Nathan". This film has got it's name, it has got some good actors, it's got some decent story (one of the worst of the year), it doesn't have much, it doesn`s a little plot and it isn`t interesting. It is just some really bad acting, bad directing and bad direction.  I think this film would have been better if it had been made by some more talented filmmakers (like Mel Brooks) who would make this movie.    I personally loved "The Last Picture" when it was released because it was fun, funny and clever. Unfortunately, it really isn`T FUNNY but only to the actors who were good actors.  If you liked "The Sixth Sense", you don`t like this movie, if you like something silly, you like some good movie making and you don't really enjoy one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is, for the average film-making genre, a truly awful one. It's about a person who is having an "experience" with a mysterious girl and sees the film as "good" or a "bad movie" of sorts. It really doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  I didn't see it on any "cribs", but I did see it at a video-tester. The movie is so bad, it's scary. I just don't understand how this film got so far ahead of other film-makers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'll admit it... I watched this film and couldn't even begin to think that it was as bad as it was. I mean, I didn't get any plot, I don't know if it's about a bunch of gangsters and that the girl is a good girl, I'm not going to say what happens on the way, I just don't understand how it is portrayed. There's also some stupidly stupid moments that have the characters in a very bad situation, I guess.  It doesn't even come out of character, it's just a bunch.   I just thought that it wasn't that good when it was just about 1 person, I thought it was like I had watched some TV, I had heard something like that before...   It was pretty horrible, but when I finally got the chance to finish the film I did enjoy it and I couldn't see that much more. It was only worth that I lost interest in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie of my life. It's like a 2-minute of a movie made of a piece of crap. I'm a little bit mad at the filmmakers who chose to make a movie about this kind of movie: why??? Why?? There's a new girl who has moved to Florida. I am about to rent a DVD of this movie. My friends thought that I would rather rent that movie. But I think that they should use this cheap excuse to put it out for the "new generation." I don't care about the plot, the camera was terrible. It was awfully slow and the dialog was slow too. But there was something special about this movie--that it was just an old garbage. There was no suspense. There were no feeling of a storyline.  I give it 5 out of 10. But don't expect to find this movie in your local video store! This movie will not survive in theaters! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My son is a big fan of Batman and I thought this was really funny! But the only thing about this film was the stupid name and the lousy acting. I was looking forward to it, but sadly I think I wasted a lot of time watching it.  I didn't like the casting, the script was silly, and the plot was boring. I'd never really been a fan of The Adventures of Batman, but I thought it was interesting enough. But I didn had to keep moving away from it because I was just looking too.  If you want to see this film, I recommend going to a movie theater and pretending to be Batman. But if you just want to sit on a sofa, watch this video as an excuse to not have done much else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think that the filmmakers should watch this movie for two reasons. First, I think they didn't get a second before the second year of its release. And, to add more, I believe that this movie is an incredibly weak, dumb-ass, unfunny, and anti-climatic movie, which is bad for anyone but the viewers. The acting is terrible, and the plot is totally unbelievable. The ending is nothing but a big waste of space, and most of the film was completely devoid of action, especially for the most part. I can't fathom how anyone could believe that it is actually real. The whole plot is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was terrible. The acting was ridiculous. The story was totally pointless. It felt like a slasher flick. It was nothing I've ever seen before. The only reason that this movie should have been made is because this was a very creative and entertaining slasher. Unfortunately this was bad, it was terrible, and I had a feeling that I should have a much higher rating. It just didn't add up to something that I would enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After playing this film for a few hours in the summer of 1995, I couldn't understand that there would be a plot. And for sure, I thought that the film would provide more than a few plot elements. The main plot line is a guy who has a brother who is crazy, like "the original Jon Stewart" or something like that. He was portrayed as a bumbling old dumb brother. But the characters all seem to be like they're all one guy, one annoying brother. A really bad story about a brother, a stupid brother, and a bunch of annoying nephews and girlfriends.  I watched this film thinking that it would be better if it were a horror movie, like Nightmare Factory, if the people playing this movie were more talented, and instead I was really annoyed by how low-budget it was. The idea of "The Jon Stewart," I don't have any real sympathy for him, but I don´t understand how much effort went into making a movie that is so bad. It seems like a piece of garbage that somebody could do in 30 minutes, but is that someone who could make something so bad? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just makes you feel like a retardated, senile, senescent old guy. That's all.  So if I was a senile old guy, I'd be like an old man.  I'm thinking I've seen some movies before and since I've moved to the US I've watched movies that are like that. But the director of this movie doesn't seem like he's seen one.  That is the only reason I chose to see this movie and I just hope my wife's watching it didn't ruin her.  And the first and last reason I will never see this video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is pretty bad in a bad way but i don't mind to lose my money. It was pretty slow and annoying but in the end it was pretty good. I was not a fan of it but i didn't care about it too much. If you want some action, you don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an absurd waste of an awful movie. I'd rather have to take a good look at one of my childhood favorite movies and see if they are as bad as they are or not. Not only that, but this was the worst movie I have seen. I didn't even know what the hell I was watching. I think I may have been completely out of it. Some people must be very naive. The plot was cute and had some pretty interesting parts, but, they didn't really do anything that made any sense whatsoever. A lot of humor was left out. The acting was not that bad but a lot of the scenes were horrible and I could only imagine being a teenager and making this movie would be fun. There is also no redeeming part. The only thing that got me to laugh was the "winsy" name and what I think is a ridiculous fact that the actors have the name of a movie for a movie called 'Mystery Murder' in a similar manner. It's just an obvious coincidence. But what about this plot? It's pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a poor sequel to "The Rock!"--the first one--which was the better one. It is bad. The plot is weak, the acting is weak. It doesn't have the "rocky" part that it should have had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a disappointing ending. The ending was really terrible and the characters were really stupid. They seemed very naive. There was nothing in this movie that made the actors seem even more naive. The movie is about a young girl who gets turned into a killer. The girl is shown to be a murderer, kidnaps and kills a number of people. When a killer gets out on a murder spree, the rest of the actors are shown to get away from the real killers. When it is over, it is never shown as a killer, but just as a little girl that murdered for fun. This movie is so bad that I really cannot stand to see this movie anymore. I gave it 2 stars instead of a 1, but I cannot go on an 8-hour movie marathon with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had a bad ending. We could make the excuse for it, but the ending is bad to make. It's simply horrible. It should have been better. I would rather have seen an Oscar ceremony than this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You see a movie about a guy who kidnaps an elderly lady who he wants to marry and demands her hand in marriage to keep her in control while his wife is in an induced coma. She agrees and agrees to give him money. So the story is the same as always. A girl who falls into an induced dream where her father falls into her bed at night and she goes into a coma at the same time. The plot is a pretty stupid, but this is an exception because the film looks good. The acting is horrible and the film is too long. It seems that the director used a lot of makeup and other props to cover the fake hair they put on the man with the mask, who had the whole "Lumberjack" look. The film would be better if the director put his face on the screen and made his face look like a beard or his hair in a suit. The music is OK, but not so good when it is played. The only reason that it made me laugh was the guy throwing himself out the window. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know the name I'll be using, but it's not my favorite, so I decided to see this film anyway. I am really sick of this kind of movie, and I didn't want to waste the time. I couldn't believe that people even found this film worth watching. I'd like to think that people can get better at this sort of film-making but there's a reason that you can never find the name attached to this one. The ending was pretty bad, and the story didn't even make sense. I'm not sure what happened to some of the characters, but this was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was absolutely terrible. I was just really tired of seeing a bunch of annoying people. The only good thing I did was the director. I've seen some pretty good movies and this one didn't rate very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see a good film but i found this too long and I missed the message about a positive message to watch. I think the message is about the lack of character development. I'm not convinced that it is either. The message here is to move past the first impression to the point of a positive one. A movie is a process of building a character who will have a positive reaction to the world. That doesn't work for a movie like this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete and utter waste of talent, direction, special effects, and special effects (which are what made the previous films, although we do have a bit of hope for this one), but that doesn't matter. As a result, you are treated to some lame, cheesy movie that has nothing to recommend, and nothing to inspire, and very few moments that have anything to recommend them. The film is a series of bad, empty plot lines, one-liners, and scenes that consist of one-line, almost slap-like, dialogs with no dialog to speak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful, and really disgusting. The movie had to be just as bad as the 'A New Man' movie, and the fact that I haven't watched any part of it made me angry.  My opinion on this film is that I would avoid it in favor of making more movies.  I can't blame the filmmakers for getting a decent script. They could use the "novel" movie to make an all-out show instead of an "A New Woman" movie. If they had done that, then they would be able to get an almost "B" movie in it. They couldn't get an all out show, though. There's too much crap in this movie, I guess. I won't even give this movie a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with a scene of an old house in a deserted town. In the beginning, we see a little girl named Lucy being kidnapped, by the name of her parents. That girl is taken by the people. Then we find out that in the orphanage that she grew up in, there was an outbreak of the disease, that came from being killed by plague. Then, there is also a boy who is a child who has an uncle named Peter, who was killed by this disease, and his family, also. After his uncle was killed, the people of the orphanages start killing everyone, everyone is sick, and there is not a good time for any of them to get away. In what way was this movie made? I won't be able to say, as I don't remember the scene. Then there is a scene where there is just a man, whose son kills his father. The man is killed by a car and his son is also killed. In another scene, he is attacked by this monster and the boy tries to get rid of it by running away. Then what happens is that he gets stuck in a car. We see this in quite similar in the movie, when the police tell a person to help his dead son. When he gets into a car, I think you can imagine a different scenario that would be like a movie. In that scene, it is only possible for you to find out about it, because there was a car that he was stuck in. There is a lot of blood, and no way you can get the car out of the car. The film also shows a girl named Daisy who is killed at the beginning of the movie by this plague. When she is brought into the car, it looks like she is also dead. This is obviously the beginning. I donít think this was a cheap movie made out of a script. It looks like it was made out by someone without any script and a few actors. There are a few scenes where the actors try to act in these scenes, and we can see that the actors arení not very good. I think the whole scene is in a dream state that we just watch, but it could only be a dream. Then when we get to see the girl killed, it's weird, because we find it weird that there is only a scene in the film where a kid is killed. It's not only weird, but I donĒ I donīt remember it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is completely pointless, and is nothing more than a waste of all of the original plot. It doesn't have much to do with the original movie. And the storyline was pretty good.  But now there's an entire new storyline. It's not quite the original one, but you're never quite sure when it's happening. It can't really make up its own identity. For example, it seems more likely than ever that this is part of a conspiracy involving a cabal of powerful government types.  This is one of the few things that have been so bad that I couldn't think of it having anything to do. The story is basically a sequel to the original film, and the "videogames" were much more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is no good. You can't expect much from a movie that is so bad. I would have to see if even one person in this movie would be recognizable. Most of the people who died in the battle were not even recognizable. And who was the man in the first? There is no way around an Oscar-nomination like the ones of "The Terminator" or "T2". The guy in "Sirens" is a great actor, but the movie is terrible. I thought it was going to be a great action movie with "Siren" but instead of using it for that purpose I am afraid to sit and watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast of the movie is very weak, if one has any sense of intelligence. A man who works for a bank, for example, with the main character, should be able to understand it. This film lacks any sort of intelligence, even for someone who works with a bank.  In an attempt to save some money, the film sets up some story twists, but fails to deliver. The action sequences are pretty dull.  And the ending is predictable, too.  This movie is pretty cheap and pretty old, and it's pretty bad. This might be a good concept, if only a filmmaker could decide to follow this storyline, but this movie doesn't try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't get the first one, then I picked the one that was more enjoyable. This is not the case with the first of the great "dynasty" movies - this one was weak and so boring. Now I don't have a particular sense for this one. The plot is good enough to make a small movie but it's so weak that it's hard to remember the characters - you get bored with their antics.  The casting is also weak, although the acting is good - but you get tired of people having their teeth knocked off. The ending was also so weak and badly executed that it doesn't help much - unless you really enjoy these kinds of movies. This one also seems to be rather short in comparison to the ones better known and thus must have been a bit longer and better. Overall this was a waste of my time - and it doesn`t hurt that it is bad but I did get the opportunity to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no redeeming features. The director should have taken a little more inspiration from his earlier movies, such as "The Brothers". Instead of this one, he goes to great lengths to make sure that he does not forget his previous movies and what was in them. What was the last movie he made? This one is simply a pretense that people who were not quite in their time will get into the movie "before it's so popular".  The film does have some good moments, though, it lacks the charm that it needs to have to make you care for the characters. The film is not even remotely good. For example, I think it is a shame that this movie had an obscure theme. I wish it had a theme. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and the characters are pretty good. But this movie isn't even a good one. Just the worst. It's not even funny! Even though the plot was good, the story was awful. There were a lot of unnecessary things. We had no idea why anybody would be forced to kill a zombie and a guy. We also have no idea what really was going on with this zombie movie. The ending was horrible. It wasn't even funny. The way the zombie was getting away and coming back to her home was awful, and the ending was completely unbelievable. It was so bad I almost cried. How was this movie even made? It was just a bunch of people without any feeling or action! We had nothing except some very low budget and a lot going on in the background. I don't know if it was going to be a good movie, but even a bad one can be funny sometimes. It should have stayed a few hours longer. But I don`t think this movie is funny anyway. Why I give this movie: * 1 out of 10 * 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film of a movie, I was surprised to find that the plot was pretty good. I felt very, very badly let down. The acting wasn't bad, although there wasn't quite enough acting. But there was some very awkward dialogue, which seemed to have been made for the sake of a comedy. There were so many mistakes throughout the film, that I couldn't find any reason to even believe that this film was a comedy; and this isn't a comedy movie. It just seemed like the film was made to look like a sitcom, and the acting was really bad.   I'll admit that I enjoyed the story a lot more than the film itself. And I think it's all wrong for them to have made this movie. I thought that this movie was just a comedy piece of course, and they were very creative with the scenes; and they even made a funny soundtrack for it. But they had to pretend the movie was a real film. Even though the film tries to portray that the film is about the making of a big, but poorly made comedy, I think they should have thought better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have seen movies and TV series where kids who have grown bored and are bored by the idea of sitting on a giant tree sitting in front of the huge tree, having a small tree, swimming in the pool, having waterfalls, sitting on the floor, and taking all kinds of silly water-like water baths, but this movie has the opposite effect.  It has no story, no storyline, no character development, no real plot, no story line. All the scenes are about a person who is on the ground, in a strange warehouse in the woods with strange furniture and strange machines, trying to figure out where he belongs, and being interrupted for various reasons. The only time I have really gotten any sympathy for this movie was in the last scene of it. You can see that the protagonist was very bored and had a huge heart-attack as soon as he gets into the warehouse.  There is no plot, and the camera zooms around for most of the movie (though some are drawn back to the tree at the beginning), while the villain gets away with all kinds.  This is about a mad inventor who kills a bunch of people and is ready to murder everyone he has in order to get his money back. Then he dies because his body is completely covered in red dust.  What I say is this movie is bad. Some of the scenes were quite good. But there is no storyline to it. There's just a lot of pointless shots that are completely pointless. It seems so bad when there's a good plot that is put in place that people can get so bored that they just watch this horrible movie instead of seeing the end of it! If you don't like the movie, then I suggest you not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a strange, but strangely familiar script. It has an irritating ending, that has never been done in film before. And, the film lacks any compelling plot. It is the only thing that made the film a "bad movie". It also seems to make a lot of people angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am having trouble sleeping through this film, and if I was a programmer for any sense of logic, I would never hire a film that had that rating.  This film is not a horror movie, it's just one of many failed attempts to create a film like "Nightmare" starring the famous "Jugger", "Bubble" and "Dawn of the Lion", but I can see that it doesn't have much more of an interesting message and message. If this is not considered "horror", it is simply not scary enough to satisfy me.   For this reason, I'd really like to keep an eye on this film from the very first, so we can understand where it is heading. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a true believer in the "God" concept, and when it comes to the movies I'm looking for the most original, and this was not even remotely original in this case. Some of the songs sounded like "God", I'm sorry. I just think it doesn't make any sense and it's going backwards in the middle of the story. I think it would have been more interesting if the songs were in "God's eyes" rather than the movie was. In the end the movie is really bad and the acting sucks. I recommend that you not see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am writing about a movie: The director was so stupid and unprofessional that I couldn't even get a name for my comments. The characters were so terrible, I don't know how it was made. The most ridiculous part of this movie is the horrible, terrible acting of the main characters. Even if you got all the actors in an audition from their acting career, you'd never see more like they had in the final scenes. That's why I gave this film 1/3.  I can only assume this is the director's first of their plays. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is really bad, but there is something fun that this movie provides. The acting was weak, but it was funny enough for a little bit, but the plot was so weak that it just plain bad. I had hoped that it would have been good, but I was really disappointed.  The ending was okay. But the ending was so lame that it wasn't worth bothering. The only good parts of the movie were the opening scenes and the end credits. I'll let you decide whether or not you thought the ending had even been worthwhile. I don't have to give this movie a 10 (because it is better than the ending of The Mask), but I can definitely recommend the ending for "the best part of a bad flick". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a ripoff this is. I'd like to go on an adventure to find the perfect way to do a movie about this story... but I wouldn't want to. I mean, this is like one of those fake thrillers where you can buy "shocking" things and find out if you're gay or a "thronged up" girl.... and then you're going to see all these guys go for sex scenes with other girls.... It's just plain bad. I can't even see a plot. What was the purpose for this movie? I don't know. I think it has to be a real adventure. And it is bad to believe people could actually make a movie like this. They're not trying to make the movie a horror movie. The plot is very predictable. The characters are very one dimensional and they really do nothing to develop. I don;t understand that. It has a little bit of plot to keep it interesting but the story is about as dumb as it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is weak. You need a good story and you can't get it. The action scenes don't even look good. In the end, you get a bad performance from the actor and the movie is just about worthless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have seen that I really wanted to see - only I have not seen enough of movies that I'd actually want to watch to determine if they were bad or good. This is no exception. And that is not saying much. It is just one lousy performance and a bad plot. The plot is so weak that it is laughable. If you're in the mood to see an action movie, you'll leave the theater to find something else to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to say, the acting is terrible. The acting is bad. The plot is awful. The characters are flat, the directing is bad, and the film is bad! I don't know why they bothered to make this movie. I really didn't know what the hell it was. I just couldn't understand why. What are these people thinking?  The plot really has nothing to do with anything. The camera is horrible, the camera never moves. The movie looks like a puppet. The actors are bad. It just is just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been very poorly written, as there has been no plot whatsoever, so I think that I would rate it as a bad budget movie but since it is based on the "Rinco" movie I would give it some thought, as it does have some good special effects. In fact, the special effects are not all that bad. But the story seems weak and has not developed. I wouldn't give this movie a 2 out of 10. I am really disappointed in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not really original. Well, maybe it was the director, who was trying to make a documentary, and so the film was supposed to be based on his own idea. But the movie is simply bad. The dialog in it is pretty stupid, though I did enjoy some moments, especially the way she looked at him and his reactions to the fact that she was looking at him. However, I thought that it was pretty ridiculous.  If you can find it anywhere, see a "The Other Days" at the airport. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have ever seen in any film of a new language. I mean, it's just bad language (see my film: The Adventures of Huck Buck and Mr. Gigglesworth). It's just not good.  I don't think I have been more disappointed in a movie directed by J.K. Gaskins than the movie that's been making for years. The plot is good, but I just don't care. This isn't a classic film but it's not like the ones made before. A little of Huck and Mr Giggls in there and even Mr Goggles. All the characters aren't all there. I'd like to see some more quality films, like the Adventures of Mr. Rock, which is much better. A lot of Hollywood is so weak, but a lot of movies are pretty good. But this is very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My guess is that a guy (guests go on stage and act like a clown) is trying to convince a bunch of people, that you should see it. The premise of the film is that the stage was going to help people understand the meaning of this movie. But the audience just isn't interested. It's too long. Also the acting is bad, not great. You can't find any real story. Just a bunch on stage pretending to be mad comedians.  Bottom Line: I give this movie a thumbs-down. Avoid it at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "documentary" was nothing more than a hackneyed, badly performed, and lame piece of trash. In some of the scenes, it is impossible to make out how anyone can make this film. The camera is horribly distorted, the plot is badly developed, and the acting is bad. There was no reason to watch this film and I can't believe I'd buy this at any price. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The premise is that one woman is able to abduct another woman, and they both have to survive to complete the story, even though the result is one of the most disappointing things that Hollywood has ever put in a film.  If this film wasn't a simple exploitation of a very basic plot, it would be a winner, in a way. Unfortunately, the premise itself makes no sense. If you are going to write a film with some kind of humor, that's probably your best bet is to put it in your comedy club, because it doesn't have to be that funny. If there was some kind humor involved in the plot, then this would probably be a "fun" movie. Unfortunately the fact that it doesn`T have a funny twist is the way it comes off.  The script is horrible. The acting is very bad, the supporting is poor, and the supporting characters are completely terrible. I'm sorry to see a film like this for the rest of us who has to watch it for its entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that this movie is a bad one because of the bizarre premise and ridiculous antics. This was a typical stereotypical "Dwarms" movie with the main characters of all the "Dogs" (the soldiers) being made to look so ridiculous that they look like cartoonish "super hero" creatures. While the premise was obviously based on the true story of the movie, the movie is simply incomprehensible. I can understand that the characters had no real reason to be in this movie (which is something I would like to see in the future). While the script is not completely out of order, the supporting characters were generally incompetent and the movie ended with many scenes that were completely unbelievable.    The film was an interesting one at the beginning, but unfortunately ended with a lot of "weird" moments (like the way the soldiers get killed) and the entire plot was very poorly developed. I would encourage everyone to stay away from this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just some dumb trash... but like the rest of the "B" series, it seems to be a typical B-Series, which are, in the past, better than the first and only film. In the first, they had some good stuff, the main character (who, according to my sources, is one of the best actors I've ever seen in film) is a nice guy. The sequel is bad, it doesn't really take advantage of the main characters in the first. It doesn't take advantage over the "F" series to which they were created.  The whole movie could of been a bit better than what it got. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In an odd twist, it has been discovered that this movie has some peculiar connection to the infamous "Godzilla" in Japanese Godzilla films, who would have had to be a hybrid beast with its own genes to make the movie (that would be a "God", one that would have a human form, and its own blood). I suppose this is because the movie was set in the 1990s when they had a connection to Godzilla in Japan, and it was deemed to be such that it was the kind of monster that would be able to breed (in order to save the earth). That's the only connection with this movie (not one with a movie: The name is the Japanese name of the movie: "God and Godzilla"). This movie was filmed in a Japanese village in the outskirts of Kobe that is actually a bad place, with the exception being "God". I suppose the director is thinking of a connection with the Japanese village that used to be the village where the original Godzilla was created. The idea behind this movie is that it is not Godzilla, but it is an old village that is in a village in Japan. I didn't care for the idea at all. The only thing I can say is that there was a "monster" that used a bloodthirsty and deadly bloodlust to "take out" all the villagers (which are a group of people) so the monster would only eat some of the villagers and then would devour the rest. That would have been interesting for the monster to do so and "rebirth" some of them. I couldn't believe that the monster in the movie didn't have bloodlust or bloodlust. It was just so stupid and uninteresting, and nothing was supposed to be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not one of my favorites, but I can only say that I was very bored watching this movie. It's so bad it's better not to spend money on it! The plot is so confusing, I don't think they can take this seriously. The ending is not even close to the way I expected it. There's no story of a dying couple, the parents, or anything like that. I have a lot of problems with this. I would recommend watching the other book, "The Family Saga", if the movie is any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending of the movie is horrible. I mean, I've just seen the first episode of "The Good Kid" and "The Kid's Mom", and both were excellent. In this film, the only two characters in the movie are the little girl and her cat. The little girl is just a bit mean and mean, and, at the end of the film, she is so mean that she forces someone into a basement to build a tower, complete with some fake stairs. She doesn't even do it herself, she's just always got her little girl in the basement, but we can't even think that. I am seriously sickened that this is what we can expect from a film in 1985. In the beginning of the episode, I learned that the little kid was the cat and after a few minutes of this, I had already decided to believe that she was a cat. And this movie is really so bad that it's almost hard to believe she's actually a cat anyway. I guess I could give this movie another shot, but that wouldn't have been wise. It was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had an absurd plot, which just made no sense, and was only about the fact that a guy has a little dick and decides to find out that he has a giant dick and then proceeds to find them out. But the movie lacked the ability to build any kind of excitement to save the plot. There was also a ridiculous plot. While the plot was pretty good, it wasn't as much fun as a real movie about a guy having a giant penis. And then the character was boring. They had little substance to their person- their little balls and their little legs. There weren't even a huge fat guy. They gave an absolutely ridiculous story, but the fact there was a penis in the main plot bothered me. The ending was also ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie when it was released in 1998 and I've never seen it. The movie seemed like a "classic" version of "Tie Me". With a cast of five actors and two minor supporting players it's just a joke. This movie was horrible. I would have turned it into a DVD of the video and watched it for that purpose because the story is so bad it does not merit much time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Trolls 2: The Unstoppable Forces" is a really bad sequel to "Took a Trip." The story centers around a teenage boy who discovers that his parents have died in a plane crash and are killed by other people, who then try to shoot them down with revenge. At the beginning of the film, the only thing that is happening is the little guy's mom (as they're called) does not try to help him as she is more worried by the man's killing. By the end of the movie, he has killed most of the family members, and is back in charge of the plane crash investigation when the pilot shows his plan. When they return to the scene, the film gradually descends into a confusing plot. The actors don't seem to be playing their parts, while the scenes are simply filmed around the ruins of the crash site. Most of the action is just showing some buildings collapsing and crashing into a huge pile of rubble. What I mean is that at the beginning, the actors seem to appear to be actors, instead of actually playing their characters.  The only thing I can say is that in one scene, you can see the first scene that the parents are dead. This is the same scene in every movie that has "Taken A Trip" (including "Takes a Trip" and "Tough Couple"). The actors are generally in such a hurry to get to the wreckage and finish the scene that they were in, that they appear to make their own death not a gruesome killing. In the "Tribes 2: Unstominate Forces" film, it was completely missing this crucial element. If you saw the original film, you would see that the actors were acting more and not just for the scenery. That would have been fine, but it didn't occur on "Tribe's 2: the Unstompable Forces" because I was specifically looking for the scene where the parents were dead and were in it.  This film is such an example of how bad the sequels can get. The script is really bad, not even the least interesting, while you can look forward to it as a "must see." You don't want to sit there for ten minutes and watch everything happen because you'll find out that you've seen nothing interesting.  But it does make the scene a movie worth sitting through just to make you bored. That's pretty disappointing, since that's exactly what "Tron's 2" does
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has very good plot and some good images, but the acting is weak and the ending is so stupid that it's not believable. This is really not the best piece of film history, but let it be so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of those movies that people just couldn't get into. I didn't even give this one the chance of saving my mind or any of my soul. I don't remember how the movie came out, the way I heard it, the plot, the people I talk to, the director. The only thing that helped me was the ending. I wish I could have that money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The name "The Expendants" is a movie with a somewhat ludicrous plot that just doesn't happen until the final episode. We had to watch that for several weeks. Then we had to read it for several hours in the theater, and we had no idea what happened. We just kept wondering why it got to the point where it became an action movie. We also had to wait until the script is fully written, and then we had the nerve to watch it. The ending was terrible, and the script wasn't consistent with the rest of the movie. The original script was interesting and interesting, but at the end it became almost totally predictable and predictable.  What is a "movie" that isn't really part of the main story and just sort of its own separate series? How did they even find a villain who was so inept and stupid that he wound up killing the entire crew. And that whole plot was only brought together in a couple scenes that were slightly connected with other parts of the story. In the rest they had to rely on the knowledge of the other characters and just make an interesting one sided battle. At that point the movie becomes totally lost and we just kept hoping that would happen again.  But the ending was bad and the movie became boring. It really was an excuse for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really annoyed at the story and the lack of characters that we had access to. However, if the movie was to be a serious portrayal of the real life of a gangster who is living out his final days, it might have been different. There would be some character that had a little bit of human qualities to him to make the film more believable. There is no way to portray the gang members that exist today, nor the gang leader(s) that the movie is set in. I'm thinking they must have gotten a lot of material from the movie and they must be very skilled at what they do. Why did the other characters act so badly? You have to wonder if the filmmakers had a great budget on which they spent on producing this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot seems like a rip-off version of "The Butterfly". Only now that it is available at the top of the British DVD trade. The title is also a rip off title, but it is only in that sense. The plot is totally pointless, not interesting enough to provide any entertainment. The camera is also lousy, as you can probably hear it in some parts. The supporting characters, such as an old guy with a dog and a man whose dog is the lead, were supposed to be so original that they would be used to the film and act without even a hint of being a film. They were simply dumber and boring, as the film had been shot in a big camera, and there is no camera, unless there is some sort of black-and-white filter on top of it, which I have never heard before.   This is not the only bad film I have ever seen, but the worst of all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed out loud at the ending when the first man kills me. The only thing that keeps me from laughing is the camera on the floor. This is one of those movies that is bad, and I never see myself laugh like this. It's pretty obvious that this movie was made in some style in order to get a release on some small network. I can tell you one thing that I do not believe this film, because it has not been good at all. If you like to believe what you read in a horror movie: "You can't tell me what's on the next door!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst piece of movie: there are no redeeming qualities. The camera is not the greatest - there is some weird funny parts (including a giant red spider, which is funny). There are some scary scenes (see the killer fish, who is constantly fending off for an impossiounfied shark), and the film lacks the feeling of authenticity that it needs.  But, perhaps the better thing about this movie is that it is so bad that it really doesn't get much attention. Not even the British "TV" news outlets have it. It is hard to think this is a "serious" movie. Even the director, Robert Lukn, is known as a movie director who loves to get in on the ground with his own creative projects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just to keep a brief reminder that this movie was a total rip-off from "Patton 2: The Big Game".  My only real disappointment with the movie (for what it was) is the fact that there are some real people in the movie...the only two of whom are actual people...and they're both very horrible characters! Even the one who is a mother (A. Kelly Murphy) who is so beautiful in her role that she would have to do anything to convince people to see this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, my wife and I have just finished watching this one and she hasn't seen it before now so I will watch it again because she's too good and not drunk. We have seen her drinking and smoking in our house when she was in L.A and she was arrested for doing it in Canada and doing it while the cops were watching her from the airport. I think there was a lot of money flowing into this whole situation in Canada in the last years and what we thought was going to happen was that these people would simply disappear and leave Canada and everything would be a paradise for her. I can see the video clips and the girls that were involved in this and how totally stupid they are.  How the acting could have been much more sophisticated than the previous version I rented and in fact was just more of the same garbage. Some things are good, the plot is good and the visuals are OK, but if you are going to rent it, do not get it because it's so bad, it's bad. If you are expecting something to be even better than this, don't spend your money for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was very much worse than a horror movie but at least it had something to be different. I can't really say why but the fact that this was so bad is not a good idea to say. I found this movie extremely difficult to sit through. the only thing that made it interesting for me were the scenes of an old guy who slowly loses his mind. It was about as annoying as anything that could happen in this world.  The biggest problem with this film was that it was not very interesting to see and the acting was bad. The storyline was very predictable and the plot was almost nonexistent. I really wanted to see if this film had any potential to do something. It seemed to be like some kind of weird horror movie that we just couldn't understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie was full of garbage. I rented the movie for my younger son and was really amazed that I rented it for him! Why the hell would I rent a movie about a rape like this? It is absolutely ridiculous that this movie was made so that it could make you believe there is an actual rape. If there was a rape, you would think that it was real. This is ridiculous and this movie is bad for the sake of the rental alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Weird Spot" is simply awful. Its a comedy about a bunch of teenagers getting drunk on a late night party, and that's all it is. The ending is a little confusing and it is so obviously not going to appeal to anyone. The acting is not even decent. The jokes are not great. I was looking forward to the whole movie and I just gave it two minutes of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a horrible waste of time to get a second life, so I decided to give it a rating as a "bad" movie: bad. It is not a film with talent. I wouldn't mind having such a movie in my life. But unfortunately, it is a shame to waste it. I don't know how they were able to make something so bad. If this movie will ever get past people, I hope it will. I couldn't believe that they would make this piece of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of "The Last Mile" has just been dumped on the web, I suspect the fact that it was created as a comedy is the biggest reason, if you consider it so. It's a very dumb premise. The fact that this movie was filmed in Africa, in a few weeks, is the only reason I would pay the money. When I watched it I was convinced it was about a joke, I didn't think this was the best thing to do. There are so many ridiculous things to be written about, most of them are the same as what's in the movie, it just doesn't matter, I can't find a decent reason to see it, the script is awful, and if I say this is the worst film I have ever seen I'll be dead but I'll do anything I can. It was an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What an unbelievably ridiculous plot. I have never been involved with this so-called "Star Wars", and I find myself surprised to learn they even make movies. This is the most painful film I've ever seen from Star Wars, but it sure as much as possible is not even worth seeing. I don't know when you'd get a chance to work in the Star Wars franchise, if you are interested at all, and I certainly don't have any faith to believe that it would have any real value. For example, a member of the Brotherhood and the "Lord" of the Black-Decelded Retrielders of the Empire. I can only imagine that they would be there for a few minutes. They would go in and make one of the most hilarious, pointless and pointless movies ever created.  If you want to check out "Star Trek: The First Night", you can rent that film on DVD, which is much less interesting than this crap. And I highly recommend the DVD copy of "Buck Bumble", which was made just this week. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very annoyed with the movie and the fact that "Myster" is about 4 years old. As a child, I don't have the ability to comprehend a word I can't even pronounce and I really don't understand any more than the words the words that "Theory" and "Mystery" were used in "Mystic" for the movies I saw. "My Mystic" is the worst movie ever made, but if anyone had the courage to see it, I suppose you would have seen it. It's one of those movies I hope isn't made. I can imagine what sort of horrible thing a film made would have done and what would have been left out to be shown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is based on the book of the infamous, "The Great Monster Revealed".   When "The Monster Reveals" hit the shelves in 1969, it was a classic waste of money. There was nothing interesting about it but it lacked a plot. At the beginning of the movie, when I watched it, I had no idea what it was going to be like.  The whole thing is about how "the Great Monster" came to Earth in order to meet with the Great Monster and why it was killed, and then, after fighting their way out of Earth, it became the "Great Monster" and was killed. It never actually got to the point where it was finally destroyed.  It doesn't make sense. The movie didn't make much sense in its own book, and there wasn't much detail from the book which made me feel more interested in it. In the book, the protagonist was never made to pay any more money than half of the $10 the movie was going out to pay for.  I didn't realize that it was ever going to have a storyline. In it's book, it had a huge plot, which I assume would have been an interesting one. But it's not there. In this movie, everything was basically just repeated in the book.  When it's time to get to the action, they are running out a few of the big bad guys. After their first fight, I think you are given a brief time to see the fight go. They are getting back to the good guys and there's some sort of a surprise.  Then there is some of the bad guys who are escaping the clutches of the good people.  At the end, the movie is obviously going to end. It doesn�t seem like the best film ever made, but I think it does have a good ending. You just have to sit through it.  If you want a movie that can actually get a "Great" feel to it, don't watch this one. I think some of it is OK, but it just isn�t. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So where am I? The truth about this film: A young man wakes up in a strange hospital and learns that he had died in the same hospital he lived in the previous summer. This hospital is a "shuniverse", made out of two different worlds, the man is trying to get away from the "dark world" in order to escape from the hospital and get into the "real world", but he is unaware that the hospital itself contains something that will kill him. I suppose the man has some special powers and uses a huge computer to help him and try to destroy the hospital, but he doesn't really know what he's up to, but I'm not expecting much from him.  I can't find the reason that this film is so terrible, I think the director was drunk and went into the hospital drunk drunk, I guess it was his brain? That explains a lot of the acting and story. Maybe he's got some kind of power, but his computer's running, and all he is doing is playing around. But not enough of the cast or storyline to keep you fooled, I'll say.  This movie has some interesting footage in it, but the acting is really bad. I have no idea what it's going to do. A lot of actors from different countries would love to see it, I have nothing but one thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really terrible. The only thing worth saving is the original, and it's probably the only thing that keeps this movie from being completely terrible. There was a good part in this that may have helped its ratings, though it was pretty poorly written. If I hadn't so, it would have been a movie like a bunch of poor actors, but not really. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was horrible, I've heard so many people laugh for its stupid plot. It wasn't funny at all. It was just a disgusting pile of moronic, self-stulting, self -defeating garbage. I will never go to watch it again. If you like the original film, you get to laugh. But the plot is completely stupid. It's horrible to see the same old story, but there were a few moments of lighthearted humor. This movie does not even deserve a release. I guess the director decided to put a'spin' on it and try to save the director's reputation. I can't believe he got that license. I don't even think this is a 'classic' episode, but it's far worse than what this movie does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not terribly creative, but it was pretty bad. There were some decent scenes but the most ridiculous was the scene with the little boy in a gas-gated car. He has an extra body that has to get into a car that is only a foot or so long. There is also an awful soundtrack that was pretty annoying. There's also some bad jokes like a character's hair going into a window to smoke, a car accident, etc. Some of the better jokes were in the film when the gas-tank is being used for a couple of scenes. The movie was not nearly as bad as the 'Curious Fish' movie, but the story and cast were far from that. I can't blame it for the awful score. I also wanted to throw it out, but I was too bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After being denied access to the new Disney anthology "The Twilight Zone" I can easily say that the movie was so terrible I couldn't even find the last episode. The plot was completely convoluted, the dialog, acting, and direction were all so bad that they made it difficult for me to say that this movie was enjoyable. The fact that this is a Disney movie is no excuse for such poor acting. This movie isn't going to win an Oscar, it's just not interesting, and most of it lacks humor, which is probably the only thing that this pretends to be. My only real hope is that it will one day have a chance to salvage the popularity that it so failed to achieve. But if that is the case, I'm glad to have seen this garbage to an end. Unfortunately it remains in Disney's hands and can't really blame them for that. I can't say that enough. But I can say it does make me want to kill everyone and I am sure that everyone else in the theater would love to find a good movie: "The Nightmare Zone" - if you will ever get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not one that I am willing to see. I am surprised that this is the best thing I've ever seen. I'm not even sure why. In fact, it has nothing, nothing, or very much to recommend to any of my friends who have never read any of the books, nor to any other of my family. I watched it, but I do not really understand the premise. For me, the premise is to "create a perfect couple, and to "take them on a road trip together to meet each other, and then to work as a couple in their respective roles". I'm confused when I see "part two", the "numbers". I don't think that that it has any plot, except for the fact that the "brother" is an overgrown teenager who does not seem to be part of "parent" as portrayed in this film. I mean, for example, let's assume the two main characters in the film are friends, the main story line is with them. What really happens at the beginning of the movie is that the two characters suddenly begin making love. This is only possible because the father is a "normal father" who cares about her child, and the two parents are both of the same gender. If you are confused or angry with the ending of this film, you would be best off watching this story instead of watching the first part. I don's not saying I'm sorry, I thought this film was good. The idea of a perfect "family" is completely unrealistic. I think that the main premise is that this film is going to "perfectly" "make" for them. There's nothing wrong with that. It really sucks that the father was not completely involved in this movie. And I don´t understand that they tried to portray her as a "curious and independent young mother" and thus created a love story. A perfect marriage between "parent and son". There was nothing wrong in that situation. It has nothing to do with what happens at all to make you think that it makes any better for me. If that is the case, then I would not be mad at this film whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this film the entire evening at my local theater and I kept thinking of people that died during this movie. How could they have died? They were so ignorant!  This movie, in its first attempt, seemed to be a documentary of the worst moment in history. We can see this in the documentary, where Americans used to think of themselves as civilized and civilized people. After this horrible movie, we will never again look at ourselves as civilized people and see ourselves as stupid as stupid people. That is a bad film, in itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like an old soap movie starring a bunch of over-rated college kids who didn't have a sense of purpose or life. This film was terrible, with a weak plot (and no real plot). The scenes were over-dressed, the characters looked dumb, and the music was terrible (and I thought they sounded like the songs in the original songs). The ending was terrible too, and I thought that the actors were way too over-hasty.  The plot did have something to redeem it, though.  Overall, I thought this movie was a complete waste of money. I won't be seeing this movie ever again, and if I will ever see it again, it will be too bad to be a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really sucks to see such a bad film, which just shows the lack of taste of directors from the 1960 to the 1970 era. This is not all that a true film would, but just shows how poor a film can be. It is not even a good film - it is a very bad movie. The only saving feature is the fact that it contains a real actor, which gives the film a sense of life. The film looks like it would have been a B grade film, but it really isn't. At least I won't be a fool to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is going to be the plot for the next James Bond film, I expect it will be a pretty good one. It won't be brilliant, but it will disappoint. It's slow, dull and dumb.  In order to maintain suspense, the filmmakers need to make the movie sound like a movie, not a real movie, which just happens to people on a regular basis (in some circumstances, anyway) and the dialog is usually lame and mumbled. The biggest problem with the film is that it pretends that it is real magic. For example, in this film, the magic is the same as the magic in magic school. And when the magic isn't real, it doesn't exist.  It can't get that wrong. The magic is real, and you can see it anywhere, and the magic never gets to see anything. So why do we care that it's not real? It's obviously fake, and it's only real when it appears to be fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is so bad, it's hard to describe. It's about some sort of plot of some sort, and it's a piece of trash, at least. It contains little more than a few people screaming or jumping in a pool. There's also some sorta'rescue' video about a killer whose blood soaks the water. Oh, the'rescuted' killer has his girlfriend's sister! Oh, wait, that's right, that was her sister... I'm not making this up for no. A lot of the scenes are so boring and the dialogue is so vague. You can see the characters running around like they're running around for hours. I won't even bother to try to guess how a guy dies.    No one should be watching this movie. I cannot believe anyone else is ever gonna watch it, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is obvious that these kinds of films are just the way for the bikers to try and act as'supermen' on a road. And to help the biker feel secure, it is obviously about to get their blood pumping. It is obviously also about to scare the bakers into believing that they can get on the roads and get away from the'men' and 'women'. If the bodge-wielding bikers are going to get the goods, they should do it as they did when they attacked everyone in the south.  But sadly it is just another biker to act like the'man' and in this case it is not going very well. I am a biker and a supporter of the motorcycle rights, but this is not the only thing I can do. If the Biker believes that he is a man and that he will get away and beat everyone else with his bare fists, he must take it into his hands in a way that he has never done before. He must show he is not a man but a coward. He is not even one of us.  The acting is pretty good, but they should make it clear that this is a movie for the Bikers. They can't even make one mistake so badly as they do in this one.  I can't say enough good things about this movie. I just can't go into the details of the plot or even find out who is involved in the plot, but I can guess that it is probably one of those people that will be getting punched, and that some may be in the hands of police or some other police-officially called'superman'. In that case it should not be the first movie that comes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not big movie fans but even though this movie was okay (I believe it was intended to be a low budget film), it was very disappointing. I have read other comments that the movie was good but was bad when it came out. I decided to write about it only so that I could feel some of the emotion from it. I've seen some better films in my life than this movie and this is not the only one. I believe this is a bad way to portray the relationship of a couple in a new couple. It is like having a movie like "American Pie", where the husband and wife only have a love relationship in the beginning but then they only have one relationship (a couple) together, with the husband having sex with the wife, and having sex only with the man's partner! This is so silly!  I don't know who would want to see a movie with only one person having sex in it. It just doesn't make much sense to me! I thought it was only a little better to have a couple that is not in the least involved in the relationship in a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a really bad example of a TV series. I mean, even if it's the same with "The Matrix", then it's like an excuse to say, 'Look at the other two movies!' They don't have any of the cool features or anything. The fact that they're so damn mediocre that we can actually see them is kind of hilarious.  If I was a member of the cast and the producers of this movie were a part of the production process then I'd have a pretty hard time watching this movie. If you've got a clue, then watch it for yourself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think you guys are pretty funny. Especially when you bring in a bunch of people that you can control and they all act like zombies, even when you're just sitting around in a restaurant watching a movie. The whole thing of The Walking Dead is just to dumb. A big part of the original Walking Dead was supposed to be a post-infection zombie show. It was supposed the entire town that lost its population due to the infection was still able to survive. And when it became a zombie show, nobody expected it would end up making it like an awful zombie show (unless the town of the town the infected people lived in was the real town). So, what does "WALKING HUNNING" really consist of? That's not what I think it is. And I really think it's just the most annoying zombie show ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so slow, I almost can't imagine how you can just sit on your front of my face and watch it for any length of time. And when the movie finally shows you a scene (and you can sit on my face), you realize that it is all about how to make you miserable.  What I just described above is about as much as I could just sit there and watch the movie, not enough, I guess.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this movie with my husband after a couple of very annoying episodes I think. The movie really disappoints as a movie about a very predictable story. While it was pretty interesting with the "gifts" of the children to each other, I just couldn't see the connection. The "fringe" aspect of the movie is only in the final scenes. I can't seem to find this film to help a "young person" get to know a new girl.   If this is supposed to be a movie for kids, the characters are very disappointing. They don't even act like kids. The only good thing is the "furls" with the car. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was obviously designed for young teens, but unfortunately all of the kids in the audience had low IQ to what was expected. The acting was bad to begin with, and the story was pretty bad.  It was a shame because this movie had a lot of value and a lot more potential in the future. Unfortunately the other stars in the movie don't have enough money to make their contracts a reality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really understand why this movie was made. In a weird way, the film is not even a documentary but it's just some sort of story on the tragedy of the Holocaust, it doesn't show any sort of Jewish beliefs, is not the usual documentary, it's obviously a cheap knockoff. The story is pretty predictable and not funny at all. They even manage to throw in a few jokes, but those were pretty stupid.  Also the film doesn't do anything remotely interesting. It's pretty long, it contains little plot, but some of the best moments of the movie are when the camera zooms around the camp, and everything is dead and they just watch it from above. It is not all that horrible to see, but it doesn`t help much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Day We Land" is another movie that was very bad. There was no fun in this movie, unless I'm a stupid idiot. The plot is bad, the cast is lousy, and the story is lousy.  The best thing about this movie is the acting. It was awful.  I rented it because I wanted to see the movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this movie, I think that the viewer may be the only one who can handle it. Some of the scenes were hilarious, but the lack of effort and the acting made this a pointless, boring movie.  I was also bored by it. It's not all that awful, but for the rest of the movie it can't really be anything but a really bad movie. But it is so bad, in some way it has to be seen. I think it was the result of some kind of marketing of this film, which is difficult to avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a horrible attempt at a romantic comedy. It's about a teenager who becomes a college student to find out that he's going to date and get a girlfriend. He has a girlfriend, and it's just plain stupid and pointless to go to school or school or anything like it, because it never goes to the real deal with the story, even with the main actor. It doesn't have any storyline and it just ends with the guy's girlfriend leaving for some family members or something else, and then he comes back and the couple are separated again, and he has this ridiculous little scene of the couple getting their girlfriend back into bed, then they just keep on trying to get it to where it stops. There are scenes where you are just wondering why everyone is so stupid. And while I liked some of the actors who played the part, they were just bad characters and they didn't get the most out of it in the movie. The ending sucks. It was just like every other movie I've seen. If you're going to do anything like this, don't even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a movie based on some events and I thought it would be interesting. But after the first week I became so annoyed by the idea of it being a movie that I felt that it had absolutely nothing to do with the idea behind the movie (which I find silly, considering it's about a guy who wants to have kids and not want to go to the big city of the real world). I decided to give it a chance, and when I watched it, I felt like I was in another movie. I don't understand why someone couldn't make a movie about something that is so important (the main idea of the movie, that is that the main person is really really a cat, and the main thing that makes it so important is that he has to get out of a sticky situation and save the world... but what makes that situation "sticky"? And when I first started watching it I didn't think anything had ever even been used in the way it was made, and all I had wanted to do was try and convince the guy to change. After you first see the movie it's clear that you're just too caught in the loop (that's why we are so scared of an angry person in an empty lot). The movie was just weak, even worse than the first movie I saw, and it's so bad that I'm worried it will never come out. And yet, I can't blame the producers for it. I've seen most things worse than that. I thought the first thing they made was pretty good. But I just couldn't shake my mind after watching it, and if I did, I would never stop believing it would not make anything but worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After having read my review of this film, I thought that it was a really bad film. This is because it doesn't manage to act like a movie: the actors do not really like to act, and there are too many scenes which just do not fit with the characters. Also, the way that it can show the reactions to the people in the movie is not as natural, and not as interesting as the characters in the film. The ending of the film is not even funny, it just contains scenes in which we just can watch and see the characters having their lives die, and then we find out that they survived. I had to force myself to watch it twice to realize that it is the only movie I have seen that has this kind of ending. Even when you want a movie which can have a sense of humor and drama, it is too predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea behind this film is that the two characters, Jack and Gwen, should've been married in a couple of weeks. That's not true, even though they appear to be married now, although their real life would have been in some way similar to that case. There are a couple who are married to a couple and actually have their marriage sealed. Jack is the new married husband and Gwyn is his fiance. While both are married, there's not much action with any real characters. In fact, it is very difficult to watch a film where the characters are not completely evil.   For the sake of having some plot, the cast were good, the scenery was pretty good, and the lighting looked good, but they were obviously made without any care.  So, for that, I recommend avoiding it. Even though I admit that this film could have some potential, I will try to ignore it. I'll give it 2, even a bit of this, and I will never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just not that bad. I guess if I watched this one I would be disappointed by the lack of quality, but I didn't. The fact that it is a movie is just a mystery. The actors have it all, the acting is lousy, the whole premise of this movie is silly. I thought the director was stupid to make a movie like this, I think I was stupid not to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to seeing this one, but I didn't know when it was because I didn�t understand why it was called a comedy. I was very concerned. I just wasn�t satisfied with the movie and its predictable conclusion. I didn���t understand what it meant to be either way. I mean, I don�t really get the point behind this movie. It is not good when the action moves forward at the end of the movie, and the ending is slow and pointless. It just seems like they tried to cram in too much material so they could get a laugh. I only laughed twice, but this movie is just awful. I gave it two stars because I liked it but I just couldn�t give it another two or three. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film about a person who murders a girl so he can keep it down, has just about the same plot, but it lacks the atmosphere of mystery and suspense.   I can't seem to find the scriptwriter, but I can see the acting. They are all too predictable.  The film was filmed with a lot of cheap camera movements and low-light cinematography, and the acting is bad and bad.  But what are we, seeing this movie? If we just want to see an action movie, then we get that. But it doesn't get that sort of vibe. This is too much like a straight murder-on-suicide movie.  You'll like it if you've seen one of those other movies like "Kill The Kid" or "Carnalet" or something like "The Killing Zone" or (that movie) "Bloodshed". It's better to see a movie without any storyline and a twist. And I don't want to spend $3,000 on that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the idea behind this movie. However, the acting was lousy, the storyline was weak, and the movie had a dull plot.  I was disappointed to see such a weak movie.  The movie was not much better than some cheap car set-up movies. It wasn't a real car (at least not a "real" one), it didn't really go anywhere, and it didnn't even make any more for my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this movie was not that bad, although I guess that at some point it was not the best film. However, the end was bad, and the end, as far as I can remember, was bad. It had a couple of scenes that seemed to have been filmed by an amateur. I don't know why this film got made, because I just thought it was stupid and bad. The two actors are horrible, the director is stupid, the acting was horrible, and, perhaps the biggest thing of all, the girl is a horrible person and she just cannot act. But this film was really bad.  I really cannot fault this movie for the first few hours. The acting was good, it was good enough to get you comfortable. But what happened after the first half of the film was ridiculous. I had already watched everything I'd seen and this movie went through and I was not bored in any way. But at the end it became a dull film, with a dull plot. I never really enjoyed watching it, and it was all over-rated.  The plot is OK, but if you get into it you are just lost, like all sorts of things. I wish I could say more about this movie, but I don`t have time to wait. I am sure I won`t see this movie ever again. I do feel sorry for my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was nothing original, the acting, graphics, and story were terrible, and the story line was only marginally interesting. This movie was simply a collection of images that were not interesting enough to make viewers care.  The movie ended up with the same annoying and unbelievable ending. The movie should have been shot straight away. The plot needed to be done right. If your going to see this movie, avoid it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't get the impression that this movie was a masterpiece of horror, it was just a stupid, stupid piece of bad, unadulable trash that made no sense. There wasn't a lot of suspense and there wasn't much horror in it, there wasn had no atmosphere and the story didn't come alive.  The film was so obviously influenced by the worst of the decade - its attempt to recreate an Albian culture without understanding how that would take into and affect the lives of native people of Bali.  There was nothing else to recommend that I thought from this movie. The actors couldn't act like themselves - they seemed like puppets.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few months back I was thinking about buying a DVD or "retraded" DVD for my teenage son and, because I can't believe that this movie ever gets released ever again. The idea was that this would be a good film for him to watch and his parents would like to watch it. The movie is horrible. It lacks any real connection with any real human beings and is, at least, poorly written. It isn't even remotely funny. Even I found that the scenes in which the boys are "parading" around an empty street and there are girls in what appears to be a house with several women. The girls seem to be very hot. They are just stupid teenagers, who seem to have little interest in anything except sex. I found it to be boring, and I am totally shocked that they could have actually written this movie. I can say that I'm a very mature person, and this movie really wasn't the least bit of horror I have seen in a long time. The only reason I have to recommend this movie is because it is in a position to appeal to anyone who actually wants to "experience life" while watching this stupid movie. At least the first part can be watched as a comedy and is interesting. But unfortunately the second part contains no real message whatsoever except that "this is the only thing I can think of". If you see it in a theater, avoid it. I don't even think there would be much merit in having a movie called "Teen-on-teenage-murdock-boom" - instead, I would prefer if it were just a cheap movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dutsovs" (as the title says) is a lame, unimaginative, two-part "movie" set in a dark basement. The plot is completely artificial. What is supposed to happen is that this guy gets a little lucky guy with some money and some mysterious magical powers, turns into a man (?) and begins to make himself a "normal" man. He gets a good reputation as a hitman, but then he starts to build a huge collection of bodies and an empire with big castles and a big fortress. This plot is obviously made up for the filmmakers. In the end, the "regular" guy (also played by Anthony Monadio) meets a woman who is so hideous that he will try to find out who's the true culprit. He decides not to pay her for sex and she dies of some sort of disease and is now looking for revenge.  I don't really like this movie because it is extremely bad. I think it was made in a short time frame time, but if they were using it as a regular film, it would be way better. But since the camera is so long, it is not really a "short" movie anyway. The story and the acting are terrible. In an ordinary room, it doesn't make much sense unless you're looking for a movie. The acting is mainly made to make it sound bad. All of the dialogue is unbelievable. The only good thing about the film is the "adventure" aspect of it. That's right. The dialog is interesting and sometimes funny. In some parts, it's funny. But overall, it just is bad. The fact that you are going to see a person who was once in a rock band and now plays guitar in a metal band is about the same thing. I wouldn't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so predictable that it actually didn't work. I was so disappointed that there would be a movie like this when I heard they were making movies like this. I had never heard that kind of movie before. The main storyline was predictable. The plot was too predictable and the supporting characters were even predictable in some situations. The movie is too boring to be even a good movie and I don't know how the hell they even made it. The idea that a movie based on a real person who has a real brain and a real wife isn't supposed to be good because it is actually a movie made by a fictional character is ridiculous. I only found that once in this movie and it was only a brief.  I'm a real fan of action movies and this wasn't one, but they are very cheap movies to make. The acting and direction are not really good. The fact that people are complaining that this movie is not like one made by the "Munch" guys is not funny. The only thing that made this movie even more disappointing than the bad acting was the stupid plot. The actors and actresses did the best job in this one so they should be compensated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You've seen it on the news a few times. This is an utter failure. The acting is awful, the direction is weak, the characters are wooden, the plot is weak. If it's not a horror film, it's a bad remake of Frankenstein. I'll give it 2 points, but this is the worst movie of 2013. In the end, there are some good parts and a few moments of fun. But the bad are only a few minutes of fun, the big majority of the movie just is nothing but annoying, stupid jokes, and worst of all, little characters. Some of the characters aren't even funny, and some are the funniest actors i've ever heard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing a movie made by Steve Belknack, I decided to watch this film on the advice of my former teacher. However, I soon found that it was boring and just plain terrible. The dialog was horrible, the music was awful, and the film itself was very stupid. I ended up watching the entire film in one sitting and said I was a 'bad guy' for taking the time to see it. I mean, that's what you do. Not only does this film do the opposite of what it claims to do; you spend your time watching someone else's horrible movie and then have the pleasure of making yourself sick to see a really awful film, without even realizing what you're doing.  If this movie is for me, I will have to admit that it actually got a little bit better. The acting is quite good, though it is very disappointing that the whole film can be so bad when you are so invested in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie had no redeeming feature in terms of plot, or even storyline, but it was a poor attempt at a horror film. there was a good film in the book and the fact that this made it a bad one is evident by the weak direction. what a waste of an idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, it's funny to even mention! The storyline is weak and the only reason you really care is that the movie is the funniest movie you have ever seen. The plot is lame, the dialog is weak, it lacks depth, the plot was very predictable.  The plot of this movie is extremely convoluted and very predictable, all of the bad effects and bad story elements are not so well placed, the ending is bad and all the scenes are poorly made. This movie really was terrible, I cannot recommend this movie. It's like a movie that only shows how bad it looks in the dark, it only shows the bad scenes, but not as bad as it looked during the daytime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible...I'm not sure how you can say it's bad, but it's pretty bad.  But this film does have a redeeming feature. It is the funniest thing I have seen in the past thirty minutes. It's so, so terrible I'm having trouble letting myself talk about it. It doesn't come across that way.  The first thing I could say is that it has some good special effects. I think those effects were great, but this movie just doesn't seem like the movie I knew. There's nothing new.  My second point is that the ending, in which everyone is killed in their sleep, has absolutely nothing new to do in this film. There was a lot of action in the movie, including a lot more gun violence. They had a great plot and the ending is pretty interesting. However, the overall plot seems so dull and uninteresting... I couldn't wait to get it out, but unfortunately I don't want to admit it as a movie of all things. I have read about movies, and I'm sorry to say that I didn't really see anything new, so I can't say the movie was very interesting.  I think the ending wasn't good...I'll tell you what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the most terrible films I have ever seen in my life. A little bit of a story was interesting but it just had too many wasted minutes. A lot of the acting seemed like it had been recorded in a big studio. I was wondering why the actors seemed to be in this place.  The story was predictable, the movie was too old and too little explained. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't deserve to be on any top 10 list of horror films. It contains one extremely weak scene, one very weak story line and one decent performance, which really just sucks. I watched it on channel 4 and I watched at the top and only the bottom was good. I expected to have been bored watching this movie, but instead I was left with a huge hole in my heart, wondering why that was happening to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good film to watch. There is no story, no story-line. No storyline, no character, and just lots of "fancier" movies and junk. The acting is horrible. I found the film "Gatherings" very boring, and I am wondering if the movie is made for kids or not.  This movie was about an annoying guy who takes a really big (a lot) blow-up at the end of his career. A really stupid story. You won't get to find a hot girl who wants to have sex with him. He got a really nice, hot wife, but that's it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In an attempt to salvage the dignity of a famous actor, the late great Jean-Franco is forced to fight off the nasty, sleazy, sleaze of a sequel.  In this film, the main villain is a character who was killed not by the killer but by an evil virus that is so vile it doesn't smell or taste or taste. The fact that the villain can't smell is just bad. Also, the only supporting role that actually seems interesting in this film is the one played by Anthony Nasca. I'd like to see some respect to this man.  The acting is dreadful, with bad special effects that look like they're from the sets and costumes of The X-000 sets. The actors are really bad and the only thing that's good is the special effects.  As I said, it's a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disgrace. I don't know if it was because it was not very well-written, but the direction is SO bad, so bad, I can't figure out why. The storyline is nothing, but a few lines, a few words and some jokes, but there are some very strange scenes, and I can not figure out where they belong. I was never really bothered, but if I liked this I would like it more and I didn't like it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about as bad a film as a film can be. Even worse than the previous entries, this film was bad. The actors in the film were very bad, the director had a major blind spot, the cinematop is poorly cast, the actors and actresses had terrible lines, the dialog was bad, and the overall plot was terrible. But the good things about the film, and most of the good in the movie were the actors. The scenes in the theater were wonderful. This is the only movie to include this horrible cast in the entire history of the cinema, and no, this is not even the worst film ever!   If you are one of those people who actually watches this film, then you probably won't be able to tell whether the movie is garbage, or if you liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a bad excuse to waste a movie. Not only one person who was part of this movie was part in it and that alone proves that this was bad. It doesn't have a single point, only an excuse. If you want to waste your time in watching this stupid waste of an action-movie, you have to watch it. It is not worth watching or listening. I gave this movie a 4, which is probably because it was made at an English speaking class. This movie has no value. Its just a big waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I recall, in the first episode, when there was a story at the beginning of the movie, it was "The Man", who had his wife, his car, and another couple with him. I thought that the story was too big, and that the plot was just too weak. I don't know if the other episodes were filmed in that format. I also think the premise was so stupid that it didn't make it a movie anymore. I just wonder if this was the case for the whole show. I can't believe that I would have laughed. If I were a kid, I would've laughed at the scene of a car falling in a ditch. But now, in my own opinion, this movie is garbage. It's really bad to watch for kids who are into "Motorsterics", because I would never watch it again. And it isn't funny at all. I think I have watched the last episode and would never give this movie to anyone under 18. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching the original episode of "Natsimode", I was hoping that this movie would be better than the previous one. But I was wrong. It's just terrible. I'm an old guy, and I watched this movie thinking I might enjoy it. The problem with "Nasimode" is that the writers, like the previous episode, just forget to do anything, and they simply put some goofy jokes in the middle of the movie. This movie isn't like the one I enjoyed with the aforementioned episode, and it doesn't even have a decent story. It can't get a decent ending, either. And I really wanted it to be a comedy movie, but instead of doing that, they put out a pointless "thrust" where a character gets shot in the head with a gun, then tries to get the bullet out of his brain so it goes into the body of another guy. So, in an example of a Hollywood joke: "The person who shot him is also a fan of John Belushi." You know that John Belugies is a little famous, right? So that's why they put in this one. You know what I'm talking about: the stupidest thing I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not really big on horror films but this one seems like one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. It's not funny or interesting at all but the acting is bad. What the heck was in the plot of this film I don't really care. The acting was pretty poor in the first half of the movie I thought it was pretty low compared to the actors who gave some great performance. This movie was very bad I guess I might have to see it with a better director if I'm gonna see it in a horror movie. I don´t like this type of movie really I donít understand how this type is made anymore I don one doubt there is a director like this. There were two parts in the film I didn't understand. I think the way they put in the parts and made it seem so they don't have all the talent to do it and the actors should have known better characters. And the way the camera worked was too slow, it seemed like it only moved one inch so it was hard for me to watch the shots. This could have been a better movie. Or at least better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is very old and I couldn't understand why anyone would want to see it. The only thing that kept me watching was the lack of storyline, the lack in terms of plot, and the lack an emotional story to end. In the end I just wanted to die. I just felt disgusted and embarrassed at the lack value of the film, and at the fact that it came out of some old college drama. I was left wondering if they had ever actually seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a completely terrible movie. It's the same, only in a totally different direction. I won't spend much time to discuss this movie, but if you are gonna see this movie in a big name movie, you would be a dead pile. If you want to rent it, go ahead and rent it anyway. Don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really curious about this movie: Is it a documentary? Was it even filmed in a documentary format? I don't know. And how was it filmed in that? I'll be interested to learn.  Well, the film itself is quite interesting. But unfortunately it's pretty awful. A little bit of history goes into the story and then we're introduced to a totally absurd plot. There are many weird and strange things happen in this movie, but it's just too convoluted to follow.  It's a very boring plot, really, you just can't find anywhere else like it. I didn't even know what happened. There is an odd sequence where a couple of people are standing on top of a mountain of snow. When the guy is walking around and he notices that they are standing there, then he suddenly turns to look around to make sure he didn't see his wife. And suddenly he sees his wife's sister (Kathryn!) is sitting on a mountain. He sees his sister, but doesn't know that he just saw the other man on the mountain.  Then he gets in a fight with the brother. It seems like he killed his wife, but apparently, he didn her first!  The acting is pretty poor.  And it's not very interesting either. The plot is actually quite interesting and it makes some of the scenes amusing, but, unfortunately it does not really go anywhere. Some parts are pretty good, but the story is bad. Some of the jokes are funny, but they are just so unbelievable that they're just boring.  A couple of the bizarre moments that make this movie are just weird. You can see a really creepy version of a dead body in a cave, but you don't really think it's a creepy thing. There's some weird stuff like this sort of weird man who gets into a fight, but there's nothing creepy enough to make you feel anything like that. He kills some of his victims and tries to get into the office with this stupid little robot that has a very creepy body. When he gets into the offices, he takes some of them to get a look at some of their stuff. There was some weird scenes with a couple weird women walking around. The weirdest thing I saw in this film was the guy on the train. And the weirdest part of this movie was a guy who just moved the whole group into a bus with a box.  Overall, the acting was pretty bad. I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You really do get something out of it. There's some pretty good performances on the film, but the lack of characters is very disappointing. You get something or someone to do, but you don't really get what you wanted. I don't know what's been bothering me with this movie. It is a poor excuse for the genre. Maybe a TV show, a movie, or a movie set in a fictional universe. However, I really don't feel like watching this at the cinema. The story is stupid and is totally illogical. The only redeeming thing in this movie is the soundtrack. But, I don`t know where they are. I just can't see any of them anymore. The ending is terrible. I won`t be watching this movie ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as I'm concerned, this movie had some excellent moments but it also had the most ridiculous plot.  This movie was nothing short of horrible acting. The premise of this movie was an old lady who discovered her true and true love after having a dream that she had to her own body and all she needed was to live forever. The movie didn't deliver even that promise.  There are two more scenes where the protagonist is having the same dream that he discovers, and one of them is about a scene of a body that he sees in the forest. This is the reason that the main actor wasn't happy with the scenes he ended to make.  The scene where the main character fell in love with a girl who he thought would not have to live in the world is the worst scene in the whole movie. It doesn't make it clear that she was "smooth on the surface". There are many scenes where she is looking at the woman who is sitting next to him in bed and he's trying to get her down to an insane depth. The guy says, 'I'm just dreaming about my girlfriend and she's sleeping', but this just doesn't go for more than a minute.  What's really surprising about the movie is the ending. Most movies, especially the classics, end on an amusing scene - the ending is interesting to watch. This isn't, and it didn't really get much message.  If you have a good imagination, you can get lost in this movie, but it doesn't. I just don't believe there is any real message. The main character is obviously not a person who was going to go to life with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we first heard about this movie we thought, "the first of it's kind." At the very least we thought that it could possibly be good. This movie was a completely inept attempt to deliver what we hoped would be a movie with some substance, some spark, and most importantly, a storyline. For whatever reason, this film isn't that. The story was about a couple who have a daughter who is addicted to crystal meth (and is so addicted that she's got a job working in a drug store.)  They decide to sell her into the meth trade and to get out of the business. The first scene has the father talking to his daughter about his plans to sell a crystal meth, which her mother has to sign on to. The next scene has a woman trying to convince the father that she has killed her boyfriend and was then forced to kill him. Then we get the guy who tries to rape the daughter's mother with a bottle of crystal meth.  In the second scene, the guy is telling his girlfriend that he's in love with her and then taking off his condom to get rid of her. And that's only one of the worst scenes I've ever seen.  There is another scene that makes the movie almost laugh-laughing. They want you to laugh so you can keep rolling past it. If you were to laugh at the scene and then laugh the same way, you would make yourself sick.  If the actors were good, it would be great. Unfortunately, they do not have the talent to do so. This is probably a typical Hollywood production. You may want to wait for it to be over before you see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it on TV late at night. I was bored and went to see it because it was funny. But not much of it made me laugh.  After watching it, I decided to cancel. I thought that I couldn't understand the situation. I kept asking why there would be people calling a woman and saying she was fat. I'm glad I didn't think about it. If I had an inkling of what was going to happen, I'd think that the characters would have been killed off. The acting is just terrible. Most of the action scenes are in a room. The whole movie was completely unrealistic. Some scenes just aren't there. Some actors do great job of making their scenes. Unfortunately, there are too many dumb characters and they can't act like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is interesting, but the acting is terrible. The movie is not a story.  In order to get a few laughs you have to believe that this movie is about the future. There are no ghosts or vampires, there are no aliens or any scary creatures that we will ever see on this movie.  There is no plot, no characters. Just a bunch of teenagers that are forced to do their homework because of some crazy guy and his girlfriend. This movie could've been a much better joke if they had some decent acting and funny songs. It's just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a piece of crap with a disappointing cast and very low plot. The main character has his son in a wheelchair and his wife is in a room upstairs watching him - with a cat sitting in front of him.  I watched this movie in a local video store - I was looking for something similar to "The Last Summer" and couldn't find it. The film had many "plot-twister" moments and the ending had nothing to do with the film in its own story. The acting was bad, the scenes were not interesting and the cinematography wasn't good either.  The movie was a waste of money - I won't watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many times I wish I could get a glimpse of the director. But I don't have much time to watch this movie... I can't even watch it in my sleep and I don`t care to pay anything. A couple of things that I did miss were the fact that there was no explanation why the movie is called "Avalmorgia" when it was made. It is a weird movie but that is not an excuse for a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the dumbest of the worst movies I have ever seen, it really is the worst. I mean that I am a "hardened" adult. I love watching some of the funniest movies i have ever made but this is the first one that I have watched. I think the "humor" of this movie is too far too dark and not funny enough.  My rating is 8 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are several times in the film where an old man looks at his younger sister with a worried face. It just happens that he suddenly turns to her and starts a dance. Oh, but that's not all, he's also touching her chest. It's not quite disturbing, but it's pretty annoying and unprofessional and really bad. It really isn't just bad, it's really bad, but I can't imagine what made this so awful. The movie is so bad that it doesn't make any sense... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to say this is the biggest waste of money I have seen since the last "B" or whatever the term "Batch" in the last thirty years. I couldn't really find my "B's" for an accurate term but I did get a brief glimpse at the movie in "B", and I thought it to be very weak in some of the scenes. It had the feel of a movie made of a grain of flour and made in a few hours of kitchen scraps.  This movie was really bad because it has a very limited concept.   It would have made more "B"'s" and would have added an interesting plot. The fact that the whole movie revolves around a very weak acting and script is what kept me from thinking more deeply and making me feel like I was making a movie. The film has a lot of boring scenes and some bad dialogue, so don't get caught in that mix. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm looking for a movie that doesn't like "The Secret History", but if I get to the stage, I'll be in a few seconds. This movie is a complete non-story to my mind.  What happens? Oh, and the guy who's best in all of history...  The guy who saved humanity and has a very famous face is now in a small town and wants to rent a movie for $1,000. It has to be a movie with a very short time in it, I guess.  I think it's better for a 2 minute film to be about 10 minutes. Even that isn't much longer. I guess it will be a lot like the beginning of "The Chronicles of "Gears" with a small cast and a slightly slow pace.  The characters are very predictable, and this movie starts to become a cliché.  There's a lot of stupid lines, most of which are about a "friend" with an annoying name, and most of them are just the same old lines we've seen in many movies, such as a line like "sucking for the first time" or a movie version of "Caged Announment." The movie was completely predictable. The only thing that made this movie any good was the ridiculous scene where one of the cops gets shot. How do we get out of here?  Also, this movie is completely without a real message. There was no story, no message, and no characters that weren't supposed to be killed. You can't make a joke about "that guy" in this movie, because you're not supposed to kill him for the rest of the movie.  So, this is an attempt to make an interesting look at the secret history of a long-lived hero. However, it really doesn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts in a very strange and strange place with a pretty annoying character (who we can only assume is one of the "mad scientists" mentioned in the film), a female named Maggie who was the subject of a secret experiment by the mad scientist (the infamous Dr. Hopper), who also had a giant monster that had the ability to control people. In short, the film is very poorly developed, and it fails to be interesting and it just ends. The supporting cast (the lead) don't seem to develop into the supporting characters, and they were also very forgettable. In fact, the only thing that was nice about this movie was the director. In addition, if there is any real story (in which the characters interact with each other), I would expect it to be very interesting. Unfortunately, it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible and bad, no, that's OK. But if you're looking for something that you could just do without this lousy movie, you can do it without having a plot. I'm not sure how it got to this level.  The plot is interesting and at least a bit thrilling, but it fails to deliver. I didn't get to know how the characters were introduced, what they were doing, who were their friends and their relationships to each other.   The ending is very unsatisfying, too.  Overall, this movie is bad, but that doesn't make it an outright bad movie, even if you like bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have to assume it was one of the lowest rated films i have ever seen in my life. i've seen better movies with better story lines and better actors. This movie is not even worth the 5 stars that it got. I mean, if it was the best it could be, it would be worth it. In fact, if you were expecting to see some real, intelligent plot, this movie was nothing but a waste of time. I thought you could actually have made a great movie if you decided to make the movie in an original way. The actors were horrible, the story was poor, the cinematography was terrible, and the plot was predictable. If you wanted to see a real, original, good movie with some intelligent actors and some very entertaining story lines, you would have been better off having another one. I am a believer of the concept of a "good movie" because this movie fails. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a movie but a movie set in the woods of New England. The main premise is the same as any other silly movie, the only difference being that in this one, the director, and a co-director (which I've never heard before). The movie's main premise revolves around the premise of a bigoted, obnoxious dude who kidnapes another woman (I guess, I didn't watch the whole thing). The main character is a very lame, very shallow story, and the end-title is only mildly amusing (though I guess a lot of other people found this so entertaining).  I was really, really pissed at the "clown" who decided to make this film. He knew what I was thinking and what I wanted to say about this movie, but what he says does not make it sound so convincing. I mean, who says he is a coon and is also a cojunk? I don't know. It doesn't make this movie a fun one to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't try to do anything new with this idea. Instead, it keeps the viewer watching the same old, worn, and boring "tales of courage" story.  I don't believe that there is something new in these stories. And not only in the story itself, but also the acting. It's just a few cliche lines about how a "sister" lives and dies and how she will die. The plot is even worse than what we see in "Warriors of the South" and this is far from the movie I want to see.  This must be the worst movie ever made for those who have nothing to do with movies. I don;t even see "Warrior."  I really don't blame this movie for its disappointing ratings. It was bad because the movie was based on a movie series of a much older series, but the movie is so much worse because it was based in a movie in the original. I didn't even finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was terrible. The only good part was the original ending. I didn't want to give them too much of an ending so they didn't get to go that far in. But they do let them get away with the original endings. It was awful. I don't know what happened to the original conclusion... they gave me a small clue.  The first part of the movie was very good but the end was horrible. I really believed they were going to be in another sci-fi movie but they just never got past that. The characters were horrible. The movie had absolutely no continuity. No one was involved in the plot, there were no character connections and the actors were horrible actors. I thought there was a huge amount of space in the movie but that was not the case. They only did a couple minor scenes in the beginning of the film but they had to spend a lot of time to establish the characters.  Overall it's not going to save your heart. Avoid this movie at all costs. I recommend throwing it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife, not surprisingly, watched this piece with the intention of watching it, so I decided to watch it when she was alone, so we watched it alone at least three times, and she didn't care for much of the material except for the plot. It seemed like most of the time she just wanted to see another movie.  The plot seemed so confusing. I just assumed it was a "journey to Africa" - something that had never been filmed before, which made me feel so dumb as to watch this movie and wonder why "Africa" would ever exist. It doesn't make any sense.  I felt really embarrassed after seeing it. I'm really unhappy that this movie ruined a movie that was so good. If this was a movie I would like to see, I would watch it just to get a few more years of life into it. If you want to see "African America" I would suggest a similar movie that has been made before, and just made a few years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really stupid movie. I'm not sure what the heck that people were thinking when they made this movie. They can't believe that it was made! I've been watching this for five years and I've never found anything else like it. The movie tries to make the best out of every dumb cliché and bad plot, all of which are just about one thing. It's so bad, and it doesn't make up for its pretense. I wish the producers were smart enough to put some more time into the movie. It starts out well but eventually it is just a busted nail. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with a beautiful beach scene and a beautiful girl at the beach with a nice haircut. Then, with great music, we find out that the girl is a hot beauty who really isn't all that sexy. Oh well. Not great. I'm just kidding. The movie starts with a few shots of the hot beach scene - a really hot girl. The next scene is when she's in a bikini, and then it's a nice little bit when she goes to the beach and shows off to her boyfriend's girlfriend. Then it moves into a big blow-up scene, and I think it was about 2-3 minutes before she's back again. The girl goes back to the apartment and does a couple of scenes with her boyfriend, who just has the same girl-doll-of-battery-as-in-the-making-of a girl-humping-in the chair. She then goes to bed with her friend. I think this is only 1 minute and 1 minute before she gets back to work. Oh, and she starts kissing another guy, which I guess was the same beach scene. Then she returns to her desk and starts kissing her. Wow, that was almost 1 minute. Then there's another scene where she's making out with her sister, and a real hot guy comes up and grabs her. The guy is a really hinky guy, and after some time, she's got some pretty dirty sex with her. She is really hot, but the guy's actually quite attractive, so she falls down on his knee and lets him put it in her hair. Then another guy (guess it's the same guy) comes up, and that's all for fun. The two of them then try to have intercourse in the back room, and he's actually a real guy, not a chick-wannge!  I was disappointed that the scene with the hot girl in the beach only lasted 1 minute, and only about 2 minutes before the movie ends. I just felt like that would take 1 or 2 minutes to get to where it is. I never got bored with that scene. I don't see any real message to this movie. A few scenes involving the girl and the hot guy are good but there's not much to see or anything to talk about. If you have any taste for that sort of "girard" type of film, you'll be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You will find a good movie that you can only find in one film. This movie is the only one.  The acting is pretty bad, but I am sure that many people were expecting something more. What this movie lacks is a story. That was missing in this film.  If you are not one of the film's original or the last one, you might find it entertaining but not so. If you decide to rent this movie then you will find it pointless.  This is a very bad attempt at a horror film. Even if you are an avid horror fan, it is a bad choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I have to wonder if they had made any money. I saw it in Canada and they had to pay so that they couldn't get any money for it. My rating is 1 out of 10. I am a big fan of the original "The Six Million Dollar Man" but to this point I can't imagine seeing this movie. It is really boring and only a few moments in which there is nothing happening and then some strange moments to make it interesting, like having some sort of gunfight or a giant explosion, etc. It's no fun. But this film only gets a 2 out of "2". The good things are good in the beginning and there are good shots in the middle. But sadly, there's nothing worth watching. A huge bummer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing a few pictures of this movie: "The Legend of Frankenstein" (1992) & The Princess Bride (1992). Since there are some minor scenes here, I thought I'd do a little research, so I decided to find out. The first thing I read was a movie that is not based on any real stories. This was an utterly awful movie. The plot and story were so bad, you would wonder if it had any relevance to reality, as opposed to just playing out a couple of scary scenes. When one learns what the scene in "The Witch" are about, it is simply laughable.  I gave this movie a 8 because the plot was interesting, although I had some idea that it might be interesting. I am really tired and bored watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing more like these cheap movies I'm more familiar with than this crap. It's bad, but I thought it was funny until the end. The only thing I liked was the fact that it was a "thrill" as it was made. It seemed like it had a "vibrant" mood, and I've got to look at my old college and see that was only a "fem" film with a lot of boring acting and a low budget. The story of a little girl who can tell you when people are about to die by taking pills is just bad. I guess it had to be made because it had been done many times before. The script and dialog are pretty good. The "acting" was really bad in this case, too. There are some pretty good actors, but none of them could convince me that they are real actors. There's also some annoying parts in this movie that were just not developed, with some people saying that the acting was good, but the story didn't develop. The movie would have been a lot better if there were no music, just great acting. There weren't too many scenes and characters. That was the whole point of this movie. None of them were good enough for the plot. I won't see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this at a movie theater for a few minutes and after the previews kicked, I didn't care much. I was completely embarrassed by some of the characters. They seemed really shallow. And the ending was terrible. I don't know if that is because there is a lot of nudity in the movie, but it's not really that much, so I think it is either an excuse for a weak plot, or just a simple "horror" movie that has no imagination.  Overall, it was a terrible movie and I recommend not watching this movie again. I would recommend skipping it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a letdown: this film was so bad that I had to put it in the bottom of my iMac. This movie is just plain bad. Not only did it show some of the characters in a bad place, but also the bad humor... I have no sympathy for this movie.  I was looking for something better to watch. I found this on DVD "cinemas", and it has been "crated" for the past 20 years. I gave it a 7 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just terrible, especially for the fans of the series. This film had no plot, so much of the dialog was confusing, with much filler. Some of the characters were very well-written, but none of them were there when we needed them. There were no real reason for any of the events, and the only storyline seemed to be a generic one that really nothing concerned the characters. The film would have been interesting if the director had done something interesting to the characters and instead portrayed their actions as something like a series of flashbacks. The acting was very poor in the film, especially when considering that the movie was intended for a family audience, and when they gave some of the action scenes for a laugh, the film felt flat and without any real plot. It was so dull that it was almost laughable to anyone. I can only say that if you are a big fan of the show, you might consider buying this one, as a cheap knock-off. I wouldn't buy this film if I had the chance to meet the original cast, because I've seen it in several different times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was absolutely terrible, you can tell that because i was looking for something that I can see the video for. I just went with a friend and we sat through it with him, and it made me sick. I cannot say that it is the type of movie i would have chosen to see. I was very unhappy with the acting and it seemed like it was just so bad that it had to be removed from the movie....you would have been better doing something like this....  it was an OK way to try and sell a movie in a very small group of people, but unfortunately it didn't really work. There are so many people that are so confused that the movie isn't really very entertaining and it doesn't even have a chance to act.  The story is stupid and it really seems to have to be some sort of a drug based movie....the only reason that this one was made was because it was about a man and his nephew who had been shot in the face and they wanted to find out the reason for the shooting. I thought they could figure out how and why. The story about this incident is pretty stupid and the ending just leaves me wondering why exactly they want to be called a horror film, because they obviously didn't even tell that it was a horror movie, but i don't care. I've never seen anything so stupid. I mean the people who are making it are so ridiculous that they are going to put this movie in the "big leagues" only if they are actually good actors, they would make something like a horror horror film...and then they wouldn't put this one in the big leagues. I don't know who is even making it. I'm going to keep on watching it for fun for the sake of it but sadly I will do nothing.   I give this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really like movies made for the sake of profit, or for some reason. I'm really bad at making a horror film, the acting was awful and the story wasn't even remotely interesting. I would never sit and watch a movie where the main characters are just talking about how awful they are. This movie was full of a lot of pointless plot lines and a very ridiculous plot. While watching the movie I couldn't tell what happened in the beginning of it, there was no real connection with the characters, I never knew who was dead or who was alive. It didn't really make much sense to make a real horror film. I don's believe a lot that these movies are meant for commercial use. But when I sat down with it, I really didn't care. There isn't even a plot. There's a lot more to it than just killing people for money. There was very little excitement in it, and the ending was completely predictable. I just couldn't care for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film, there are two characters who are supposedly very close and friends. They get a long-time partner, who has to do a lot of work on his time and the rest of the cast try to find this partner, although it seems that they have no idea he's there. The rest of this movie is spent watching some random person do lots of random things (usually sitting in the car while driving away from the car) for no reason and then all of the things just happen to make absolutely nothing worth going through. There's also just an endless parade of annoying scenes, the characters are in a loop and the film is basically a comedy-free movie. There is also something else in this film that I couldn't make out of it, but I can't really complain. Maybe it's some sort of game show but that's not what it is, it's just a dumb film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just don't know why I bothered to see this. It's not a story, but it really seems like a really bad film. I only found out later on that it's been described as a thriller and I can't find out why. It really has nothing to do with the real world or the real people and it's just a bad, pointless story.  I'd like to see one of those documentaries films instead of this one, but I'm going to tell you one reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film (the third in a series) of people who have been diagnosed with a diagnosis of being brain damage, so that it is the result of a genetic disease, and apparently they cannot help them, but instead a mysterious entity, that feeds on the power of the people in question to get others, the "infected", into a body of flesh and blood, so they must fight.  I don't think there's any real difference to this film. It is just a very bad show. If you can call it a horror film or a "horror film", then it is.  The plot of this movie revolves around a "shapeshifter" (and what the hell does he do?), which apparently uses his magic to infect "nurse" people and force them to fight. This is all in a circle of people with nothing but the hope of finding one that does not succumb to being infected.  This is really no different from the previous films. In one of these horror films (the first, "The Exorcist") I noticed that the characters in the film all have one thing, which is their desire to live and not be killed. But in this film the characters all have the same thing, except that their desire of not being killed is only because they're infected with a virus.  That's right, only a virus has made them immune to being attacked.   If you had any sense of the human being, you would say that these actors are stupid, and this is no different.  So if you liked the film above or the first one, you might think the first film to be a good one and they'd have nothing to add to it. For example, when one of the characters says, "I'm just a human", it doesn't make much sense for anyone to say the same things in this one. If I could only have put that thought into the film, it would've been quite entertaining. But the truth is, the whole "nurses" in the movie are no different than they were in the "exorcist" video.  If I had made this film on my own, I would have left it at that point in the story, and it would probably not have lost any plot. It's just just like the first time when I saw it.  You can just imagine the scene where the whole family were infected and all of them, along with their whole families, went into the "nurs
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie is that every person is going to take the name of God and is in it a religious religion and has to save the world. It is very simplistic in the least possible way.  I have to say that in my opinion, this movie was poorly written. There is a little hint of Christianity in the beginning, but it's pretty useless in my eyes. I have heard people say the plot is "The Messiah" so i assume that the whole movie is about Jesus.  The ending is totally predictable. The ending ends up feeling like a cheap thriller. It seems as if they didn't have much to add to the plot, but the movie is so bad that it can't be considered "good".  If you like a bit of fun horror, this is the place to avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that this movie was terrible. I did not understand the plot. The characters were so dumb and unfunny. They were just boring. I couldn't feel anything, which is what I had expected from it. And this movie also reminded me of a few instances of crappy horror films like "Bloody Summer" which are so bad that they even got made into movies. (Yes, it did). The plot had a funny bit, but that was about the time when I found the idea that the whole movie was about "wasting" people in order to try to make fun of the dead. This movie seemed to be about "killing" people and being killed by people as the people came to watch and then killed the people. That is so sad for an old lady like my mother, who had such a life and I have heard she liked to take out more than one person. This only left a lingering question about why they died. Perhaps they would have used the same tactic with the "death" of their parents. Maybe someone who is already dead and could help with the grieving people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a more serious movie to watch and saw it in this sub-genre. I went for a minute. I felt really, really, dumb. I knew that I would only watch one of those. I didn't care, but I didn�t care that they wanted to kill people. This movie wasn�t the usual one. I was disappointed to find this movie was so awful that it didn�real, was really scary.  If I hadn�t watched the movie before, I probably wouldn�ll have been horrified at the ending, but it made it a bit easier to swallow. The storyline is OK, but the movie doesn�t go anywhere near the "good" part.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the initial hype surrounding this film comes out, it begins to feel like an effort to do a cheap, low budget "R-9" film. A plot is told only in the brief, brief, opening credits sequence, which features the villain (Dirk N. Stern) as part of a "Bounty" of ten million, while it takes place during the film. I guess that's to make a small point, as this film would've been great if Stern was cast as the villain instead of a villain, but to be honest, it's a lousy effort. After being so much hype, the story suddenly loses focus, as there's an effort, but fails to make any point, at all. It's a bad film, but it's not as bad as I expected. I'll give this film a 7 out of 10, but I really don't like it in particular. It only showed some moments of entertainment, but they were very few. I'm a fan of this film, so I guess I'll just let it go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. Although the plot is very interesting, the movie is not all that it has been. Although I liked the idea of a killer who had the reputation of the 'Big' Boss', unfortunately this is only a mediocre excuse to make a 'B" film. The acting is awful. The fact that the real people are now appearing in the movies is laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible and I was very surprised to see so many people like it. It was very obvious that people didn't care about any of the actors or the story. The acting wasn't that good. Most of the characters looked the same as they did in the original. It just felt like I was watching a made-up movie and the stars were all in bad places. The plot was terrible. It seemed like something only had two or three actors that actually could act. The best actors in the movie were "the great ones". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty boring and not that interesting. If you are a fan of some form of American film production, then you might want to see this one because you would like it, but not in particular. If a good story is, you'll be bored with this movie, and will not enjoy anything else in the movie.  The story itself, as I am sure it does, is very predictable. It's just like how one writer like a lot of others, can write a script like this. If the character is in a good mood, I would have no problem with that. But this one just doesn't have that special quality.  I'll add that the ending is a bit predictable, but even so, I think it could have been a bit better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is, at best, a bad attempt to take the life of "The Walking Dead". Don't even go out of your way to see this film. If you're a fan of this movie, you might watch it for the sake of the fun. But you will only miss out on the basic story lines. As such, you'll miss out for the film's premise, the supporting characters, and the climax. As if it weren't bad enough. You'll just be bored. I wouldn't say I hate this film; it was interesting enough to do the story, but it really just ruined the overall enjoyment of it. I wish I'd had the money to make something better, but I'm forced to put it out for myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is very much like "The Matrix" and a sequel to the old movies. they just show how awful this movie gets. the main characters are extremely stupid. they are obviously just looking for their "friends" instead of trying to find things in the world that they want to be.  The story is a lot of crap and you are just so bored, so that you really do not care for what happens and just look at the story and let it pass you like it. the story is about a young boy who has got a girl (the girl) to try a new sex scene which is a terrible idea. it's just plain stupid and pointless. there is no love interest in them and you really want them to be killed. the acting is terrible. the movie is not interesting. It's not like anything special. It is just a waste of time to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not even worth a viewing by me, although I'm looking forward to this movie so I might see it to be on a DVD, and perhaps I might do so. Even so, I was annoyed at the fact that I just don't know what to say about this movie. I was expecting a documentary type of movie, but this movie was neither informative nor entertaining. The acting was bad, and the plot was very disappointing. The scenery was very bad in most of the scenes, and most of my favorites were so bad that they weren't even mentioned in the plot. In my opinion, this movie is the worst film I have ever seen. There was some very good shots throughout the movie, and that was the only movie that I have seen that made me watch. But the overall effect is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Way of the Man" (1989) is a piece of garbage that is nothing but a pitiful, unful of itself and pretentious piece of trash. It is not even decent as a film that was supposed to be an insightful study of men in the middle-age. It just shows the standard "male's life" -- a lack of common sense, arrogance, and the utter disregard of common decency -- in plain, un-sparing, clichéless waste of time. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the ability to deliver a few laughably ridiculous moments. The ending, though, is painfully predictable, as you know. And while the movie makes itself all about the famous and easily predictable "women's lifestyle," the rest is just plain awful.  The acting is terrible, the scenery is too pretty, and most of the dialog is so boring and uninsentient that you wonder why they'd put so much money into making this movie. I found the movie on TV a little more exciting than the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A simple mis-hit movie: lots of bickering, lots of boring scenes, lots a little action, some scenes involving a character that could not even be named, and a bit too many shots of the protagonist kissing another girl.  There is some nice glimpses of a couple, the two guys have their lives, but after a few hours of viewing they're all sort of forget about them. Some of the scenes are cute, but not the most disappointing. Most of them are pretty interesting and well-drawn, but most of them aren't that good.  The only redeeming aspect of this movie is the cinematography. It's an interesting genre, but the director failed to make the movie a good one.  This is the kind of movie that usually only gets released in the summer.  I give this one a two and a halfs, because it contains a decent number of interesting scenes and a decent amount of interesting story lines, but it's just not enough to keep you watching for much longer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. It had a lot of good features, and I thought that it would be a good film. However, when I watched it, I found out that the directing was very weak, the actors were terrible, and the plot was extremely weak. Even worse than I expected.  After watching the first episode I was very disappointed.  I think this movie is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd say this is one of the worst movies I've seen. I was watching this at my local video store as a kid when it came out on DVD. I think my generation (i.e. me and my 2 sisters) can't stand to see this crap. It is simply a stupid, cheap, cheap movie with a very little plot (if there is a plot at all). The acting is wooden, the script is thin, the shots are so bad they almost look like graffiti, the dialog is bad, the special effects (which are not even good) were bad, and the movie itself had an annoying soundtrack (which, I guess, was just as much as the movie was bad). And what is the last word that comes to my mind? This is the movie that made my parents think my brother was a "sad little boy" (he is my older brother). I wish I hadn't bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the kind that people like to watch for a few hours so that they can get the "real" plot, nothing to see from the beginning or end. If you are one of the diehards, it is a pretty pointless and stupid way to waste time. I have been to this movie twice and I just can't believe the "plot" ever comes on, it just seems to be a bunch of people in a garage somewhere. If your friends are bored, if you are bored and if you want to get their hopes up for it, this is a bad choice for you.  The ending is bad, too predictable and you get yourself into the rhythm, but you can see a few people being happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is fairly interesting, with a young boy (as we learned) growing up as a child, who is sent by his parents to join a circus for amusement. However, the film tries to break it down into a "comedy", which is not as good as "The Elephant", but still does nothing.   This is a cheap imitation of the classic horror movies of the last decade (some of which were better than "The Exorcist", although none of them was good at all). It can't make much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the absolute dumbest movie i've ever seen. It's really hard to find this movie's origins. What was the director up to when he made this film? Was it the filmmaker's mother? Was he drunk with friends? Was there a lot of money in the production? I can't give this movie a number of points, but it's definitely worse than the title of "The Man With 2 Faces" which I love. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just read the reviews of the movie and i just didn't see the movie as being worthy of your time. The story is very poorly written, so if your time is anything more than to sit and watch something else, you might be more of a "wanted to be" type person. The cast of the actors don't really show enough to make the viewer jump up on the movie itself. The plot is very bad. It would have been so easy to have the protagonist with an army of soldiers and get all his buddies into the movie by making him a leader. It just plain doesn't work. There are plenty of things which don't make sense, such as the fact that they were all taken prisoner by their country. When they finally arrive, we don't see them getting their ships. In general, the movie seems like it was going to be a great movie, with a lot of action and excitement, but the plot is only two dimensional. The acting was pretty bad. The movie also isn't very interesting. The storyline is very poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is horrible. The dialog is bad. I laughed at the first hour of this film, and then turned in shock when I watched the last hour.  In all this film is a collection of mindless mindless scenes, and an irritating cast of characters.  What a shame... The movie is so bad that it is almost embarrassing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are plenty of horror films in these days, but unfortunately they're not as good as the ones done in "B" or the horror genre.  The last movie I saw was "The Purifier", by the director and screenwriter Jason E. Kaufman. The story is about an unnamed priest who becomes obsessed with demons and starts a hunting for demons. At the beginning of the movie, his name is listed in a magazine, but is not seen at all. The plot of the film is a big ol hoax, and I think that's the reason the plot is bad. Not only does it not have any plot, it doesn't have any dialogue, it is unbelievable and pointless. The idea that you need to find some way to deal with it is absolutely ridiculous. Also, you can't tell who did the story is really scary is ridiculous.  And although the story isn't completely horrible, it does make some really scary scenes, but this movie isn't one of those.   The good news about this movie is that it's not directed by Kaufman, but he is making it himself. But this is about as bad a movie that Kaufman ever made. I can say that he did a lot of great work with Kaufman. I just think that one of his characters in this film deserves better screen time. I wish I would have thought that he had done the whole story to a full detail. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has a total lack of plot, a plot twist, no one character, nothing that even resembles anything original, it's just not funny. There is no real plot, and the acting is bad, unless they were in the early-90s when they originally planned this film. Most of the other acts (the best one is one of the best, by the way) are the main actors in this film, but what they do are simply "traditions" without much in the way of actual quality. In the late-90's, people can't find this film in the theatres, and it's been a long time since it had any traction at that time. And I don't really see any stars that can make this film to my standards.  I would have considered making this film a joke if I had done it. It is simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so much like 'Rango' and it had nothing but a bad plot...  My only real problem with this movie was the fact that it ended with 'Rambo' in all of the action sequences and that was the only thing I wanted to see. The acting was pathetic in the way it acted, and it just didn't look like anything in 'Rio'. I would have to agree with them that "Rango" is a very important movie and it has made hundreds of millions and I cannot disagree with them on this but if they want to make a big bucks then they should take that money and spend it to make this crap. But I guess I just don't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was one of the worst films i've ever seen. It had nothing, nothing, and no redeeming quality. It didn't even look like a horror film! In my opinion, this is a complete failure to capture the spirit of "Rashas". I don't believe there is anything worth being an actor. If I was a person who could have been the protagonist of this film, I would have never believed. If it wasn't so bad, i could have laughed at it.  It was just a waste of money to make this movie. It was completely uninteresting. I am not even going to spend a few days viewing it. You would see it in a movie theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a really bad movie with a really terrible premise, a mediocre director (Brent Jones is decent), a really awful script (a horrible plot) and bad supporting cast (who can only act in a crappy movie), and a really lame and uninteresting movie.  For those who like low-budget, low-concept movies and can tolerate it, this movie will disappoint you, because it's just bad.  The best way to avoid this movie is to watch any movie: a comedy (like The Best Movie Ever) and a drama. A comedy is generally a good movie, but even this movie was a failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible, so bad that I had to watch it at a hospital (which was an act of self-defense).  I found this movie to be boring, with little substance.  What can I say?  I guess, "A lot of people like this movie", but don't really like it.  This is a horrible movie, that is at best nothing more than a rip-off, and at worst it's a typical "movie". I have to find out which movie is better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete disappointment, but if you get it at a movie festival, you will probably enjoy this movie. I was a little disappointed because the acting is pretty good, and I think the storyline was good, but unfortunately the movie is weak. The plot and action are extremely weak. This is why I can not give this movie a 10 because this movie is the equivalent of a movie that doesn't have a plot or a plot whatsoever. For example, the acting of the characters is terrible. For instance, a movie named "Loyalists" had a plot that is OK, but it doesn't quite go for its purpose. This movie doesn't. The acting of characters is really bad. I have to give this film a 1/10 because it is just terrible. It's just too bad for the plot. The ending makes no sense. You're thinking about the "good" things and when the film drifts you are just left crying. This really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few months ago I had to take a break, and in the middle of my sleep I am now wondering what I had in mind at that time. This movie has not even made it to the top of the horror pile. While it is supposed to be a horror film, it is not really scary in the way that it is portrayed. The script is really bad. The characters are simply caricatures that you can sit in the theater and make yourself think there is something going on. And I have no idea why people would go out to see this film. It doesn't have any point, and it doesn't go that far in it's story. The direction is horrible, and the actors just don't seem to do anything. It just seems like a waste of time. I would have to assume that the studio was trying to make a horror movie and I have to conclude that they were wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only pray that if the movie is set to being, the story will be more interesting. Unfortunately, it does not. The characters are, in essence, the worst possible part of a film. Not only is the character's behaviour annoying, but the fact that it is so little actually does not make the film interesting.  What was the story of this film? The short plot was told in such a horrible way that I was left in an utter frustration to see the characters in it. The fact that the story is so poorly written, I am afraid to not give this film credit as much as I should. Even though this is a film I was totally unfamiliar with and am unable to locate myself in any of the descriptions, I understand that it's a "documentary", in the truest sense.  I cannot fault this film with bad acting, or the script. I am very confident of the director and the writer, but they have chosen a bad way to make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an awful film. It is so bad that I really wonder if it ever found any audience at the film festival where it made it. As I saw it, it was so bad it couldn't even get past me. I cannot tell which actors did or see which scenes. There was one girl who was the one with a beautiful blonde and red wig, but when she said "I wish i was in her eyes" it sounded like a nightmare. She was a horrible person. It was difficult to tell which part of the movie was directed. The acting was awful, the story was bad, the camera was awful and the camera-making was terrible. There were also some pretty good scenes, but this really made me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is completely unprofessional and ridiculous. For instance the script writer can be so terrible to read! I laughed at the most stupid scenes, like when a black person tries to pick up a girl as they sit around with a young girl that is obviously very ignorant of the world, because that one actually involves two teenagers. Also the fact that the "good" movie in which everyone is a racist and the "bad" movie is just another example of how bad these movies usually are. The good guy gets into some hot chick who has a tattoo in her hair and is more fun than everyone else around her.  The black guy tries to hook up with the young girl, which is the equivalent of a real man and a complete waste of a movie. This is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The plot is not believable, the dialog is just terrible and the only good parts are the scenes of the kids getting away from their parents. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You know how kids are stupid when they are made to think their own words. I guess it was a little too old for that, but they weren't in the slightest. Not even the best of kids, and not a single one should be put in a jail. And what happened to Judy? The only reason we should watch this is to see how she acted towards the kids who were in a hospital for her mother. There's a real message in this film that is the kids should be in the hospital instead of doing everything they want for their parents. The kids are forced to act in their roles, and the only thing that helped Judy was to make sure the children knew that she was responsible for their own safety. The ending just shows us that they are not even worth saving. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the most awful films I ever saw. The plot of this movie was an old man's wife tries to make up a family. The only way you could keep from seeing it would be the endless scenes of sex and violence. The best thing I can say about this movie is, "Why is it called Sex and Death?" You can't take anything so far from the plot. The characters were so incredibly dumb, that they had no chance to survive.  The film did have one good performance. Adam Sanderson, who usually plays pretty, was good. However, he was horrible in this film. He had to try a few times to save this movie but couldn't. His performance was terrible. I think his character did a good job. His scene with Paulie Walsh was better than the other ones. The others were okay. But there is a moment where he doesn't know his lines. This is where you'll wish you'd get the CD on the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie: 1. Bunkie does what a movie would do, and then proceeds to try to pull this out of the bag it made on.  2. That is the point of the movie: Bunkies are the biggest people in the world and can't afford to lose money on a movie.  3. The actors have no dialog.  4. The story is lame.  5. The acting is too weak to make this point.  6. And the plot and the script makes absolutely no sense.  7. You can't make this movie interesting for your mind.  This is the last thing to get from a truly terrible movie: a stupid Bunkiest movie. But, if you see it for yourself, you'll see that you're better off dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script is horrible, the characters are boring, and the movie is just plain bad. The ending, which is really lame, is at least good when it comes out. It's disappointing when you get caught in the middle of the story. It starts to be like a horror movie, when you see characters suddenly appearing in the dark. This has the feeling of a piece of candy in an overgrown bag. This movie was awful but I won't watch the whole movie because the ending could have been a much better story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was supposed to like this movie because it was so good - so bad it couldn't help but screw up. I didn't like the end. I was looking for something to see and was looking to the next movie and something only in my mind was the reason for this movie was to make fun of the badness of this movie. The badness seemed to be much more than what I had initially anticipated and I could even think the story line was more important than the characters. So, it seemed to me to be a bad film - one where there was no fun whatsoever and there was nothing that made it worthwhile to watch. Even though I didn`t agree with the movie and I thought the ending was not as bad as it might be, I just couldn`t take it. My apologies to my friend and friends. I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what I've called. As an example, I find it difficult to get out of a "movie" that contains nothing but a few minutes of nothing. For example, they just go on with their special effects and just continue the action until someone has to die. This is ridiculous. But it is, and I will bet it is because the story, with no actual fact about what is happening, is not done well enough to hold viewers to its story.  The other good aspects of this movie are the acting (like "B" star Omar Elam, in the movie and the movie "Z", for example), the dialog (like John Belalik, who is well, very well), the acting and the acting, but nothing good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like a sick joke of a film made in the early 1990s and directed by a guy who can't act. It's so bad it's just hilarious. If this movie was made in 1994, it would have played like a sitcom about a person who goes into a coma.  In the real world, this movie would be funny. But not in the movie world, in its most ludicrously dumb-ass twist, the "spaghetti and brains" sub-plot, which is not funny at all, is incredibly bad. It is just like watching a movie where someone is playing the violin and all of the people in the audience are sitting in front of a big screen. It looks like they're in front and on the big screen watching everyone trying to get into the show. If you thought it was funny when it made it, you'd probably have a laugh. But if you laughed at it, then you'd have laughed at the first part anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and plot twists were so convoluted and overdeveloped, that I found myself, like a boy who was bored with this movie, asking for it to be dropped.  The fact that this movie was made so stupid I couldn't understand why they wanted to make such a movie! The story was so obviously wrong! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it can't even be described as a movie.  So, in case you are looking to watch something that will be fun and funny, this isn't one of the better things for you. But if you want some sort of horror or suspense you might enjoy it for a few minutes. However, you might just be bored after watching the whole thing.  The story seems to be about the end of the world, and the story seems pretty vague. I only realized that this movie is about a couple of people in a house. And I've heard that it's a horror movie only. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had high expectations for this film and when I saw it in my library I was extremely disappointed. This movie is just plain bad, even worse than the sequel to "Star Trek: The Next Generation". I'm sure that I've seen it twice so I know what I'm talking about, but this really makes no sense. The only real thing this movie does is the fact that it isn't really a movie. It's just a big budget adventure. The main villain is a guy that wants to destroy the earth and he has no problem killing people and killing people, but that's not a movie for action. There are no real plot to the film, and what they are trying to do is just stupid. I think that it has to be a better movie if they made it instead of a "movie with action", because it has some action. This really sucks, because it can't be as good as the first one, because they tried too hard to make a movie about something that is obviously not interesting. The story is a poor excuse for the movie. If you've seen "Star Wars", it's pretty much the same, with some little surprises sprinkled throughout the story, but it's the difference. This is just another disappointment. The action in the film is bad, because the action is not good enough. It starts slow, but everything is pretty good at first. But then after the first few minutes of action, you just want to speed up the pace to get over the story a lot faster. Even so, I'm not surprised because they still have a good story. But, if you get a chance to watch it, you'll probably miss out. But I don't think it is worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The name "Bever" was chosen by the producers, who wanted to "make a fun movie about a teen-evil killing of some animals and a girl. The story is not so funny.  The whole thing is just disgusting. A couple of teenagers were killed and the girl was sexually assaulted in a couple of scenes. They also had to be molested. That's all I can think of! They can't even pull the camera away from the camera for some scenes! The actors are pretty good, but their characters are too stupid. If I was a teenager, I would probably watch this film and leave it after seeing this horrible, terrible movie...   This movie is pretty horrible, but I guess it isn't so bad because it has a funny title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was like a "Saturday Night Live" script come to life and the script was complete waste. The movie had an odd ending and I think the writer should have known better. I just found it's quite depressing and the casting of the characters just didn't have any substance, if it was meant to have a story and an interesting one, it didn't. The acting was bad and the story lacked substance. It's too bad the director is so ignorant, but if he could just tell it's a movie I think it would be a bit better. We're all glad he had some time to make his own and he really needs to get the other guys in a little better way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's truly baffulous is the fact that a movie entitled The Obstructionists' Revenge is being directed by a former director (in the hands of the same people) about the idea that all the bloody, violent films that came out of the late 1960s were true to the lives of the victims. It's obvious that there are many other Hollywood directors and producers who have never done a movie about the bloody victims. If The Obporationist's Revenge is a movie aimed at a different audience than this one, it should be a much better one. If you didn't see The Obviationists' revenge when it was released, then you never would have the opportunity to see The Revenge. The title, which has been kept in print in all the bookstores, says the film is about the victims' revenge. But this title is so vague and meaningless that it seems to be the aim of the actors in it. If they weren't part of the story, why would they be part of it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like a movie: 1) Don't pay for it.  2) Watch it, then watch it only to watch the first 30 minutes of it. 3) Do not waste your money.  4) Avoid getting any money from it. It is so bad and bad it has a script that's so bad I can't say it's good.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i don't understand why people can't find this film in their own DVD or V2 and see it alone on the internet. this is the only film in which I have seen "hits" like this and i only found one, and that was the film I have chosen, because i found it in the DVD.  This film has a very annoying script that I can guarantee to make absolutely nothing of. It's so bad that i am worried that the plot will end up getting picked for "best horror film" in the world or whatever. In fact, the plot has about 30 minutes before it begins. If you are in a place where you can get a copy of this film, you are welcome to stay away. If someone's looking for a copy, i suggest doing a search for it, even in the UK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie because I couldn't find anything I wanted to rent to watch on video; I rented the movie because of the gore, violence, and nudity in the film. I'm very disappointed in this film. The acting in the movie is extremely terrible. In many instances, the characters were so pathetic that they should have been placed on a giant wooden beam to create a monster. The scene where the girls are making love in a huge mansion is incredibly silly. There is no evidence that the characters, in real life, can make a convincing argument about their beliefs in Satan. The story is so bad that it is hard to see where it comes from. The movie tries to imitate a movie that came out of "Wannamay, I Love You People", but it doesn't quite make it look like that. There are a few things I can say that make this film better:  The idea of it coming from an occultist is extremely stupid.  The use of magic is not realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I am very sorry for this movie.  It's bad, it's bad. But, at least, at a fairly small scale. In one sense you can view it as the first attempt to get something meaningful that is actually true. For example, I'm sure I don't have the slightest bit of interest in this. I have seen quite a few dozen movies and the number of people who have been fooled by the "true" version of this movie is quite low. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the past I worked for the United Nations, the Department of War and the Department Of Peace. I have been in both of those roles since 1981. I cannot remember where I worked in the United States at the time, but I will say that it had a somewhat good reputation, especially after my retirement, where I was responsible for all of the work of the Department in the 1980's. I do not know who thought me, but it did not make a very big difference. The story I heard about the film was a little vague, but since I never lived there myself it would have been reasonable to assume that the film might have been a bit weak. There was no evidence to back up the idea of a Nazi-fascazi film. Some of the scenes were rather good, especially the scenes of a Soviet tank, but in this I had little to do in my position, nor did I make any effort to film it, although I thought it was rather well done.  The only real surprise in the film were the scenes depicting the bombing of a village of Jewish prisoners. I remember these as having been filmed at a similar point during the first Gulf War when the first troops landed in the Gulf. This was one of the many instances of Americans doing not terribly well in Iraq (I can't remember the number of people involved in the shooting) but had some great footage, which I must admit was a bit weird.  After all, it seems to me that there should be some films about the aftermath of the bombing, rather than a short film about the bombing itself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a HUGE fan of Michael Douglas for the most part, his performance is great, but sadly he plays very poorly in this movie. He can't act and he lacks depth, it's too slow and not believable.  The rest of the movie is okay, but it needs to be much better.  I also think it was one of those films that used the name "Curse Of The Dog" but it is far from the movie's "true name" which I can't believe. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst horror films ever filmed (and it's one of my least favorite horror films!) and it is really painful to see this crap on screen. The main plot of this movie is an extremely stupid story of a zombie outbreak that turns into a vampire(!) zombie(!) outbreak. That's about the time of a vampire hunting in the woods as described above and this is pretty lame to use. The good thing about the main story and that it is a horror film is that it's a horrible movie. It's bad that the actor should have had his hands full to do the lead in this movie. He could have made some money for himself by getting some good supporting characters. For example, the character who makes the movie was obviously one of those supporting characters and the only reason this movie had so much money was because it had good actors who could use it. In the end, it just looked like a very bad movie and was so bad that I felt sorry for the actors and producers because they had wasted a lot of money. The whole movie could have been better if they made an alternate plot of the zombie hunting story and had that done for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is an extremely predictable and weak film in that it doesn't deliver anything new to help its viewers. It's just a poor way to deliver a film and the characters don't do anything they would expect. It also doesn't make any sense. Not only is the first half of the movie about how bad everyone is involved, but the characters are just terrible and the dialog is poorly written, with most of the dialog being completely ridiculous. There isn't even any interesting moments to the film, aside from a couple of silly moments. Some of the film was quite good. But the characters in this movie didn't do much. It was just one thing after another of an awful movie. It just seems like it is the worst movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first thing you might notice after watching the opening scene (which isn't spoken at all), is the lack of "story" (or any real story). This was brought up by the other acting (namely the "Aldo" actors), and the whole film is about how people make movies about how the other people make stories, and not about a movie. The other actors should have done this instead of wasting time on a "story". They are all too boring and predictable, even though they are trying to make an interesting movie. If they had done this movie, they would have used a lot more scenes that actually engage the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I saw was an almost laughably bad production. If it was an hour later, it would have been just OK. This is not a show, a movie, a show like the others, but a poorly made one. We are not sure who did this, and we can't blame the director for it. But we do know that it is not supposed to be a movie. A bunch of people in New York decided to make one, and they didn't. They put on a few scenes, and then they got rid of the movie, and the people who made it got fired.  This movie is basically just like every other movie made in New Yorkers, not great either, and there are no actors. The plot is just another of those plotless movies. You are not expecting the same thing in a Hollywood movie. It doesn't do that. We don't get to see "Mr. Vanishing." The only actors of the show, the supporting actors, and even the actors who didn't act for about half of the film were very good. The only problem with this movie was that it wasn't interesting. The story is predictable, and it was bad. The movie is about a bunch of old people who live in a small village, but you just don't want to see this kind of movie. But if you like movies that make you look like a little statue or look like you would in a museum, you will probably like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am surprised that this is the type of film that the big studios like to pull out to try to promote. After they see what they got, they just put it out. A lot of this stuff is just laughable. It makes no sense, it doesn't have any meaning to say, no more for me. It's not interesting to watch. The acting is weak, it's not entertaining or anything else, it just sucks.   If you're going to see this, I strongly urge you not to see it, and to avoid showing it to the public. If you had to watch it, you wouldn't want to see anything like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really understand how much the director thought that people would be willing to take this film. The film takes the "hilarious" premise of a rape (as a fictional case of revenge) to a point where it becomes an almost nonexistent plot. The most important part of this film is its sheer stupidity.  The only good thing in this film was a surprise, surprise to most of the actors and characters. I've seen many horror films that were so bad that they'd be embarrassed to be shown this film on an HBO channel. This movie was the only thing to have failed to impress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't remember why I watched this. I can't figure out why. It was just one more stupid "movie" with the same stupid acting. The scene when the girl gets into a car with a bunch of people only gives a few minutes of pleasure (for some reason) to watch. I thought this was going to be another scene and then the scene when she drives away. The only thing that really bothered me was the way the camera did not show the actual crash scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a big geek who likes to watch Sci-Fi action movies, then this movie is not for you. The story is weak, the acting is bad, and the plot has no substance to speak to it. The plot is the same as all other Sci-FI action movies and I am ashamed of watching this one. The characters have absolutely no connection with anything except for their sex appeal and you will wonder how these people find people. I would really like to see a movie that doesn't rely so heavily on sex appeal to prove its validity but this one does that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to recreate the '90s New Orleans, complete with the same old clichés. The acting is terrible, the sets are bad, the camera is bad, and the director is terrible.  After seeing this movie, I decided to watch a documentary on the '80s New Jersey. I saw it once and laughed at some of it.  The only good part in the film was the first 30 minutes of the documentary.  I'd have liked to see this movie more. Instead, I watched it only once and left it sitting in the dark. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe how many people got mad when a movie like this is released. It wasn't the greatest movie of all time and that's the only reason I can think why it was released at all. I don't really care that much about the plot of this film. It is pretty bad. The only redeeming trait of this movie was the fact that it stars a lot of very good actors (including Timothy O'Neill) and I was glad to see some of those actors in it. I just can't say anything positive about it. The acting wasn't very good. The directing is bad and there is nothing about the script that made me happy. The plot is bad. It's a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. In fact I don\'t remember anything that happened to this movie. It seems as if it never had much merit or anything to recommend to make. This movie is just bad enough that it should never be part of your list of movies: it is just plain bad. I recommend throwing it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe they're making this film. I have to agree that it's an insult to their fans and the viewers. I'm going to be honest here and admit that this movie is a complete waste of time and money. I watched the movie and felt out of my mind for the first 30 seconds of the film. They knew they were going to deliver crap and I could feel that every second of the movie is completely unnecessary. The movie is not even worth watching by people who actually got the idea and started watching the film on DVD. I know people have a pretty good idea what they're doing and have the sense of a "big idea" and a passion for this type of film but I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie. This movie is no more enjoyable than "The Great White Dr. Who" and it's a complete embarrassment to say that it actually is. I've never seen such a letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was lame to the end, but it was worth having because of the good cast and good sets. However, this movie was very bad when it premiered. The premise was pretty good, but was very weak when it came to the big showdown. The movie is so bad that I couldn't even talk about the first few scenes. The plot really should have come on a much stronger than this, but there was absolutely no chemistry in either one. The only good thing about this movie is the first 20 minutes of the movie when it comes to an explosion. There was a good soundtrack, but that wasn't very impressive. The ending is terrible and this movie will not even make it to the Top 10 Worst Movies ever. This is a movie that doesn't deserve to be watched. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I noticed, in what has been described, is that the movie was filmed in a room that resembles a typical Hollywood studio, it's just a room in a standard building. It's not the kind of room you'd expect to have during a filming situation. This is because the camera is not mounted on a dolly like the studio, and it's surrounded by black-painted walls and the floorboards.  This makes me wonder why the director chose to film in this place. There are some very talented people in the film, but what's the whole business of choosing a location that is not suitable for the production of a film? What happened to the original? The whole set is pretty plain, and the camera moves so slowly. And there is very little action in the scene. In fact, you get into some of the most ridiculous situations imaginable. In the beginning the camera was positioned to look right at the girl who was about to be married, but the way he's holding his arm and moving into the house, it was pretty ridiculous. I won't go through the whole film to describe the story line, but I can say that you really should be paying much more attention to that part of the movie. What the producers didn't see is the complete truth. They are obviously not in a position to make films like these, and you don't learn anything about the production process, unless you have some knowledge of the genre. And they don't know what they should be like.  My advice to anyone looking to rent this movie: Go and rent it on the same movie: "the first half is about a girl who wants to go to high school for her final exam, but instead she gets pregnant. They don't make an effort to make a decent film, they don it on DVD because it doesn't really look like a normal film, so they're wasting a lot of money. And while they're making this, they're not doing enough research. They're just going through the credits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as bad as any film I have seen lately. And you know why I am an expert on horror movies, because this one is the WORST one I have ever seen.  If this is true I would not have to wait over 1 hour for this movie to be available for DVD. But the movie is released in late September and in that time it is already available on video.  Well if it is true then its good that some people have agreed to release it. But this is just not the way to go. The movie is one dimensional but a ridiculous way to waste time on it. The plot is so bad that a small group of people could make a list on how bad it is.  You should be a little more careful to pick the bad movies from the DVD. This is a really bad movie but one of the worst movies I have written about and I wouldn't buy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on DVD (i have a copy), I thought the movie was really terrible and I'm glad I didn't waste my money on it. I thought it was really bad. I mean, it is a lot of crap! I'm used to movies like this, but this was really awful. I'm not sure if anyone is paying for this movie. I really didn't like the "set" which was very, very little. I just sat there watching the whole thing and hoping that the story would get better. However, it didn't. I also thought it would be good if there was more story. It was very poor, with too much violence and stupid scenes of the "spartans" in the movie. What was the "good" part of the movie? When it came near to the end, the music was played in the background by a person who was obviously trying to be a rock star. I didn-t find this at all interesting or interesting. I was very tired, and I just couldn't wait to throw it away. The movie is a bit like "the other Spider Queen". I think they are in their little time in the rock bands and have chosen to "make a real rock 'n' rock 'bout'" movie. If that is the case, then there are some people who should not have made it. If you want a movie that will be interesting and amusing, you don't have one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When watching the "Fugitive Force" series of "Bv2" I thought that this was going to be a great movie, but it was really nothing. There was so many terrible and predictable things going to happen throughout the movie, and most of them seemed to be caused by one of the actors. The only redeeming trait of the film was the incredible lack of any real plot and plot. When I first watched the film I didn't think that they would be able to make it into a movie. There are only 4 main characters and the only one that we can see is Jack. If you're a fan of movies like this you should not spend one dime of money on it. If it didn't make you laugh so hard then you'll be left asking why they made it. The script was terrible, the acting was terrible and the directing wasn't even able to salvage it. I don't think "FUGITIVE FORCE 2: FUGITE I WOULD HAPPEN TO FULTE!! I HOPN! HAPPY! I DONN! I WANT! TO FULL! MAKE IT STOP! PLEASE! HOOOO! MAKE ME CINNED!" (a bad line to say) was the most horrible scene that I can recall. The whole film just felt like they couldn't make it right. I couldn't even watch it again. If the filmmakers were trying to be truly horrifying, then they were a lot better. I was glad that they released a complete "Fugenius" sequel but it wasn't worth it. This movie is just a collection of bad movies. It doesn't matter if you're not a fan and you're interested in the film, you're just wasting your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just couldn't believe that this movie was even remotely interesting. I mean, for a movie starring a female lead, and what is that? The "courage" movie is obviously sexist, and even just the first hour or two of it would be too much to waste. The storyline of the "village" movie has nothing to do with the movie's title, and the movie starts out to be totally boring, so you don't want to spend much time watching it, but then you just want to watch the movie and see nothing else. I give this movie a 4 out of 10 because it's a very weak, disappointing movie. I can't wait to be the "citizen with a conscience" of my future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with my wife and my dog. Not even in the best place to get a laugh, or to be a viewer. After a few minutes of the movie, the characters (for whatever reason) completely flamed us.  If it was possible to do a movie for a laugh or two, this would have been perfect. It's just plain bad. The story wasn't interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this I will never forgive my friends for watching this stupid movie. The idea of "Hollywood", was based on a really lame excuse for a movie that it was a Hollywood Movie is completely stupid. I mean, i just "thought" that it would be a movie in the most serious sense. It was lame, boring, and stupid. This movie is a joke. You can really see it. There are not any funny dialog. There is no funny pictures either. No actors. No story. There's no great characters. No characters. I don't know why this movie was made.  I also wanted to point out something that really bothers me about this movie: The number of times that this movie has been "released" is ridiculous. It has been released in like 5 or 7 different countries. This is not a movie, and not a special movie, it doesn't deserve to be released. I guess it's a TV movie, but it should not be released in the big leagues. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, my husband and I sat in our living room, wondering why this movie was made. We were sitting there on Christmas Day, and I had a screaming fit. There was some music playing, I had started watching some of the movies, and the plot seemed to be made up without the actual characters. The main character seemed to have been taken from the movie and thrown into a storyline that had absolutely nothing to do with the actual story, and a female protagonist had been thrown into an endless and pointless plot. My husband said it wasn't good, but it was interesting, but my son didn't like it at all. I'm going to let the other person comment here about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dark Side of History" is a bad, lousy, piece of crap film that will have you believing that the story was true and so the characters were the true heroes. Not. The whole idea of the film is that it was a true story. The plot was not true, and the movie itself wasn't very true either. It was only pretentions.  The production team were so sloppy and sloppy that it is painful to say they left the truth out of their movie.  If this is the only reason you have to go see this film, I suggest you stick with a couple of books instead. There are some interesting stories from the original books. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of those things that only happens once in a while.  The scene starts at the beginning and goes through it until the end, then we've got the standard 'good cop, good guy, bad guy, good cop,' and then we get the standard movie, with little drama and drama and no action whatsoever. The end is horrible. I have just seen so much crap that this movie is no exception.  I am a huge fan of the early days of John Carpenter and John Blair films and of late (I would say the late 1980's) movies, but this one falls apart at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had some decent points, but the acting was awful. It seems that I am incapable of judging whether it is acting or not. The movie was so stupid that it had to be dubbed "Bunkin the Living Dead". A movie with a lot of crap on it (nameable actors, plot, acting, a lot, but worst of all) is OK to avoid if you have the patience to wait for the sequel to be released. But this is no movie. That's the only reason to watch this movie. I was too tired and worn out from watching the previous two movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is like something that a person might do at the most stupid day - take your kids to a movie that has no reason whatsoever. it's extremely childish and bad! if you see it, you should avoid seeing it. the dialog was terrible, the characters acted completely stupid and they were way too self-assigned, there was no story whatsoever. and the plot lacked any excitement. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was lame, nothing special. It just seemed like a cheap effort for a good story. But I am glad to see that this is a low budget movie with only one or two lines. The acting was terrible, and the story was too long to get anything interesting. In my opinion, it is not worth watching, especially the scene at the bar where the guy in the car with the phone was talking. You could get more interesting, but the story had no story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When this movie was released, it was criticized by many as being the worst movie I have seen. I think there is some reason for this.  I will confess to not seeing this movie at all. In the end, I didn't find much good in this film. It wasn't particularly bad, but it was extremely poorly acted.  The plot was poor. Some of the actors (Pleasant and others) looked like they had been in their lives. I mean, this movie had to be some sort of torture, and the only reason was that it didn't make too much of a difference in my opinion. I guess the fact that some people were watching it as "Horrific Attack" at the beginning gave me confidence that it wasn't bad as I expected it was. However, I think that the acting was about as bad as it could have been.  Also, the scene where he meets with a bunch of people (he didn't meet with a guy, since there are no witnesses to the meeting) made me think that he was going to torture some people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad, but it is so bad that I decided to put it in a short review to save my time. I am not a fan of the first three movies and can't say I've ever come up with an idea like "Wander" that isn't based on the same basic plot or script. I can't believe that people who made this have ever seen one. For example, "Werner" is about a character named William Forsygin and has a very simple idea and has more action than even one of "Worner" or "Warden". "Werewiller" is really just another character in this movie and has little to do with "Wirner", except for a short scene on a boat.  The first thing that "Worter" did was to have a little bit of action going on before the ending. Then, the second part had the "Olympic" logo in the background for a few seconds, and the third part had a scene to which the film is supposed to be a scene set in the city. And since we're so late in the film here (by the third, anyway), I had to watch "Werker" as well to confirm that it's a completely amateur piece.  This is also a movie that is too long and really is not interesting to make. I guess the producers thought that there would be a lot of action scenes, so they didn't bother with them. The problem is, we're constantly talking about how stupid everyone in the movie is. And we've seen them in other films already. I think they're better at making long-expired scenes than they are at doing long, boring ones. It's just not entertaining. And if you want to see any fun scenes from "Willer" (or any other filmmakers, or any other genre), I would have done it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's no surprise that this has been one of the biggest failures of any TV movie ever made, and I'd have guessed it would be the last one. As usual I wouldn't really think I had a particular liking for this genre, and for example have not even bothered to watch it. What was so interesting in this movie was its lack of development. Some people who are familiar with the genre will have no idea what's going to happen and will just look out for the sex scene. I wouldn do anything to avoid this movie but sadly it seems to have the same problem. It doesn't develop any plot and just leaves you feeling like you're going to get killed. A lot of the scenes were really dull. I didn't understand it. Some scenes seemed quite interesting and were interesting but it just ended up not being there, and you end up wondering if it is going to make an end. I just didn't enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the actors, the director, and the producer (Lorenzo) don't like what they're doing, what are we going to do? I don't know. I know that the director's in charge of the project and the studio have gotten it all wrong. The movie isn't even funny as an action flick, which is the way it could be. In this case it's just a pretentious excuse to waste your time and money. I'd be willing to see this movie if it wasn't a shameless commercial exploitation. I would never buy it, but I'd rather have a movie that wasn't so bad to have just been made and not made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film at a local movie theatre as a kid and saw a lot of it when I had the opportunity to rent it out, but I felt bored after most of the film. I think it was about as interesting as it is supposed to be. The main plotline was ridiculous.  The plot was extremely bad, the ending was unsatisfying.  Also, the script was so poor that I couldn't understand what was going to happen, what was left for the hero to do. Also, I was annoyed to see this movie in theaters as I hadn't yet watched it in a theater.  There are so many bad sequels that it could be better than a thousand years of sequels, and this one was not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  But at least it doesn't seem like a bad film.  I didn't watch this until the movie was posted on the Internet and I saw the review of the movie (I've seen it) and saw it again (which I didn`t get until after I watched it.)  This movie is nothing but a collection of scenes of people taking an absurd role as a superhero. The only good thing in this movie is that it shows the story of one of his adventures on a plane, which is really the only thing that got away from it.  The only other thing that didn't happen was the flying of one hero, but in the case of the film it seems like a big plot twist at the end.  There are two scenes where he was hanging from the plane, the one where he lands and jumps over. It was just there and was just showing the action of a hero, which just doesn't make sense. There is also one scene that you hear about him coming back, but that only happens in one scene. I guess it was filmed in a studio for this movie, because it doesn`t make sense, but it wasn't in a film studio. And I didn´t know that either was happening before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the movie, but it was so badly written and acted, that it could never have been considered a "film". The dialog is terrible, the story is bad, and the acting is bad. The idea is that it's a comedy that's so hard to believe that you just see it. I've seen it in over a dozen times and this is the only movie that I've ever laughed at. The worst movie I've watched was the "Hannalita" of 2008. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this film was on the ABC news program, so it was pretty interesting. But after seeing it I didn't like it. It was terrible, not even funny. I think that it should have been the show to play, and the guy playing it obviously had too much money to be a good actor. He was stupid, and his acting was terrible. My favorite was Chris Metzen, and I was very, very, bored with him. But I can't say too much about this movie. There were a few funny moments (like one where you see a man walking on a bridge, and there's some action between two cars, and everyone laughs hysterically at seeing that guy walking across the bridge), but I don't remember any scenes. It would have been a much better movie if they would have put some more action into the movie (like a stunt-man and stunt-like car crash). And then when you see that man walking across that bridge, don't believe it! No one could possibly believe it, because we all knew that was supposed to be Chris Metzel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Sister" was an insult to the intelligence of the whole film world. The acting was terrible. If you see this movie, you'll just want to throw it off. The cast of actors who played in this film were too terrible to even make jokes in the first place. This movie just wasted its precious time. No plot had any more substance. The script itself was the only good thing I had seen. I had so much sympathy for the actors who actually lived in the time and place, but the "SISTER" failed to deliver. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not even a good episode, in that it is really bad. This is probably the most predictable episode of season 5 (the first one of the six). In this episode, the entire plot has been done. All the characters are stupid, and the episode is mainly about just a couple of characters in a small town (the local priest and the local policeman). It's only the scene of them kissing that gets the funny laugh out of me.    The other thing about the episode of this movie was the fact that the ending was so predictable. The scene in which the priest and local cop kissing was in such a brief scene, and it all of a sudden becomes funny. The ending was terrible. What's really funny was how awful it ended. This episode was bad in every sense. Even a simple scene was funny. This had no plot, and nothing interesting. I have always been in for a "good ending", but unfortunately this one was one of those boring ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie to be made that I have ever seen where I feel like watching the beginning of every film just to watch the first one. The characters are terrible, the dialog is terrible, and the whole premise (the two of the girls) is stupid and stupid. I'm not a fan of "The Sisterhood" type movies, but "The Sisters" is the worst one of those. The fact that it's so bad is pretty obvious because the two sisters are famous so they get paid. They act so, and don't act like characters like "The Brothers Brothers Brothers" or "The Fugitive Series" or anything like "Goth Squad". "The Mother In The Sea" is one of the better ones, but it was horrible in the way that it was designed. I wish I had the patience to find "The Last War", so I could see the same sort of effort, and better quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is nothing but a sad waste of celluloid. The plot, the directing and the photography are not the worst part of a bad film, but the story is simply bad and not very convincing. For the rest of the film, I am able to watch the first 10 minutes of it and still don't see why anybody is in it. The director makes some kind of musical statement, but I can only guess what he has to do. I only know that you can see the plot of this film in the film itself. A bunch of guys, in a post-modern world, sit around in a little cabin, drinking and smoking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've seen "Vietopia" before, you'll see a story that would fit so much better. Not only is it horrible, but its lead actors have absolutely no chemistry. The story is only the worst thing I've ever seen from a film. It is bad because, on the other hand, it's a classic example of movie making that just doesn't get made. No wonder that the production is so low budget; but there are some interesting and amusing scenes. The only thing that makes "Viatopia" worthwhile is the soundtrack. The music is OK, but the movie is bad, so much badness was created. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out with a story of a couple who are separated, with a married man and a young boy trying to get back together. The movie, along with its main characters, begins to go downhill. It's not good, but it's not the worst movie I've ever seen.   It does a couple of interesting moments, but they're badly drawn. A couple of kids are drawn into the plot by the couple, and later, we find out that the guy's wife is an annoying bit of a psycho, but she's only part of the plot.  As the main character, the movie seems to lose a lot of energy. The story is nothing but a pile of scenes, and it's very predictable. You won't be expecting that it's going to happen, like the rest of the movie.  The two actors are, at least, talented. But they're not good enough to have anything to do.  I just don't think they're good enough, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What? You think this movie is supposed to be about some sort of "experienced" person or a "group of people" that wants to get together and "save the world" or something? Well no, it's not that. It's just a bunch of people that want to kill the people because they've been made to believe that the world has been ruined and there is a plot to "kill the world".  The problem with this movie, however, is that it doesn't really happen.  As an example. On the day that the "experiences" are made available on DVD and video, someone is named that's "the guy". He's a person who is supposed, supposedly, to be the best person in the world but no one can meet and interact with him in a real, not only simulated, world.  The movie starts out with a story that involves a lot of people and ends with an event that is set to occur in the real world in the form of a movie, although the "group" is trying to bring those people back to life so that they don't get killed by the "real" person.  What does it do? Why don't those people actually meet and talk to the person who's name is "the actor" in the movie? I have no idea what is supposed happen if the actors meet and discuss the story, but that's pretty rare anyway.  Well, to answer my question, it does indeed happen. The problem is that, while the person does get killed, it doesn give a few more people the chance to meet. But they don`t go together in the same way that they did in the book. This movie just uses the story of the "guy" with a friend that was killed in the previous movie to "solve the problem". If the book is a real book, this movie has nothing more. There's no one there and no one that was supposed to save the world. The characters are not actually portrayed as "good guys", as they were in the original book. The story is about a fictional story that has only been made in the story's back story. There isn`t much of the movie that could be considered "real". The film is so bad it actually makes you wonder why it was made and why it exists at all.  And the ending is just terrible and is totally unbelievable. It comes on that there was some sort random actor's wife (some sort
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is like a two-party wrestling game, where everyone in the main storyline is the villain and the good guy is the victim. And you've seen it before, all it's like a bad attempt to make a serious comedy movie or even a serious one.   A new "comedy" has become the most painful part of the movie-like genre. Even the funny guys are so inept that they almost don't know the jokes.  And it's not really funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a waste of time - I didn't care for a lot of the plot, but it wasn't that bad as it sounded in the previous titles. But it sure wasn't the best either, considering the number of cast members and the lack of action. For instance the main character was annoying. I felt like I was a big fan of the other entries in the series - but, apart from that, it didn't really work. I mean, who doesn't look like this? It doesn't need to be that bad. What happened to the series and what was it? I think it's just bad looking - the actors were boring and the sets were wooden. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains no intelligent or amusing way to entertain. But it does have a certain style. There's little fun in the characters, the acting is bad, and it's slow paced. It doesn't have a storyline. If it had a storyline, it would make more sense. The best place to watch this movie is if you decide to rent it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of movie I have seen over and over. I don't have the patience for seeing the same movie over and on and over again. I have the sense that I don`t care as much as I do for the ending. It is only a bad attempt at an original, though a talented young actor plays the part of Richard Brooks.  I do have a small amount of sympathy for this movie. I am sure it was made for a commercial purpose. It appears to be an effort at the genre. But it could have been made for the same reason as many others, and failed miserantly. It has nothing but a plot, a title, and a script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that you feel like you might die if you even THINK about it. A lot of the story is about a couple who had an idea for a film and are having some fun for a few minutes. They decide on the date, and after getting there, they decide on a film called "Inception" and decide how much is worth to shoot, or to write a negative script. I guess it's some sort of parody, but it doesn't really feel like a parody.  Overall, this movie was too much like a '80s horror film, not even close to that. A few of the gags seemed a little realistic, although there wasn't a big deal with that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to seeing this film. I had read the book and had heard many good things about the movie, but the "plot" that they "pulled out" is so weak, I didn't really see much, and I didn;I didn't even find a character that looked particularly interesting. There was the guy who was supposed to be in the middle of the movie. I just couldn't figure out who his character was and I don't think he was one of the "villages". The "villagers" were pretty bland and uninteresting. But the "heroes" weren't all that interesting. What a piece of s--you know, a villain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I watched the movie, my eyes were pulled out and pulled down by the camera lens. It made no sense to listen to this part of the movie. The story is really bad. The characters are very poorly drawn, and I think that they have the most boring and unbelievable dialogue. I thought that it made the two biggest shocks of my life, so I gave it a 10 out of 10. This movie is terrible! It really is not worth it for anyone with any sense of intelligence to watch it. I'm really disappointed that I could spend money to watch this. If anyone could see this movie for free I would really recommend not buying it. It's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a shame that this is what a movie "The Castle" does. When it was first released, I was really interested in it. But I couldn't wait to watch it. I got bored with it. It doesn't come close to what it was when it was released.  It's horrible, but it makes sense when you sit on it. The only reason this film is not a failure is that it is terrible. The plot seems to be a lot of fun in the early stages, but then, as it gets older, it just becomes a cliché and a boring plot. I am very aware of the people involved in this film, and I am sure you will find it to be amusing. But it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people, including me and the people that are used to watching comedy movies, will watch this one with their heads, hoping to find something funny in it that isn't actually there. This is obviously a bad sitcom, but it's actually really bad. The idea behind this is that it's all about the same situations over a couple of seasons, and it doesn't really pay much attention to the characters. I like jokes that are a bit off-balance and have a weird theme, but this one just seems like you're trying to make jokes that you can't laugh at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it's good, and there are some cool moments in the movie that I've never heard in a movie before (maybe the last time), it will be an interesting piece of cinema. But unfortunately, I can't say that in any other words, it's just bad. I really don't understand how people decide on this crap. It's like someone goes out to an arcade on the weekend and decides to pick up a movie: "I'm a fan of this movie, but I just don't see how they can make up such a crappy movie". When I was a kid, I was so disappointed, but this movie was worse than half of my favorite movies, and I just thought, "it's bad for my taste". Even the best actors, who would love to be in this movie are no-talented or people who are talented. I don't believe in the makers of this crap, because it's simply bad, so bad, and it is pointless. They must be completely out of their minds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My only problem was that it made me have nightmares. I actually think it was OK in comparison. But the ending just ruined it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to watch this movie twice to find it "satisfifying"  I was really worried, because I've read books that I think are very good. But when I started watching this, I had nothing but horrible thoughts. It was just horrible... I really wanted to scream and scream! The dialog was bad, the characters weren't great, the way they treated the characters made no sense, etc. I'd have been willing to pay money to rent the movie if they had done any "serious" plot, but I was unable to rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only reason why I gave this film a two stars. There are just too many clichés. What are the best things that you will find in a film that has this bad name?   I would rate this 4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't tell how this movie is going to go. It is a shame that this is the first film that I have seen from a movie theater with such bad directing and story. There is really no plot to any "Bondolio" plot, and the movie is just a collection of a bunch of scenes in a car. It isn't any good, and I felt like watching this only because I couldn't find a movie that was so bad that I had to see it. It looks like the only reason this movie was made. The story is very bad and I would've thought to see something more appealing, but instead I just sat there, trying to make sense of it. I think this movie should have been an action-adventure story. That is all this movie has to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got out of this one because I was the only person in the cast who would take the job. If the production had done the right thing I wouldn't have to look at another one. They were trying to make a comedy about a guy that was on the verge of being diagnosed with a cancer. How come one of the actors was a complete amateur comedian and couldn't act properly?  What was the purpose of this film? It had been done for a laugh by the people who were actually part of the cast and that's the most disappointing part of it. The script was so terrible it had to be that low-budget movie that made it more laughable than anything I've seen before.  The ending is so horrible, it's such a waste of time to see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just laughed like a dead.  The only time I felt like I was in "good" movies was during the film. There was no good story, no real story to go to, nothing to follow. The only part that seemed real was the character, the way he was portrayed. I think he was the villain in this movie, if you really think that. I had to laugh in his character for a full hour. He had no reason to be a villain in his role. He was basically pathetic. It made me sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's so much going in that has no end for it... well that was a few months ago. This movie has been completely predictable and we can't wait to see the next one. Maybe it will have a chance to deliver a decent performance from a good movie (as was the case with "Journey To Venus: A Space Adventure"). But the script is so bad, that it's not worth anything. I'm thinking of a more creative way to review this movie: a bad plot and bad characters. If you watch the first 2 or 3 minutes of it, you might be surprised that it was actually very good, but you'll miss it if you spend several hours watching the whole film. It's bad to begin with something like "The Walking Dead" and then have to watch the second episode as the characters slowly move toward the end as if they were never there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not so much, just bad acting, stupid storyline and very dull, but very entertaining if you watch too much. If you want to watch a movie about a movie: just watch "Scent-Inch". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not kidding and here are two words, one and two...one is not one, and two are not two. I give my opinion to this film: "  The story of a sad man who is lost to the carjacking gang at a gas station that is the only place he can go to be punished for his murder, and at the same time, he tries to beat up another serial killer by beating him with a steel bat. It's very confusing and not the kind of movie I would watch. It is one of those that are designed to have shock value to bring the viewer to the edge of their seat, but then fail to actually deliver what it promises. The two leads of the film are a really pathetic cast, and the acting is really bad. In fact, they should all be sued for making the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad it was funny, but at the end it seemed to have only a few more "climax" moments and the camera showed no one. In the end I felt like they had spent an hour and a half or more watching this movie and then it would have been even more annoying, because the movie only took 1 or 2 minutes and nothing more. The only thing that helped this movie was seeing the original "The Last Movie" (that was really the best one). It would have taken us several hours to realize that there was really only a half hour of this movie. The fact that "The Movie" was a really bad movie, but the reason I gave this movie is because it's so boring and unbelievable that it can only make some sort of jokes about it, like a little sarcastic commentary about how silly it was. But it's a movie, not a movie. So this really brings nothing to life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that the first time I watched this was a comedy. If there was any comedy in it, the director is stupid. It's just awful to see so many of the actors that can only make a few, short, scenes. It is OK for a comedy if you can pull it together. However, if you don't, you just can't make it worth watching.  I watched the original film back when it was released in 1998, and was very impressed with what a funny scene was put into the movie. This is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. Even the original was a lot more entertaining than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who grew up with this movie, I have to admit that it was disappointing.  This is easily the most pointless film I have ever seen in my life. And it got much worse.  For starters it had no story (the plot is actually pretty good, but it got so bogged down that it becomes boring). It had no one, and the "residents" didn't even talk about the killer. The script lacked substance. There was a lot of "nuggets" thrown in which looked like very interesting scenes and yet only showed little more.  What really was the plot? A lot of scenes were in "no way up there" locations in a different town every day. The actors who were supposedly in the town were totally unnoticeable.  The story itself was very predictable. And for the sake of a movie that wasn't stupid but at least kept a good pace, it is too predictable to me to say anything positive about this movie.  I did really like "the bird". In her first appearance, she was cute, cute, and very annoying. She just lacked substance to her role as the bird. It got better as the movie progressed, but sadly was no longer.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a short teaser, this film was released, and I had a pretty hard time finding it. The acting was horrible and the story was completely uninteresting. The film looked like a real person doing something for a movie. But the plot was too slow and uninteresting, so I guess I had to see the first 20 minutes, if not until the last ten minutes. The ending seemed to be an empty, so nothing really happened except a very odd ending. I'm afraid that a really mediocre, yet totally predictable movie is a bad choice for your viewing. If you liked a movie, you'll want to see it again but I don't see myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I knew I was going to read this movie and was going for my trip out of the wilderness to the desert I would go. I was right. I thought the actors sounded like their real personalities were being played. The music was horrible and the characters were nothing to me.   I'm not going to rate this movie since the end is only about 10 minutes long and the rest of it seems to be in a rush. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is only the biggest movie in the history of American culture. It was bad, not scary, but a total waste of time and entertainment. The only reason this movie was made was because of a handful of talented actors (I can't think of any more of them), but they were not available to do this film. There are no good actors to have in a film like this. There is no great way to make a film with a man in a suit, for example. This is not a movie about people and how they die, but rather a movie where people die without knowing it is happening. I give it 4 out of 10 because of the sheer stupidity of it. The film tries so hard to make it seem that it has happened, but it doesn't. It doesn't make you feel that you were going to die. In fact, you think you just went to Heaven after your little life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My thoughts are that I was expecting an all-access high-speed video at some point in the film. I was not expecting to have one on the ground to watch. I wanted that type of thing in this movie, but was unfortunately disappointed.  The story lines were not even remotely engaging or humorous. What is it that you really need in life? The plot tells the story of a failed attempt to find the "magic bullet" which will end the world. The storyline has nothing to do with reality and all of the characters are stupid. The acting was the worst in the movie. I expected something like this would be, but that didn't happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see the plot line of the movie and find out how it is supposed to end.  I'll be surprised when I see this.  It's just not believable. It's the most embarrassing thing I've seen in a while. I'll have to say that it is hard to make an old man feel sad - especially if it was a beautiful girl. The ending is extremely disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie that is all about an incestuous relationship, one of the most painful episodes I have ever seen. Not only because of its blatant plot, but the script is terrible and the actors were terrible.  A true "stalker" type film, but no matter how much you can laugh it away, you have no time for any sympathy. The acting was horrible. At least the cast members tried to hide it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a complete waste of a film. Not even the great cinematography and editing. What was it that gave birth to this pile of crap??. The director is clearly clueless in what he is doing. Perhaps it's a desire to be the next "cinematic" film. The cinematography is horrible, the directing is lousy, the story is not believable, the character is so bad. It's such an obvious cliché that a film starring Robert Downey and Robert Downfield is going to be a truly bad one. It doesn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a horrible movie in its own way and with bad performances, but you do have to read this to believe it. But this is really disappointing to watch. It is so bad that a good movie would probably be, like this would be, so. A movie about a man who falls in love with his beautiful wife is something interesting and funny. Unfortunately it is not that kind of movie. There is too much humor to make this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You've seen the one before and I've seen it only twice. This movie is bad, I mean the plot and acting are bad but it's good that it's not a movie so badly that it becomes a movie with characters that you're supposed to be loving but you're not so loving. It's just about getting revenge.  The plot is terrible but I thought it was better than the first one and this one is a worse parody. I'm surprised to find out that a lot of people actually watched this movie for it because it was very good at the beginning. I gave it a 2 and only 2 out of 10 because I felt bad about the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a movie set at the beach in the summertime of 1977, the characters are set to a few days away in the jungle and are forced to hunt the other actors by their boss and finally killed by their supposed'sister', a little bitch named "Fanny". With a seemingly very annoying and annoying little redheaded, annoying little lady in a bikini is forced to perform in a little naked swim, which is then tied down and bound to a tree like a tree trunk to stop him. The other actors then decide to follow in order and follow him through the jungle in search of the girl who is supposedly dead.  As a whole, this movie is pretty horrible. The acting is weak, the direction is lousy and the plot is only semi-good. The plot twists were so bad it was the same in the previous movie (the movie was set in the same location) and the acting was better. The funny thing is that I think the 'Fanny' had some real chemistry with Fanny. The 'Fearing' in the movie were pretty bad. There was a scene where Fanny, in the bikini, fell into the ocean and fell into an old tree, which was really weird.  The movie was better when we got to the part where Fitty was killed. I think that if she was killed in the original movie, this one would have been much better than it was in the other movie, but not much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a friend of ours told me that "B" has done his job. When you say "B," it's supposed to be a comedy. Not the way it seems because it really wasn't. It's a big fat movie. Not only the "B"'s script is awful but the movie is horrible. It was a slow and painful ride. The acting was not so bad, though, the actors did good except for one girl. Not good enough to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning of the show, I thought that it was going to be something I would enjoy. I didn't care about the fact that the show had so much material that I wouldn't care to waste any more time watching it. And so I watched the whole thing twice. Once I realized that the story wasn't going to have much to do with the rest of the plot. There were too many stupid elements, like a female character having a baby. The first episode, I still believed that the plot would be a hit, but by the second episode, the premise of the whole show became the equivalent of a bad TV movie: a female has a big belly and can use a large belly to kill a male. I don't know if it was because the male actors were stupid, or the idea was just that it didn't have enough material. The whole thing just amounted to a little of an excuse to make me like it because it was so good that I didn' see it at all.  I've read much of the web and I've seen a few comments that say that this was a better show and that it deserved to get more than two stars. This is where I disagree. The reason I gave it the two stars was because it had a good premise. It had so few characters, I just didn't want to waste those characters on a poor show. At the end of the series, they just didn'n't do much. It made me want to throw it into the trash heap. I'd like to see this show cancelled. I think that it had it's place as a joke. I'm sure it has more value than that. I just think that by the time it was canceled, it was pretty much ruined. The only reason that this show had such a bad time was the fact the plot had become so poorly written and directed. At least this show didn't really do much with it's premise. The main characters were pretty bland. And I thought they were all pretty useless. It didn't seem like they all have much in it and I just wished that it weren't too much about. I know that the writer was trying to get an idea. He had an idea that the main characters would be on a plane.  There was one character who was a bit like a buffoon and that seemed like a pretty good character, though the other characters weren't that much better.  In order to tell this story to you, I had
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a piece of garbage this movie is. I mean, you can watch it for the reason to do it, but you would never want to watch it anyway.  The plot is based on a few real murders that were investigated by the FBI, so the killer has to have killed something about 30 different people in the span of a couple months. How does the killer get the blood? How does it kill them? How do the killer do the murders? Does the killer kill them in a different manner?  Why did the killer see the victim, the killer, in the dark basement and get a lock in one of the rooms? There's not one. This guy wants a body to use on someone else.   The killer has the same blood on the arm, the hands, the feet, the torso, the hair, the jacket, the skull, the pants, the chest, the body of the killer and his car. How did the murder victim go to the garage in a dark location? How did he take out the body and use it in his car? How could he know the car was there? How can you know he was dead when he put the body in a black plastic box and put it in a room in the garage? How is it possible that a corpse with the blood on it could have been used without anyone knowing what happened?  I couldn't find anything that made this a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the most predictable of the worst ever made I've ever seen. They filmed this in the late 1970s and after 60 minutes of filming had a lot of nonsense. Even the title of the movie is not even true - it was titled "Killer Shredder", not "Shredder the Killer".  There were a lot more unnecessary people in the movie, and there was a bit of a weird story. I think the writer, one of the two people involved, said he wanted to film some of the events in "Kader" which were thought lost for a long time. I guess that is why the characters in the film were so much better than the "Kady" movie they used to. I'm sure those movies would have been better than this - they are both too predictable and over-the-top - but I didn't care.  I wish to add that this movie is called a "Shorter Movie", because they chose to use the same theme music that was in "Liver of Tears", but only for the "shorter" part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I'd like to see this movie to see if it was as bad as I'd hoped. And I did. I have to admit that it was a bad flick. In fact, it was the worst thing I've ever seen, and I'm sure I'm wrong to say that. I've read several books and comments on how this movie was bad but I've never really seen a bad film like this. The plot of the film was pretty dull and pretty bad. I think the movie was basically the idea of a person who was drunk while trying to try to find out who killed the man. This guy was the one person who had to know who killed this guy, so obviously he had a very simple, logical problem. But what really drove him? The guy was in a weird situation and he was trying to find a way that would kill him. This is the same thing as the person in this movie. It has nothing to do with the person's situation but the writer didn't even make this matter. I'd really rather see an original, but that doesn't exist when the camera is put up at the window and is put away when the guy is killed. I don't know why I even want to see the movie with this film because I didn't want the plot to make me care more about it. And the acting was terrible. The guy wasn't very good, but I don`t see any reason for him to carry out his act as if he was a detective because he was obviously drunk. Also, the camera was put in the window during the movie and it was just one of two things that the film didn`t make me look any different. I thought he had seen this movie at a movie theater. In case he was there on his way to find the body. So, what does that mean? It makes me wonder why he was so confused. It must be hard to act as a detective without seeing people and seeing himself in the movie. You need to see some evidence of the human character before making a decision. In a movie where the characters are made of plastic and plastic and nothing has happened, it would have been better to make the character believe they had made a decision already because he obviously had no knowledge of this case. That`s right.  This movie is not great. It wasn`t awful bad but not brilliant or very good either. However, it could have been great if they were making the same movie as
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Bitter" in this film is "a bigger" who steals another girl's baby and has a child with her. This movie is just bad bad. How did it even get made? Well, you get some action sequences along with an evil clown-like character. There's also a few sexual scenes along with a hot chick in a bikini. It's just bad! There's not enough comedy and entertainment from it.  The story isn't too complicated, which could have worked better. The fact that the main character was a guy is just not enough to make this film interesting.   I'm sorry, but I can forgive most of the "Bimmer" and its makers, as they tried to build a compelling story. But this is really bad for film making. They should have at least tried to put something more interesting in the film. And, to be honest, if the film was made in France like that, it would be a bit better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read the previous comments, and I have to say that this is the most ridiculous of the awful films I have ever seen. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, although it certainly was the best in a bad way. The only good thing about this movie was the actors. They were good, but this is a total waste of their talent. As much as I dislike the director, I have no regrets. I thought there was nothing more absurd than this movie. Even worse than having a car in a hot tub, having a pool with a pool slide, having an aquarium in a room with a swimming pool, having fish swimming in the house in front of the garage... These are just some of the things that could have made this movie better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a generic one-note-one-note type. That means you can watch the movie and then wonder why you don't see more than one story. A couple of teenagers, one with a teenage girlfriend and one with the teenage brother, become a family-friendly family in a suburban home. A married couple, a couple who have a toddler daughter, and a couple with a grown family of four, go in together for a visit. Two of the kids end up having a pregnancy and, in another scene, they decide that their next baby should be their daughter.  At the end of the movie, the father says to his son that, "we'll keep our little boy away, and we'll pick the baby up on the next trip." The teenager tries to pick the next child. And you, for some reason, don't care. After some serious talk between the parents and the parents, the husband and girlfriend decide to leave the house and go on to rent another house.   This film isn't really a horror film. At most, it has some horror elements but is no horror. In my opinion, it's just not scary.  The acting was also poor. The actors acted like their main characters (or at least their main actors) and showed the least amount of effort. That doesn't make for scary performances. The script was poorly written. There's nothing funny in it. The only funny thing in it is the ridiculous gore. You see it in the beginning when they are both walking. A few minutes of blood is thrown in front of the camera to make the scenes scary and the camera camera look like a pile of gore. It just doesn't add to anything scary. Oh, I know you don`t get that as a shock to you. You know how they get blood in a pile and how they can get it back again. I thought of it to get that blood out, but that was not an idea that I could really wrap my mind around. The plot, especially the first scene in the story, has a "gleeful" ending. You could see this as a very serious tragedy but I couldn't. When the plot first started and the characters were introduced, I didn't think the film was going to be that scary, but the next few minutes proved to be the most disturbing thing that could happen at any point.  For a horror movie, it is pretty OK. But even so, I wouldn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've seen of 2016. There was a little bit of humor, but mostly just the sad and depressing nature of it, which was disappointing. The main plot is in a two-part sequence with a little family on the beach, which we thought would be a good time to relax and not even pay attention to. Then we're just left with a bunch of annoying characters, while the rest of the movie is a bunch for who is ready to lose their senses. It's not even funny when it's in front of a group of people, because at least the actors were good. Even the plot seemed like they were trying to make some jokes when the characters are surrounded by dozens of people.  It's difficult to guess what happened to everybody in the movie. There were plenty of scenes and scenes that weren't important to what happened, but we're not sure what happened or what people did. There's some weird scenes. Some things were really funny and others are completely pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely bad. It's boring and dull. Most importantly, it just can't stand out as a real film: it's simply a pile of crap. Not a good movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're gonna be a hater, then watch it, because I don't think there's such a good movie: it's a waste of entertainment and time, a cheap, cheap film no one would ever buy. If you want a decent movie, you can rent this movie to your local video store or in a video store. You will never get the benefit of these people and their movie titles. There's just so many movies, I don`t care to list them all.  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I didn't see much of the plot, it was not like the movies I've seen on TV (The Matrix and The Matrix, among many others) or any of the sequels. I did not find it to be funny. Not to mention that there was no real acting, the music was horrible, the acting didn`t look that funny. The only thing that worked in the movie was the music. What a waste.  I gave a 4.5 out of 10 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like another film of mine, the most poorly-made piece of trash that has been on my brain ever. It has nothing to do with the plot, nothing to recommend anything to anyone else's taste. There is a lot of bad movies and over-rated movies in the world, and this one is not one of them. But what a film it is! What a story, what a plot, what story! This movie contains nothing to connect with anyone else, and nothing to help anyone else. It's bad in all kinds of ways, I cannot remember a word that came from it. I don't have much more sympathy to it than I have to have to watch it. If I was so desperate for entertainment, I would have rented the movie myself. The ending is horrible, so horrible, bad, terrible, bad-bad. I can only hope to find the last few minutes to where I was left and to make up for my wasted time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a disappointing movie but at least it had some fun, and the storyline wasn't bad at all.  But the acting is so bad that it's not surprising that it actually got cast in this film.  The only thing that made the movie more interesting were the actors. Unfortunately the acting was terrible. The main story line was a horrible one, it only made the film worse, and it was terrible in the end, the only reason to spend the money on this movie.  Also the cinematography was horrible, it couldn't help because it didn't work. The idea that the audience would enjoy these types of scenes was ridiculous.  Overall this movie is bad because it's overrated. It was terrible and it failed to make you care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am surprised that this film is considered to be a "hit" film at all. Yes, it does have some interesting and unexpected elements. But the story is poor, not even the main actors seem to have given enough to make a believable and memorable performance. The movie starts out with a good idea but then drags the story around like a piece of junk junk.  You will be wondering whether the people involved will even be able to recover from this mess. If they are, then perhaps they are the characters that should have been on the screen the whole time. This movie will have a slow pace, but you will be bored, hoping you might see it to make your mind relax for a moment. However, I think it is a bad choice for a film. The plot is predictable, the characters are not convincing and the characters look like they've been shot from a double camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film when it was released in 1998. It was a horribly amateurish, ill-comprehended, badly written, poorly directed film that made no sense whatsoever. It's no wonder that this film is getting so much attention. The plot was not so convincing. The acting was terrible. The only positive thing I can say about this film was the story of the mother and daughter, who were forced to be a "mom" and the father's plan to keep her child from the drug dealers. It could have been a decent film if the movie could have dealt with all the abuse the mother endured. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film because it had a somewhat interesting plot. However, I couldn't believe the storyline and the director were not convincing. It just felt like a waste of money to watch it. I just couldn't quite make it work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really bad, but that's not the reason why I left the movie. I just wanted to give some other opinions.  The acting in this movie was horrible. It is a really bad movie. And the last one had the annoying sound of the "B" in the movie... It is ridiculous. I can't believe that is happening... I had the feeling of death in my stomach... I have never felt like that before. Even in the last minutes of the movie I was wondering what was going to be next... I don't believe anything could be worse than this film...    I am not sure if this movie is meant to be an English film... It just can't compete with something like "The Devil Wives". I believe that this movie doesn't need to be English to be released in English, because if it has English in the script, the actors should be in the same manner. And if this is supposed to be a film, it would have been better that this would be in English. This movie has nothing to do with language, so don't try to put yourself in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty confident in my beliefs when I first saw this movie, so I waited until I saw it at the Critique convention, and I can tell you that if you are a fan of science fiction that you will not understand. It is not even decent to watch this movie. I am not sure if it is a documentary or a film based on the work of Robert Kattoo. I cannot imagine why this is. You can probably even see the film if you have a long time with this genre of movies. I guess someone, with a big budget, would try a real documentary and put his own ideas on it. I don't think that's possible. If it's a documentary then a documentary is usually better, but this movie is pretty bad. Why? I will say that it is not so bad if you like the genre of science-fiction. It can't be an excuse to not watch this because this is not going to be a documentary. If you just wanted to see a documentary, then this movie isn't bad, although I think that it probably is the biggest waste of an hour ever. And the fact that I can't even say the full name of the "documentary" is also a bad sign of a bad "documentarian" film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like seeing the face of a monster. While this film was interesting I can't give much of it. The acting was poorly delivered, and the ending was just about the expected conclusion of this movie. Unfortunately, the ending of this film has ruined the overall quality of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie on DVD and i have a hard time finding this movie in a DVD store or any video store. I am a fairly intelligent person and I have a few friends who saw this movie and were horrified by it. I did not even think that it could be that bad but it does not deserve the title of the movie that it is. The acting was very amateur and the plot, while amusing, was extremely poor. The ending was disappointing and it really did not do justice to what the plot had been set up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of film, so I'm glad to see a documentary of this rubbish, but it's still awful. And worse than the documentary for that is the movie itself. In the beginning of the film, the movie begins, it starts to develop, but you can't really figure out the plot. The people are just making stuff up. At the beginning, they put a lot of money into the movie. But it was really very weak and they were very fake. Then they just had the action happening, but not enough to make a difference. So then at the end, they just put a disclaimer and just to say that the movie is completely bogus. I don't see anything that really made the movie, they are all fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a very poor attempt at a "golf film" in the sense that it's only the kind a film writer could make. Although I agree that the film had an interesting story, the plot of the film lacked any semblance of realism. If the film were based on a movie of the way things are, the story would be interesting. However, it was obviously a fake story. The movie was about a movie producer with the ability to make his fake story and then, that fake movie would then get into a "movie" that no one would even care about. And no one, in its current form, would ever see it. The acting is flat and the actors are wooden, and there are a few scenes that don't even go anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is just an excuse to blame the actors for it's incompetence. The plot had some good ideas, but it's just too predictable. And this film was just one of many terrible American films of the early 1970s. It would be hard to blame these movies on the fact that Americans didn't really get the "Hollywood feel". But it seems pretty obvious that the lack of "Hoho" quality in the first, and most important, scene was the way it just failed to capitalize.    In some respects, I'd like to believe that these actors were able to make a convincing performance. Alas, they weren't able to do so. Perhaps it would be better if there was a better version of this film and one of the better directors. But unfortunately the director of "Tadashi: A Little Dog" is dead now and the rest of the cast is no better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've been into a movie: I saw this movie in a friend's movie store a couple years ago and I'm sure it's not all bad and funny but this movie is just so bad and is not funny at all.   It's really disappointing to see someone doing this kind of work and not doing it right. What happened to the stars? The only way it really does get better is through the making of a funny DVD of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the problem is that most movies are made about human behavior. Most are about human interaction, and they are all about humans being selfish people who want to be loved and who want their stuff. But what you really do in a movie is that it's about human failure, and that is why the film is a failure. It is no surprise that when the characters are struggling to get money, it is also about how helpless they feel, and what is in their hearts and minds. I've seen many people fall into deep waters by watching this movie, and the only time I've ever seen it was when the people just wanted to be left alone and to go with whatever life their luck had. This is not film for people who have any idea of film making. The actors were just so bad that I couldn't help myself to care for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the few films that I ever see that has disappointed me. There were no big themes, no message. The acting was bad. It felt like a bad "B" film. In the film, everyone looked like an overgrown goat. I never liked these guys. They should have chosen to be the guys who was supposed to be a man with a lot of money and talent. There was something about these guys that was too annoying, and it wasn't funny enough to make me laugh. They just seemed like their characters were going out of their minds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had so much energy and potential in this movie but it failed miserly to deliver on this one. This movie was terrible. The acting was bad, the dialog was bad and the fact that there was no good story to follow or good comedy to act was pathetic. What was the message in the movie: that it was a horrible movie to see, that it wasn't worth seeing, that its potential was wasted, that this movie was a failure. No wonder that this is the best movie to be released in the world and it doesn't have it. There is one reason for me to be glad. It's not a bad one, it is one of the worst films ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot:  The film was about a bunch of aliens in space and an interplanetary war with many planets that had to be attacked by aliens. However, the movie was slow, annoying and really only played the "war" part for a few minutes. The biggest problem was the ending. Why should this be? The movie had so many holes in it, that the film really had no purpose. The ending was completely inconsistent and pointless. The storyline wasn't even believable.  The most interesting thing about the movie is that it had a really annoying premise and it didn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not even the best I've seen in a movie: I give this a 1/2 because I'd never liked it, and I'm never going to watch it again. The plot is extremely stupid, which is the only reason I gave this movie a 1.  I'm not really sure what's the point with this movie, but I'll be glad it's coming from the director of "Bigger Wives". In this movie I expected to find a female character that could develop the character I've so often watched over the years, but this is not that. This movie is about a girl with a big vagina and some extra special things. It's about a woman with the same size, but not the same body. This woman has no real personality, no real love, no meaningful relationships and no real storyline. It makes me wonder if she was so stupid she got pregnant before the movie was made. I can't believe that she was stupid enough to want a girl to spend her time with. It must have been that much easier to find someone that could be more appealing to someone with her weight and body. The ending is disappointing, but it's a lot better than any movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the original James Bond films of 004 and 002, but this one completely ruined it for me. I didn't care for it when they made it, I was just looking for something that was new and exciting. Unfortunately, they didn't deliver anything that was exciting. The only reason I had for liking this movie was the "great" production and acting, and that is pretty far gone now. The casting of the "top" Bond characters is disappointing, especially the portrayal of Dr. Hardy. In terms of the plot, it didn't do anything that could have been realistic. There was nothing new. The story was dull and lacking a "story" that could drive the plot forward. The scenes were predictable, and the only way that this movie made sense was when it became apparent that the "main" character, Bond, could have a great idea. If he didn't have one, I'd be interested in hearing more from him. It didn't help the actors either, and I can't believe that they cared. I do recommend that if you see this film, you do so without watching it. The movie seemed to be a standard action movie, but I felt that you would just be bored and bored, without the excitement that was obviously missing. I wish I could give my friends some hope that it would get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film looks to be like a really bad way to promote a sequel: a movie that can't even make sense.  The movie takes place in one town, but not one person, and features the same characters in the same role in several other towns. They are a bunch of guys with a few guns, who are all very suspicious.  There's nothing else that would make sense, and I guess you can't get an idea of what's going to happen in the movie.  Not funny.   What a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I had my hopes for the plot and some of the characters. But in all of it you just want a really annoying movie that doesn't let you see enough. It is like a movie from a third grade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first scene of the film contains no plot whatsoever. There's nothing except a simple rape sequence. The second scene consists of a brief dialogue between the "good guys" and the "bad guys". Then, the two men have a small conversation between them. I watched this film at a friend's house (in the early days of summer, when I was a teenager). My friend asked me, and after I watched the scene, I was totally surprised that they had "good" people. That was the whole problem. The film is weak, and nothing is ever true. The dialogue is so bad, the characters are so bad that you can't even talk with them. One of the characters even called his wife a "dirty whore". This is a true slap in the face of the cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have ever wondered why I've watched this film so many times since it debuted, I sure thought it would be one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, but it turned out to be awful. The film tries to take place in the fictional universe of the film, but fails to do that so. For example, we see a character named "Terebin" in a short period that is basically made to be a "supercomputer, a computer program in the future" as well as a computer of Terebin's origin.  We learn the "first computer", Tere Bin, which he uses to make himself famous, and he does so by throwing it into a computer, and then, we don't see the computers from that time before "Tahsada".  Once Tere bin is in, we learn the name of the "computer" and how it was used by the "forever" (and not the "computers"), and then we finally see the "Thing" that Tere thinks is the "super Computer."  As you can see, the "clay" (the clay-like substance that Tiber's is made from), is used for a variety of purposes in the film. It's just not used for anything that was important. When Tere is in the movie, he was actually a scientist, a mathematician, a magician, and so, when he was in the past he is a famous person who was at the center of all science in the universe, so, the computer was made that way.  A lot of stuff about the "future" and its history goes missing, while the movie itself goes to great lengths to try and convince us that the "real" world was made at some point in the "2000s" and so Tere isn't the "creator" of the movie. But that's only the beginning, because the makers of the fake world of Tiber and the "imagination" of Tah and his sister are pretty brilliant, even for a movie that has "realism" as its principal theme. The movie also tries to make its point, but is pretty vague, and it fails. The biggest problem with the film is the story. Even if the story had some real "plot", the movie is just about as vague as possible.   The premise is that a computer is created that is capable of seeing and experiencing everything that you can read. This is not
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie: 1st, a stupid premise, which I can't say is the only thing that this movie does.  2nd, a dumb plot - dumb-but that's OK, and funny. 3rd, a story that has no plot, a predictable, predictable and flat. 4th, a horrible acting. 5th, the editing is terrible. I had a headache and it was hard to read.  Overall, a lousy comedy, but I do see several movies that are good, but this one is not one of those. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really, really bored with this. I've never seen anything like this, and if you see the trailers you'll know this for sure. What was it that made me watch this? My rating is 1, but I'll admit that it isn't a good movie. It was obviously made for low budget so that it would seem like a decent effort, but it is painfully slow, boring, and just plain plain bad.  The plot is very vague and I don't understand why they put this all together. They should have put in a lot of more background and atmosphere before that happens. It isn't good enough for any director to say it's a movie.  I've seen this before but I won't really tell you. But if it was any worse than this I wouldn't even care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good thing about this movie is that most of the supporting cast are excellent, even the villain. The other actors suck, and the story is completely unbelievable. Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you read the title, you're going to be pissed. You're not going to like "The Last Summer".  Well, you might be curious to check out the "Summer" video, but if you're not, then just watch the "Tina". That's the only movie I recommend. Even if you love "The Summer", it's just too bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of movie that is exactly what I imagine most of us would avoid at the expense of their lives. When I sat through this, I couldn't even see the story. It was basically about a woman who is married to a horrible husband who is going to take her children. The two leads, they get together, get pregnant and marry and have a baby, with no regard for the children, and the rest of the movie goes on, and while it's going, there are so many instances of sex that are forced to do so! The characters aren't very good, and there is a really annoying sex scene with a bunch of naked men that make you cringe! There was some humor in some parts, but you don't want to watch those scenes again, and it's the only movie I would have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the first episode, I found myself wondering how much the show had really gone, and I turned on the television to see if I could find it. Luckily, I got the opportunity to try the second episode. This episode has really nothing to recommend, other than the fact that it is the worst episode I have ever seen. The plot is a very bad attempt at a comedy, with an extremely disappointing ending (not quite as much as I expected) and a painfully predictable dialogue. The only reason I can describe this is that it seems to have no real plot, other then that it has no real characters. It seems a bit like a TV film where people were shouting to each other and the only characters involved are a bunch of kids.   This episode had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the show, except the plot. If the writer had put more effort into this, I would have been more impressed and more in to see it. If anything, it is extremely bad. This is a shame to see. It is just bad on purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only give this rating a rating. It was bad. I cannot understand why the director chose to waste so much time on this. The only reason why I bothered to even watch this movie is because I could have done something better than what the writer had done. The first scene is where the main protagonist is introduced as a woman who loves him only to find out that she is dead (and she dies from what she wants to have done to him). It's like they just wanted to show some more stupid scenes.  The next scene is about a little girl who is pregnant. When she's pregnant, she's got some guy boyfriends and they all make her pregnant. They all give the girl some pills and that is what makes the girl pregnant. The next thing she does is just try to do something so that she can get pregnant. She tries to get pregnant and then she has sex with them! The last scene was about a person who died by drowning and had been revived. The scene was just about like a typical zombie flick but in this one you see blood everywhere... And there are no corpses of people that are dead. I have read this movie twice and I was really bored with it. I do not care if you are a horror movie, or you have a great sense of humour, you are absolutely nothing. I don't know how I will ever be able to finish watching this one. I am truly disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie is an advertisement for a bad movies, I am expecting to get paid for it. It's not going to be in a good movie. It is about a group of guys who steal a little boy who is tied down. But if the boy was kidnapped, the movie would be a really bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had the worst cast of the first wave of films directed and the worst supporting cast in the whole history of film, but it was fun to watch and the director and writer just did it. This was the only film that I have ever seen that was so bad. Now, I am a film collector and as such have seen hundreds of great films. If there were some of these films this could have been the same. But this is not that. The plot of the movie revolves around the relationship between the two main characters and some vague sex talk but no real sex is ever discussed. The only thing that was ever brought into the movie is the sex in the bedroom with the two actors. This isn't even remotely a sexual scene, and no one ever even touches the bed. There was a sex scene between the main two characters but this was just a lot of dirty looking guys. I'm not one of those weird looking guys who are in movies, and it's like the "Mysteries" movies.   I didn't even see the actors who made this movie. They all looked like some actors who are only slightly taller and smaller than the actors. The whole premise of the film is that the main actors have had some nice little secrets and they are now married to each other, and the two are now engaged to each another. There is no end to this. What we are really getting is a weird, ridiculous plot and bad acting. You might as well watch a "Mystery Men" movie for that reason.  This is the first film I've seen in which I have actually wanted to skip as much as I could. If I'm lucky I will catch some of the other movies and they will probably be more enjoyable than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first thing i think that i have not seen in my life since I saw the first one in the theater. And i am an adult, i have seen only 4 movies before and i have never seen this one, and i am a big fan of James Bond, not to mention the other actors who are the same. I guess if you are stupid and i love James Bond then this movie isn't for you. This movie was horrible in every way possible. If you like James Bond you will not enjoy this one. This one was not an English thriller like "M" or "Goldfinger", but I thought it lacked something. It was only when the ending was announced that i finally realized how horrible it was. Not only does it seem like this was James Bond's last movie but the other two James Bond movies that come out were of the same genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what they used to sell in the UK in this year, even before "The Hobbit" got the chance to release.  The movie starts off with a fairly decent plot but then fails to stick around - I'm thinking because of the lack of character development and the ridiculous dialogue in this first scene.  As the film plays, a couple of men find themselves on an island where they've lost their husbands (in a fight, no spoilers). When they find themselves having to fight their way out of their predicament, a few moments before they're able to go back to the island, they're treated to the same scene as the first one and it starts off going nowhere but then quickly falls apart.  This movie does not really develop anything. You only really feel like there is a storyline, but the only "plot" is the story of the couple trying to escape (in the same way they get lost) and they're having some really bizarre scenes with an over-used "spooky" name - "Ghosts of the Forest" is really dumb but for the sake of it it you want to try it.  If you're looking for a movie with a plot, don't let it turn into a "spook" - there are better ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dr. Z" is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story is pretty standard, you get a little bit of character development, a couple of interesting situations, and then you have the typical cheesy, silly story and the movie plays about 30 minutes.  And at the end of the movie you will have the annoying, yet hilarious, "climax moment" and you will probably die.  The good movie: 'The Butterfly' - it is a great film. But 'Dr. Zen' only makes one movie more boring than good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have the nerve to call this movie "silly." It's no different than the other "sly" movies that have come before. It's a little bit worse than "Dukes of Helper" and it doesn't even make sense. The acting is bad and the plot is bad. But we've seen it all before. If you want to see some smart, sophisticated film with a few well made, interesting films, you'd pick a "Duke" movie with a creative plot, a movie with some beautiful, beautiful characters, and some great dialog, or if you want a movie that's got a plot to build, a well made story, and a funny face, go to "Dude'Naked" without an ending. I'd suggest if you just want to watch something stupid and funny that isn't meant to be a joke, you might pick "Dudes" and "Docks" or "Duggy" instead. The rest of the movie is pretty funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about a ridiculous plot - a love interest of one girl and another, and the results of the movie are horrible. That was the reason why the movie was canceled. In order to achieve this ridiculous plot, the film's creators didn't even try to make the movie. They had to make a whole movie about an incest scene - it's hard to believe they have the balls to do this. The plot, to some extent, is about the girl falling in love with the girl that she loves. Of course, that would be the story, not the actual scene. The incest scene is nothing about the actual act, but that's also a spoiler for the movie (which I didn't like). I'd much prefer to watch the actual movie rather than the special effects. What a terrible ending, why was the movie made? Why this movie was never released? A really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had some redeeming qualities (for a true horror film) but, overall, it lacks the authenticity and consistency needed for a horror movie, not to mention an adequate one.  If you have some low budget horror films, like this, I suggest you watch it once, then see the next time. You may not like it, but, sadly, you will probably never enjoy it.  The acting was awful. The dialogue was a mere two or three lines.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a small group of people, who are forced to act in a fictional war, which they are not in. The plot is bad.  I'll say it's bad. So it's not a bad film. In fact, I thought it was good, but the story didn't make me think.  For example, they could make a real war, where the soldiers would decide whether to go into battle, or to be killed.  The plot was predictable, but bad, especially since it happened just in the same way every time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was boring and stupid.  The plot was interesting but nothing new. It just got worse by the way of the dialogue, the acting and the direction, and the directing was awful.   There is no reason to watch this movie.  Don't waste your time and money on this movie, just don't like it. The best part of this movie was not in the acting, not even in the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a movie with a plot so bad that I have not been able to relate to anything about it. It has to be said that I'd give this movie a rating of 7.1 and I'd only go for a 7. It's a bad little movie, but it's fun enough. For example, a black vampire named "Raven" and a vampire named Vanessa, who have a "normal" appearance and only "normal people" are their victims. Why there's such a weak plot? If you are the type who loves vampire films, you'll love this movie... But if you've read the books, you won't.   If you want a movie to be a real vampire film, go ahead and rent "The Vampire Chronicles: Blood Bloody Moon" or "Blood Bloody Moon".   Oh, well, you're just lucky I guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm one of the worst of my life and I have no faith to save myself. I find this to be just one more reason of having this poor film. I can only believe that the producers of this crap film have no thought whatsoever that their film would be enjoyable to viewers. This is just pathetic and one of those films that just doesn't have enough content to keep the viewer entertained. I'm going to have to find something better than this, but don't really know what. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is an odd but I guess I guess someone else had to take a moment to watch it just to make a point. The acting is simply bad. I didn't like the story in the beginning. I guess that the writers were not interested in this story so they added a little humor and it works, but the story falls apart as it goes. The plot has a really stupid ending. I don't know why. I'm really confused when it ended. The movie has a pretty good ending, but it was way too late for me to get it to happen. I think there is a lot of people who are happy with the storyline but I think they are a bunch of people that can't admit this stuff.  The movie was about a teacher who lost his job. It seems like she is in love with a good teacher but she is making stupid mistakes and then loses her job. I'll try to buy it: I gave it 5 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing, no, nothing, and at least no good movie. Well, at least it didn't kill the original The Wolfenstein franchise. I was expecting a movie about The Wolfensko Brothers, the kids that would bring The Wolfenwolf to life. I thought that it would be a fun addition to the series, but it just couldn't do it. I didn't get any interesting part in it, and I'm not sure if any of the kids would have wanted to work in a film that could be so bad. I'm hoping that it is a great addition to a "sprint" or movie that is at least interesting to work out with. The idea behind it is that the kids are so young, and the director is trying to make kids seem more mature, but I think they were a little too old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was lame, not a good movie... It really is that way of saying something, but it does not do that, so much as I like, so it really does not. It really just tries to take a lot of things out of the world, like, what happened to them in the real world... And is that pretty ridiculous to me. I'm not sure why they decided to make this movie, but I think that it really is what they should have done. The director did a great job but, it's too dark and too badly filmed... I really felt like they should just take it away and leave it, like "The Lord of the Rings" movies and films from earlier times... Anyway, the acting is OK, there was one funny guy, but most of the movie is bad. I had a little bit of hope... I'll give this movie a 6 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you enjoy watching horror film, you'll love this one but it is a really awful film, not a horror film of any kind, I would think it would have to be something more like I'd like to see in an English language. The story is just bad and the acting is awful. There are some funny scenes in it but the actors are just awful, not funny at all. I wouldn't recommend watching this film for kids. There is absolutely nothing to make you laugh in! If you are a horror movie fan and you have any sense of humor or humor and a heart in your head, you should avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even say this film is bad, but I thought it wasn't even bad. But it is bad. It starts with a plot that involves some guy with a "junkie" personality and a bad-looking girlfriend. The dude decides to make the person he was in love to and start getting back with the girl. Then the film is about how his friends decide to bring him back to life in this world. He is obviously dead, and the film continues with some weirdly strange and disturbing things. I have been watching this movie for about 15 minutes and didn't even finish it until the 2 hour mark. The script is bad but not really that bad. There are some scenes that can only be described as "terrifically stupid" but the rest of the scenes are extremely poor. The acting is not even worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie the other day, and I've noticed a bit of a pattern in it's ending. When you find it in a movie, you expect it to be a great flick, but then after the big twist happens, you suddenly lose your interest. I'm pretty sure that it was just a big twist in the film that made people lose interest, so I just didn't like this movie. I was a bit annoyed by the fact that this movie didn't follow the plot. For example, when the villain is playing to the camera, you would expect it would be great, but it just didn�I don't know if it was a spoiler to the movie. There are plenty of plot twists that bring you to tears. For most movies, I think they are pretty good if you can stay with it for a few minutes, but I don't want to do anything else. You can try to predict what happens at the end of the movie, but if you don�t, then you just have to find out the ending and then try to figure out what happens. But sadly, it doesn�t go that far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director's first-rate special effects were a doddi-and-the-robot kind of film. Not all that was in the story, and not all that is in the plot, the two girls have a lot of very boring situations. We all know it, and if we hadn't been spoiled by the previous story, I'd have believed that they would actually be the same people. The director, however, is an incompetent artist, and his lack of thought is plain to see. It's a joke, and I think we've seen worse than this before. I have been looking for years to find something like this, and no luck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought "Shutter 2" was about three times better than this one. Maybe it was better to have this one than the earlier version. The movie was only two and three minutes longer than the one from the first director's hands. I felt like the entire movie was nothing more than a "Shower" movie with a very few hours to work. When I was expecting a movie about Shutter 1, I decided to see it for myself and laughed at how stupid it was.  The movie would have been a much better experience if you had it from the "Dances With Babies" days, and instead of a "Dive" movie, you would just be staring at your naked girl at the beach.  My hope was that if this movie had a real story about a real person, it would be interesting. It's a little sad that this movie isn't. There are two people in the movie, and they are a really scary couple. I'm not even sure they are real people, but I felt they were just creepy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty bored when I finally found this movie on the Internet. I couldn't believe that it would have been just from a "documentary" and a documentary. I had to watch the trailer. It was a blatant attempt at a "Bachelorette" show, with a "humbler" who plays a part in this film.  The movie features a female who we can't seem to find as either a movie or a TV actor. Her name, "Barbara Ann McQuadder", is listed at the beginning of the "documentaries" listing the "film" as a documentary or "documentation" and shows a series of pictures, of which she looks like a lady who is a sexpot. I didn't think that would be the case. The female is a very boring character, but I thought she was "uninteresting". The scene with the camera, when she is alone in the kitchen, seemed so shallow and uninspiring.   Not one to be a film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is completely unfitting. I know a lot of people have trouble reading this type of movie. I'm sure they don't get that this is a movie that is trying to be an adult version of the "Mysterious" novel, but it doesn't have the ability to do so. For starters, the characters are completely un-suited to the plot. They have their lives and the people who would normally be their companions. They are, in effect, completely detached from the plot, and their attempts are for no purpose whatsoever. I really think they should've just kept the plot alive in some sort of way. I would've liked to have seen a couple of lines about these characters, the basic plot, the people's lives, and the main characters instead of the actors. But then there are a couple scenes that don't work in any real sense. The story is simply not there, and we get a few scenes that are absolutely unbelievable and that were probably meant to be some sort sentimental, but the writer/director just don't like how it makes any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so terrible that it is actually painful to watch. The main actor is obviously terrible, but the script is so dull. I'm sorry to say that even the most ignorant of people in this country have to look this movie up. The idea of putting the actor in a body suit and putting him in a chair is just plain stupidity. I would really like to find this movie on video so that I can watch it and laugh at it. It's only worth having the director do a "B" rating and be ashamed of the failure of such a piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. I don't understand any more. But if you like the story of a good movie, you would watch it. The plot of this movie is too stupid to make any sense, like a movie from the "Mad Men" series. The ending, which is extremely predictable, just kills you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only horror film that has ever made me look twice. I know what it's about and I have just seen it once, but I really don't remember. It was not funny. My only guess is that the plot is similar to a previous one with a similar name, so there might have been a similar premise and I'm wondering if there is one.  Oh. The girl has been kidnapped, the man is on the side of the bus and he's dead, but she was able to find a car and get in.  I couldn't have imagined that this would happen. It really isn't one of those films. It's really just a piece of trash, nothing better than a bad VXU-2 or a bad The Road Dog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is meant to be a horror film, it is horrible. There is no suspense or suspense to make, it's just a boring "horror" movie. I really couldn't believe this was a horror movie. It's not even scary. It just doesn't even make any sense. This movie had no suspense. I just did not understand it. The movie could have been made that way but the story was very poor. And the plot was too simple to make sense. All I thought it was made by a few friends of friends, who just wrote a bad review about the movie: it is like a black guy in a black box.  The acting was pretty good and the plot had some twists, but it just was too unbelievable for me to understand what happened, and it was way too confusing. There are a lot of jokes in it, but they just couldn't stay interesting or make any use of it. They just seemed like another "horrory" movie, without any suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little while later I found myself back in the movie where a lot of things like this happen in real life, and I began to wonder whether the filmmakers knew or intended to portray something like this. I found no way to avoid this terrible thing, and when I got the chance to do so, I chose to turn it all the way off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I didn't enjoy the movie very much. The acting of the characters seemed weak and the cinematography was terrible. The scenes looked really awful and it is impossible to read anything in the script that seemed believable. The cinematography in this movie looked like I was watching a poorly made and uninteresting film. It is difficult to know whether to say anything about the acting or the story, because nothing seemed believable even though the characters looked good. I cannot understand why this movie was released in the Netherlands. In France this movie is released in France. The movie was supposed to be in France, but I think it is just in the United States. The storyline is very confusing, there is a lot of it just about how to tell something. I don't even think that the people in this country know what is happening. They don't talk like the Americans. There is only one real man in the movie. The woman is just a teenager, who we must be extremely lucky to find her. In the US there are more people, I think the man in this film is a family man in a small town. I would have liked to know more about how the people of this village live and what they do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about to be awful as ever. And if this movie is to be truly bad, I can't think of anyone who could make it a decent movie. The premise of this movie that was totally missing in reality is about as dumb as a plot as I have ever seen. The fact that this is a movie that can be made in the next hour is, unfortunately, not funny. It's simply a waste of time. I'm so disgusted by this movie's failure to make me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty good and it's a good idea. But then the script was very predictable. The film was about a group of Americans who get attacked by a terrorist. This film made an unnecessary subplot with the characters.  When the terrorists try to capture the other Americans, the camera is at the top of the screen and it seems as if the camera isn't moving. This is just the kind of movie that comes on like a bunch of guys in a car trying to get somewhere.  The acting is awful. The acting was terrible. The plot was too predictable and the plot was pretty convoluted. The ending wasn't really good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a true adventure film. They take a lot of time and money to make and then waste most of it on ridiculous scenes and scenes that will not even be recognized by the audience. There are far more interesting scenes about a bunch of people who go on vacation and who just find the right place. These scenes are poorly drawn and poorly executed, not even good enough for a true indie film. There is no plot, no believable characters, and no real storyline. This makes you wonder what happened. The only thing worth paying attention to are the annoying and irritating cast members. The good actors who have a great script and have some great screen appearances in their roles, but most of them are pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is nothing. it does nothing but try to make a few more for the sake of TV (I guess TV) so it will make an impact on TV and get a few viewers in it, but it lacks quality and its a terrible attempt at humour and a terrible script. the actors aren't as good as they were in the TV show (or they don't look that way at all) and they aren't that good to watch. i would suggest they don´t want to watch this movie, but to all the horror fans, you're better off sitting through some old-school comedy where you will laugh more and not let the whole plot go downhill. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I love a good movie: it's horrible, but not the fun one I expected.   You can find out it for free on IMC movies:  The movie is an extremely boring plot, not even original. If you've never seen a movie like this, you will probably be the least fun one in the bunch. If only two things in this movie were interesting; the actors (who I have never seen), the locations (which I don't know), and the dialogue, but none of these have a good supporting cast.  A horrible ending makes the film so sad that it's just awful.  Avoid it if you have seen it before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete disaster. While it may be funny at first, it is so horrible it's so bad you can't really think of funny, you've probably got mental health problems. The funny moments are so boring, the dialogue so poorly written that it has no real value. The actors aren't good either, and I don't understand any of the chemistry. The best bit of the movie is when you have a good laugh: a couple of people talk about a little animal trapped in the woods, they tell jokes about "the other animals" and try to make them talk, then they get mad and run away into the woods.  That's OK. But, it's bad to let the story go so far. In fact, the whole movie is so terrible that you really don't care how good the story is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Beverleyville is like a big fat and drunk drunk guy who gets so much drunk in every day he can't think of anything except the fact that he is drunk and thinks he needs to make up a bunch of really stupid movies. He doesn't really try to act in some sort of realistic ways like he has been told a lot of times by his parents that he was a real funny and funny as a kid. I never found out what he is thinking on his way home. He does a whole lot of "funny" things and he does a lot like he is a really big stupid drunk guy. I just think he doesn't have any brains and should stay in the dark hole with a bunch more people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the film twice, and after viewing it, I have found no reason to think otherwise. In fact, it is not funny, and no one will recommend it to anyone, although it does have the benefit of being a film set in the 1930s. The plot is utterly stupid, the acting is bad, the direction is terrible, and the dialog is simply not convincing, and it is likely to kill your appetite for the film. I cannot give this movie any of the medals in any of its genres - it does not have any depth or value.   The film stars Robert Blake (as an adult, played by Robert Blake), a cop who hates the government, works as a detective and is now forced to join the Army, and works for the newly established National Guard.  Blake is killed in a gun massacre by the government's own men, and then killed by the Army. The police has the idea that Blake will be a little "special" in a few days and will be released from prison, so they can take care of Blake's body.  How are they going to find Blake in the grave at a cemetery? There's no evidence of any graves in it. There are grave guards, there's no bodies, there are only grave trees - there's nothing here. So Blake goes into a graveside at the local cemetery and finds the grave's coffin in the middle of the graves. Blake's wife, Elizabeth Blake, visits him, and she gets caught up in a sexual scandal involving his widow (played by Annabella Ruff) - who kills Blake's friend.  So Blake wants to release Blake from prison and is at first told she'll be a "special"; that his jail record will be put in the drawer. When they arrive at the cemetery, she asks Blake to pick a grave in it and bury her husband.  As the detective begins to look into the grave and it's empty, Blake goes off on an expedition with his wife. He discovers a cave, as the grave in the hole contains nothing but a couple of cattles. At night, Blake finds a dead woman (played, by Maggie Hutton) who's been dead for 10 years and wants to return her dead body to Earth; she gives him a bone, which he takes. He's even asked a group of people to dig it up. The search is a short film - it's over in less than 90 minutes, leaving Blake dead - who sees a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The scene with the "doom" is probably the most laughable scene in the entire film. It's pretty unbelievable that these people had so much time and money to make a movie out of this utterly lame scene. This isn't an isolated incident, it's a common theme of movies that people put out for poor people and then get another couple of actors to do it and see how their film is done. If you want to see a movie that revolves around people getting drunk in a bar then it's not going to help. This movie is no more than a pathetic attempt at a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In most movies this is something to avoid. I like to watch a good movie, like "The Adventures of Napoleon."  Well, not so much, and "The Secret History" has been pretty bad in comparison.  I think that "Secret History" is a movie to watch. But "The Spy Who Saved the World" is just the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't believe that this is a sequel to "The History Channel."  The other sequels to "History Channel" are alright, and I like "Battle Against Giants" and "Lunge!" but "Secret history" doesn't make the same impression. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just ain't right. It's not a horror flick and should never be considered one. It was supposed to be a movie about a woman that was crazy and wanted to get revenge in revenge for her husband killing her husband and her parents. That's not what it is, but I have to wonder why this movie made it.  It is simply a horrible, sick and un-fun movie, and really nothing else. It doesn't have any redeeming properties or any great surprises, besides a certain amount of humor. I am surprised that there is no plot. I had to find out that it's not actually a movie because this isn't really a horror movie in the least. It has a lot of stupid (spy-) jokes, some of which I find humorous only in a small percentage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really only a joke. The movie was so horrible, it was a depressing waste of time.  I just couldn't even watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. It is the worst movie of all the years. If they had a better name for a movie starring a guy in an underwear, it would have been great. But instead they hired a director for this horrible movie.  I've seen many movies made since this movie, but I didn't like them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been completely ruined by a horrible script, a bad, bad story, bad directing, bad acting, bad special effects, and bad special effect, and worst music. But what really stands out as the worst part of the movie is the very stupid movie. It starts with a bunch of teenage actors getting a little bit drunk, then going to jail for a few days. A few days later, they're hanging out in a club and making love, while singing a few songs. If they're making love in their bedrooms, you're going to have to wonder why they hadn't been sent to jail before. And, it's pretty obvious that the gang members who are going out with the music club are drinking, and doing drugs and going around and having sex with the girls. They're getting together in the most pathetic way possible. But you have to wait until they finish off doing drugs together. So, when the police see them doing drugs in the club, they stop them and arrest them. So what does they do next? They send them to jail, and then, with their music and music, the gangsters start singing songs. They are singing songs that seem totally random and completely incomprehensible. But they don't know what they are singing about. I thought the song was supposed to be about a love story, but it turns out to be a song about drugs and prostitution. Why? I have to admit, I did not take much time with the lyrics, so I just decided to just watch the songs for about 10 minutes. And then I decided to find out the story. I wanted to find this out, so my curiosity got stronger when I started watching the story and seeing the girls dancing in the nightclub, and getting the gang made me curious. This obviously is not a movie intended for adults, and by the way, I do not think it's intended for children either.  I cannot say that the acting was good, the acting could have been a lot better. And the music, which was so bad, was so weak, the idea seemed so contrived that I think I wouldn't have seen it coming. The ending of the story seems like a bad joke, but if the story was in a real person's head and not some movie set inside the whole world, the ending of this movie was like a big joke. Even if the ending was supposed as a big, silly joke, it was so over-the-line-stuff stupid, I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry, I had to sit through this movie because I felt it was supposed to be about a romantic love and romance between the two, so obviously it's not. I know I might have done more with it but I'm pretty sure I got turned off after the second hour.  Also, I didn't have any kind of feeling for the characters--I felt like they were nothing more than actors, not even real actors--which isn't what I want to be watching. But the plot is good.  The movie was awful. The ending was horrible. I found that to see just two minutes through the beginning of the movie was the best thing in it. The acting was poor, although, if you are watching it for more than two minutes, you'll find it's very enjoyable, but the characters themselves were bad--really bad.   My other comments:  It was interesting to see the romance between Paul and Kim--and this was bad enough to keep you awake--but the romantic relationship was so bad that it made it seem even worse that the movie itself was bad. I just wish I had more time to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have done better at a martial arts video in school or at the martial arts studio if I had been able to get a chance to watch the video. This movie is the opposite of that. A simple film of some people pretending to take on a real man and fighting one-on-one battles for the title of "king" is no way for anybody to enjoy in that area of the world. For example, the fake actor playing a fake king at some point is attacked by "the real king" while fighting with an "real king" who is not really king but is pretending to be king. I just can't believe that somebody who's actually not king can even make fun of himself in a video game when he's pretending to have a fake title. It seems like a cheap joke to get people to laugh at so the producers knew that they couldn't go to school to get even a small budget of filming and editing. I think it's an excuse to get some cheap movies made and not a film that was worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days after I rented the movie I woke up and decided to see it on HBO and was horrified by the sheer incompetence, and after watching it I decided to cancel it. The acting was bad, the plot was pathetic and the movie was so bad that I decided not to rent it.  I rented "Kung Fu Master" on HBO, and that was a good movie, if only for the novelty of seeing an obscure movie. The story is about a man who discovers a kung fu masters training camp and hires some of his martial arts training students. That's about as dumb as this movie.  The only reason I rented this movie is that it had a lot of action and a plot, so I decided it was good to rent anyway. But what were the other two? What was it that made me decide to rent this? The movie is about 2/3, it's really quite bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My rating: 3/2.   This movie starts off with a good idea - the whole plot is about an escape plan of a group of people, one of whom will need to go down a certain way.  The first thing that has happened in the movie is that the entire cast has just been cast in a few scenes.  What happens next is that this is a movie where the cast and the sets are just thrown together, and there is little interesting and even minimal dialog. The plot is, basically, just an excuse for getting more "interesting" shots. It is really not something that needs to make the film more interesting.  It can't be blamed for the horrible visuals and sound either. It's hard to remember that there are a lot of guns in this movie. And even worse - it is really, REALLY just a boring, pointless plot.  For example - there are no shots of people screaming and killing, with people getting chased by something - either that is the "tough guy", or the "robbers" coming across it. The only thing that really works are the scenes of a giant bird flying around the city. That is it just another way of trying to find and kill people for not having the right answers. If the film was at all interesting, you could have seen the way the scenes were made. That was pretty good, and the characters had the right personalities. But the movie just didn't develop with anything interesting. It just wasn't something I would enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised they even mentioned it here. I've read a lot of horror flicks, and it's the case for me that this is the worst I've ever seen in cinema.   The scene where you're screaming at someone at a hotel room is a joke - but not funny.  The movie doesn't make up the full-length horror films that used to be a little scary in the 1950s. There are no "clocks of motion" in this film, so it doesn't give you nightmares. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is completely horrible, if only because the actors manage to do it without a single human in it. The plot is an obvious rip off from "The Matrix"--the movie that inspired many of the Matrix characters--and it is, in part, a complete failure. The acting is flat, the plot is too vague, the characters are not interesting, the "plot" is an empty one. This is unfortunate, because I would love to see a movie that was actually inspired, rather than the one that is a movie of one's imagination and its fantasy. Unfortunately, I have nothing to compare the movie to (and it still isn't that at all, since it is pretty much like the movie that spawned the "Matrix" franchise). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast was awful. Most of the cast were awful. While acting was good, they didn't have a story. The only thing that saved the movie was the fact that the ending was good. However, this is a movie made from nothing. It is hard to sit and watch this movie. There are too many unnecessary twists and a bad ending. It could have been made much better by a very simple plot. I am really looking forward to not seeing this movie ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is only good if you like a "My Little Pony" movie with lots of dancing and a lot of nakedness. Not the way to make any kind of decision, but it is bad if you ever had any other interest in a show: a cartoon, a musical, a real movie. This movie has nothing, nothing, no special qualities, nothing that was good before. I don't want to watch more episodes of "MyLittle Pony", because the movie has so many bad scenes and I was just annoyed at the fact that the movie is about "My little Pony" and not "My Boy!". The first episode of "Little Pony" seems to be about "my little Pony", but the next episodes are only about "the Pony", and I don`t believe that is the "name" of the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't even funny at all. This movie had me laughing in frustration at some of the bizarre things I thought were in the film. The acting was incredibly bad, there is absolutely no way for a real person to be in this film.  There was a funny moment where a character made a wish to die so he could make a wish on his mother.  This movie should have been called "Taken Away". The fact that this movie made it to the movie store could not even be true because it was just about a week after I saw it. This is probably the biggest shock to me of this movie. If anyone can make an attempt at making a decent film this has to be some of their worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was bad to even the best of their famous comedies. a little bit of fun would have been entertaining and maybe even to me. but unfortunately the whole cast and script is a huge disappointment.  i found the whole movie a waste of time and time to watch. the only way i can say this is to watch it so i can see the movie at a decent speed.  if you like "The Unscripted" then you'll really enjoy it. if not then you will just watch it on your car. it is not worth wasting your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed out loud at this film. It was terrible, it was absolutely terrible, the whole "Maine Seductifying" thing had lost its energy. I just couldn't believe that this had so little substance. If this were even a decent movie, it would probably be one of my favorites. But, unfortunately, it wasn't. It is bad enough to get the director of this movie fired for it. It isn't funny, it isn't cute, it is just awful. I recommend that you leave this movie alone. If you have any sense of humor, don't see this movie. I did, however, enjoy the funny scenes. It's just about the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen nothing but mediocre martial arts movies over the years, and with nothing to recommend to me or anyone else except a very, extremely awful movie: I was disappointed to find out this piece of crap in a Hollywood production.  I had hoped that the producers would have taken some inspiration from this movie and perhaps we would have gotten some good acting from it. If you had seen it, and if the movie was any good, then it probably wouldn't have been that bad. I don't know how one would even come out to "make" this movie. It is really just a typical story of a young man (the son of a Japanese family) and his sister is attacked by a couple of thugs, but it can't seem as if you don't actually see the scene where the Japanese mother is attacked. The only real thing that makes this movie is the actors (the characters are really bad, but that's not the case with the movie itself), they're obviously not actors who have the talent to act.  The plot does not make any sense (as I had imagined) and the dialog is totally stupid.  In all, I thought this movie was just plain trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not a real classic, but a pretty awful attempt at comedy, that would be the highlight of a poorly made movie. The premise is a story of a young father who has fallen on some bad drugs, and has been taken in to an abandoned home, and he falls in to a mad doctor, who kidnaps the whole family. The movie follows a story that includes a few very strange and unbelievable situations, and it is not all too good either. A few of the characters, for example the father's daughter, are pretty useless and their only appearances are in "the last few hours".  I found most of the scenes to be ridiculous. Most of the actors were either stupid or pretentious. I thought the scene where the "doctor" used his own razor to cut the victim in half was particularly silly.  I didn't really think the movie was funny. However, if you're looking for a comedy movie, this is probably the best film to choose. But if you are expecting a comedy, you might have been expecting something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on HBO. The premise was that this would be a film that was about some girl, a man, and a couple of kids in which it would be an easy way to get the kids to start a relationship with her...but apparently that was not the case.  I don't know if they thought that this was really something that was so simple that was easily solved, but it seems to have worked out in other ways. The acting wasn't great either. The only good scenes were those when the kids were in the room together, which was obviously just one scene but I thought they were boring and the movie seemed like it was going to be an hour long to watch.   So after watching this I decided to give this film a rating of 2/10, and I have no confidence that anyone will ever find this movie. If the movie has anything to say to anybody it doesn't do. I give this movie 2/2 out of 10...I hope I can survive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only film I have ever rented and it is the first time I have rented a DVD of anything. I had initially thought that this film would be a "good" film but after the initial shock of seeing it, I didn't understand how bad it really was. I rented the DVD only because I had just rented "The Hobbit" and I was determined to see the sequel.  I had no faith in this film and when I tried to "hold" it at the start of watching it I saw that the actors would have put themselves in the hands of the actors they had the script for. If that was a feature, I would have taken that point on faith. I don't believe in films made that much, but what we had seen in "Taken 2", "The Lord of the Rings", and "The Chronicles of Narnia", was very disappointing and I doubt that any of those directors have even finished filming their own film. I will admit that "A Dark Castle" was much better than this. The plot seems to be made in a madhouse, and while that was true, it didn't have the same impact. If you want a story about a castle with a mysterious basement, you'll have a lot of fun and interesting things happen, but this film didn't. The characters are very dull and the film seemed so empty that I felt the film was actually wasted. There was the movie's ending, and this was the only time I saw it with any interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A "documentary" that, by the end, tells a few words about "the worst" movie ever made. We begin at an old hospital where the "heroes" and their doctors decide whether to keep the patient alive or not.  There is no way that it can be good, not even a very interesting one.  It's just a bunch of disgusting, amateurish scenes of violent death, gore, and disgusting things. A few dialogs, a few scenes, and most of it are just a little boring. In the beginning, the movie tries to create some sort of drama, but it really isn't interesting. If you want a really good movie with a storyline, you'll have to wait a couple hours and see what it's going to be. But this movie is just not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as bad as the others made of the recent reboot of Spider-Man. This has happened in so many movies, it is difficult to know why. If there are any real fans of Spiderman in the Marvel Universe, they'll see this movie as their worst ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Zeta, A Movie: A Movie about the Great Depression...  I was so embarrassed to read the synopsis of this movie... A movie about the great depression?? I was hoping I would like to go see it. I couldn't, I'm not one of those people who dies of the tragedy and it didn't really work out that well.  This movie starts out with some of the biggest goofs and I was bored by it. For example, there is a great movie: "Viva Libre!" which depicts the liberation of Puerto Rico, but it doesn't seem like that if the people in Puerto Rico were in Mexico. I mean, did they shoot that part of the movie in Mexico? The man who did that movie is a millionaire and we never find anything about him in this movie. There was the famous "Buckets of the Basket of Freedom", in which the actors acted in their roles as residents of their community.  I'm still considering making this movie and I would definitely like to buy the DVD, but not one bit to be in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people dislike "Gamera" because it's not scary but it's so old! It is just plain annoying, there is no suspense whatsoever. And this is not only bad but it is just stupid and not that clever. The first thing that annoys me is that it lacks some logic. When you are explaining a car crash, you have to explain it. This just seems like a bunch of kids trying to make a stupid movie with a bunch kids. The second thing is that you don't get a good look at the big characters, you don;t get to see their eyes! The third thing is the idea that there are "experienced" people. If there were some "experience" people on the set, they might have some sort of common knowledge about the situation. On the set there are the big red and blue people, who look like their special eyes. What are they doing in this movie? When we saw the giant monster in the previous film, it was like the red and black creature had a special special ability and could, somehow, escape from the other monster in another part of the film. So what are these guys doing? And they were also talking on the phone. How did they get to where the big car would be? The car was moving, it's in a car, I didn't see anything but red. And it's unclear what was going on. All I see is a bunch to run for it, they just shot, the thing had to go over. And, by the time they finished the car, it just had to jump over. So how did they jump? And where does this "experient" guy get to escape to? What are these little kids doing in their car? And why is it all there was no way of escaping? Where did they land? The camera and camera work seemed to be moving. What if there was another part with a lot of bodies falling over? Who is it that made this movie all it was made? And this movie was so bad I don't know if it's coming for "The Fastest and Most Dangerous" or not. And the people that made it are like stupid people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just so boring to watch. I had to go into the end to find out how some of the actors had a sense of humor. The acting isn't as good as I expected, and there aren't many characters or real characters either. The movie tries to act like a horror movie, but it doesn't go anywhere.  It's not even funny. It's just a lot of boring garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really feel comfortable about this one, not enough to do anything about it. But the good parts seemed to be pretty decent. Unfortunately, most of the parts don't add anything to the story. Some actors were good, while others seemed like filler. I felt the biggest problem with this film was the fact that the storyline involved a bunch of people, and no real character, and was just a few scenes. The ending was good, but in the way it was structured I was unable to get any meaningful sense of what happened. While the story seems like a bit of a plot, I didn% seem too interested in the characters.  The acting wasn't too bad, and most of it was pretty good, although I don% like it in this type of movie. But I think that part of the movie should be made into a movie with a real plot, and not just some scenes that make a bit more of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst ever made for me. It lacks a lot of elements needed to make this movie worthy to even being called a documentary. It isn't funny, it's not interesting, and it doesn't even manage to have a clear story. But the funny moments are OK, it does have a few funny moments, and some great moments, but the story is so bad, I can't really blame this movie's poor writing and direction. There's no reason to watch this movie unless you like to watch some movies that involve a huge plot. (The story in the movie was interesting, but I would rather watch this one just to see someone yell.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I went to see this at the 2nd weekend of the opening weekend of a bunch of Hollywood films. The acting was OK, the cinematography was OK but the story was weak and the story didn't go to the depths of my heart. The plot was pretty good but the characters had no depth. The cast were flat and the dialog was terrible. The only reason I'd ever go see this movie is because I have a bad sense of humour but you need to watch something like this: just to laugh at people like I am. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a complete disappointment.  I had hoped this would be a fun film, but it got so bad I couldn't get to watch it. I have to assume that even if he actually had a script it was incomplete. There's nothing more annoying than the ridiculous name for the movie, "Wackowah?" (The name is in the film itself, but that's not a problem. He's called Wackowa because it's such a ridiculous name). The characters are completely made up, they're so stupid and the plot is completely unpolished.  One thing that can save this film is the fact that it is clearly not meant to be a serious film. I was really hoping this would go out in an interesting way, but this really isn't it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is stupid. There is nothing in the movie that is not just predictable (or predictable-something like this). This is what you get when you see an empty movie with no character (the movie is full of plot twists and story lines and nobody is even involved). In the meantime, the story is predictable and only adds insult to the characters who are in the main storyline (you know who the main guy is, you are the viewers of the movie). The acting is bad, not really memorable, and it lacks any feeling. My rating: - 7. There were a lot of twists and I didn't really care about any of them. It's not even worth watching in the least bit, it's just a waste of time. Avoid this movie if you have any sense of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what I mean, a film that doesn't make a difference. I didn't like it. I am the type that takes itself so seriously.  The story is a piece of trash and the acting is bad. The director should be more careful with the casting, not just with the actors.  What a great ending? Not one I will see again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The whole thing sucks and i cant remember when i watched it in the beginning of it because it got on to the good parts it looked like a movie about a gang killing a mother of a bunch of people and killing her son in the same way but it wasnt the way i thought it was supposed to be. the acting was bad and the music was bad at the end. i thought this movie was going to be made for a "B" movie but it could only go if it was for a 'B" film. the fact that it was made in 2008 is not good because it made no sense at all. it was interesting but the script was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the "good" ending of the film makes the ending of this movie seem interesting, it isn't. A little bit of romance, a little bit, but a few too much for the "big" love story. If it had been good enough for the ending, then the rest of the movie would have made it seem even more interesting. However, a plot involving a little boy and his grandfather would have been so interesting. But the script has so many false points that it could never make the ending any more effective than it does. There are several different scenes that go out of the main story line, leaving the main characters alone, and there are several scenes that make no sense to anyone but the main character. The "good part" of the story revolves around an old boy who has grown up in a big mansion with many wonderful family members and a young boy who lives there and is very happy, so what does he do? When the two boys go to the attic to see the story of his grandfather, he doesn't even notice he's gone and we see his grandfather standing up, and this whole thing just ends on a note of a good relationship between them. Now, while they're both having a real connection with the story, the ending ends with them having no connection.  This movie is an example of how a big film can go, and just as soon as you think it's finished, it goes on and it's still not done. It just doesn't end well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie I saw today, was completely predictable. I didn't like the idea of a movie called, "America Has Spreading Heart, Where Heart (a documentary about the history of heart disease) is set in a futuristic city where a politician, who is a major politician, with a good face, comes into a crisis with a mysterious girl with a big, black, bald head, and a large, hairy woman with a huge breasts. It was completely unbelievable that the guy was the one that killed the girl and gave her a big fat belly. I also didn't know why they got rid of her hair, and I just didn't care. As far as I could see, the movie is just a re-taken of the first two parts.   Now, let me state my opinion about the first part: that it's OK for a guy to want a girlfriend and to bang another girl and beat another woman, and not see a movie with his girlfriend. And let me say that I don't think it's possible to put a two-part movie with two strangers in a documentary about a two people's relationship. This movie is a waste of a couple of minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the movie, "The Love Files" is about a woman in London who, after a lifetime of marriage, has to find the perfect match to her husband.  Now the girl is on the run, a fugitive and a fugitive, searching for a good man. This is what we should really be doing, for a plot based on the true story of the famous "Man of the Rings", the character who, according to the film, is so beloved by the people he loved. But here, instead of seeing the love of the people who love them, we instead see a very one sided character. In the end, the movie simply tries to be a movie about the romantic relationship, the love, and the relationship, rather than the relationship itself. The whole movie is pointless.  The ending is bad. The ending really only happens to someone else. The characters are basically in their place, which is the best outcome, not the "best" ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the most stupid movies I've seen. I have read about this movie as a friend, and it got to me so bad that I had to write a negative about it. It is not even funny and has absolutely no character development. It only makes sense as a vehicle for a ridiculous, cheesy movie with a very simplistic plot that relies on the "good" male plot and makes it a predictable and unbelievable comedy. If you are into comedy like this, you will laugh like a pretender. But you will not enjoy it. The only saving point is that this movie features a decent cast in a relatively small cast, and you can only hear some dialogue from some of the actors. If the movie was a movie, I would give it a 7, because it is OK. But it is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is as bad as it is in every way possible. The first scene I saw of it took the most out of me and made me go to watch the rest of the film through the eyes of my ears and the eyes and mouth of my conscience, and I don't think I would. What a film would be if it had some decent direction, some decent action, and a good plot, that is the only thing I would go for it if it was. But it didn't do that, and instead it became one of those movies that is just worse than the standard, that would normally be considered a must-see movie. It seems like the direction was simply thrown at people and not made for people, and the story line is the biggest problem in making this movie. The main character, Jelena, has absolutely no personality, the only one that even she was in the film. The other characters she has to drag on to are basically the characters she had to play as; even in this one, she had barely an idea.  The only reason to even watch it is because it had a plot, and that was the only reason why I thought I was watching this one was that it had been good. The only thing it had to do in this movie was to make the viewer forget the rest. But, of course, that was probably the biggest crime in the making of the movie. If you have any sense of intelligence, and care about the quality of a movie, you should seriously consider letting the producers and director of this film to know that they are not capable of doing anything better than this one. As the viewer, you will have a few moments of confusion to get your mind right on what they are doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, in my opinion, was the worst, not even the worst movie that's been shown in the past couple years. I will admit that it was made in the UK. It had quite a few laughs. But when I watch this film today, I have no idea what a cast is supposed to be. I've never seen anyone with that kind of personality before. I can't stand it. But I can stand it in some other ways, and it's OK because the film is entertaining, but the acting was awful. There are a few jokes here and a handful of jokes that were just terrible. But, it did not make the audience sit on its feet. Some people, the majority of them, probably would have seen this film if it were a comedy film. But it doesn't. This isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had absolutely nothing to do with the best, the "Best" movies of all.  The story is unbelievable, but I have to admit that it was really weak. I am still wondering why they hired this guy to write the movie. He is obviously writing a garbage movie, but given the storyline, it would be a pretty good movie anyway.  Even with a good storyline, the movie was not great. I didn't like it so much, but not in a bad way. A very bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of this film, Mr. Gioffo, was a very nice man, who knew that the film would be a failure, if we did. It didn't work. This film, about a car bomb that kills people by some sort of unknown method, is a complete waste of film. The actors are either extremely ridiculous or simply terrible. You can't blame the actors for being extremely talented, they do a good job and they are just like most actors, but this was an utterly terrible mess. This is only a shame because I saw it many times over. It's an excuse to avoid this movie, but if you're one of those people who likes to watch movies about horror, you'll probably love this film. But I have to confess, even though I think this film isn't the worst film of all, I still consider it the worst movie of all. This could have been a fine film, but it was too much worse than good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love movies, but I always found that they were a little boring. But when I watch these 2 movies, the first one is fine, but after the first few minutes of it I just really don't care too much. The second one is so bad it could even be one of the most annoying movies EVER! This movie seems to have a plot and some good elements but it doesn't have any.  The good thing about the first movie is that it shows you where the story is going. It's nice to see the movie after you've seen it so you don't lose any more time. But this movie just really didn't follow that storyline. It just became completely ridiculous. The story of the bad guy is supposed to be in charge and he's supposed to have some sort of plan to save his wife, which of course he doesn't because the cops arrest him. He was supposed to use a car to try to find his wife and he has a gun! He has nothing in the car with which he had the idea to save her.  What a plot is? The plot is that the wife is being kept captive by the cops. She escapes from prison because she saw her husband beating the police officer at the police station. He has some idea that he will use the car to rescue her and bring her back. Well, there are some good guys and she doesn't help him.  When the cops see the car he says, "I'm going to try with some good people and save his car".  Well, I didn't try with that. I chose to save the car and let him get away.  I think that it should be called "Bick-N-Tiez".  I'd give this movie a 8 out of 10 but that was only because the dialog is good and the story was pretty good. But it just doesn't get a very big number. It would be a really good movie if the dialog was better but this is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry to say I was disappointed with this film. In it I saw no real depth, nor any real message for the characters. It's just an exercise in writing, and I don't believe this is worth a movie. There are some pretty good scenes in it, but I can't believe there are those who spend time writing this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess there's nothing really original or interesting in this movie, though a couple interesting scenes and a few interesting scenes, which I think can easily be ignored by the director, make the case for making it a "failure". The plot is not quite bad, but the story is just about how to do something, like the end of the day.    A couple of scenes about how different people are. How do people just start behaving in a couple of years and how they deal with themselves. The plot has no real plot, no plot, and no storyline. The characters have no real motivations.  The story was about how people could just "get on". There's no point in the plot, the story just has some pretty basic dialogue and a couple scenes. The ending was not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so disappointing, I didn't even watch it myself. And for the characters, even the little that was there in the first 90 minutes, they seemed so one-sided that I didn´t even bother to think.  I give this movie two thumbs out of 10, but it still seems like it had a purpose. If this was the purpose, I don´t care. But unfortunately, that wasn´t. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so boring, I couldn't care what was happening in the story. I could not care for some of the other characters. It was the worst scene I've seen from a movie. I thought I would die if I lost my mind. The only reason I would watch it was because it was a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Way" is basically a glorified horror-horror movie in which a bunch of guys (which includes a really annoying Michael Jephts) discover a strange and gruesome world of cannibalism. The plot is nothing but stupid. There's absolutely no plot, even after the death of the main character (who was killed) the entire cast is pretty well dead! In fact, it's just about a bunch more people who have to eat human flesh or dead bodies, so no one really becomes a good monster in the movie, unless you've been a cannibal. I don't care if you're going to see this movie, or if you want to, but the special effects in this movie are about as bad as your brain's going to deal with. They've got fake body parts, they've got huge fake prosthetic flesh, they're about to be killed, and a lot of the stuff they're holding around is totally fake. The dialog is too long, the plot is too convoluted, it doesn't connect with any characters and the movie is just about as dull as it could be. It does not make for a watch. The most annoying thing about this film is the ridiculous fact that the "real" people who are supposedly dead have to pay money to survive. It just doesn't make much sense. If this movie were about the actual human rights of people who decide to stay alive for whatever reason they had on their minds, this would be like a horror film. It would be a horror flick. This one isn't even a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most terrible movie I have ever seen. I can't believe that this movie was ever in the top 100. The acting is unbelievable. The only reason I have watched it is because it was so disgusting and stupid that I decided to give it to an old friend. I think that it is time to start a list of movies that can never have to make the top 10 (in fact this is not in the category of movies I would like to see, but I did give this one more than 10 points.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just bad, but that's not the biggest problem. As the other reviews have pointed out, the plot is predictable and the movie is boring. What really irreducably appeals to me is the utter lack of character development, especially as the plot unfolds. The movie just isn't enough to make me care for the story, but there are some interesting things to learn from it. There's nothing to do but talk to an old lady.  There's another annoying character named "Lola" and that keeps getting me into the movie-making. This was a very bad way to go down a low-budget film: a very old lady in her seventies who lives in a cabin in rural Tennessee. Her only good feature was a hair, so we had more in her hair, which gave us a clue that she was a real person. I was just so sick, watching the other characters talk to her. There was no point in listening to her and having her talk about everything she was talking about! It was just painful to watch the others talk to Lola as she kept getting in the middle of saying things.  If you wanted to see more of the old lady, you'd be better off watching one of the other films: the more interesting ones I saw. In fact, the film is about the story of a very interesting character. The rest of the characters had far better portray, and it would have been better if they had done that instead of having Lola talk to everyone.  The story is very, very weak. The plot has some weird elements, mostly a lack of any character development. It was also just a total waste of time, but if the film had the time to build up more interesting things, then that would have happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you get to the point that this is bad, you'll probably go mad. But to say this is really bad is almost like saying it is REALLY bad, because the acting was OK, the story was interesting, the dialog was interesting (but there was absolutely no plot, only a few little things), etc. But the movie was a total waste. And the acting, as you would expect, was bad. The ending was awful. The plot was terrible.  Oh, but did the movie even make me care about the characters? No. The movie wasn't bad or bad. This was only the worst movie in the history of cinema. And since it was a bad way to make a movie, I don't really want to blame anyone for it. I don´t recommend this movie: you might enjoy it if you like a good old story, and if you hate it or something like that, but you probably won't care, and you shouldn't even watch it again. I won´t even recommend this, unless you find something more satisfying to watch in a movie: a very boring and stupid movie with some good acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is something about this film that really bothers me. The movie is not very interesting and it is simply a piece of bad movie-making, which is not that surprising for a movie that is so full of pretentious and pretentious comments, that it makes you feel sorry for yourself if you ever saw it. I had hoped that the film might be a decent comedy, but it didn't really reach that level. If you are one of those people who cannot appreciate anything that is not 100 percent serious, this is not the film to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the absolute worst ever to have directed,acted or produced,or to have created,a movie in the history of the Hollywood industry,ever. The plot is no good nor any good.The plot does have some good parts and this is where it stops. The acting is terrible as well,or the fact that most of the actors involved are so bad that they couldn't act in this film.  The other problem that I noticed is the fact the only actors who act the main roles in the film were either one girl, one girl or one man.  I can't believe that these actors who were the main characters in the movie, or the characters that were the love interest of the film(or one person) are not available.   There are some very talented actors who appear in the video but the rest of them are so poor,that they cannot act as well as they do in the TV series. I have no faith in the director(or the writer), the director is too slow. Maybe they used a computer set on some scenes for the video and there were good actors who acted in those scenes but when the actors in the back of the theater were made they did not appear very convincingly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two really disappointing characters in this film. The first one is Jack's brother. He's a mean old guy who thinks revenge is good. But not only does he kill the son of the guy who just killed his own son, but he also kills the little girl. Jack's other sister is a beautiful blonde girl who wants revenge on the rest of the family. If there was a sequel, this character would be really interesting. There is a lot of love and sex in the picture, but the dialog is awful and really has no plot. It is just a sad and annoying ending for some pretty good friends and family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe I just watched this movie, but I did. I am not one of those actors who you can find easily with one of these movies, and I am pretty sure that most of the people who make one of them are good actors. But when they were casting for this movie I felt like they just couldn't find any actors who seemed to be the right actors for this story. What it is? I think, because it is an obvious effort by producers to make a "campy" movie (the story has nothing to do with "campiness" in the most important sense) they just used a few lines and then added a few moments and scenes from the movie to keep it interesting. It just seems like they thought they needed something to happen and decided to put the story as a throwaway after that. I had no idea that anyone would ever want to hear this story again, but it does seem like there is a lot of money to be made in this. If you can call this movie a movie that will be remembered and made into a permanent memory, I certainly hope so. But it seems to be another type of movie that nobody can really make for. In fact, I can guarantee that there will never be another movie that I will watch with people like me. There are too many false characters and situations in this movie. I do not think it is any worse than a movie about a bunch of teenagers, but this one just isn't that great. I think it was bad for the people involved with the movie, because they thought the story would be a big hit. They just used some cheap acting, and nobody else, and then they wasted most of that money on cheap sets. I cannot fault this movie for its shallow story or disappointing endings. But I did find one funny moment worth watching, and that was the final one, but there wasn't a great deal of excitement, too much gore, and too much drama. If I'm going to try to do something that has nothing else to do but commentate and discuss, I'm not going to waste an hour or hour, and a lot more for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible to look at and if you have an idea about a movie, you might as well start on making a list and say something like that.  When you get a little background info and a small glimpse of the cast and the setting and you've seen something similar to a movie: this movie is pretty horrible. The writing is terrible, the acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and the acting isn't even bad, but if the cast was great the movie wouldn't be a terrible movie (except that it was awful and stupid). The plot is horrible, the story is a little better than it should be (but it's really bad), the acting sucks, the plot doesn't add any new parts and the plot just leaves the viewer in complete shock-horror-completion with nothing but suspense (and nothing but a cliffhanger). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years ago, I caught this film on video and was amazed at how horrible it was. The acting wasn't quite bad but the plot was pretty terrible. They had to find a person to do it! In an almost-perfectly pointless film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't believe that this film would be "good" or that it would be even a "good". I just knew that I wouldn't be alone in making this film. This film had absolutely nothing to do with real life, nothing to bring the story to life. I can only assume that the actors had a dream about what they would be like in the film. As a result, it failed to find any good parts that would fit into this film, and in my opinion it was terrible to watch. There was no effort made to connect the "bad" characters with the "good."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have seen this film, you have already seen it. I have read that this film is rated 3 out of 10. But that's only half the truth. This movie was bad because it tried to be something more, but failed. The storyline was the only reason to even watch it. The story was a horrible one. It was predictable and predictable. I had to sit and wait for the end. I wanted the ending to be exciting, but when it didn't, it just wasn't. If you want to see something original and thought that it was interesting, go see the original The Naked Ray, which was brilliant. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I saw it when it first aired I was shocked to find out it was a completely awful movie. I didn't care for the story nor the acting nor the fact that it was the main driving force behind the movie. The acting was horrible.  If you're a person who thinks this movie is good - don't! Avoid at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an utter waste of talent. If you like it, you will hate it. It isn't just bad or poorly acted, but worse than bad. You will wonder why anyone is bothering to put this out in the media. The only reason I have seen this is because it has a plot, though it does not have a plot. They don't have any plot. The fact that this is considered interesting is simply that it is bad. It is bad in everything. And yet I cannot give this film an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, although I am willing to concede that it was decent at the end. The fact that a writer named "Lorenzo" would write a script for this movie is astonishingly ridiculous. "Lornzo" is the type of piece of writing that doesn't deserve to be put into a good movie. There is no dialogs, no characters, no jokes, nothing that makes you laugh. I would have laughed at the beginning of this movie if I had not already been warned of its disappointing outcome. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into the theater with my wife and she was crying at the beginning of the film. After the credits I said to her, "I didn't have it for you. I was too ashamed of my selfish and mean-spirited parents." There is only one movie that I think that's good, I'll call it "Jelly." The movie is so bad that I can't forgive my wife to see it. I can hardly blame the makers of this movie for wasting money on a movie with two actors, one of whom is a comedian. The other stars should be removed from the movie, too.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is probably the worst film that I've ever seen. It really wasn't a film at all. It was the dumbest thing I have ever seen in my life. The dialog was incredibly stupid, and the director had no idea what his message was. It would've been better for a computer-game-type message from a group of hackers. But, I did find a funny ending.  I guess if the director and director were to go in one day and visit the "juggling" room of a porn studio, they would get their message back. I just don't know how he got it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but a waste of time to waste. It's OK for a TV show but not for a movie, it's just boring and uninteresting... And I found that to be the main problem with this movie, the plot is simply not there. The idea that we all know that the killer is a serial killer, a psycho, a child killer, blah? A movie like this is nothing like that.  I don't even see the killer and I don; I'm sure there are plenty of reasons to be interested in him but in this movie his life and motivations are simply stupid and I think that if that is the case then I will lose interest in him anyway. But that's not the only problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. The acting wasn't even that good, and the storyline was so stupid that it had to be taken out of consideration. A very weak, mediocre film with a lot of weak plot and unbelievable acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was predictable, the characters were predictable, and the story was predictable but the overall story was a pointless waste of time.  Most scenes were dull, and only a handful of scenes got to get a good reaction. The story was just boring and meaningless.  There was a lot of wasted time in the characters and their relationships.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was some good actors in this movie though, unfortunately one of the bad actors was the only one that was able to do something in the movie. It also seems that the actor who played a character in the film was in a relationship with her husband who died in 1999. I can't believe they made this movie out of this awful script. I thought this was about a married man who wants to marry someone who can help him get his wife back after a divorce. This movie would've been a better way to help her husband back. I guess they wanted to show the character as being totally divorced from their spouse. I am not an actor and I didn't expect such a horrible plot, either. I'm sure there will be more movies of this kind of tragedy, but this should be a warning to not bother any actors that are in the business. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read through the book and seen it twice. I am a devout Christian and not a religious man but I've seen the "solutions" in this movie. I really didn't like them. The premise, unfortunately, doesn't seem very accurate. In the book, the solution is really something I had hoped to see. So, I'm hoping to see more. This movie is not as accurate as the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After an awful performance by the lead,  I gave this film a 10, and I had absolutely no idea what to expect. A couple of people, including myself, found it very dull, and a few people laughed very seriously.  I'm not a fan of action or adventure films, and this is no exception, but it was poorly directed. The plot is weak, the acting is terrible, and the cinematography is terrible. This film didn't go where it should have gone. The beginning had a point to make, but I didn't feel much of interest in it as I watched the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this was absolutely terrible. even if I would have wanted to pay for this, it would have been a pretty good movie (it's a little bit like the "Jetsons of Tomorrow" from "Jolio's Last Days"). i thought the story wasn't even funny but the characters were awful, the director didn't seem to care if he had some brain cells to act in his movie. I only laughed a little laugh when the woman who got her money through the lottery was so dumb and annoying and couldn't even convince us that she didn't get the money back because of her "good" life. i'll just go out and watch "Rio Tiroiro" and hopefully if it comes back on the air the director will get better. Maybe if he comes back, he can fix it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film, a group of women (as I have seen many) are taken prisoner and tortured until they are killed in a horrifically violent manner. They are being led to find a certain girl to use her sex to escape, which turns out to be the only human being alive in the whole town and thus has been taken into a concentration camp for the rest of the film. When the guard is killed on one side, the others start to fight each other, which only ends when the guard dies (he had never even been in a concentration camps). The movie does not make this easy for the viewer. In fact, there are a lot of scenes that are obviously staged in a similar manner, i.e. in a prison of a concentration-camp. However, the plot is so much weak it could be ignored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a truly horrible, and extremely weak plot. The protagonist tries to save the village of the main characters only to fail; i.e. he does not do so, and the people he meets are only there to provide an extra set of entertainment for the audience (as if one would see that they're just some morons and not, i.a, people who have lives) The acting is, i mean, substandard (for a film, anyway); i mean the actors, the sets, the setting and the sets (that, unfortunately, are not there); and the character's looks are bad. I mean, if they're supposed to be supposed to appear as a normal person, i don't want to believe it's an extra person. The acting and the setting is so bad, i wonder if they had any other reason to bring such a bad film. I cannot believe that they will even get to a sequel... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film they pretend to tell us a true story about a mysterious lady who stole a dog and kept it alive. It is not true story, but a "story" that is just a pretense. What they do is to use the fake story to make the real story, which isn't true at all. I won't comment on the story but will say what I thought they did was pretty basic. They pretend to use a dog for research to find a real dog, and then they put in a fake history. I guess it isn't like they are making a true history, but if you have a dog it makes you sure that they are. It doesn't even make sense. The writer also pretends that there's nothing more dangerous to a dog in a jungle, and there's absolutely nothing to make that happen. Why did they put a fake animal into the jungle?  If you want to see a movie on TV, don't see this one. If you have to watch it, do so only as the pretense that it is a true "story". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    this movie was awful. It was a horrible waste of time, but at least it wasn't an unplayable one, so I'll try to ignore its awfulness. It's all bad but there is something good about this movie - it's an interesting topic, but it was too weak to be interesting. It would have been better if this movie had been more interesting. I'll stick to other films like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I had no idea what they were trying to portray. What a film-making factory produces is supposed to be, I guess, funny. Well, it's funny but it can't get funny. Not even Michael Jackson's love of horses was able to do the movie. The movie, on the other hand, was pretty funny. But, sadly, it was not funny. This film is a waste of money, if you can find something else to do with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, so far, I have seen the most brilliant and well-acted, if not Oscar-winning performances, in a dozen films in which a male protagonist and a female protagonist are in love. So far, those four films have been absolutely awful, the two remaining films are worse, but the only one in which the protagonist falls in love with the girl is brilliant and beautiful. This movie is one of those films which is so bad that they cannot even be placed in the list of all movies which I think are truly bad. It is very, very bad that this movie was made. There are two good ways to avoid this movie. One is to avoid it, as the words "Avengers: Avengers" and "A Dark Angels" are the only two sequels which have a plot that connects with the main plot of the original film. Or, if you want to see the sequel to this movie, do not go out and see "A New World" and then go see "The Secret Mission." It was the sequel of the other, and "Secret Mission" is better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very simplistic, and there are some silly elements, but, if you consider the movie, it's very disappointing. The plot really isn't all that bad, and the acting is pretty good, but the plot is just awful, and one of the main protagonists dies almost the entire time!  I have a pretty low opinion for a movie like this, but it is better than some mediocre stuff. The other characters don't much, although the good ones do. But there's really nothing, really, that's good about this movie.  I only gave this one 3 out of 10, and I am glad that my friends decided to let me see it, because I would have been willing to see it at my local store, but I cannot recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i really hate movies like this. even though they had an interesting lead with a dark storyline, all of it just falls flat. a few of the scenes were really cute, but i just think they could've had better written parts than what i got from this. i thought it was one of the worst films i've seen in recent years. even a little bit of humor would have helped the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was just a victim of the 'I Scream For Your Living Dead' fiasco, and after watching this movie I had nightmares of my mom getting attacked by zombies. This movie is the worst one of the lot of horror films I've seen in my lifetime. I have never seen anything like this before. It seems to go to a point where it doesn't go into the storyline and then returns to the story line of the original. That's not a good thing, because it can't be a good movie to make. It's bad, but it does have a pretty good story, if only the actors did the job right for the part they were in. The problem is that the whole movie can't make itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I was watching this movie for a couple of minutes and watching the whole thing to see a story of some sort, this movie would have been a fascinating watch to see just as the main characters are at a point in the film where they have to confront their actions. It could have been so much better than this crap. As an example, I'm just looking at the opening scenes and realize that the movie was set in one of the biggest cities in the world during the time. I was very confused. The characters seemed to have been thrown in a position to where the camera was not actually near them. It seemed like I was looking at different parts of the story instead of watching it as one of them. Some of the shots could have gotten closer to their characters. When I tried to watch this, I couldn't tell if this was because of the lighting of the city or something else. I don't know what was going on, but this movie is not even close to the good part of a movie like the beginning of the book.   I am disappointed to see this movie. If you want to see the best movie: You can get it for free. The DVD edition does not include a complete copy of the movie. You'll need to rent a copy of it if you get one. The book is also a really good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew it was a bad film when it hit me as a teenager, but then i had to see it to survive. It wasn't a pleasant film, but I didn't mind the awful, but at least it didn't quite as bad as I thought. And at the end of it the ending was really awful.  It wasn's just a stupid film. And i believe you are right to complain about it. But I just think that you can't sit in a theatre and see something like this. I'm not trying to see this at a big theatre. In fact, I know that the cinema's are very good. I've seen them in very large amounts. But it's just the average case.  But I think you have to go see some real movies, because this was the worst I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. It's not funny, but it is incredibly stupid and the plot is awful. The director of the movie is also very stupid.  I have read the book and can understand the premise, but this movie really is not funny. The only redeeming fact is the fact that some of the actors are really good. They do some pretty funny stuff but there are not enough jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not going to make my eyes stop, I guess. What I do know is, you can expect better. It's one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I can only watch one, and its just not as funny as it is supposed to be.  In short, it's nothing worth remembering, and i'm going to pass it as the least interesting movie ever made.  It is bad for a family. There is a lot of humor in it, and there is very little plot. The story is very weak. There was one character who was really likable, but sadly most of the jokes came from just one person.  I do believe this is one of these things that made the first decade of the 2000s, but I cannot say it has been in that decade. This is one to avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I guess my comments went a bit too fast. Well, I'll give a few more details and then I will tell you how it is:  This movie is so bad, I'm almost ashamed to watch it. I was thinking of having a video tape of it to watch when I bought the DVD and then a few hours later I decided I couldn't care for it.  But then I read the reviews: "The film is really stupid, even if it has some redeeming qualities - the acting, the cinematography, the visuals."  This is what I call the film equivalent to a "striptease", "Mommander", or even a "KojuKojuu". If I had the right money, I would send that movie to my friends. If I could do something better to make this movie, I'd send it again, and so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What i had hoped to be better than the previous film. Well, the way to turn that into a more interesting film would be a different film. I've seen this film at other places, in many different places, and I've never seen it anywhere else. This film is simply one big failure on every level.  This film looks like a movie made at the Cannes after school awards ceremony. Some of the actors who performed this film seem like they have done in some small movies already, but they should not be allowed to make it over a movie which isn't done in anything but a few years, a film which has been seen by many people, people with a more sophisticated taste, people who have a deeper sense of life, etc. This movie does not include enough original people. The characters are either too ridiculous and uninteresting, or, well, like they are the dumbest people you've ever met. You really don't know what you are doing. This is also quite obviously filmed in a manner that you can't even begin to compare it with anything else.   The script is very bad. The acting is horrible. There's no scene in which the actors are funny. They just seem like people that they can't make themselves funny. I don't see why people would spend so much money to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a big, big, sexy dude who wants to meet up with a young, sexy girl who has only recently lost her virginity to some old guy. The guy has no clue what this little guy is. He's so stupid and clueless that he gets the girl to meet him. It's horrible. The girl is so oblivious and pretentious that she barely even knows her way out. I thought this movie would be great if it was scripted, so it's just pretty plain awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, the whole story plays no matter that it is based on a true story. The "dinner" at the office of a company called Fidelity Life, which makes no more than pretentious claims. The plot is obviously nothing more than a "deeper" version of the story of the real life of the company. In the movie, it does everything except the story itself. The fact that it contains a whole sequence about a plane crash on the other side of the world is not what makes the film good. In fact, the plot is just bad, but that's OK. For example, the movie is about a man who gets involved in a car accident (which is not exactly a "real life" movie) which is obviously not his "pre-meditated" story, as it has no storyline, is a movie about a movie set in the Philippines, and is about the person who is in charge of the accident, and it contains nothing but a bunch of stuff that isn't real life in the real world but is instead a completely meaningless story. Of course, the fact that I didn't know and was therefore missed during the film, is worth mentioning. For me, this movie was just so boring and unbelievable that I just decided to ignore it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so much of a waste of time as a movie: I'm really surprised that this was ever made.  I'm glad that it did not go off as a horror film, but it was just very low budget, and nothing really came together.   Most of the actors were either so bad, or so stupid, that I had no idea what to do with them. I guess this is a type of movie, that you do not see a lot of people like this. I cannot figure out why it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely trashy, with a plot to drive you away, and the ending has some weirdly creepy (like a serial killer) bits, which I won't really think too much about. I actually had a small chuckle when a few of the characters were alive. It was really like being put in a coffin and being brought back.  I didn't really buy this movie until I saw the opening scenes - the creepy part was in the hotel pool. The ending is basically bad, but what a great ending? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this movie in the theater, it was about 50 minutes or so, and I thought it was a pretty bad movie. I didn't care for the plot, I don't care about the storyline, the characters, but the plot was pathetic. The movie is about a woman who has made an abortion on an pregnant woman who is not pregnant, is then pregnant with a newborn, and that baby is then born and it's not even real. I never liked the story. The acting was weak too. The cinematography was weak, too. And I didn`t know how to get to the end of the movie. Not sure if the actors had a line for the end. And if the movie is better than this one, it`s too bad to compare it to a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of an idea. What a sad movie this is. This is an amateur effort of all of the worst movies from over the top of the movies. There is no one good who can watch this piece of trash, and I think you would never think so bad a movie exists. This isn't the best of the James Stewart era, but it is the worst piece of cinema out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like a bad joke. In an hour, you may get a chuckle. But if you get a laugh, you'll lose everything else. But it's not just you. If you had any special talents, like seeing great performances from various comedians, I bet you would enjoy yourself. Instead, the movie just seems like a bunch of actors who think it would be fun to make up a stupid joke. It's like watching a "joke" where some of the actors act like they're acting in a sitcom. A lot of the jokes and acting are done badly, and it's just a bad slap on the face. If there was a comedy movie made in 1999, I think it might be interesting. The way I'm thinking about it is that the movie was made after the movie "The Rooster", which had some pretty good comedic performances. But this movie just comes off to you, like a cheap laugh at a bad comedy movie: a bad laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was good but the acting was bad, most likely the result of the direction of the movie. The plot had a few scenes in which a couple are kissing. A lot of the scenes were in black or yellow and there were no dialogue which meant they didn't have any plot. Also the movie didn't go so far as to make the audience believe. The characters were boring and the storyline seemed a bit unrealistic.  The only redeeming point was the great camera work. The first movie was more like a "novelure" film with a different theme. The second was the better movie but after seeing the first one it had nothing but holes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i mean i thought i heard that the movie was gonna be called the "Munchi" movie but when i saw it I thought it was going to be about a "sneaky" dude stealing every girl and making up to his death a movie with some blood in it but i thought it would be a funny way to just rip off some of the older guys on a movie to use a few lines from "Mashra" but then i thought that the only thing i thought was that the "munchi movie" could really suck so bad and i honestly think that it would have been better if it was done as a film instead of having a new person on it and then you might get something to be interesting that isn't like the way that it was made. In the end the movie just made me a little sick and then i just wanted to make my friends mad that this stupid movie was out there and to let them know that this movie sucks and so I went out and made some videos instead of watching the movie on TV. But then i don't think that was the only bad thing that i made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got into the movie in hopes, I wanted to see an entertaining movie. Instead, it became an anti-narrative thriller with too much action and a lot of cheesy dialogue.  I left the theater in disappointment.  Why did I get into this movie? I didn't get paid, I didn`t see the ending, and I didn`.I don`t understand. I'm not a huge fan of thriller. I thought the dialog was pretty good, the only thing that got me in the theater was the acting, and the plot was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film looks like a really old-school sci-fi film. It is very annoying, at times it is pretty slow. I think there is something that could be made better, if you look closely into the film. I don't know how much of this film will come back as it appears to be. But it is interesting to look at in terms of the story, but what are we going to find in it? a very old woman who had to survive in the wilderness after the apocalypse (because there was no way of getting her out of the baddies' clutches) is killed by a new and very primitive tribe who has no morals. Also, it seems that all of the film's actors are in the cast of the movie and the only characters that are of a human appearance are the "hippers". Some weird stuff there like a robot in the movie. It was pretty awful, it was probably not intentional. Some good stuff in the film though, if only for the original purpose. Otherwise, I don`t recommend it, but if you have the patience to wait for something good to come, I suggest you skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just crap, the story, the acting, the special effects, the music, the script, the plot, the direction, the location, the characters, the production-making and everything else are all worthless, nothing happens, it doesn't even start to get better. It's just bad, and worst of all, this movie is obviously not made to satisfy. It is absolutely useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Killing of the Dog" is an incredibly stupid film. It's not about the dog, it's about the story. But unfortunately, the dog doesn't have any motivation whatsoever. The premise and the ending are both so bad they were almost a comedy. I had nightmares and it is very unlikely that any animal would care for anyone but animals do care for their pet. The plot is a really bad movie, but not as bad as the original. It is just boring and there is only one woman. The only good thing in this movie is the photography. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing out there that can stand with this movie. But there are some redeeming qualities. Some of them are interesting and it's possible that one of them was in The X-10, but unfortunately the others are not. You see these scenes and you wonder if they are real. I'm afraid, if you watch this movie, you will never be able to tell whether the actors are really in their right. Some scenes are good, like the fight with the assassin. But this movie is too much like other movies and it lacks any creative value beyond the premise.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd watch a movie with it. But this one was a disaster. There wasn't a single plot in this movie. In some part, it's interesting to see the 'proxies' that these movies usually are. But what happens if they don't go into the movie to some other storyline.  This movie is just bad, so bad in fact that I can't believe it will be released! I can only hope that it will stay that way, otherwise it would be bad enough to lose its status. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it in the late afternoon of the week on Saturday, and I didn't have any choice in choosing a movie to watch, so I chose this one. I don't understand why this is even a movie...  It is a bad choice for a movie in which we know nothing about the characters of the protagonists, and the story goes backwards.   My guess is that it's about 2 brothers.  If the characters in the movie are supposed to take a family trip to California with their older brother, I can only assume that there is no connection with the brothers, unless they were cousins who have known each other and have been in a long line of business relationships. It was just a cheap idea, and a bad idea at that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was a waste of time and money to see this piece of film. While this was supposed to be a true thriller, it really just wasted time and time to go to the store to buy a DVD of this film: if I hadn't seen it already I probably would have thought this was a dumb movie (like a movie about a real murderer.)  I won't mention the last scene in the movie. I've done the same thing in a couple other movies, and the last was probably even more stupid than this movie. In what way, is this movie just going to be better than that one? That movie was awesome, but that one was pretty good as well. This is a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only do the characters seem to be played by two actors with no discernable character (one is obviously a lesbian), but what we do next? That's where the actors go to do what they do not so well. You might think that the characters would care more about their respective characters than the simple fact that their fates are so close that if their characters don't take care of each other then it's a pretty bad plot. This movie seems to be trying to have it's own identity but instead relies on other stereotypes which it does not really deliver. A lot of it is pretty good but then we see it as a "comedy" that doesn't really have any substance. What's more interesting and exciting is the "new direction" it has to follow. It's just a shame that this film doesn't seem to have any idea of it's purpose. Maybe if it were a movie made specifically to reflect the real world then it would be a perfect satire, or a simple "comic," but not this one. The acting was decent enough but the movie could have been made a few years earlier with a bit more depth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, the actors are really bad. The supporting characters are extremely weak. They look like they are going through the motions for a quick shot. I'm not sure why this film is made, but I don't know why it is made. And if this is a movie, it looks like a nightmare. Don't expect too much from a movie: it should be on a video store shelf instead of on a projector screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. They obviously knew there would be a big movie to be made with the best cast and the greatest production value. They couldn't just do it without an obnoxious cast and crappy production. I don't want to spend an hour on this movie, and it sucks the soul out of me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was terrible, especially the supporting characters. I saw it on "The X Files" and I was sick, and the ending was disappointing. The acting was not that good. Even if the film had been a film with a real story about a killer who is obsessed with his victims (like Jason Bourne's "Beverston"). A typical Jason Bourner, in a typical Bourne, in another stereotypical Bourne.  The movie is about an old man, who kills a bunch of victims (which is an obvious fake murder, but still a plausible murder), and that he had found a female in an apartment where the victims lived. And after killing the females, Jason Bourney returns to this apartment and kidnashes the women. And this is what makes him kill them. Why is Jason Bournen doing it? A lot of people ask why. This is a classic example of a bad film: Jason Bournes does his own thing and then comes back to the real world and kills people for no reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really couldn't believe this movie made it all. The story was pretty terrible, the only saving factor was the fact that it was a comedy. Not an actual comedy, although it was fun to watch. Well, there's some good stuff, but most of it just wasn't. The only good thing I can say is that the ending was interesting. The rest of the movie was pretty much forgettable. I can see the ending for a few moments in the "fumble" sequence, but when it gets much better it isn't.  I'm just a huge fan of it, but it doesn't deserve its rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie a cast of some actors (not that any of them are memorable) decide to act out a plot based on the murder of a famous serial killer. It turns out the killer (Booth) has been a serial killer in an obscure and long lost local area. In order to keep the killer away, the town leader decides to act on this new serial killer to avenge his death. It seems that one of the actors is more interesting than the rest, but that's just because they are the main protagonists.  If you're a fan of film:  This is really bad to watch. Not only do they get better performance, but the acting sucks. The direction is bad, the acting is bad and the acting of most of the acting really sucks. It's bad to get caught by the story, but it is bad to the characters.  The plot itself can't help. The plot isn't like the book it does. There isn't much substance in it. The characters are either weak or bad (or both).  If this was made in real world, it would be better. It just doesn't happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very serious and committed to the truth and the truth in this movie. However, the filmmakers obviously didn't take that time to actually do anything with the movie. In fact, they spent all of the time focusing on this movie only to have an 8-year-old scream on camera with him and his mom. This is really ridiculous. It was all about a 15 year old girl pretending to be a girl, and you can't believe what she is doing! She can't even fake her eyes, and she tries to say that she's having a vision of her dad and dad, but then, in order to have a vision, she tells her brother that she just keeps asking him. You're confused, you wonder why you should see this movie? And I'm sure if you have any doubt in the fact that it's true that it was written, it is absolutely true. But then you think that this movie was true? You don't even watch it! They made a completely unrealistic movie and I don't have the slightest doubt that they're trying to make an interesting one. The worst part of this movie is that they can't act the way they do in the real life of real people. I am completely unconvinced that it is the greatest thing. I don;t believe it's possible to make that unrealistic. They don't really portray their characters as people we should be ashamed of. The scene in the hotel is ridiculous. And, if you had the movie, it would make me mad. But it seems to me that this film is the opposite. The acting is very, very bad. The movie just doesn't go out of its way. It doesn't seem like the movie was intended for "real life". I think it's all about the other actors' reactions and behavior and the actors themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with a very confusing storyline that involves a group of men (including a female woman) and a group who are after the killer who was recently murdered.   They are led by an attractive female who is very seductive. But then after that they see a group that is going to be killed, only that is not a killer. And the killer does not appear until the very end, but what was he? A killer who we later found out that killed four victims.  The girl who is raped (and also brutally raped) has a new husband who apparently wants her to marry. She has to lure a group to get the killer to come into a room that she can't enter. He is very suspicious of him, so she has to use the phone to try and get rid of him. This was also the only movie where the main character had such a big gun and a large knife in her hand. It looks like the killer is actually the victim instead of just being a serial killer.  This makes me very uncomfortable when they had to include this killer as a character in the movie, because it makes no sense that he was a serial Killer. I believe the killer was so despicable that they had no choice but to include him in the story. The movie is just one of many cases of stupidity, stupidity, and stupidity that have shown us the very good things that movies such as this have accomplished. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Burden of the Brain" is an awful, horrible, bad movie starring Tim Robbins as a college freshman. Tim Robbins was at the University of Phoenix in the late 1980s, so I'm not surprised to find out that this was made. But the movie isn't that bad either. The acting is terrible, the story is terrible and the special effects look like crap.  This movie was made because Timothy Robbins had a lot of publicity in the 1980s when he was in college. But in real life Tim Robbins looks like a very weak and pathetic loser who wasted his money on a movie: The movie sets Tim Robbins's girlfriend, her brother and friends to be a minor student, but doesn't let them know the reality that they're the two students whose lives he wants to spend his time with.  The film sets Tim in a small town in Texas where the only thing that seems to have an interesting plot is that Timothy's father is a high school student. That plot doesn't make it a good movie.  I'll end the review by writing a positive review about an excellent movie: "The Bad Life Behind 'Burden' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and plot, however, do have a sort of coherence with the story. It doesn't, in fact, work out. There is absolutely no convincing reason for this...just some old crickie tricks to get rid of a nasty monster. It has a small set, a few small touches (like a giant shark, for example) and a weak story. There's not much in the way of story (and not very memorable), so a disappointing film. Still, the movie sets a depressing mood. The scene where a monster gets killed by a little girl is OK. But the story isn't even good enough to make up for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie about half a week and a friend of ours had to leave his room halfway through the film to avoid the "plot" line (which they seemed to be) in the movie. I think the plot line was a bit strange, but that's understandable. I wouldn't have wanted to see it if I didn't know what the plot was. When the scene ended, the director said, "I don't know why I had this idea in my head... I didn�t have any other words in my mouth...  I thought the acting in the scene was OK, although the music wasn�t particularly good. But the acting was bad. I don�t know why this movie was directed at all. I would have liked to see this movie on it's 2.2 DVD. It would have been so much better to see the original.   The movie was really bad. There was nothing good. It lacked even a plot, and it was pretty obvious that the actors had nothing to do with their acting. The story would be a lot better if they had more dialogue and more camera time, and there would be more action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't exactly "Fifty Shades" or even "Bachelorette," so you can't really blame me for laughing at this one. The plot isn't much better than the previous "Bash Barys" or "Daschaahyah!" (the last time these were made), and its lack of story is the same as the "Warmy" movie of 2010. There was some sort of musical-music track, and the story of a married couple was a little more fleshed in. But aside from that, there was only some vague sexual scenes that could be interesting, which I didn't feel very comfortable with.  Overall, I didn? Did? Did?? I don't. The acting was OK, although it really was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie and was very bored. It's only two minutes long, and the plot is very weak. It was obvious that a major actor was obviously not a "winner" in this movie, but I really wanted to get over to the stage to see the actors who were in this flick and see what they looked like. As far as I know, the "winner", in the title, was supposed to be Nick S. Fish. In fact, I know that it was Nick Fish who had been in this picture, but it didn't make it seem as if Nick was the "victim" in the movie. So, when this movie was released, Nick Fish wasn't in this case. I have to see that in action.  The movie was terrible. I am at the level where I have an emotional stake to see this movie's ending. To be fair, it was made well, but the movie was not as much fun as I thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I watched this movie on a Friday afternoon. There are no suspense to see the ending. What about the story? The director wanted to showcase the death of the parents. The only thing that works is that the actress is a woman. The writer obviously couldn't even convince herself. We are obviously biased. The story is too predictable and is full of clichéd dialogs. I had no expectations. I just found it tedious. The dialog and the acting seemed so amateur and boring. I left the movie without even seeing the ending and tried to turn my attention back to the plot. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie, which is really no matter if you like "The Devil Wives" or anything else. Some jokes don't come off, the acting isn't good, the dialog is poorly written, the setting is poorly photographed, the film is terrible. There are some good scenes, but there are only 5 or 6 of the 6 actors that really deserve a mention. If your love for "Wives" is in the slightest, then you might watch "WIVES" with an out of date show. If you are into "Witches", "Wires" or the "Munchkin", then don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of good time and money that this movie was. There was not a single moment in the film that seemed to be moving. I didn't care for any of the characters in this film. They were completely horrible. I was too afraid of their eventual "sickness" and was willing to turn to the TV to see them. The only reason I gave this movie a 2. was the fact that it showed the awfulness of such a bad TV show and the fact it was a "gag of gore" which got me thinking that this could be a serious show. The editing was horrible, the actors were terrible, and the ending was ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was good, but what happened next was utterly awful. The script was obviously written in a vacuum and that's all we can say.   My favourite bit of the film was the scene where "A Night For Two" took place. And that was about all we got. The idea of a man in a coffin and his sister was a poor excuse for the plot, nothing more than an excuse for a terrible "plot" and the fact that it's a movie about a man and a woman who are not necessarily lovers is the only thing that got the whole thing wrong.  All in all, I would have been interested in a much better story. Maybe one of the characters would have made it out there instead of having them marry and then bring their brother into the mix, and make out the ultimate couple, and then take the woman back to her husband's death. Or maybe someone could have a job instead of being killed in a car (or whatever she did, since it doesn't occur), and get a man's mind back on as a man. But that's not how the film works, and I am pretty sick of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't even get a chance to look in the credits of this movie (the title itself is "The Darkening"). I didnít even realize that I had seen it beforehand.  The movie begins with a couple of women who are in the presence of a strange, demonic looking woman who has a black skin, what we can't say, and who has this same, "evil-looking" body. This woman is being pursued by police as they chase her down an abandoned road as her vehicle gets up to speed, and we know who's the pursuator.  At the beginning of the film we know this woman is a priest who was in charge of a religious congregation in the South Atlantic region. We are looking at her as she picks up her victim. Then we are treated to this terrible, grotesque scene. It's so slow and there's nothing to see, you can't feel the suspense, and you just want to go straight to the beginning and just shut off the film and go somewhere.   There are some pretty good scenes, but what do you do when you're looking for one scene after you've watched it?  The actors were good, but the rest of the movie is simply awful. The plot is so bad that you want to leave the movie after you finish it. I didnąt watch this one twice and I can guarantee that it was bad even before the credits finished. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was lame, poorly written, bad, stupid, boring, fun, but totally unbelievable. At least I think that some of the plot was interesting and funny. The acting was bad, the only decent part was the movie itself. I don't even remember why. The movie is really awful. The best movie of this century is "Kirk", the last movie (or "Pistrophobia", "The Big Game") by Sir Robert Mills, who used his own name as his title, but it's not that good either.  The movie was not even entertaining. It had a few amusing moments (like a scene where a baby in a crib), but what was the real reason that this movie was made? Why do we have to sit through it? The fact that it was so bad must be one of the saddest ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really bad movie...The story and acting are quite bad...there's some pretty decent actors...but what they did was just plain stupid...it's not that funny or scary but the acting is awful..it's bad,it's terrible...the dialog is bad and the camera is horrible...all these things are terrible and the plot is bad...it all sucks to watch...and you have to ask yourself what has happened in the plot...there is only ONE good thing... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I guess there's some part that you don't care for and there's just some people who can't see. It's just a pity there aren't more people in these movies. They don't just make movies, you can't just get them and you aren't just actors. The rest of the movie is just a bad, but pointless film. And they must make some sort of joke at the end. If there were more people to see this movie, I wouldn't mind to spend $15 on it and I'd probably even leave the whole thing out and just watch it as a piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When the film came out it looked like a real horror film but unfortunately it doesn't. It is no more than a pretentious piece of hackney cinema. There is no point whatsoever. The acting, however, is good but the story is badly written and the film is very predictable. This is what we call a "horror" film and it looks like that, only to borrow a few details from a horror movie.  The film is really bad. We all knew how bad it would be when it came out, but it does not deliver to the satisfaction of our hearts. It just makes me want to scream. I don't know if the director got the idea to "make a horror film" as a first project. If he didn't then there is a reason why it was so bad. Maybe he can find someone to rent it out on DVD.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think this was even remotely interesting or funny, and even though I didn`t laugh, I didn\'t even notice that they used the 'funny' word for 'nonsense'. This movie had a few moments where I thought it was amusing but nothing else. I was left feeling a bit depressed, and a few months later I'd decide I'd better watch a movie that doesn`t contain a lot of nudity and nudity than I'd have to watch the movie that has 'humor'. I really couldn`t wait for the DVD to arrive, and I still think it`s just not good, even though the script is very good. If the film was real it would be interesting, and the funny moments would have been funny. Instead, it has two very poor, mediocre, non-comedy moments, but then there are some very good scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has a bad plot. It was not really original. The acting was good but the plot was horrible. The ending had so many unresolved questions and not answered. The two supporting characters were in constant conflict and were not able to develop any connections with the main character. A lot of it seemed to have been a case of "the two of them" with each getting involved in another situation.  The film was very good but its lack of logic was so disappointing that it had me scratching my own face. The plot has enough serious issues to bring the film down to a "bad" rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie over the weekend because I was looking for a movie that was not entirely predictable. I was disappointed with it. I had the idea that a few words, a few minutes, might make the story jump the mind. If I had seen the first 90 seconds of this movie, I would have thought I had heard those words before. I only paid $2 for this movie and did not realize that it was an insult to your intelligence.   The plot is extremely slow. It is predictable and just about the same as a movie I never saw. There are just too many plot twists that just don't fit with your knowledge. For example, you will learn that one of the characters was a very wealthy man and that was his daughter, who had married a very corrupt man, who also helped make sure that her daughter married the man, and you will know that she had a lot of money and she was married to another man, so you can never predict the outcome.  And you can forget a huge plot.  The ending of the movie is the most disturbing part. I have never seen a movie with more twists and turns. When the characters are talking, they are not as entertaining or moving as they should be.  What did they make? If I was watching this movie for entertainment, I was bored and I just didn't have enough to watch. It was only about a couple minutes longer. I just got a little sick.  So, if you are a fan of mystery, you should not go with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went out on the internet for research before watching this movie and I thought I'd be prepared to hate it. I'm glad that I didn't, but this is the most annoying, most stupid and worst movie I have ever seen. This is the worst film I have seen in over 50 years. I can't say why. The acting is bad. The director seems to be a complete novater, and the actors seem to be as stupid as usual. The plot is a complete mystery. This movie is stupid and ridiculous. In fact, this movie has to be called "The Fumage" because it is about an angry, bitter person. I don't know why anyone else is allowed to watch this. It is so bad, that I'm hoping the author's only mistake was to not let it be released. I know how many people will be watching this. I'll let you know when it becomes available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an example of bad movie making that can't help but inspire feelings of disappointment. As I heard in the first minutes of the movie, it is just bad, bad, BAD! Bad! BAD! BAD!!! Bad! Bad!!! BAD! BID NO ONE ON! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was scared watching this when I got into it. I saw the "documentary" in the trailer and realized, as a first-time film buff, I'd like to try it out. I had to sit through it and watch the entire thing over and over. My reaction was that the movie was stupid, and very, very, boring.  I just laughed at the story. The story was absolutely ridiculous. It was just a bunch of guys who were stuck in a cave with some guy, who killed people, and you only see these two groups. In other words, they just killed each other.  What was the first time I watched this movie was. I thought it was a lot more interesting than it was. The actors had some good chemistry. But the story was boring and stupid. I decided to watch it because it was way better than the other movies I've ever seen. The only way I'd see this movie would be if I could see the original one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like horror movies, this is the movie for you. Unfortunately, it's nothing more than a bad film. I just didn't understand what made it funny or funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a disgrace of the genre. It is just about the idea of the whole movie being about a giant creature, and the giant monster actually has its own identity, but then they are not even remotely recognizable as such. The monsters don't look anything like they do in the real world. They are not scary. They're not scary even to humans. The supporting actors look like they're taking a long nap, and they have no personality. They just act like spindo, boring characters. This movie was so bad that I laughed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised to learn how much people will complain about this movie. Some people can't read. A huge majority of people will look at the title and find it to be a silly waste of time. For example, if the title is "Star Wars", then you would expect to get a real, fun movie with lots of great actors. But that's not the case here. If you watch one minute of it, you'll see the title's absurdly short (especially during the battle scene).   This is simply an excuse for one-trick-out-of-all lousy movie. Avoid this one if you need a movie with a lot of action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It just shows you how shallow your brain is. There's nothing in here that can make you feel real. You're in the dark about a movie: nothing happens, but they talk a little bit to each other. In this film, even the most serious of the characters is a victim, but this is a case of treating a person like a piece of rubber. And to think that you've made any connection between the two characters is just stupid. In the end you just want the killer to kill everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I would be a huge fan of this show. But I am sorry to say that I didn't. Not really. In fact I just laughed at some of it. But not so much. This show is a complete and total disaster in every possible sense of the word. The plot is unbelievable. What if they had spent some of the money on a few extra characters and were a little bit better than the other cast? That's all it was. I didn''t see enough of the show for which I had paid. I think it could have at least been a fun thing, but I really just can't make it to last an hour. And this is the show I have seen the most of the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I like to watch comedy films. But this was not one of my favorites. I felt like watching it was just plain awful. I was looking at the box and wondering how was this horrible piece of entertainment. I couldn't believe it was the "fugitive family", and I couldn not believe it had been made. I found myself on the edge of my seat as I was walking out to the parking lot. I also had to laugh at the lack of "good" jokes. The only redeeming value was that I did not lose any money when this movie was aired on "Saturday Night" last year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to hear some more about this movie: I'd just like to know if it was a film, why it was so bad, and why it even made it a film. It is bad but I guess that it could actually make it better. It's not interesting. The actors are bad. It doesn't make any sense, and the direction is bad, too. The ending was pretty bad. I found that it was pretty predictable and the whole plot was not all that interesting. I had hopes the director would come back to his "Dark Castle" film and improve the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not fun to watch. And there's too much of it to make you want to just go to it and leave. But at least it's not totally terrible, it's okay, as a slasher, as it could have been, but it's just a complete waste of time.  I mean this is not a movie for kids. It's for kids who have a lot of friends and who have seen the trailers of every other movie, they can tell you's going to be pretty damn bad.  But there's so much in it that I don't like, so I don`t care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a young person who grew up with the film and the series of the animated series, I think it would have been a more interesting idea, if they would have cast the young people in more of a supporting role. It is the main reason why this movie is so bad. It shows little or no concept at all. If it were an idea, I'm sure it would be interesting and interesting, and it would work well in an action movie. But, this just seems like nothing but a cheap way to make a low budget, cartoon. I have a very low opinion of the people who put this out. They put out an inferior movie, a horrible one, and they should be ashamed of it, because this is the only movie they've made of a cartoon series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got tired on the "B" film and I was extremely annoyed that this one was so bad. I think it's too predictable. I was looking at the pictures on the DVD and it seemed so bad, like a cartoon that had no plot. There is a plot. But this one does not.  I had to see this film, and I could not believe the ending. The movie has all the elements of a terrible movie - acting, bad direction, and bad story. I am a huge fan of the "S" film, but this film was the worst of the kind. I just cannot believe that this movie was made. I can only hope that if I have a second chance I will make this one work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to be a fool but I was not expecting to like this one - I'd have hoped it would be something better - but when I was expecting a comedy of all sorts, I didn't really take it as such. I didn'T quite agree with the premise of the film, but it failed to deliver. I thought it was an obvious rip-off.  There was no real plot, no story, no characterisation - nothing. No one could expect to find their way through a movie with no character depth or character development - in fact, it had zero suspense. The only thing that was even vaguely funny was the "jolie" joke - it was the only part of the movie that made me laugh.  If this is to be an actual movie, I would like to see the cast and crew admit that they were the biggest fools of this film. I know why this was the way they wanted it to be, because it is so dumb. The acting is poor and the script is so poorly developed that I just had to find out. It had the biggest problem of all - it didn't take long to get to know who was in it. I tried to make it work and I couldn't do it. The director wanted to be "one of the greatest comedic movies of all time" but it is nowhere near that. I wish I could have seen it as bad as it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really bad, and unfortunately one of my favorite actors has left me alone because I lost my respect.  The only reason this movie is made is because it was made in a commercial setting in a theater. There is no reason to watch this movie in a movie theater. It is simply a pretentious excuse to be a movie. It doesn't even make sense.  What makes this movie even a pretense is the fact that it is supposed to be based on the life of a small girl who was sexually abused by her father. This is absolutely ridiculous! The only real thing that comes out of this movie are the people that talk to people with no regard whatsoever. It should be so that it would be a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to a good film like "Matsayga" and it seemed like it might be one for my tastes but unfortunately the movie lacked any sort of suspense and so that means I have a weak feeling about it even though I like the director, John Michael Murphy, and the acting. Unfortunately it's not as scary as I'd hoped but it really isn't as scary. There are some clever moments but sadly no great surprises.  I'm sure you get the gist of it but even if you liked the director and the cast, you'll probably dislike the ending when you see the ending.  It's an excuse to waste my time and perhaps even a small budget to see a great movie. I just couldn't finish it so I gave it another 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I watched this movie was because of the great "Bever-Wisey" music that was the main theme. But it just didn't go far.  The movie was very predictable. I just wanted to go off into the "wrong" side of the movie--something crazy--with a bunch of people who have nothing but money and power--and nothing but a pair of dumb characters.  Even the story of the first episode didn't have much in it. The acting was too predictable. Even if it is the type of dumb-bitch who doesn't think she was getting pregnant, there is still nothing to be good.  If you want to see a movie with real stars, and music, then watch The Incredible Miracle, or a movie starring Elvis--both of which are not even as good as "Bitter-Wiser".   I'd watch the "Boom" episodes instead of watching "Buster" to see whether or not they were better.    Even if the acting was good, it doesn't have any real meaning. Even when the characters are in the most ridiculous situations, there are so many stupid scenes of characters doing stupid things.  There is a great soundtrack in "BOTTON". It is like the "WOW" of a musical album. They never come out for a good song.  It doesn't even have a musical theme, and it was very boring.  This movie was only the second most disturbing film I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of those terrible low budget "action movies" that I've seen so many years. If I had one ounce of money I would kill it. In spite of my horror, this movie had an interesting storyline (or should I say a somewhat interesting one) but was not properly written. Some parts made me laugh while others were really scary and I think that's where the movie's heart goes in. At least it had a plot. There is no plot. The only character who had to act their part is the little girl who is so dumb she can't even find a shirt over her head. The ending of the movie was also terrible. If you are a real horror film fan you'll laugh at her "clums" but if you're looking for humor you'll be sorely disappointed. If only there were some money it would make a movie even more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of entertainment. It is a little bit cute, but it's not funny. There are too many moments that don't get resolved, and no one gets anything significant. It's pretty plain when you're about to leave, and just then you feel that the plot is about to be resolved, but then, it never is.  The plot is bad in several scenes and the characters are terrible. I don't remember when there are scenes where someone is supposed to be the villain or the hero that has nothing to do but get on the phone with the guy and try to save the day, but there are some scenes where they actually are saving the day and everything comes up in his face. If the movie was interesting, this would be a great adventure, but sadly it's only a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title says it all, but I don't remember the name of the movie. The title is about a very strange movie and the main character is pretty annoying. It is not a comedy or horror, it's just really bad. I've seen many weird movies that I'd like to see on the channel and the only one that I can laugh at is the title.   There are two characters in this film and one of them is pretty well named. I don`t know why they named him "Mr. Amshelin." I think "Mr Amschel," better. He's also called "Mimic," so he has to do something with his name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film just seems like a movie made by incompetent filmmakers who can't figure out when they want to make a hit. It is, and I mean, it's like watching a movie at a high school of theater: one has a "one hundred years" theme. The characters are boring, and the script was pretty bad, but at least the dialog seemed interesting.  There were some cool moments, but you can't really tell what the movie was trying to portray. In the end, it is just like the badest horror films out there.  I recommend making a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an example of a bunch of sad people whose lives are being played on a tiny screen. The only thing that makes this movie interesting is that I cannot believe this movie has actually been created by anyone. I'm afraid that a movie like this would actually be a disaster, but if not, it would be a welcome distraction.  I don't know if a TV pilot has enough talent to produce this kind of movie, but this is about as bad as that. It's just an embarrassment to see as much as it makes no sense whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries so hard to make us feel the same way it tries so desperately not. What did they think when they made this film? Where did they get their idea? I'm sure that they wanted to take the whole "people can eat" part of the movie out of the context. But in this case you get the impression that people need a little magic so that they can eat magic. I have seen too many times that the actors in these movies will be ready to take any role that the director, in this one case, asks. I can't imagine the plot of this movie without a single joke. The first joke is that it is a magical movie for a little girl. The second joke is just plain dumb and pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am more than a horror fanatic, but if you are one of those who believe horror is evil then you will not enjoy this movie. In fact, it is evil. It is no different from other horror movies I have seen over the years, such as "Resident Evil".  If you want to see "Reset" then you can watch it when it comes out. It will probably be better that this movie is released in the middle of next year and have more people watching it.   Unfortunately, "Resetter" is simply bad. You know that if you get a good horror movie then you get the same effects, but you can't really say anything new about it. You can be a fan of a good movie and you can still see the effects. But in this one you can see the same old movie but only you cannot see the "new" parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad, but good on a few aspects. While it could have been interesting for a short period of the film, it really got on a bad rhythm when it became predictable. The biggest flaw in the movie was that the characters, who you'd think would have some substance in them, were too cute. It was boring. I'm not sure if you can find the parts that were interesting in the original, so you can't really fault. There was an interesting twist with the ending, but it didn't make it worth watching. The acting was also really bad. It lacked the quality of a movie, so it's not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it comes out in 2001 it's a slap in the face of all of the plot devices used in the classic films. When the same guys get it wrong it's painful to look at the list of film makers and watch them try to make it just as brilliant as they did before. I mean they had all the action that made the 'Titanic' franchise. And they were able to get it right to the end. But when you watch it you realize that there's nothing in it that has to make a positive review. When they tried to make everything up to the ends they didn't succeed in making the film any more interesting than the original trilogy. When you watch 'Tronix' you get all the big and flashy scenes back into the original book. When it is time for those characters it just sort of falls apart and we forget. When watching 'TRONIX' they just move away from their own world and try to follow 'TOMVENGAGE' for the next two hours. It's sad that a film with such a bad plot and a bad camera and a terrible plot keeps getting pushed into the air. If you were one of the people who were watching the film in 1991 and you liked it then, it is OK for you to just ignore it and watch something else. But if you didn't you should make your own choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is really bad. I think the storyline is so bad that it's not funny. I'm surprised this film has so much life in it. I don't believe it.  The supporting characters, which are pretty annoying, don't make much sense. They are just plain stereotypes, and they need to change to real life if this is supposed to be a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't find a good point to make about this movie: the acting was bad, the plot was completely stupid, and the ending was bad. What is it that makes this movie worthy of being the same as The X-Ray? I think it must be something that cannot be seen...like the X-RAY.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After viewing the whole movie, I could only say this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  The first thing you do is look at it and wonder how it was made. And then you see the other half of the movie, and think you'll get it. It's pretty clear that it's about a bunch of guys who want to kill someone, so they have to put a camera on it and shoot someone. You start feeling more and more angry and you are scared the person is going to get a gun. But that's the same for the rest of the story, there are people who don't want to shoot people, but they are scared someone is going for some sort of attack, so we need to shoot everyone. Then you are looking at the rest and wonder what happened next, and that's when you start wondering why it doesn't make a point. But then you realize you are just watching a movie and you don't know what's happening. The only thing you can feel is the sadness and horror of seeing people dying or killing each other for a few minutes and then getting killed. The scenes are like a few days of watching a normal murder movie but instead of watching them, you are forced to watch a movie that has absolutely nothing new or different. And the movie doesn't give you a great understanding of the plot, unless you want to know what happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I noticed in this movie was that every person seemed to be making the same kind of movie: a little bit of violence, a little more of violence and a little less violence. What did that little bit more?  The plot is very similar to a TV series I've seen (with some twists, like the story of Ben on a train). But I didn't understand why the show would so badly put into its story. It's a good idea, but the writing is dull, not developed, and it just comes off to me like a "pretentious" movie, so bad things will happen.   If you're going to see this movie, try not to go beyond 1 and 10 minutes. Save your money and enjoy the first 15 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to confess that I've never done the "The Walking Dead" since its inception, and therefore I'm glad I didn't. This show just wasn't good enough to warrant an advance to the premiere. I'm not the only person to note the atrocious plot, but what the hell, this show was supposed to be about? I know when a sequel is being made, and you get the idea that it's about the time to resurrect everyone who dies; so why would they make it only to make the fans go all of the way back? The whole thing is one sickly-making attempt at an idea that's totally made up.   The show had much of the spirit of "Sledgehammer" from "The Legend of Conan" but at the same time it also had an appalling, unoriginal script. This has been one of the worst horror films I've seen in my whole life, but it does give you some reason to stay away from it.  But if you want to try one of those shows, you can look for this one in the "Mystery Files" section. It's a real garbage show, but if you like it you can just watch it and then go on with a pretense and try to not get killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the series of The Three Kings many times, but this film was the worst I have ever seen. It was completely unbelievable and utterly unbelievable. I did not see the first one because I didn't want to lose any more time, but I still got mad at the end because of what it brought to me. I felt the same with the last one. If this film had a chance, it had a similar failure. I couldn't stop laughing at the ridiculous and ridiculous scenes in this film. This is one of the worst films I have EVER seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed to learn from a recent television broadcast that The Walking Dead has been approved for another series, to air on FOX. I was thinking of reading this book and seeing how good the characters were. I'm afraid of a disappointing TV series, but I'm glad to see that The Dead may be able to get some of its stars back. This is bad, poorly written and unentertained. I really hope that this new series will not be an embarrassment. I would like to see The Walking dead and The Walking away before they get their proper stars back - not a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i like the idea of the film but after watching the first 30 minutes of it i was disappointed in the ending. I mean the ending is unbelievable but this movie is really bad. If there was a plot there wasn't any. I think you can probably watch the ending without any plot. A very disappointing film for sure, but at the same time it does a good job of introducing to a few obscure science fiction films. The acting wasn't so bad either. They did a good show but they weren't like they usually are.  If you have to see this film please think of a movie that has some more interesting dialogue and interesting characters. That's what this movie really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie over 50 times and it is pretty much a mess. It has a funny name but is no more funny than it's original premise. Not that much is left behind. It looks like a bad little fantasy movie, so, for me it wasn't funny enough to entertain anyone. I'd have to agree with the people who are saying this movie is a comedy. It isn't, so if you are one of the people saying this you should watch it. If it's a comedy, let yourself go ahead. You can just go and watch it and then walk away. For those who want something to be like that, and to take a joke off of something, watch it, watch the beginning and finish the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a plot that has a good idea, but that really doesn't work out. The actors are the worse-than-the-movie-script, so the whole movie is pretty boring and poorly acted. In particular, the first scene of the film was pretty creepy. In fact, the actors were acting like zombies when they should have been scared.  The plot has a decent idea, although it doesn't stick. I am not sure that the plot had much more to do with the characters, but the end was pretty disappointing. There was a few things that worked quite well in the beginning, but then all of it fell apart. I think it's a bad idea to make a film that relies on your characters in a weak way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie features some good actors who played the role of a very good protagonist, but this movie was poorly written and horribly edited. The story was not consistent with the characters, and it failed to take into account the emotional needs of the characters. The film just seemed like an action movie set for "Murdocks," and in comparison with other action movies that have much more story and storyline, this was nothing but a "murdocks" set on an empty street. I thought it was so bad, that I was afraid to even go into the movie. I was able to sit through most of it, but I left the entire movie after I started watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there is any difference between this film and others that have actually released, this is not one of them. The plot is simply one of several that is lacking. This film was really disappointing with an extremely stupid story. What a really interesting film would be? The idea of a bunch of guys being put out for suicide is stupid and pointless to me. The characters don't act like normal human beings and the film doesn't even make much sense. The acting is even worse than what I expected. This is simply an excuse to play this movie as much as possible to pick a loser who was actually a good actor.  The first thing I saw was that it was so bad it was considered a "movie" in the first place. I was amazed that it had a 2.4 rating. I don't know how other people can rate films that were so bad. This movie wasn't rated the way I expected it to be rated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never met anyone who was capable of such low-end acting, or even low-budget films. The problem is that it can't figure out a decent story. The acting is terrible and the plot is a joke. The actors are terrible, not even given enough to bring the characters to life. The direction is terrible, the sets were horrible, and the camera footage is terrible. It's painful to see how much effort went into filming this, but at the same time, a lot of people just couldn't see the same effort. A lot of this is just plain bad, but it doesn't make much of an effort to find some good material. I'd give this a 7 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie very much because it has a really strange plot. The acting wasn't that good, it wasn't bad in terms of plot or any other aspects. But the plot was bad in that it felt like an old horror film. The plot of the movie was extremely predictable, and the only interesting part was the ending. It's a pretty bad joke that people can die at any time without being killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has some very good images, but it is disappointing that this movie was just another one of those films made for the sake of selling, and so one can never expect from such films. At least one of these movies (like "I'm a Martian") would have made a better impression. It's a shame that this one didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just for the sake of the sake, if I was a judge of a judge, I would have thrown it down. Just for me, it isn't as bad as it is in The Aries to Aries or as it was in The Matrix. I guess that was the worst part of the film.  The main reason to recommend this movie was because it is interesting for a short time, if you can't get that in the end. But it's just not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is a collection of bad films, it is extremely bad, most of the characters are lame, the story is not interesting and has a huge plot hole that we can't escape from. I'm not the first person to watch this movie but I think that if I saw it I would be thrown in a deep freezer. If you read a good book, I would consider this to be a piece of trash. I have nothing else to say about this movie. I recommend that you stay away from it, and try it on a DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing i did for this movie was to write a positive review about  This movie is bad. Its not that the acting is bad, but the acting just sucks. Its so bad that i can't even talk about the plot. If the plot was good, you would enjoy it.  The plot does not have a good ending, and the ending does not make any sense.  Its hard to believe that this movie is a real movie because of its bad acting. The plot is very predictable and only decent.  In the end, the movie is just boring, and you wonder why it is in the same category as some bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is no good - no good. The story line is poor, the acting is weak, and the overall message is one of the worst things I have ever seen. The movie is a piece of crap and you will probably find it hard to make it to watch again. The fact that they made it so far just shows how poor and lazy they are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never done a good movie, but I have always been impressed by Michael Keogh and this horrible piece of crap. The acting is very bad and the scenes just don't quite make up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I am not stupid. The movie was quite good with very little (and very few) plot lines, but there were too many stupid things that made this a total nightmare of a movie. It is probably the biggest non-movie: I mean a movie that tries to connect a lot of random stuff, but tries to mess with your mind and gets the wrong ends.  This movie got a little bit better with the ending and one scene was pretty good. However, when the big scene came (that is when we're told the guy is coming home), it was a total disappointment. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was so bad is because I watched it twice! So, that's why I decided to watch the movie and then to see it over and over, and it ended up being the same horrible movie I had watched twice. When the movie is over it just goes straight into another movie. I couldn't get it out of my mind and after a few days I decided it was worth watching, but I have a hard time looking at that movie on video. I've watched it over 2, 3, 4 times and then I was pretty tired. So, this movie probably wasn't meant to be watched. I'm not saying that it is bad, it is just too bad that I couldn`t finish it. It was a pretty bad waste of time on this movie. This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is as dull as a dull glass of milk.  In the beginning there is a decent plot. But there is nothing else to make this dull movie interesting.  As the story develops the characters are as dull, boring and useless. The movie ends with an unbelievable scene of one of the biggest blimpe moments of the movie (in which we see the man is walking down a road...  I was thinking "why do we see this scene?" The answer is that it was just a matter of time before the movie began. The other characters were good and there are interesting but this movie is just about as shallow as a lemonade.   I'll just tell you that my opinion on this movie was: if you liked the first episode and you didn't get it, you will have to try again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is like a piece of trash where there is no way out of it. The plot is nothing more than the idea that the world is going to crash at the end. It is not a good idea, the characters are ridiculous and the plot is so bad that it just plain sucks. I have to admit that this movie was a success in that it is a really bizarre premise. Unfortunately it wasn't done that much better when it was made. I cannot say the idea was good but it doesn't help much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible and extremely dull. Some of the action scenes were laughable as if a computer was running.  Some of it seemed staged to make an impression. Some actors were completely flat.  I have been very skeptical about movies about which I liked, and this movie was not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of nothing, except a few scenes of nudity in a room of some poor looking porn. I think the first few scenes were pretty good though. However, the sex scenes are about as pathetic as anything in Hollywood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just like "The Untouchables" with far more stupid dialog. This movie tries to break the family up and do something a little bit silly, so no one has to get the idea that it's about a bunch of people getting drunk and dancing.  I can't believe that this movie is "good". I can only conclude that everyone involved with this movie got the same crap as the parents did with "Fletting the Red Sox".  My suggestion is to take a break from this movie and try a movie instead: "Dancing With Her" or "Trop Up With Her".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just plain trash, but if I am interested in watching it, I can only give this movie a 2 out of 10. For me it is a completely ridiculous scene, and this is pretty obvious - just about the way the whole story gets played out. The acting is bad, and there is no good point to the story. The plot is awful, but it gets better with the ending. It's sad that it keeps coming off as a "romantic" plot, and not much else.  Overall, this movie is bad because it doesn't make any sense. The characters and scenes are poorly thought out. It is just a cheap, amateur movie made by teenagers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main theme of this movie is its ridiculous and totally predictable plot. A strange scene involving a vampire comes at a small hotel (set in the woods) and a little girl gets bitten, leaving her to fall down. In a strange way, he is the Vampire Slayer, but his new wife is a Vampire named Claire. It is unclear that she was bitten by an vampire. The vampire wife is forced to be seduced by a woman named Kate (Anita Marie), and she then falls in love with a man named Gary.  This is an unbelievable movie with a little bit of gore and a few scenes that are very weak. The plot of this is completely ridiculous as well as the characters who try to take advantage of the female vampire. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I am not going to get up for "Star Trek: The Next Generation" when the episode in that regard is about 30 minutes. I can forgive a bit of the "hatsimangala" in the episode because it is not entirely insulting to the audience.  The episode in "Star Wars: The Nesha-ko" was much more entertaining than the original "Star War". The plot is weak and there was very little interest in the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film like this should be made about a real documentary-making about a true story about a man's life - the movie doesn't seem like it was made as an actual documentary -it is all too boring.  I'm more interested in this movie with a documentary-maker like Jim Malloy.   I have tried watching this film without this nonsense, and it doesn't make you feel like you're going to have a life -and you don't get all of the answers you would normally get.  The story itself is bad. It isn't really a story. It's just a story, and there are a lot of people that don't understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just about a couple of guys having sex. It's not a comedy, but really bad!  I guess it's because the stars were all actors or people who aren't good. And they didn't really deserve that.   There are some other funny jokes, but they are not funny.  A lot of the acting was very good. Some of the humor is good, but the rest is really bad. The characters are just terrible. I thought some of the scenes were so bad that they weren't funny, but instead they were funny only because you had to laugh for several minutes to try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst movie of 2016. The acting is bad, the story is bad and the plot is bad. The only thing that got me was the crazy story of a teenage girl who is so sad she does a suicide attempt. The plot is totally stupid and I was very interested to see how it works. The fact that the girl is killed by her parents (I guess her father) is totally ridiculous. The story of this girl is totally not believable, and if you want to see the plot of a movie like this you will not get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is awful, the acting is bad, the scenery is terrible. I laughed for a few minutes, because it was so cheap! But then it started getting funnier, and the jokes became worse! Then the jokes, the humour, were bad!  The film is based on a failed attempt to remake the famous film "Bababababbabab" from 1973. The first time I watched it, I watched "Babsabab"' but I don't remember why I did so because I was not part of the movie. The plot is about a mother getting mad in an asylum when she starts seeing her husband's mother (the mother being the real mother) making love to her husband (the husband being her boyfriends father).  The scene where the mother sees her husband having sex with the husband, is just a few seconds before the screen zooms and shows her seeing the husband having sexual intercourse with his wife. There is no indication in the film that there is any sort of intercourse during love-making (sex is shown only through intercourse, but I guess she is not as ashamed about having sex on the balcony). Even the sex is just for her husband, not for his lover (the real mom).  But you can also see the scenes where the two characters are kissing and then having intercourse again. The kissing is a sex scene and the characters are completely unaware of that this is happening. I guess the only reason to see this film is because it's cheap and can be shown in any way because it is a comedy.  What a shame, is that someone in this film decided to make it.   But this film didn't even make any money. It made less money in the US in 2004 and had very, very low ticket rates. The biggest loser is the director. This movie just makes no sense and no money is made in this whole movie. It's like he has no respect, and it is extremely bad for him to do anything to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Naked Cell" is the least interesting way in which to watch a horror movie. As much as it's pretty awful, it has something. "The Cell" tries to be cute and cute in a bad way, but the film isn't smart enough to save yourself. There are some pretty funny lines, but they're not funny. There were only a handful of interesting scenes. The story was very predictable. The only thing was the creepy thing which seemed to kill everyone. I was not surprised by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You get a small glimpse of the new world of warring nations, the last place where the best person will ever be. But there's no suspense, no surprises. Just boring, boring, dull.  The plot is no more serious than the boring plot, the plot is completely lost, and the movie is no longer a movie, it's a "movie with one person" (as I said before).  The movie is bad for two reasons. First and second is that the film's cast isn't even as good as the one in the original. And the actors have no special ability, and don't deserve anything.  Secondly, the film has only one major plot. A real war, one with many dead and dying enemies. The story is mainly about the hero's struggle to save the life of a little boy who was also trapped in a tower of corpses, as he tried to help the other boy in the tower. But that is it. There is absolutely no connection with the "War" that happens in the actual war, but that it does happen in the war is the only reason why the hero becomes a "hero", i.e. an ordinary man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really sucks. First of all, I thought that it is an entertaining movie. But I am disappointed. This movie seems like a waste of everything. The plot is really stupid. Not only, there was a lot of stupid characters but also the characters were extremely stupid. The fact that the actors did a good job is another reason why I was not as bothered as I was. I cannot say anything positive about this movie. There is no funny jokes, nothing, nothing. It's just too much stupid. I recommend for a quick movie if you have nothing else to do in life but spend hours on it. But not for the same reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this film was full of bad garbage - and I am not going to give any ratings that give them some credit - the story is bad, it is terrible, it has horrible characters, the plot is lousy, the actors are horrible, and the characters are not believable. I can see some good talent in the cast, but the whole thing just gets in a bad, bad way, and I can't blame the casting either, they were obviously bad and they are very mediocre. I really don't know what happened to the movie. Perhaps the writers had to try for something like this as a way to promote themselves.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm afraid of making too many comments. I will make a longer one because I feel this movie is too slow to finish.  If you are not a horror movie fanatic, this movie was not worth watching.  This movie was so bad it had to be compared to the film "The Sengle and the Moon" in a comparison.  I gave it 1/2 out of 10 but, I was too low to decide. The storyline is completely unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had a major flaw that was made evident from the beginning. A good ending is impossible if you can't keep your nose at the end. But then you cant, and they just try to make the scene fit with the rest of the movie. So you cant really get to that point if you're not a fan of it. The ending was just unbelievable.  I would recommend if you stick with a copy of "The Last Jedi", you will likely be rewarded for the movie with good laughs. The characters were just in general bad. The acting was so bad that it was pretty predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a film set in a post-Apocalyptic America. It is full of ridiculous, dumb, stereotypical and stupid violence. The story is pretty dumb, but the characters aren't quite so bad. In spite of this, it is pretty amusing. Not very funny at all. But then it comes on. The plot, the characters, the storyline, the dialogue, the acting, and even the music is a complete rip-off of the original. The only thing that impresses me is the art. The cinematography, although the characters do look good in the film, they are horribly poor. The special effects look like they were done in a few minutes. But nothing stands out. The storyline, which is more or less about a woman who tries to break up with her boyfriend while being robbed at gunpoint by the husband, is very good, if you care to see the movie as a movie about a shoot-down of nuclear power plants. That's about as much as a 'classic' film can get. The rest of the plot is pretty ridiculous. It seems that whoever wrote this made up a little extra, but it's not.  The good part of this movie is the cast, which are pretty good. A good deal of actors and supporting members, though only some of them are obviously talented and others are boring, stupid, or plain bad. The characters, though, are good enough. Unfortunately, the plot can't make up for its lack of depth and intensity.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised that this film was so terrible, and I couldn't find it to be funny. For example, they made a movie about a dog named after the fictional dog, but they decided to call it "the Dog", because it's so obviously a dog. I am ashamed that I couldn´t locate the real Dog after seeing this movie. It seems to be like the Dog made up with everyone's lives and then started putting them in place and throwing them around, like they did with the other dogs. This movie is worse than what I had anticipated it would be. The movie is just bad enough to warrant a "3" at best if you can make a positive review about something horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not even a classic film, let's see. This is a "campy" film, not even entertaining. The cast and the supporting cast are horrible, the acting is just bad and the story is poorly written and poorly made.  I couldn't even manage to get to watch this film, the director didn't even get paid, and all the actors are in their pants.  But that's OK, you can watch this movie, and you can do much better work with it than it's made. But it's not a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't find any good movie: It's so bad, you can't believe that they will be able to do this if they're making one in a year. It is just horrible to watch. You don't really understand what they are going to be doing. They're going to kill people? And the best thing in the world is that they would be able a kill people. I mean they are all going to get in the car and drive to a hospital, with the people that there are in there. They should be more responsible and be responsible, as well as have a movie in the middle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not even close to the worst I have seen of recent Hollywood, I can't afford to rent this movie even to rent. Even with an advance payment, this piece of sh* is an absolutely awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't even find the plot to take place, but the camera and camera movements make no sense. This is the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater. I don't understand why the other actors got so involved. It's so shallow, with an inconsistent pace, that this movie is so uninteresting that it becomes a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really disappointed with this movie. It is not funny at all, and it has really low stakes. I didn't think this movie made any effort to "set the stage". There is nothing that will come along and make it funny. I felt like watching the beginning of it was a waste of my time. If I was to watch the whole movie, I would not have seen much of it. I would have thought it would have been a hilarious little comedy and a really funny little movie, but it didn't.   The biggest reason this movie isn't funny is that there's no funny material in it. It's all about what is the most stupid thing that's ever been put on the screen. The only good parts are the parts that make a funny appearance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason to get this movie was because I wanted to go to see it after I lost some money on some of my personal investments. But this movie only showed the worst aspect of the movie in the film, the lack of any redeeming qualities that can be seen in any other movie (the only thing that I remember was the part of the film that was not filmed in a house). If you've seen the "My Son" series of movies (as I've seen them), you know that there is no way to relate these two movies except that one doesn't have any real characters, there is too little dialog, and the only thing which we could find in this movie is a good deal of nudity (since the film didn't shoot that). I am very disappointed that this movie failed to even resemble the premise of the series (and since I didn't remember the other two movies, it might have been lost). The acting is horrible and the story is bad, but the story itself was the only good part in this disappointing movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the idea of this film but when I read the synopsis I was surprised. There was some nice jokes in it but when they were cut down in the movie (there is a lot of material on the page) the jokes seemed pretty weak and were not funny at all. If the actors were funny I would have enjoyed it but I didn't. If you like a comedy, you don't like this one. If someone wants to watch a comedy or movie I would never see that one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a believer in the natural beauty of the human. However, this movie does a complete 180 in to this point. The writing is bad, the directing is bad and the acting is bad. In conclusion, this horrible movie is only worth consideration if you are bored at the mere mention of the name. This movie is the worst in the movie universe, that is all. I'm convinced that there is no hope left for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It starts off as a fairly entertaining show but quickly turns into a moron story, one that has too many plot twists and turns to become an unfunny parody of a movie: the usual 'guesto kills a friend' routine - usually pretty funny - except when you're the main character and you have an inner sense that the film is going to be bad. (The movie was so bad that I had to look at the subtitles before they finished their script.)   The plot is a simple story of a person (called 'The Hero') who has seen his wife's husband killed by the 'villain' who has also murdered his wife.  The villain isn't named, but instead he's a 'guineo' who kills an elderly woman, and who is part of a gang.  This is bad, because it has a weak plot and very annoying. It doesn't have any great story or atmosphere, and the film itself is almost always going to make me laugh with a 'this one stupid movie'. The scenes involving the 'guain' are completely useless - you never get any suspense. It's just boring and predictable.    I did like some scenes - the 'vampire hunter' scene was a good scene and it was interesting to see the 'closets' which used a lot of blood and gore - but they are so poorly drawn and so poorly written, I don't know how the 'prostigious' part was written.  I just think that if this had been made a horror film, it would have been better. It is just about as bad as it can get. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an awful movie: it is about a serial killer who killed a man and rapes the girl's mother (with a knife) so that his girlfriend's sister will take his role as the "god of the girl". In addition, the killer tries to rape a woman who was in the beginning of a relationship with his girlfriend. If you consider yourself a smart person and have watched horror movies, you know that a serial rapist is no joke. Also, the film is awful. It is very predictable. There is a lot of stupid stuff in it, such as a black leather bag and a knife, so that it's really hard to watch. Also the acting isn't good. The guy who murdered is played by a fake (I didn't care) and he's too scary to look at. And the girl is played quite obviously by a girl who was an annoying teenage girl. Her behavior is rather wooden, which is supposed to be the opposite of what she should be. The only funny thing is the girl. The acting is great and the cinematography, but it's so weak that it really doesn't help the horror-film genre. This is only good if you're looking for something to rent. Not even that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the biggest disappointment in this film. If I had been at all smart to watch it before my first time seeing it, I would have done just about the same thing. Forgive me, not wanting to see it before watching The Omen, but the fact that it was actually released in the weeks following the film, it seemed like some of the more intelligent viewers were missing that fact. And I don't want to put down anyone who made this film, but it does seem a tad over-the-top on just about its attempt to portray "normal" men with great powers. Even after the film itself did away with its attempt at being realistic, it still wasn't quite as subtle as most films would be. The Orested is, to all of the following viewers, a terrible waste of time to sit through. The film itself tries, and fails, to tell you what happened. For example, the film tries to portray the "evil" woman (i.e. the man who raped the victim) as having some sort of love for the rapist, which, as I'm sure the author intended, is a poor attempt.   The film depicts the rapist as a "normal man", and it tries to depict the rapist's "normal wife" as having an attraction to the "normal husband", which, unfortunately, is not true at all. In reality, this man was a manipulative person, who had no interest in actually being able to have a normal relationship with his wife. This is the point that the film was trying to make. Unfortunately, the viewer, I suppose, really just tries to find out which sexual partners is capable of having sex with someone. This only seemed to be the point the film tried to make, and there is really no point to making that argument. At the very least, The Orem's portrayal of the "good" wife, and its portrayal of her relationship with her husband, were both completely useless to the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is simple and, in some ways, like a typical "comedy" movie. But the plot is just so bad that I don't even want to say anything else. It's just a waste of time, I guess. The story is predictable. Maybe if there were some suspense to keep things moving on, it would be interesting. But it's really hard to make any real sense. And the characters don't do anything except make you want to stop watching.  There is the cliché that the protagonist is a "savior," which comes as a movie: "The man who made this movie was in a lot of trouble, but was rescued by the love of his son." Even though the protagonist has a perfect family, we can't believe that the woman is a man who needs to love people. And if that guy is rescued, it isn't really going to help the family, it will just be the victim of his own son. This is so sad to see! If you want a movie, don't spend the time reviewing. You really need a more thoughtful movie: a storyline that can actually tell a story without being pretentious and without being stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it when I was a college student and I was the only student in the class who could make it out of it. The whole thing was that it looked like a made-for-TV series. The plot was very bad and the characters were just horrible, even with the original cast. The acting was just bad, I guess the best actor in the whole series was the ex-girlfriend who left him for an insane number of years. The ending was horrible, the ending didn't match the first ending, the entire plot was a piece of garbage and even the plot was ridiculous. I just wanted to kill myself and then watch it again just to see that it was not even worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping to get some action from this movie, but, unfortunately I didn't. I was a little disappointed that the entire plot was so little fun and so little plot, I couldn't find it, even if it didn't get a good laugh. It didn't even have any more punch. The only saving grace in the whole movie was the scene in the cafeteria where they are saving the lives of people who are trapped in a tree, but that was mainly a flashback scene which had no punch at all. And the plot, the only thing I remember and I was certain was an important part of the movie, is the one moment when the car that was driving off the road is stopped for no reason. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that the guy was driving, but I was more concerned with the fact he had his car locked away. The plot was too slow, with no time to react. The acting was terrible.  I only saw it to try to read the subtitles and to see if I could get any more clues about what happened to the people in the movie. It doesn't seem like they know what is happening to them, they just keep talking, without much explanation. I don't understand it. The movie was completely unbelievable. I'm not sure if there was an opportunity to get more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no patience for these kinds of low-budget horror movies in the late-1980s. Why is it that these movies are so terrible that we can't just let them out and let them carry out a week of murder! The "scary" film just doesn't have any real message. The scenes aren't made for anyone who's going to spend 45 minutes looking at every bloody piece of flesh, or who's only going to turn the camera lens to look at the bloody slough that the cop sees, the bloody blood, the brain-burning guts of the infected people and the bloody, screaming ghosts, and the corpse hanging on the pavement and the sick girl screaming for revenge. Even the death scenes are just the corpses, not people.  The plot of this movie is that of a murder at a house that was held by a psychopath who was obsessed with serial killer Robert Doyle, and this maniac is obsessed with a woman named Mary Jo Rippey. The psychopath wants revenge, and because of his obsession he is willing to kill people for her sake. This is why the film is so slow-moving and uninteresting. Even after this, I couldn't believe that they had put more effort into the movie and had any point. If there were more details about the murder of Mary Jo and the serial killer, it would have been interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I'd like to say my feelings about this film are based on its gross incompetence, not really all that the film itself. I think this film is one of the worst films I've seen in my life. What did this film do? In the first few minutes, you know something is bad about the film, but you don't really know what. I'd say the film tries too hard and really is just that bad. It was obvious that the filmmakers were just trying to make something a little better.  So many of the scenes were just boring, you're not in the most ridiculous movie but just boring. Some scenes made me laugh and you would not be able to laugh in a matter of seconds.  The most notable things about this movie were that it was stupid to have so much in it. I mean it's a pretty good film that has a lot of nudity, which I didn't care too much. But if you think those are the best scenes in this movie, then you shouldn't think they're the best. And the story is just so weak that you really can't expect it to happen anyway. You also get a really creepy black guy. He kills some of the people and then comes back with some women and is killed, and then you just try to kill him. And then you get to meet a guy who is really evil. The fact that the Black guy's head and who is the killer isn't even that big a deal. Oh my god! This movie is one to watch only because the plot is good, but it really just plain old. So boring.   Now the movie is good in some scenes, I really liked it. But the plot wasn't that great, and the acting was a little below it. And what I thought about the plot and acting was that it had some interesting dialog and some good ideas. It didn't really try to be funny, the characters were all pretty likeable and didn't seem to go into much. I didn's like this film because it had something that made it funny. I don't know if the director didn't get a lot from the sets. Some people are likeable, the actors, and it even showed the actors had a little bit of acting talent, but they were only a few actors.  This movie just really plain sucked me out. I couldn't laugh at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are willing to do something that is not an absurd film then this is a waste of money, an action video that contains only a few moments of sanity (if that is a thing), and a lame premise. If only it were a bit more intelligent, I would not have laughed so hard in the theater. If the idea of a car exploding and burning is your favorite topic of all time, then don't waste your time in trying to make it.  This movie just doesn't need to be watched. It's a bad move for the kids (as many of us would) to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I thought my dear husband and I thought this was a well put together movie about a love relationship that falls apart. There's nothing to recommend for this film. The acting is horrible.  If it's so, then why did I let it out? My husband's love for a little girl is well known, but it isn't the love we should have for our kids. I've always liked him and, I'd rather not to let him lose his job or perhaps even lose his marriage. However, I knew the father had his job to keep the little girl happy and that the parents should be able to cover up for his lack of work. I knew that a lot of times, I would have chosen to buy a DVD on a normal budget. It's just so bad and so disappointing! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was bad, but that's not a bad thing. But what was this movie: An attempt to re-invent the "Supernatural" (for the sake of "reception" or "reacquatch") of the "Lights" storyline. What could this new storyline be? To me it could have been a simple re-do of the storyline, although with very little new storyline and very little originality. The movie tries to build on the Supernatural storyline but does so in a bad way. The main story line has two sisters, a father and a new stepmother (a mother and the father), which is obviously not in the best way. To be fair, the story line with the new mother is more believable than the story with the father. If the movie had been a sequel to "Lites," this would have been the case. In this movie, the new step mother, who is obviously better than the old stepmother, has a new story that does not mesh with the original story line. To make matters worse, the main villain is a new and evil female with no regard for the family and everything else in the movie. The new villain has a much more interesting look. But in this movie she is still annoying. The family tries to convince her and she cannot help her in any way, except by putting in a huge amount of heat on her. I can't blame the mother, because she tries to scare the family. This is a bad case of overwork and failure on the part of the filmmaker. I wouldn't expect the plot to be this difficult, but it does nothing of its own (except for the sister). The characters themselves aren't that strong. The old story lines are not interesting, but if it had some value, it would have. They were very disappointing and in many ways the storyline of the original storyline, which is far superior to the new plot. I was glad to see the film again, but after the film, it was a bad day. There were two small moments that helped keep the plot going. The first was the fact that the old mother was a different type of female. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the original "Staircase" season, this one was only a couple hours away from taking a trip to Hollywood. A little bit of research got the idea right and, by the end, it was an embarrassment of low concept TV shows.  The plot is the usual, and the cast is pretty bad. The acting was awful, but, it has a good beginning. But I didn't really like the idea of having the same characters as the "Stairs" movies. For the most part, it's a fun idea, but it seems to lose its credibility after the first few minutes.  Overall, the ending is OK. But, what were the reasons? The fact that a TV show set in a dark dungeon, a lot of the action is supposed to take place there.  I don't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that I can believe that I had expected in this film was that it would provide a plot for the film to provide a "feel-good factor" to the film and that the film would allow the viewer to do something in a movie that would be fun for them. I didn't expect that the viewer would find any kind of fun in such a silly, self-loathing film.  I didn-t expecting any kind.  Not at all. If that was the case, I don't think that it had anything to do with any of the "feelings" of the film. It didn't even have the slightest bit of humor to it. No wonder why. It was just a poor excuse for any "feel" in the film in which I could see any real humor. I don`t have an idea what the actors/actresses were expecting to do in such situations, but that doesn't stop me. They seemed to believe that such an action film could only happen if they needed a message from the viewer. They needed to say something to a bad, self over-acting movie is "that you don't believe me." There was only one person in the movie who tried to keep it from blowing up like they could.  It didn`t stop me, and I think that I am an easy-to-follow person, so the more I read about this film, the less I learn about it. I do have some hope that I might see more action films that allow me to learn something more.  "Rise of Storm" is a classic case of poor logic and low budget. I have a really hard time believing that any film made today that could be so boring that it could actually be considered worthy. I only read this film after seeing "Fist of Fury", and I can't say the same thing with my own eyes. It had the potential to be fun, but in my opinion it was not doing it.   It is hard to make up what went wrong in this movie. The acting was pretty good, although the direction was awful, the sets were pretty good. But to be fair, they had a budget, and it is hard for a big budget studio to produce anything that is completely unrealistic. The idea was that when people don't have any budget (or any budget to do anything but put out films), they could just do a few days or weeks to make a film. Well, when I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely worthless.  The acting was poor. There was no reason to believe the two guys. The setting was terrible.  There was very little humor in the movie, as most of the humor was on the side of the screen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit that I'm surprised to hear someone like "Lemony Giant" even have this film in his collection. But I am surprised to find any other movie with so little regard for the dignity of the human beings, not even for the small town of Rockingham. I'm also disappointed that this film features any remotely original message, unless we take the title, to be the "Killer" (I don't think that there's a term for that).  The story is about a couple, with an estranged couple, in the hopes of starting an affair, but instead ends up as a complete waste of time, while being subjected to the same treatment as if the couple had been dating their boyfriend.  If you're going to see this film, be very careful. Avoid seeing it at the local video rental store, and then try to rent the movie from your local video store. The movie begins with the most insulting dialog in all of Hollywood, and this makes it seem as if it was a completely improvised movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was pretty good, but the "gatherings of the brain" just did not have the same level of suspense, as the plot has one scene which is completely over the top and only lasts, like half an hour. The characters were completely uninteresting.  And if you are not familiar with the idea of the "brain", i'm not sure you'd like to watch it. The plot is so bad, i wonder if it's been kept from the production by the production company, and even if that was the case, i'm still surprised I'd even take a movie: i mean, at that point, it was pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess it wasn't just the fact that it isn't funny - it's just a waste of precious time with some good acting and a boring plot.  The plot is the least interesting. There was a brief cameo as a young girl, and it showed some of the most ridiculous scenes.  I'm not an expert on writing, but the lack of inspiration really kills this movie. It's a shame that this movie is such low-rent stuff. The movie should only be filmed a few times to make more money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has one of the worst, worst actors and the worst characters. It's so bad, it makes you wonder if it's the real world. At least the plot was good. This movie should never have been made. If this was a film:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an absolutely terrible movie: a bad attempt at "the great American movie". It's an attempt at an American "documentary" that relies on the standard techniques and clichés of the most absurd film no-one would have even imagined.  This movie is completely predictable, and no one could predict what would happen to a character (other than the director and the producer). It's so bad that you can't predict the outcome of the movie. The ending is very predictable, which is OK if you're a film-making geek. But, if you aren't, you'll just watch it and wish you're dead! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie just doesn't have a storyline. No one gets a chance to redeem this movie.  The movie is based on the original series of "Lassay" that I love so much, but the movie never goes off script, which is bad, but unfortunately we can't blame the director.  If you were a loyal "LASSay" fan you would never forget about the beginning of "Trucail".  The story is so bad it's no wonder people think this movie is a sequel. The actors have no chemistry with the characters and the movie just plain sucks. The ending is bad too.  All in all, a bad way to start a comedy movie that has nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest problem with this film is that you are really only given a few minutes to "meet" with the characters. The way the characters act is not like it would be. At times the characters are just so stupid, it isn't that good. In this case we have the typical cliché of the action genre. A lot of the scenes are so incredibly dumb. That was not the case in my personal opinion. The action scenes were actually quite funny. The only way the film succeeded was that it was an incredibly weak performance by a great actor. You can imagine how terrible they could have acted. The reason the film failed was because it did not give enough depth to the characters (this is the only way it can be, in my opinion). It was just plain bad. It was so bad that I think that I only just wanted to finish watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a bizarre sequence involving a vampire that murders the villagers who have already been attacked by a vampire in the same way as the previous scene. The film does not even manage to keep the plot going. The story itself (not directed by Romero) revolves around a woman who kills her husband and keeps him alive to keep him from dying.  The end of the film is filled with some of the worst scenes I have ever seen from Romero's movies, including the scene in which a man kills a woman in a shower... (this scene has never been so poorly done, even though it appears to be more than a standard Romero horror thriller. It is not funny at all, as it can't really be considered a horror film, even if it's a zombie movie: it just lacks suspense. The script is totally incomprehensible. Some scenes in the film are so confusing that they are not even interesting to make out.  As it is now, Romero's films are not really scary enough to warrant an eight-digit Oscar nomination. While the director's talent was certainly in some areas, his movie is pretty dull and nothing else. This is not the first of his films to be relegated to the "horror" category; this is simply his first failure, and I expect we will see the same line of failure continue, if not the director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's painful to see how low the production values in this film really were. There really was no reason for this movie to exist. I couldn't believe what I just saw, and I think the acting was pathetic. The direction was poor. A few plot holes were missed and it really felt like they were made by people who didn't know how to do the job. It really could have made this movie, but it just didn't do much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so terrible it wasn't funny. It felt like a parody of some sort. There was little plot and little humor. We weren't in the way we would have expected. Not only the dialogue, but the acting was awful. The way these guys were portrayed was like a bunch of guys in a cave trying to figure out what they were. The humor was terrible. The chemistry was lousy.  I think this movie had a purpose, if the director didn't have the courage to do the movie on purpose. He obviously didn't. This was no excuse for a movie made on such an uneven surface. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an awful attempt to do a small-town family movie, with some of the worst acting, direction, and plot lines I've ever seen. I can't believe I wasted more time watching this movie. It is the least interesting part of "The Secret Life Of 4 Kids". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is your life, go do something else. I am surprised to see such a poor film. I went into it with no expectations, and I did not see much to do. As a result, I am not a "lone" who would enjoy this movie. There was only one scene that I thought was interesting, and that was a very annoying scene. The idea of the girl and the girl's boyfriend getting together was silly. I really thought this movie would be good. Unfortunately, the actors should have done more than that and they were not doing it. It was like they did a bad episode of "Sister Bedlam." The whole thing was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of Sci:Conspiracy, but this movie didn't make much sense to anyone.  You get the idea that this was directed by a filmmaker and the movie has very little plot. If you get the plot, you would get bored. That the whole movie revolves around a plot to steal money. And that in the end, someone kills someone.  I didn't get that vibe when I watched this. The actors had no chemistry and the ending, which I thought would be a much better ending, never seemed to be that good.  The actors seemed like a bunch of guys sitting around and having a little bit of fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this movie is that it doesn't even make any sense, and it keeps making me want to scream. There's no connection to a plot, no characters, no action, no storyline, no plot, it's just plain boring. It's got to be really annoying to watch it. This is the first film I have ever watched in which I think I may have turned the channel off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the name of a "star" movie, this movie was supposed to be the sequel to the hit series of "B" series (the first one was made a year ago). The idea was simple - we'd see all of the cast and get a sense of the characters. Unfortunately, it is not. I was disappointed when the characters all did the same - with the exception of a very small number of people who obviously had a lot of money. The rest seemed to be a bit like "B3" made for money but the premise was so weak I couldn't see the movie for myself. It was basically a "one-woman/one-man, one-man" situation with a couple of people - the best place for that would be to have one person, but unfortunately, the only two actors they had were in the same place. If you want a good horror film: don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie and was so disappointed. The plot lacked the most basic action of any feature film. The characters were not strong enough. They had a bad cast. They were not believable and they were not realistic. The movie just sucked me through the whole thing. The only reason I saw this movie was because it was released in 2003 and I thought it might be a good movie with a great cast and even a good score. If I had seen it before then I would have probably just put it on my shelf and left it. It didn't have enough to make me spend anything but a few minutes on it.  I'm not sure if this movie is as bad as they said it was. I will watch the DVD and see how it did. I'm guessing it will make the rounds to Hollywood. This movie was horrible. Please don't waste your time watching this. It will be one of those films without a title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was filmed in a manner so terrible that it's almost painful to watch.  In one scene I watched, in which a huge bald man stands on a mountain for his movie (!) and is repeatedly attacked by giant orcs, who appear as cartoonish monsters. After the attack he's taken to a new home to get comfortable, which is then shown to people as an ugly home. The fact that this is a movie is the worst thing I've seen in film history. There's a good moment where we see the dwarfs coming for him, but the way it is handled, and the film doesn't come alive until the point when they appear to be human. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing else that can top this terrible piece of garbage. It is no wonder this movie had so much money it could be purchased to production. However, I would have expected a few moments of humor in the movie, or something to show that it was just one thing.  The story line isn't too complicated, and the dialogue is so bad that it really doesn't have anything to say.  Overall I was disgusted by the fact that a film like this had to be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to wait until the third episode to see this one. I didn't know when to begin the rest of the story, which I was very certain would be an absurd plot, but I just watched and waited. It was very boring and the actors were awful. I felt I had wasted the time watching the first episode.  I watched the other episodes in the beginning and the second episode, and I'm convinced there's no reason to waste another hour and another hour of my time viewing this piece of the film. There were some of my favorite movies like The Naked Lunch, The Wizard of Oz and the Monkey's Scowls and The Elephant Man, but this movie is a complete waste of time. Even if I was paying attention and watching this at the beginning, it wouldn't have been worth watching any of them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that would have been a good satire if it had been made by Ayn-nail. The characters are in bad situations. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is that there is a group of terrorists who are trying to destroy the world. In order to accomplish their goal they need to abduct one thousand people. We are not even sure that this is a film based on real footage but the main protagonist is a terrorist named Elroy (or his real identity). The first scene is actually a scene from the famous, horror/thug movie "Bloodshed" which shows Elroy getting killed by his own terrorist accomplice. This is a pretty disappointing twist since in this movie there is no dialogues whatsoever in this flick! After Elroy kidnaps an American, he is then forced to fight and kill another American, which is actually filmed in a black room where Elroy is fighting the other American and doing it in an abandoned warehouse. The acting is pretty bad, especially by the cast, but in the end they manage to get a little bit better with the final scene.  After this, what do you do if you watch this? The plot of "Terrorist" is nothing more than a bunch of guys who have nothing but guns and a little intelligence. The ending is obviously just boring and the acting is too badly executed. So basically, if you want to see something that is not made for dramatic or suspense then you're pretty close to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know what to do with this film and I didn`T care enough to go to the trouble to buy the movie to see it.  I thought the film was overrated and a really low-budget version of a true thriller. The plot was very predictable and the story was very slow and tep that could be expected to be either very entertaining or very unbelievable to most viewers.   Although it was well filmed, the acting was poor. the actors were horrible. I just couldn`T buy the film to see the movie and pay $50 or $100 or $50 for a DVD. I'd rather rent it as a movie, if I have to rent it and rent at a store or something then it might be better.  The only good thing in this film was a very interesting storyline. A true thriller would have been that the storyline would be interesting and very scary and in a way more interesting and dramatic. However, the movie couldn`t even take place in a very exciting way, in fact, it ended up boring and sad in a bad way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a bad little movie. It has been done on countless TV, in countless other TV shows, movies and commercials. In the past years, this has always been an action movie. The "action" genre, usually filled with bad dialog and bad story has a long and glorious time to wait, and now it has reached a stage that is truly awful.  A good movie: A fun movie. Even the acting was fun; there are exceptions, some great scenes. But this movie is terrible. It doesn't work. It's a typical action movie with bad effects and bad storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening scene of this movie is a pretty good movie, but when the ending occurs, it just doesn't make sense. When they're finally in the room with each other, I thought they had to act like they were doing a normal scene and then, after that, they have to act as if they're only in a room to have sex with eachother (if you're a married guy, you can act as well as that and still not get caught in the act, and the scene that starts when they are in their bedroom is not there, but rather a room with a couple of fake walls around the room). Then they have some scene and some kissing scenes, but there isn't much of any story. There was one scene where a guy is sucking on another girl's dick with her mouth, but I really think that it should be in a movie of a couple making love, not kissing each other. Then there's one scene that's like the scenes from a normal movie, only it only has sex in it, and it does it in a creepy way.  The other scene was a bit interesting, but the scene when they were kissing with each another, or when they're kissing in their room, is just not enough. You'll think that the scene where they were making love to each other was more interesting.  If I would only say that this movie isn't great, I would say that it's really bad that it doesn't go over the top. The ending makes sense, but it doesn`t last long enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the writers knew that the premise is supposed to be that a family of children killed their mother. The rest of the film is about a group of people who make jokes and have a very low standard. I just don't understand. A family of kids killed their father and sister. The kids are all in their own beds and being told to keep the car off the road. There is a scene with a family member getting in a car after the car is being crushed. The plot is not really made with any suspense.  This movie was so bad I couldn't believe I was watching it. I think I am the only person who can recommend this movie to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people seem to think that this movie is a film about how a woman makes it up to survive. But if she survives this life and survives the next, then her life is so much more painful and horrible than the previous life. If she decides to kill her husband, then she has to suffer the same misery as the previous ones. If the other character, the wife, dies, then that person has to die, too.  How can you expect to act so totally stupid and terrible in such a ridiculous manner as this? The movie only takes around 10 minutes to get the message. The film is just bad, no way better than the original films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was pretty good but I had some reservations. The story seemed to be a bit weak. But this is a movie without any real plot whatsoever. I had really low expectations. I didn't get the ending the plot line went to (probably about 200).  But I guess that's just the way the movie goes. There isn't really an interesting story and it goes nowhere.  But if it's a good picture then I give it some thought but I guess its just the same as a bad one. It's just a movie about a bunch of people and it's not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can, make a really nice time out of watching the movie and turn yourself into a complete idiot. Do NOT waste your time watching this movie. If you like it, go on a rant about it. I'll tell you, the plot is stupid, but it is amusing to have people make the jokes they needed to make. But, let's be honest, you can't see the humor in this movie, and you will spend more time watching the other crap in the movie. The acting is a pile of garbage and a terrible ending, but this movie is a waste of your time. There is an alternate ending to the movie, but since you can never get more garbage like this one, I won't be surprised when you watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even a horror film, but it's a completely stupid film: a horrible plot, bad cinematography, stupid dialogs and horrible acting... I was expecting a good movie, like "The Devil's Materiade" or "The Housewives", but instead of taking a movie like a big budget, it looks like "Pete's Town". When the movie is set, it's an empty building that looks like a little town.  I couldn't see it anyway, and the only reason I'd watch it was because I heard so many people complaining about it. It's hard to tell how the movie was filmed and edited. It was supposed to be a horror movie, but instead it is about a stupid premise that takes a lot of time and effort to actually make a horror video.  Also, the fact that there's no real monster in the movie makes me wonder why this movie was made. I think this movie is supposed to have been a horror-horror movie but instead just turns out to be pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, in my opinion, should not be shown as a film in a major museum. If I am one of the most knowledgeable people in the world, I'm certain my opinion would be different.  I'd have liked this movie. It's absolutely worthless. I mean the acting was OK, but it's not the first time, and it's also got bad.   The fact that this movie has been out for a few weeks in an international market is more than a coincidence. It was made at a very low budget, and has no artistic value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a film based on the famous "Hollywood War Story", but the production is really slow and you really just can't believe that they really made it. You only know that there are some parts where it was all about the military. But I don't care for a lot of scenes about how the soldiers were treated or how they had to fight. The military scenes are bad and a lot about how we went about the war, but they didn't have any depth. That's about as much as you can get, you don't really even know why people in the military died. And the characters were really stupid. A lot about the soldiers' feelings about dying are simply fabricated. There was a very bad scene with a very disturbing plot, as well as a very sad movie. A very bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was good. But the fact that there were so many people in the film was absolutely ridiculous. In the case of the first scene of the film, it would have been different. Instead of having five people and then they would have to tell who to kill off. Instead, you would have seen five of the people who killed someone in the first shot, and then those people would say, 'You killed me!' The only reason I'd like to see this film is because the ending is so ridiculous and terrible that it really ruined the film. I'm glad I saw the film but I wish I had never heard it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film at a video store in the old Brooklyn where the DVD had some problems. I did my best to look for some useful info. I just went into the library and picked out a bunch of DVDs that told me a couple of useful things. That's it. Nothing. The movie is a nightmare from start to finish. The best way to get a good laugh is to just go into a room and shut yourself off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed so hard during this film. I mean NO insult, really! I laughed SO HARD in this film; I never laughed so much!!! The acting was awful, the direction sucked, the camera was shot through my eyes, the songs were terrible, the production was horrible, and the ending sucked!!! I mean, the film only lasted 1 hour, but I guess that's not too bad. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only reason I'd even watch it is because it was so terrible that I had to sit through it. It was just a depressing waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horror film that I have never seen. The acting is extremely awful, the film just lacks intensity, and the acting is completely predictable and boring.  It is not even good to know what happened, or why the girls would sleep in a car. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is an almost pointless sequence that goes nowhere. We know the characters are good and will be able to make the storyline come alive but it seems to take until the final quarter to see.   The "plot" is entirely made up. There are no real characters, no actual plot. No actual characters. No real characters.  This is the worst part of a horror film. It is a story that is obviously not intended to be part of anything that will make us laugh. The best thing about a horror movie is the acting and a storyline that is supposed to be funny and which is supposed not to be ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie a couple of weeks ago and thought it was funny but really only half-fun. That's it. I think it's a very poorly directed movie, I have read some of the book, but this isn't even that bad. Not funny at all. At least I think the story is a decent one. In the end the characters are extremely ridiculous and the "story" starts out completely unbelievable. I felt like this movie would be a good one if they had some real talent. But not even that, just "worse," I'll admit. The acting and visuals are awful, and I really don't care too much about the story. I would like a better, better, movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a movie this movie was, I couldn't even think of the plot. Even if the plot was interesting, the plot is nothing special, like the other movies I have seen. If I was really a hardcore fan of the series, I would rather have a new DVD with all of the original cast in it (that's probably the biggest reason). I have to say, this movie is really bad, as I have never seen anything like this in a movie. The only reason that this movie made it was because of the special effects, and they are pretty terrible. It really doesn't deserve a repeat viewing because they are only good in certain situations and not the whole movie. Also, the only good thing that this is, is the soundtrack. If it was only for the audio, I believe that this would be a better movie, if only because they gave better score. I don't know. Maybe the makers had to make some money on the production, but what do we do, what do you know?   I will continue watching this movie until I find something interesting. But I hope this will be a last time. I would also like to see "The Castle" again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sequel to "The Mask" and it's bad. The first one was pretty good, but had some good moments. I expected some good ones here in this sequel, but they got nothing from this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got some of the oddest comments from friends. How, one would like to make a film about a cannibal who kills his family because of a dream he has of being rid of people. Why would one do this? I knew that the script was absurd but, to be honest, I really didn't care. The fact that they made a movie about a serial killer is disturbing but this film is only decent when it comes up with some sort of plot (as in the vampire).  What really annoyed me the most about this film was the acting. They're not the ones you would expect to find in a film.  Not only because the actors looked very good, but because they weren't that good. They are the kind that are just there for money. It is not their fault and not in a big way. This movie was an empty one, but it does have a pretty good ending.  I didn't buy it because I just couldn't care too. And if I did buy it, it would have been interesting. I mean, I wouldn't buy a movie that has been made a million times before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst of the genre, although I have seen far worse (and worse) from this genre. In a nutshell, there are no real plot. In the end, I can only blame this film for its lack of originality, which is a major reason I chose to recommend this film over a few months ago. I don't care how "hushed" these films are, but I'm not really that big a fan. It's simply bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is that a man in a hospital is suffering from a severe coma, and tries to escape this coma by trying to get a cure through an injection. When it is over, he wants to take the drug, but it is too late and he wants more than to keep his breathing. He goes to a mad scientist, who tries to cure him.  The mad scientist is a scientist who, in a different way, treats the man's coma, only to make him believe he has the virus.  This is, I think, the only serious case in history of a movie that has a premise like this. The fact that the scientist has the cure is beside the movie itself is just the fact that it's an attempt to make the movie a horror film. The ending, though, has some semblance of sadness in it, but the ending itself, is so much worse than a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were plenty of good movies in this country, and there are plenty of bad movies in America, but this one was horrible. I watched the whole thing with my wife. The plot is horrible and it got boring, and the characters are stupid. I'm not a huge fan of these people, but if I hadn't heard about this movie I would be completely out of luck to guess it was even that. But I didn't get bored, and I was the biggest fan of the bad part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely nothing. It is painfully pretentious and pretentious, especially considering the time it spends. While it is a typical American film made for the low budget, it lacks even the basic decency. The dialog is bad, the directing is lousy and the acting is poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible, I think if you are expecting something to be like this and you don't like horror films this one is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dracula" is an awful low budget horror film. The plot is completely ridiculous and completely uninteresting, and while it tries to keep it interesting, it simply falls apart. The acting is poor, and the "plot" is completely pointless. The story is about the director (Robert de Levese) who is "forced" to make the film about a couple of Nazi inmates who commit crimes by shooting victims...all of whom have been saved by Dr. Wagner. The whole scene is a complete ripoff of The Castle (as well as the first one).  The plot has been updated so many times, I have a feeling that this might not be the film that "Dr. Wagner" originally intended. I've never seen this film before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really bad but I found that it was really not interesting. I think the best part is the story, but I don't feel like they went that far. The characters are flat, there is no story. The story is not like a true thriller. The main reason why this film wasn't better was because it had a great cast and the movie was not as good as the other films this year.   I think if you are a film maker, you can put this one back. It's not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed. I was scared the first two minutes I saw and thought the last one could still be the best part. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars was because I didn't see the other parts, the only reason was that it was good. As it turns out, it is not. The story is about a mad cop who was so mad he had to shoot someone and was saved by a fellow cop. It's just a stupid plot, as usual, and you can probably pick up a few lines. The action was pretty good, but it just is not a very good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is awful. It's really bad that they decided to make this movie. I'd rather see a great movie like "Scent with Grace" instead of a boring one like this one. I wouldn't even call it a sequel but instead would prefer "S cent with Grace". I know this is a bad film but i know there are better things in this world. Maybe they had a reason to do this but that's not the case. It is the worst I've seen since "S Cent with Grace", even worse than "S World". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some weird stuff in this movie, but it's hard to figure out what it is. I found this movie at the very end of the film after it has done everything else. It's bad. There are a few moments that are very entertaining, but they just can't stick with it. There's a few interesting scenes, but after you get used to seeing the other actors you don't care too much. This movie is really bad. I really wanted to spend a lot of time with the movie, and I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made to death. I laughed like a teenager. My son didn't even look twice at it. It is like a movie made to have a 50 year old person and let the person play a little part on it. This is nothing short of a waste of brain power. You could sit it in your hands and have your mind blank. I tried to find the copy of this movie on video and had to give it up to me. You can probably laugh a lot, but even when you try to laugh it's not a good laugh. I thought I was going to have some fun in it but I didn't, and I never will have it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched it for several times and even after I "saw it on TV" I couldn't bring myself to care. It was horrible. I'm sorry I got to watch the whole film, but I have to admit I was bored. I just knew the premise and the actors from the beginning. The beginning gave me a little bit of hope. The ending was really bad, I don't care for it, but don't get mad, you are not one of the movie's actors. I saw it in a bad car, it was too slow, but it didn't help the movie. I don;s not a big deal. But, this movie is just the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was some kind of plot here but after 2 episodes that I was left hanging out in a very strange place - not sure what it was, but I'm sure its not. It isn't so bad, I didn't care to find out. But when it came around, in an empty room...   I'll see you, I'm not going to waste any more of my time with this one.  But it does make good use for a couple of shots of dead people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As soon as I got a chance to watch this movie, I couldn't even find out what was going in. It was a movie that consisted of about three to eight actors making a movie (and I mean we only watch it in the first 30 minutes of viewing) for a "B" rating. I mean, a movie's B rating is about being made and put into a standard movie, but what are the numbers of this film? I have a hard time finding it and it's about as pointless as it is a movie made for a living guy to do. I had to put in to watch it to finish it because I couldn`t find anything else. I would have to give this movie a 10 out of 10 because it can't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, if you haven't already seen this movie, don't be fooled.  This movie is not like the previous movies. This movie contains the same ridiculous plot and just as ridiculous scenes and a few pointless scenes, but it's worse because it's more likely to go out in the middle of a year and people are watching this movie at a local grocery store. This doesn't make any sense. Not even a decent movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i think you could make the case that this movie is so bad that i didn't even watch it. i'm a fan of science fiction with a love of space movies. this movie does not meet the criteria of a science fiction film, nor even a space movie. the only reason i even watched this movie was because of the original show. the rest of the movie is either not a parody, or is a dumb movie that was designed by an old sitcom. It has a really strange plot (which was never in the original TV show). the only thing i would like to say is that i would not watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, about a mad scientist who tries to make a "hollow" nuclear bomb, and his wife gets pregnant with a black female who tries out on an abortion. A really dumb plot and not really even a good plot.   The fact that it was a movie is the reason that it became so bad. If it was made for an independent film, then I have no doubt it would be an entertaining one. It was stupid.  The whole time in this movie, it was boring, and then boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just awful. If your a mature adult who is looking for more entertainment then watch this movie. This is horrible, but you have to be prepared for the entertainment that is being forced into your lap. I am not one of these people. There is absolutely nothing that I can stomach in this film. Avoid this film if you are in the mood for torture. You won't care if you don't understand what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only assume that this is the first effort by the director that has been responsible for the worst performance by any actor (to say that I didn't like this) in a film of his career. I've seen the last 5 films that this director has made and they all suck, especially when you consider the fact that the director is a complete joke. I thought it was amusing that the man who plays the father was playing the patriarch, but I'm sure he wasn't even in the same movie as the son. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie because of the name "Godzilla". But since I didn't know, I decided to look into it and try watching it as a horror.  I tried watching it in the beginning and found that I was really not enjoying the story. It's just plain terrible, but I don't think it's all that bad. It just can't keep up to it's trash-filled plot. I won't be buying it because of its horrible plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing to be proud of, but I wouldn't call it a horror film. There are many bad twists and turns that are predictable and nothing that would ever happen. This is the type of movie that is so bad it really doesn't seem to work.  The plot is about a bunch of college students who have been living under the influence of the devil to make a few hundred dollars money. When the student is in a cave and is surrounded by all the demons, he notices that a guy who is named Jack (Cavaliero) is going to try to get into the cave so he can get some money. We do not know much about the villain, which is obviously a bit strange. He obviously has a dark mask and hair and a mustache, but he's also a lot worse than the villain. He does something horrible to many of his victims in the movie. The scene that concerns the victim is pretty good, but it is just not worth watching.   There are a few decent scenes in the beginning and when the girl is introduced to the protagonist of this movie, but that's all it is. It's bad enough to make the viewer think that the movie is going over the top. But there are also some scenes in which the girl tries to keep the demon in the cave alive and she is successful. If the film is successful, I'm sorry to say that the protagonist will be killed. This could have been a movie about a student, like David Kagan and Dean Winters. But what the hell? The characters are pretty good and it is a shame that they should be let this movie get into a repeat viewing to avoid being laughed at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sort of film you'll find no one even willing to watch. If you want to see a movie that is at least good or if you want a film with some plot that was interesting, like the old "Journey" movies, you will not get it. The actors are awful, the direction is lousy, the action is bad, the characters are stupid and the story is stupid. I really cannot believe that this movie is called 'Spacejets' (or anything else) because the plot of 'SpaceJets' is really bad. And the plot idea is totally absurd. Even the most loyal fanatics of Spacejets, like me, can not believe that the movie is about spacejets! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is absolutely no way to make a movie, and if I'm to say, I'm just one of those people who loves bad movies, it's hard to be sure.  The acting is bad and the plot is extremely poor. I was expecting to find this on DVD, but it isn't. The dialog is so bad, and the actors are poor, it just doesn't make sense.  For this reason alone, I give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't much to watch but, it's alright to watch in a sleep deprived person. It's pretty bad when you have to go through all the pain of being sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhea, food poisoning, all the other things people go through during a horror movie.... and then get your blood running with horror... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst film of the year. The plot is weak, the acting is weak (the only two actors are OK), and the movie is completely uninteresting. It is OK to watch something like this to watch and learn about the lives of people. But if you have anything else to do, just watch it and leave it alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame because this movie has no storyline. Only a few plot elements are involved and the story is pretty poor. Although the scene in the first one scene is pretty funny (the first one with the female character kissing an old boy), everything else is terrible. You will never have to laugh. The acting was terrible. I have seen it many times and I could tell I don't recommend it. The first scene was just stupid. The rest of the film was pretty good but you couldn't take any real risks because the acting was bad. I would never recommend a movie like this one as a movie to rent because it is just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad I just skipped through it because I had no idea how I was going to get into it. I found out that there was a movie in the middle. I had been watching this movie for years and never really understood. When I finally found out it was one of those "traded" movies that were released in the mid to late 1960s and there was never an easy way to see what it was, nor a big plot. The movie was extremely predictable. It could have been filmed better. There are two endings to this movie. One of them is the ending that everyone is dead. There was no reason for the other ending. The plot has nothing in it. It has a very bad ending. It also seems like they just used one other character's name to make up the story, that they can't make up their own story. It really was only a few minutes into it, I couldn't care more.  The acting was really awful. Most of the actors seemed bored, as if there wasn't even a plot. There is a lot of bad lines. The story is just a bunch of people, who just happened, who will now die when you ask. The fact that this movie had a good ending is ridiculous. It just sucks. I only wanted to avoid watching it, but I couldn' help the viewer make up on their own.   My rating:  I gave this movie a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a tough time watching this film. The acting was horrible. The script was poorly written. It just didn't go for its own storyline. The movie didn't have any fun. My favorite scene was the scene where the priest was attacked.  The acting did not match what I remembered it was about. The scenes of the first two and the final two were the worst scenes of it. The ending is about as bad as anything I've ever seen in a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As for myself, I can't imagine why this has been so low-rated. It is just the only way I can say the movie wasn't that bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about an extremely stupid plot that is nothing but a cheap exploitation of its original idea. It is not funny, but is rather depressing. If you are into horror movies, this is no good. If not, then you'll find yourself sitting on the edge of the seat wondering what a piece of **** should do to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie for about 5 hours. I was expecting to be a film about the great Irish soldiers of the British Empire, and I thought it was about them, but I couldn't see how it was even connected to the 'Britons.' I was so disgusted by it that I had to watch it twice just to make sure I'd never watch it again. I'd rather not see it again if someone could make this movie look interesting and something to use for entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the idea from the beginning that this film would be a comedy-horror film, but I was sorely disappointed.  For starters, the camera is just like a camera, not like a real camera. They use an absurd number of actors in the film, they make a lot of mistakes with a completely stupid premise and then don't bother to make the slightest effort to make a convincing film, which is supposed to be the movie.  The most irritating thing about this film is the fact that the characters are so bad, they are the characters that have already been so good. The film can't possibly be as bad as a horror film, because the plot is so convoluted. They just use the same dumb jokes that have been used for the first 10 years of this film.  If you are interested in seeing this movie and want to see it, try something else, don't even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed at the entire thing...it isn't funny at all. A couple of times I've seen this movie on TV (and on a movie broadcast) and I've yet to see it. The plot is just bad. I have no idea what they are thinking when making this movie, and I don't really understand how they thought it up. It seems like it's the only thing that is going to change. I'm wondering if they even know what to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think that this movie was the worst example of the'slasher" genre that is currently available.  I am a really curious person. For a "slasher", there are some interesting things that just can't take place. For example, the characters are portrayed in a way that makes them all murderers! It just takes one minute to be murdered and then they get a second chance to kill. And, if they are killed, they get second chance. I just can not figure out why. They are not interesting at all!  But this is a horror movie, not a horror flick.  The only good aspect about this movie is that the film stars some very talented actors. I didn't realize who were the other actors, who could help this movie, I'll try to buy them.  But don't expect to find an actor who has this movie in her portfolio! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely stupid. I just laughed out loud, the whole time. It was absolutely unbelievable that the people who made this were so stupid, and that they had to make a movie about it. I give this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing that stands out as an exception to this very boring film. The film has one plot line, the very predictable "allies" go out of their way to help, and some "friends" from their own worlds show up, but there are not enough to make this movie a true "story". Most of the characters are either stupid or incompetent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard several horror films lately that I don't believe to be good... but to me they're all overrated. They're either pretty good, but not good enough, or pretty terrible. I was really hoping to see the excellent action sequences that we've seen in the films with a little bit more attention and intensity, but the disappointing ending didn't make up for it.   The plot has an obvious flaw that doesn't really help the story. The film stars an unknown young girl who has a sister and who is obsessed with a supernatural figure named "Bethany" and she is very powerful. But she doesn't have a connection with her sibling and she's too much of a bitch for her brother to care about her. I thought she could have fun in her role, but she didn't seem too eager to be seen. Her brother is obviously a part of a cult in a very old time where her parents used to live and what she is is is really a victim. The character, I guess, is an important person in the cult and so I have to wonder if she's part of some cult group. There was something about the cult being made into a cult. The whole film is about their sacrifice and how she has to become part of them and then how she is turned into a follower of this cult group and that was a bit upsetting. It doesn't make it into an interesting film - the character development is poor and the ending leaves something to be very disturbing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is bad and there is no way that it can be. There are some scenes that were really interesting and some that were amusing but the movie lost most of it because it doesn't go along with the plot.   The director, Michael Gilder, tries to make an indie film that is so predictable that it becomes a horror film and not a horror movie. It is not just bad but a really terrible comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Warmy" (1985) was a terrible movie: terrible acting, bad dialog, bad performances and terrible plot.  The plot is totally unnecessary.  An odd woman named "Watt" (Sheila McStice) is a cop with a little computer. She has a strange name (like a computer) and she has a very strange name too. And she is actually a computer? And the other computer is "W" (Elaine Schwarzman).  When the film was at the local video store, "Wush" was shown in its first 2 or 3 minutes. It is hard to tell what happened after that.   I would have recommended "Wondoor" to watch instead of "Wemly" (John Hustson). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible movie. I can't believe there is a reason this movie should have gone to the bottom of the box. It is a total waste of effort. You should be given the best place for this movie: a basement or the Internet. There is no way in which you can say the ending is worth watching. It just doesn't help you. I don't know how anyone could have gotten so badly confused. I would have guessed that this movie would have been one of those films where a woman would be the star, because she didn't know what she was going to do, and I wouldn't say it got any attention. It certainly couldn't have given the same importance that it did.   I've always wondered why I'm such a believer in the Christian faith, and it is just too easy to believe, because this movie is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, it's not exactly like the recent films with which I have just recently watched or the movies of which I've read. It's not like a good movie is always a hit. But this movie isn't either. It just doesn't have any depth. Nothing happens, nothing happens. And it doesn't really make any sense. I just don't want to waste my time on this movie. But, like my other films, I couldn't even manage to guess anything from this movie: why he did it, why he wanted to go to see it, what he had to see. How the hell was he going to do this?! You have to be really, really crazy, really, not crazy like the man that killed the man in the shower and for everyone else would be crazy to do it.  But the movie doesn't turn out to be scary at all. It seems to have an aimless direction. So if you're looking for a movie with some real scary and creepy people and a real plot, this is the place for you. But unfortunately, you can't even see it that way. This is just a cheap knock-off. So much of this movie is just stupid. I can't recommend it to anybody, even if you like horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title of the movie is a bit misleading, I suppose it is because of the film's premise. It's not supposed to be a horror movie, it's meant to be some sort of action movie. But the film isn't really scary, it isn't even scary if you're interested in going along the story. For example, you can't really think of yourself as a victim of this monster, unless you're a child. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just plain trash. If you find yourself bored with the most predictable story line (or the only ones that are there), I recommend you do not watch it, or see it only once if you are on a train. Otherwise, you must watch this crap so that you will never see a sequel like this. I think that most of the people who have this movie have either seen it at some point during the production of this film, and then have forgotten it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst movie ever made in my mind ever made. It is so dumb and stupid that it is a wonder how many people will actually enjoy it. The acting is so bad that it almost makes me want to kill the director. It seems like the director is on his phone all the time. It also has a story that is absolutely ridiculous. The movie is basically about some lady who is a nun and falls in love with her husband, but she can't figure out how to break the couple off. It contains so many bizarrely absurd situations that it was very hard for me to take the time to actually see it. This is probably the worst film of all of them ever made and I can only imagine that there is a copy of this in some school in England that contains some pretty pictures of some real people. If you can get hold of that piece of crap, I would highly recommend you avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a kid who grew up watching "The Wonder-Of-Nature" I couldn't understand the whole thing. There was nothing that made me love the show as a kid. They made jokes out of my childhood (with no regard for my 11 year old). When we weren't watching the show in grade school, I was pretty bored watching it and not able to laugh. The show had a ridiculous plot and even made me think that they were planning to go into a bunch of aliens living with the characters. This was extremely disappointing to me. The first scene was set in a small town with very little people and they were a bunch (which made the other actors think they were the aliens). It also had a stupid scene involving the two brothers (which never happened). This was such an absurd scene to me, and I had a bad feeling about the future of humanity in the future because it made the two stars look stupid. You don't see two brothers killing each other in a gas station. You never get to see the two sisters fight each other and then marry them for all kinds of marriage or relationships. They have nothing to do in the episode. I don't think this show should be put on the TV for kids. The acting was OK but there was absolutely nothing new. It just wasn't funny. The shows didn't have a lot of laughs and the acting was only decent enough to make me think this was a sitcom. My only two other shows were "The Incredible-Things" and "The Invisible Car." Both of those shows were pretty funny and I actually have watched it more than once because I've been on several shows in the past. Unfortunately, these two shows are no longer considered to be great. The TV show itself is far below the TV Show category. I had so much fun watching the two shows and the only reason I wanted to go back to watch the show after so long is because of the new series. When I saw "The Wonderful Time With Jimmy Logan" for the first time, I thought, "oh my god, there's something for me." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Cirionale," the movie starring the legendary "Trucárío," is really stupid, it's not worth watching. But it is funny, as usual, when it isn't. Some good actors in the movie, like the Cuban Cuban actor Juanito, should have been involved. But, in the end, they just don't get enough laughs. The movie is so badly done that it really doesn't even make it. The plot is basically nothing special, but you can guess how it came to pass. The story is very predictable. It's a little about a boy who gets pregnant and is going to Miami to get the wife, but it doesn't go much further. The other thing that got me uncomfortable was the acting, especially the part of the family that is constantly crying in the room, with their crying is not convincing. The acting was decent, but nothing else. I would rate this movie, at a 6 because it's OK for kids, but unfortunately, I think the original was much better than that. The fact that they had "an aunt" and a lawyer was a bit confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie at the mall when it was an unrated video. It was an hour long. I didn't like it. It just had a stupid plot. The characters were obviously not believable. I thought the girl who's in it was too annoying. The guy who's involved in the kidnapping plot is annoying too. The movie is really a bit of a b-movie. If you find out a movie that has a plot that is obviously stupid you will enjoy it but if you don't you will just flat out watch it without having any more purpose than watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has some of the worst lines I've ever heard in a Hollywood film. Not only in the lines, but also the actors. A lot of people are going to love this movie, but the characters just don't fit together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Killing" is a truly moron script, and it's quite awful. It's like a cheap attempt at an action thriller, as well as a really bad sci-fi movie. It lacks any kind of chemistry. The plot of the movie is a typical one, with the main character killing and being murdered in various ways (he gets caught, etc.). There is no real storyline. Most of the actors who are in the movie are in some sort of supporting roles, and the whole movie revolves around just about having a bunch of thugs doing a little movie. There are some very vague plot elements, but it's not bad at all. It does have some interesting elements. In fact, it is a bit interesting (the killer's head exploding on a tree in a tree), but the plot is lousy. There is nothing about the plot that has ever been worthwhile. The ending is extremely boring, and unfortunately, there are no redeeming aspects to the movie. The acting is also incredibly weak, especially the protagonist. I do not think that the makers intended to release this movie. They wanted to get a little bit of publicity from it, but the movie was so terrible that the producers just decided to release it. You don't want to watch it unless you don't like murder! The ending was very disturbing, as was the horrible dialog (some of which was not even written). But it's got to be true: this movie is no worse than the crap that came out of those kinds of movies. But sadly, that's all it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very disappointed with this movie. I've seen the film many times, but I haven't even seen the end.  The premise is very simple - if the person (with a gun) is going to try to destroy the person(with a person) with a stolen car... who is actually a cop and then the person is going back to prison to punish them. If the cop is a cop then he has a cell set on his head...  I was expecting a more interesting plot, but that was not the case.  You'd think that would be interesting and the ending was interesting too, but they really just ruined it.  For example, I won't even try to add any further information, but the story is so convoluted that it makes no sense.  I only wonder if it would have worked out if they had written a negative evaluation about it:  The acting was really bad. You never see actors with a body that shaped like these. You'll never find actors that are in a body so hideous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very skeptical of this movie. I was glad to see the film in theaters, and I thought it would be interesting for a young movie lover. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a dull, predictable mess of a movie. Although, if you've seen a movie made by Michael Jephrels, this is a pretty good one, and if you didn't see it in theaters you'll be really disappointed. I mean, they made an OK story and there was an interesting twist, but when it gets complicated it becomes a boring one.  This movie is simply bad, and it was a shame that this movie was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual, every film I read is complete trash. This film is no exception. It's very disappointing because it is poorly written and is not even well thought. This was one of the worst things I've ever seen. The story is a very bad one. It doesn't come close to the original and the plot is so bad, that I am forced to believe that the makers were just drunk with their writing. This is not the movie I expected, but I will admit that I had the opportunity to watch this. I was very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to rip apart a couple of scenes that are not there in the first scene. The beginning, where it is clearly intended to get the main story done, doesn't go nearly as far as the original. It doesn't seem like it would be worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was completely ridiculous - no reason. The plot and acting were not up to the standard, the script was slow, the performances were bad, the story wasn't very effective. I think this is the worst film I have ever seen. The only good scenes were the ones where the actors interacted with each other - great acting skills. The rest of the movie was just empty trash - the only good aspect in this film were the scenes in the background, not the entire story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always wanted to be part of the film "Drama of the American Civil War", but it doesn't have any actors. Only a few soldiers can be there. And the plot is simply stupid.  I can't find anything that makes any sense. The only thing that makes sense is the fact that it's a movie. I don't know why the "Civil War" is supposed to be a movie, I don' t really know if anyone is even remotely interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an over-rated piece of crap. I mean really a bad, stupid film (not funny) about a dumb story and stupid characters. There are many scenes where I wonder why they chose to put the scenes in the movie which is totally unnecessary and I mean this is a film with about 70 minutes of padding and a bunch of scenes that were filler. I've seen countless movies like this over the years, but this is too little to compare. If you are going to see this movie then you should avoid it. I give this film a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never done anything that made me feel like that film, but I do love an interesting movie. Unfortunately, in this one, there is just too much junk and a bunch of terrible acting. This film only has a few amusing moments, but there's little mystery in it. I don't know whether anyone actually got to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of "The Terminator", and I love it in the most cheesy way possible. But this movie just completely misfires on all fronts, not even having to make a convincing case for the "singularity" of the series. It's just a boring story, but that's all it is. The villain's got a really annoying face in the middle of the film that is reminiscent of old-school "Sixties" films, the only thing about this movie was that it was poorly executed.  The story is about a computer programmer (Robinson) who is on a job and comes to an empty office, with a bunch of computers that all make the computer a digital nightmare. There are a few scenes where Robinson is talking to his boss about some of his programs, but nothing that really matters. The other scenes are just about his personal life as a programmer, nothing interesting. It would be nice if Robinson had some lines that he could use in his story, instead of having the villain look like a monster for the sake of his character-design. There is a scene when Robinson's face is put in a glass case and it's filled with black coffee beans that all have coffee in their cups. Then there's another scene where the guy gets a new face, and its an interesting look of his face!  It's not even worth a second time.  Just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply bad. It has no plot, characters, the plot, nor any story. That's the reason why it doesn't come out of Hollywood. I don't think any big Hollywood producer would like to spend money to make a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is pretty bad.  They tried to bring a fun message with this stupid script, and it is bad. I don't really understand the whole story. I have nothing to do with the director. It is horrible. They must not spend the money. In my opinion, I find this movie just plain bad. There are some good actors, but they don't deserve their money. At the end, I think they should leave this movie, and their other movies. I want to make something intelligent like the famous Fishekin's, but that doesn't seem to be enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are decent but their acting is poor and the writing is just not good. It could have been done for a documentary but the movie could not be a documentary.   I give this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If your wife is expecting some action, you might want to rent this movie: The plot is basically that of a woman who sets up a sex-pocalypse, and her husband is in on it. However, there are only two supporting characters. The other supporting characters were basically wasted (this is a movie made in 1996, not a new DVD from the same production). If you want to see it for yourself, you can rent a sex adventure. But don't make it in the hopes of any real action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't even get into a movie with like this! What makes it bad are the actors, the script, the direction, the plot, the fact that it is not interesting or interesting! What's interesting is not the movie. The characters are just weak, pathetic people. In the end we just want to see "what happened to the girl in that movie?" and I don't think you can get that in a movie like this. It's only to make you think that this movie is stupid and stupid. It is not even funny, if there is no humour. It just seems like some actors who don't understand the plot but make it seem funny.  The other reason I'm not sure what the writer was thinking is, is that there are a lot of scenes that are not interesting (such as the "wacky" scene of a zombie that kills another zombie who is trying to find this girl). If you have a good brain you can find them but this is not one of the ones you'll find. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was pretty terrible film. It had some good shots and very good cinematography. But it's really bad. I don't care what movie it's based on, but it's not a great movie because it's weak. The acting in this is really awful. The plot is very weak and it has a really bad ending. It's just horrible. I didn't even watch this movie after seeing it. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like this. I'd have expected this to be good. The music is decent, but the cinematography is bad. It looks like a documentary about a murder or some kind of tragedy. There's nothing special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply an attempt to fill out the shelves of the DVD box. The first thing I had hoped for was a clever plot, and that it would do so would be a bit amusing. Alas it doesn't. It's simply a simple, stupid tale of an elderly woman who wants to find out her lost husband. What are they going to do to her husband? How will they find her husband and where they will be when they finally meet? How is she supposed to find that one? How can she know that? And how can they be separated? How are they supposed to make that conversation? Well, I think she gets her husband on a plane for a short while to rent her house. Then there are some guys that try to convince her of her husband's whereabouts (presumably) and that's just the end. Well, well, you know what it has to do? The plot of this movie is bad enough to make a decent movie, but unfortunately the characters themselves don't deserve it. A lot of the characters are horrible, but it's hard to make it believable that they are so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not surprised to find this movie a film with any real message behind it. For the plot it's absolutely lacking in any real substance. It doesn't have a plot, it doesn't really develop, it lacks any real meaning and the characters don't do anything new. The ending was predictable and made no sense. I thought the ending was silly. I was disappointed with how many times I watched it, the length seemed to make no sense and the story just didn't help. It was just another excuse to watch it and I'd rather see something else. Avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the previews for this movie I'm wondering what was it. I watched it on a couple of weeks and I watched this in my car. It was bad. It just felt like a bad horror movie. The story I watched was just about a teen girl with a crush who was obsessed with her boyfriend (played by Christopher Plassant), and that's all the more confusing to me. The movie is about getting killed by the boyfriend while pretending to be a high school girl, but then we learn she's in love with him and that she wants to kill him. Then they get mad and try to kill her...and she, in turn, tries to kill herself. I have read that some people have made this movie to show how ridiculous this movie is, and then that shows the fact that the movie is truly, stupid. If it weren't for the fact the movie could be a movie to watch for those with taste, it would be funny. It has nothing to recommend. It had some really good moments, but it just didn't make sense. I'll admit I did enjoy the "clowny" scene, but there really isn't enough time to give much thought to this film. I give this movie one of 4 that I don't even have a sense of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the video and it was not even funny.  But my wife said it was very funny. My husband said not at all funny. So I thought it was OK for a movie, at least. But my husband said it didn't really make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie seems to be the most pointless movie I've ever seen. It was horrible to see, I didn't like the characters or the movie but the movie itself was bad in many ways. I'll be totally honest. This is a movie that is so bad that it isn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is lame - it's a little bit strange, it seems to imply that the protagonist is going to meet some strange people who might be a "special" person and that she wants to be killed at the same time (and this is the only film that he has ever acted in). A few minor plot points appear but there are too many plot lines and they don't develop.  I thought this movie would be good if it had a good premise and plot twists. It didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film with a lot of bad acting (if there was any) but so, so, is it. I'm afraid of you as a movie goer. I can't see how it manages to include scenes with the actors in a scene or in the scene after the scene with their actors. I cannot believe they managed to use just the actors on the same scene, I'll bet that the camera was in their hands, making me jump into the stage and screaming in a few minutes. There are only a few small scenes that make this look interesting. And the whole movie is about an elderly man who is obsessed with a man who kills his beloved dog, and later kills himself. The movie is so boring that it has me sitting there, watching the elderly man do something to a guy who was probably his victim. I've got to think that if the acting was good enough, the movie would have been much better. Maybe, a few scenes of the dog's death would be interesting (a dog's head breaking open a window), but the film would have worked much better if they'd kept in a light-hearted mood. There was not enough for me to be impressed, especially the dog scene, which was a nightmare, if they made more effort.  I do hope that this movie doesn't get cancelled, but I'm sure that this is the worst thing that I have seen from a film that I've seen in a long time. I don't know who made this movie, but if you had to make a movie about a dead person and how the actor's life ended, you would do well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an insult to the value of this year's movie. It is ridiculous. The script does not even fit the plot of the movie. The story is the dumbest thing I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, even compared to the films that were released during the 70's! This movie was completely pathetic. The plot was completely ridiculous, I don't know why they would put a new cast onto the entire cast. I mean, if you've watched one of these movies, you know exactly how it goes, even though the actors are usually well matched. The acting was awful, and the dialog was terrible. The only movie I like is the first one, and its got me all worked up.  If you are looking for some movie to watch, I recommend watching "Karate", it's a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion on the bad movie has to be that it tries to "prove a positive review about movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no spoilers here. All I have seen of this movie is what i've seen for much of its life.  This movie is only a 2/10 in my opinion. It is simply a complete waste of time and bad acting.  I know what to expect from this movie. It's not going to be a good movie. However, if it's a sequel, perhaps some new direction to the story might improve it.  But what you want in a horror movie: The first one, maybe 2 hours to the end, of course. The second one, 1 hour. I know all the sequels, but none of them are even close to this level, which is a huge disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a complete failure on every level. For starters, there was no plot. It was only an old guy who liked cats and cats were introduced to the movie by a character that he'd never heard of. That made it look like an odd story. If you read this in a movie like a big studio made flick, then you would not want to see this film. It seems to have been a movie made purely to waste money.  For starters there was nothing of substance. That was, on the whole, a movie about a big boy with no hope. Not really a horror movie, but just a dumb guy pretending to have a girlfriend. I have been watching movies for over a year and this was by far the most bad I have ever seen. There was nothing but a complete waste of screen time. I only saw two or three of the scenes in it, and the only thing I saw was the final scene which had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, with the guy kissing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is that the "Star Wars" franchise is going to try and break out into the mass market for children. What do they call a "Star Trek" movie?  The "Star War" movies were obviously made to be a comedy, the plot was simple, and the characters were amusing but had little depth. The "ZOMA", on the other hand, had much more depth and story to this point, and was just not funny, especially in the early parts. The story was weak to begin with, the acting was poor, and everything in it was simply ridiculous. The only real highlights were the plot, the action sequences, and a few funny scenes. But the only "real" part was a plot, which was far removed from the rest. It would have been a far better story if the movie had started in the "Zeta", which was a more realistic space planet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad, especially when the plot is based on the premise that all lives are human, so the whole plot is ridiculous. The film starts with a very interesting set of characters, unfortunately they have all got their skeletons broken and the script has so many holes in it, the characters don't really develop. And while the actors are pretty good, they seem to get a life in this movie.  I would consider that it's a horror film but unfortunately it is not scary enough, although I will say it is OK for a horror movie, but this movie is just crap and I don't recommend to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a disaster of an attempt at trying to put it into a film with a decent story, which is exactly what happens with a sequel to this film. They just used some of the old elements from previous movies to bring in some new twists, and just did a bad job in creating something that is no more than an excuse to waste our time on an uninspired film.  The plot is absolutely nonexistent, not even the plot of the first two sequels, and this film has been completely botched on any level. The characters were completely inept, and the movie is almost a rip off of a stupid movie from another. The only reason I chose to watch this movie was to see a sequel of this movie: another stupid movie.  I can see a movie that has a very good plot, but it's just the poor quality of the story that ruined it. It really didn't help this movie. I have seen better films, and even worse. The movie is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was nothing I've seen in my lifetime. It is just another episode of a failed "movie" that is, or has been, and is more about showing a bad idea than anything else.  It has been reported by many people that this movie was meant to showcase the true story of the first and final time. This is absolutely false. In fact, this movie is about a bunch of people on a train (or the "station") who are trying to stop a terrorist. A terrorist has stolen a bunch more cars and started robbing. (I think the movie is called "Crash.") Why would they suddenly want to stop him when he is at a position to make a lot of money? It was made so ridiculous and stupid that people actually got caught in it, because we all knew that it would be impossible to stop it.   I'd rather try to find out why they decided to make it. But I'm not going to do that.  I'll give you some more. This movie is obviously about a drunk guy who is drunk and trying to make money. His wife doesn't care if he tries to stop this guy, but instead wants him to do what he does in his mind. Why is that? Why would he have that? You are going to stop another drunk guy? How did he get that? How is he doing it? Who? We just went to see what the drunk guy was doing. That's not even a couple of people. It's just one guy who we just saw that was supposed to make us think his plan to stop all the terrorist.  The guy's wife is also drunk. She's really, really, REALLY crazy.  This is ridiculous, and I cannot believe it was made for anyone. There are very few people who can actually make that point as to make me believe it actually happened. I would have a good idea on what they meant to make the movie. (That is why they wanted to get people involved.) I would also think they were trying to bring a bunch into it by making the movie seem like it's a horror movie: there are a lot more people on this train, and you are going in to make some money in a few days.  Why don't they just make another movie with more of their guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is, as usual, completely uninformed. It's only been described as a movie starring a group of actors who are completely incompetent. The only thing that could possibly help this movie is to add a new set of actors (which we have already) to portray the victims of the crime, and it could be a pretty cool performance. Sadly, the film does nothing of the sort. Even the victims have been reduced to mere pawns. No matter how good an idea that the film is, it is simply bad. We only wish that they could do better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You could probably call this "Superman 2: The Insurrection". In this movie, it is only the heroes who try to take the world into a gigantic battle, and the villains who don't. The "heroes" should never be allowed to do this, because it is so bad that it's just impossible to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days later a young girl in a hospital named Jane Hartman shows up as a patient, she becomes obsessed with Jane and wants to have her father killed.  Well, it is sort of an odd thing. Jane Hartmann is a famous actress, she's a famous person who is known as the wife of another famous person, her dad had a part in this film and his wife is famous as a famous woman. So, Jane Hartzman seems to be the person who hates her father and has a penchant for her father's son. She wants her father to make up a creepy story for her, she wants him to die and she wants to kill him. It's so bad it's funny when you consider she's so creepy and sadistic.  When I heard the ending I was just so glad I'd missed this movie. It would have been so much better if I was bored with Jane Hart's horrible performance and not put the little bit in my brain. I give this one some credit for trying to make a comedy that's so stupid that it never gets out of my mind. It still sucks, but at least it was an interesting one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have seen since I watched "Mush" on HBO. In both seasons, it is a bad waste of time, but if the movie was good I would have given it an 8/10. This is just bad, no matter what you may think about it. It is absolutely nothing like a movie I would like to see. It was horrible, so it had to be a bad grade. What an awful plot, what a bad director, and what an even worse director. This movie was really bad, it made me regret even getting a chance to watch it. I am really sick of the whole "Mysteria" thing. The director, John Boose, did nothing but try to make it into something that is not really something it could be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never had a movie with that kind of plot. It is painfully predictable. I am glad that I am not the sort of person who would go to see this piece of garbage! The ending, not much more than the first, leaves me feeling like I was going to kill myself. I have the best laugh in the entire movie, however, as I sat through it, I kept wondering if anyone else could finish it. I would like to give this film the same rating as the last "Virgegar", but I'm not sure what they would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film from the 'Lassie MacLalonde' documentary on a previous Christmas day, and when I found it, it had to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. It really just doesn't even come up to the standard. I can't believe anyone could actually make this film. It had no depth. It wasn't made out of any particular circumstances except the fact that it had a "high" rating. I would have sworn off the film with a boll of salt. The acting was really bad, and I wonder if they even had a sense of humor. The only redeeming quality was the camera footage. But the camera work had been awful. No one was able to make the film look good. The story had no real story or motive. That alone could be the greatest shame. And, after such a dull and silly film, it did seem amusing when John Deasy made his "Lassiette MacLondois" debut. It was interesting, but it was bad it wasn't true. It's hard to imagine how they could even have made this movie. The two brothers seemed more like they were making a documentary at the same time. And the film had a lot of dialog. In my opinion, the only thing it had that didn't turn into a "Losses MacLiette". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in a theater, and then I watched it on Netflix, and I couldn't believe it was a movie. I just couldn't care how I watched this movie. The acting was awful, and the plot was so confusing and had no end. In the end I just sat there and let it go. The problem is the endless plot-line which I could only tolerate because I like movies.  I just can't believe the plot is supposed to take place in a fictional village where some of the villagers have killed some people to create a village, and some of them are now in the village where there are a lot of people, and there are some more people, one of whom is a priest. That's not really a realistic premise. The end is a bad ending and I didn't think it made sense in itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. I am a pretty tough guy, and i'll fight any type of enemy for sure. But this movie doesn't give me enough time to finish it. I won't take anything away from this, but if you enjoy the film as a comedy, then you'll probably be bored after the credits come out. And it does not make any sense. Some of the characters even appear to be having sex with people, but that was done for shock value. The only good thing about this movie is the casting of the three lead actors, who are pretty good actors in their own right, but the rest of the cast are pretty bad. Even with the famous Chris Farrent in the lead role, this movie just doesn't make any real sense. If you have some sense of intelligence, and you have the patience to wait for the final day and have this movie ready to film, you will probably lose interest in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was stupid and pointless. Some good actors in there were there (some of which I liked) but when you get to the final showdown they are very poorly written, with bad writing, bad acting, bad direction and horrible script. I was very disappointed when this movie was finally released. I had the option of watching the first episode or the entire movie (I'm sure that was my choice) but I didn't want to watch it. I'd give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was about a bunch of dumb boys who decided to turn into a serial killer. They decided to try their new methods of killing as the main feature of the movie. They were a bunch who were trying to make a 'gang of thugs.' However, the movie was horrible. Most of the scenes consisted of a bunch with only one person and he used the new method. They had so much in them, like a gang of guys, who were the main characters of the film. Most importantly, the girl was a pretty annoying character, that she was the main character who killed everyone. Most viewers just see her getting a lot of attention from a bunch and then leaving her in the hotel room after her had killed the rest of the world. The 'dance' scene in the movie doesn't make the scene interesting. The guy's acting wasn't good. It had a plot, but it wasn't developed. Most people just expect a scene to happen and then he dies. I think it was intended to be a thriller. The ending is horrible, it doesn't have a plot and doesn't go to that point. There are a few funny moments, but not enough to make it all worth watching. I would say that it is the worst movie of 2015, in terms of cinematography. The movie had too much in it to make something worth watching at all. If it wasn; it would be pretty good and worth watching but didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not like they would make a movie to "prove" that aliens have taken over. This is just another example of "The Good Guys" getting into another, even worse movie, than the one the movie was supposed to be about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this film is about 3 of the worst movies I have ever seen in a movie: 1. The first act was really scary and this is the third film I have seen. The second act of the first film had two people standing in one room. The third movie had just ONE person standing in a room and walking through the hall. I just hope I will never watch a movie that has this lame structure. I wish the producers would have learned from this when they made the first Twilight movies. I don't know if this movie is better than Twilight. It's pretty sure I will not watch the next Twilight movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a film for the masses, and it's got nothing to do with the genre, but it's not quite good either.  The plot is pretty straightforward and you can see it right as the beginning of the film with a brief description about the "The Newest of America", but as the film goes on it becomes a convoluted little tale with many strange twists and a plot which is so convoluted that it has no real purpose. The problem with this film is that you can only see the beginning with a few minutes and there are no significant parts that are done, leaving the viewer feeling as if they were going to sit through it forever.  It does manage to have a decent cameo as the mother and daughter, but only really so when it comes into the middle.  What is the end? Where was the last place we saw them?  I won't spoil the story of the ending, but if you are a serious movie buff then you will be left feeling a little bit bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the original and this one was really weak in its first sequel and its second installment. Its just too long and it doesn't have much in common with the first. There was nothing to do in either of these, aside from the usual story line and its lack of any substance, as well as the ridiculous acting of the "bad guy", which was really only a few minutes of time. The reason that this was rated a 7 instead of 10 is that it was not original and had the same characters in the first movie and was just a few years later, so it could be taken as a remake or even a sequel of the first and not be original. The ending was disappointing. And while it was good for a few scenes to finish up, it didn't really add much to the story line. I have to mention the bizarre scene in which a guy is killed by his mother (as the mother, no less than his father) and then later stabbed by a sniper rifle, and the horrible scene of the car crash. The best part of this film was the scene where a guy killed his wife, and his wife killed the father in a separate scene at the beginning of the film. I think it's because you can't really feel like it when you're making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts with a creepy story (of which I never heard of before), then suddenly becomes a horror-movie by the end. The problem is that the story is totally incomprehensible, the gore is lousy, the ending is lousy and the acting is bad enough to keep the viewer from wanting to see it again. If this is the case, let me see a movie: "Kushka and the Lost Girls" (I remember that movie, but sadly never bothered to watch).   My two friends, Chris and Jaimie, were absolutely terrified by the final film. Jaimies takes his job as a computer-generated camera operator in a very serious, high-budget-movie production and immediately starts asking us to see this one again. So they decided to rent it anyway. If you are going to rent a horror movie, I suggest you rent a "KUSHKAANAN". It is not that funny. In fact, there is no joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a shame. There are some good scenes here but the movie just does not reach a quality level. It feels like it was a low budget film for the big budget Hollywood. Not only a waste of money but not a good movie either. In conclusion, the movie was horrible in my opinion. The whole movie is about a guy having sex with his girlfriend (and wife) and what happens next.  The movie has too much of a plot to make up to work. The girl is the mother of his son. This is not a typical movie to watch. The movie is nothing like a typical movies, it is simply a horrible waste of time and I don't really see anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst of all fake horror films I've ever seen. This movie was like a movie made of "Shiver" in the 80's, "The Host", "The Monster", and "The Devil's Grinders". But unlike the others, this movie has nothing to do with the characters, characters, and even their lives. They are nothing more than caricatured, boring, dumb, and dumb actors. They even give a "B" grade. The acting isn't even as bad as the "Shivers" from the previous movie, and there are some characters like the characters from the first one, such as the monsters of "The Dead Zone" and the vampires from the other movie.  But there are so many things in this movie that make it a completely non-suspicious film. The characters are so horrible, the plot is so lame, and the director tries so hard to make things up as opposed to making it believable.  The ending of the movie is very unsatisfying. What it has to do? Some of it's characters are better than the ones in the first movie, but there are very few things to make this movie interesting. The ending does seem to be slightly original. But the rest is so terrible that it's hard to say that it really was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual, the plot becomes a joke at times, it is very predictable and it just doesn't work for me. I give this film a 3 on a 1, and I find myself agreeing with the film-makers who chose to film this film because it was funny. But what happens? There was a plot? Who cares. I can't wait for the plot to be filmed and put in a movie, and you need to know what that plot was. The film-making is horrible. There is no way that it can make this film. Why did they put this out? Because, really, if you don't have much patience, you should see it anyway, because it is predictable and a huge waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad that it is no wonder that this movie will be forgotten. What an embarrassment to me. Myself alone (and others), I'm sure of what would happen if we made this film: the first and the second sequels of this awful movie. I find that these two movies are about as boring as I could imagine them being made today. In many ways, this film is even worse than the first one. I have seen many documentaries films that are actually pretty good (for instance, "The Lost Continent"), but this one doesn't fit the criteria of that type. That is a sad fact.  I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm more embarrassed by this film than by most people I know and don't even know why. For those of us who care to watch more films, it was a disappointing choice. The plot is so weak, it can't even be called a plot. The dialog is just a collection of random trivia spiced with the occasional sarcastic, unfunny jokes.  A shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this film was intended to be a depiction of some sort of "sus" or cult, I didn't think they would do it so badly. It's just so bad that we can't really blame it for the bad acting. This isn't a bad comedy, although there are a few moments that I found annoying, particularly when a priest, who obviously didn't know who he was talking to in a movie, spoke on a phone (with a different "sound" than the actors in the film, i.e. a telephone call). Overall, the movie is a depressing waste of time. If you didn't mind the obvious problems with the film-making and sound-making, then watch the video instead of wasting your time with the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I am not the biggest fan of the movies (I think most of my friends and family would not understand why I would like this movie in the first place) this one was extremely disappointing. The movie had some of the acting that was really good in the early 00's when I first discovered the film. However, after about an hour, it suddenly became a completely pointless plot. There is nothing in the movie that you can feel even remotely happy with.  Not only is the ending that horribly predictable but the acting is just flat out bad. I was really hoping for a short film like "Lecora" and the fact that I don't have a copy of the DVD helps to make that point even more.  If you are not a casual fan of Hollywood films (or anything else) don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst type of film I have seen in this whole movie genre. It does not make any sense. I give it a 1 because it is not fun. The story is bad. And there is no action. There is no laughs. The characters are not funny. The acting is bad, except for one guy. The scene at the restaurant is terrible. It is completely unnecessary. All of the scenes could be better than in the original movie, except the one that does the most fun. This movie was made just for money. I cannot believe it. It should have been made to be a film with comedy. It needs more. I have never seen one more bad movie. The director should get a job so he will know how to make movies. I recommend to avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a piece of junk to make in the first place. The plot is very weak, the characters are terrible, it does not meet the expected conditions in the world. There is no chemistry and very few shots are done by actors, there is no reason. There are only a few scenes that are very funny but they are not even funny in the small part they do. The acting is quite bad and it does make some parts funny but the dialog is bad. It is about as bad as a movie could get.  The last thing is the whole thing. The movie is about a couple who have made the best wishes for their lover who is very poor and in search for someone to help them. There can be nothing better than that, if you like a big party. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst film i have ever seen. The acting is dreadful, the music is horrible, and the whole plot is just plain bad. I was tempted to watch the first part in a dream, and after having seen the movie, i decided not to.  I am really glad to see the first 2 parts after spending the whole time watching the first 1. If the film was any good, it would be a masterpiece. Unfortunately, this movie is no such thing. It is only a pretense of it's intended to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, although very good, has really been an amateurish attempt at a plot, as is evident in the story and in the editing. I was expecting some kind of action to happen, but it had no effect. The acting was completely terrible, which didn't have any real message or significance to the story. It was just a bunch of people shouting and shouting and then doing nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After being inspired by the aforementioned "Inspectors" video, I decided to watch "Fatal Attractions" the same weekend I was watching "Inquiry." Inquiry's premise is that people will die to be attacked by a strange animal in order to test a human body, and it's just so bad. I watched it for a minute before realizing that it was just plain stupid. Not even the actors could keep themselves up, and even the sound was weak. The director, who was obviously trying to make a point with the plot, couldn't care to give the slightest thought to the characters' lives, but this movie is just awful. The movie is about a car accident which kills a young man who kills himself in a car. That car accident happened a couple months before I was a teenager, and the plot of the movie involves a car getting a little wrecked as the car gets passed on. The end of the film is about people getting caught in traffic and turning into a vehicle which ends up killing their friends. Even though the film had a good message, the script was poorly developed and the dialog was bad. The characters were too one dimensional to make the story realistic. A lot of stuff was obviously scripted. I think the director should have written a positive review about an awful movie: 1/2 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen the movie since. The plot was completely incoherent. I thought it was silly to assume a man is guilty of the killings in the book. The acting was horrible.  I had to laugh at the first scene when they put into a scene a guy trying to escape. This guy was screaming and making all kinds of noises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a believer from the beginning. I thought it looked a little bit "fun" and had a decent plot. But this movie was completely disappointing. Not only did the plot and cast fail to do so but the characters were flat and uninteresting. Also, it was obvious that they were acting like puppets.  If it were an isolated movie, there would have been some interesting and original characters. However, they were nothing but a collection of cardboard characters. The ending seemed to be about making a joke and only a couple of jokes were even so funny.  I was a little disappointed by this movie and was really angry with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're one of the most overpaid and pretentious movie producers in the history of cinema I pity you. If you have read a positive review about  You get a two stars on the back of the DVD cover. The plot has been so badly executed that a movie should not be filmed at all, it should not exist.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen better films in my time but I would never give this movie a chance to be seen by anyone. The story is a waste of space. If you wanted to see a documentary about a failed love, this would be your answer. It could have been a funny or humorous documentary on one of those failed loves, but it does not provide the story. The movie was like a bad MTV show or like a slapstick cartoon, but not something to entertain. The humor is only the result of a weak script and a bad production. What was it that made this movie fun? I cannot even remember the name of the actors. A couple times I heard someone say "that's a lot of money". If you're wondering if that was real, I think it is just a bad joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's got to be really frustrating that the movie tries to convince us that this one was real and it was meant to be a documentary. But if you take the time to look at the "real" documentary, you realize that the filmmakers didn't even know that the people involved in making it were involved in the actual documentary process. They made the movie without bothering anyone, and we know it's not an accurate portrayal of what really happened at the time. The film attempts to pull the same sleffily fictional nature of the documentary into the documentary which never was.  I have to say that this movie was really bad. I thought the story was fun at first, but after the third and fourth time, it just wasn't fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess my friend's wife caught it. I'll be honest with you and say I didn't even watch this movie, but I heard some dialog when I saw it and it got me up. Then it ended... on a whim. Now if you're a little curious, I'll tell you about it. The characters don't talk. The director and producer just use what's convenient to the characters, the plot, and the acting. I guess the actors thought they would be selling their tickets but they were wrong. Then there's some very minor stuff that happens, like a naked woman getting murdered. That's pretty tame, if you get a chance to find it and watch it twice. But I didnít see the ending, and I can only assume the movie was completely blacked out.  In conclusion, it's a bad watch. The stars are very small, the action is extremely slow, and it doesnít make any sense. The dialog is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how to take this movie. What I did was to think that this is going to be the movie that made me feel sorry for my college friends. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was terrible. The fact that it is a comedy is what is supposed to make the movie funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What really happens is that the only person that manages to pull this movie out from obscurity is the Director, Gary Storro, who tries to pull the life out of this film, but that means you have to turn to wikipedia's wikipedia of course so you can't believe what they're doing in the movie. In fact, I had the feeling that it was made up of whole numbers of lines that were completely and utterly pointless.  The first thing that comes to mind when I read this movie is the bizarre name of the movie: "TINY" I guess. If I knew it was, I would never have guessed what happened.  A movie entitled "Tiny" is not only strange but pointless. I was expecting "BING TINY". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just horrible. There was a few very good scenes but the acting wasn't that good and the characters weren't that great. The problem is that it doesn't make any sense. How did the other actors play? And how did the characters in the film act? I didn't really think they had any chemistry. I felt like they were going out of a parallel universe. There is a man who has a red hat that had the eyes of a man and you could see his face in a computer. Why is that man still not wearing his hat and body in that camera? The plot was pretty good, but it got a little tardy towards the end. I don't really agree with the story. It makes no sense to me and the dialog isn't convincing enough. What was the man going to do in the last moments of the movie that had him try to steal the girl? I don�t understand. What were the scenes in the movie and who was in them? I can only assume that the man was involved in a relationship with someone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts out with a pretty good ending...but after some time, the plot seems to go downhill. It becomes a melodrama that really doesn't go anywhere, nothing interesting happens, and the end is anticlimagic. It's bad, but not bad enough to ruin the movie. This is the movie that should have been titled, "Wickedness!". This movie is far worse than the real thing, but sadly that doesn't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that this movie was created in Hollywood. It was a piece of trash... a very poor effort at making a very bad movie... and it looks like a bad show. For example, I was really bored watching it. There was a few things that made this movie interesting, like the story about how the movie starts and how the story progresses, but I could only believe that they made the movie in that way. There were some interesting things but when the movie was in the middle of the movie, I couldn't really figure out what would happen. The ending and some scenes were quite good, but when I just watched it I was confused and didn't have much fun. Some of the dialog wasn't even that interesting, and I didn't like how there wasn't some way to jump on the stage to help the hero. The end was extremely weak, I didn`t find the final storyline to make me care about it. I think this movie is about to be replaced with a lot of movies that were much better, but it will probably be the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really not a fan of this sort of movies, particularly since they are only a few decades old and have only been partaking for 20 years. But I did not like this one until I was sick. It is nothing more than an attempt to resurrect an old formula which would have been so much more effective on a different era. This one tries so hard to emulate the original formula, but just ends up failing, because of its "tendering" of this old formula.  And for that matter, this is an exception in the world of film noir, and that is the reason that this film gets more respect for attention than it does any other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, there are two things that I can conclude about this movie: the fact that it is not actually a horror film, and the fact they decided to write a bad story instead. This movie, is not intended to be scary, which is more than usual for horror, and it fails to achieve any other qualities in an awful way. As it stands, there is nothing to this movie that was good. There is nothing interesting. The acting is terrible, with some mediocre dialog, and most of the dialogue is just plain awful. Even the story is pretty bad, and they can't make a sound like "An angry man!" to work, because this movie is full of it. But there are moments where you understand that this movie was probably written before this movie even came out. Some examples are: the first bit where they go into a house, and there are screaming and screaming and there is a fire in the kitchen. The scene where a girl gets attacked and killed by the guy by screaming and then throwing the man's face into the mirror is one.  This movie doesn't really go for any of the genre of horror (horror, thriller), it doesn't manage to scare. It's a bit disappointing that it even manages to be a horror movie, with nothing else to make this film scary (or any horror film for that matter). The plot, at least the beginning, is pretty good. But the rest of the movie is bad, in a way that you just do not care about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really awful - an amateur (not really amateur at all) attempt at a "wack" movie with a little bit of gore.  What is the point of this film? I think, if you've ever seen one of these things before, you might not care that much. The plot is stupid, and the movie is not so great. In my opinion, it is extremely bad. Although the acting is OK, the acting (especially the dialog) is bad - they are not believable.  I gave it a 2 out of 10, I think it would be much better if they removed the "wacky" theme - if they would get a little more from the characters. It is obvious that the director, or whoever made the movie, doesn't understand why these people would care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was cute and fun in some parts, but there were very little plot twists. For the first hour, it got completely lost in a comedy with a bunch of teenage teenagers. Even worse, the storyline slowly morphed into a very silly, ridiculous situation. For example, a young girl is being abducted for her father to bring back her boyfriend and another boyfriend who is getting lost by the other guy. When the girl is rescued, there's a scene where she's back on her parents' lawn, where she discovers that her father has lost his eye due to an accident. This scene quickly becomes silly as it just goes nowhere, and ends with a sad ending.  I guess what I say in this review is the humor, but I think there was a lot of humor in this movie, but the humor isn't that great. It's just bad humor, and not funny at all.  Overall, the movie has some pretty good performances, but it wasn't worth the effort. I give this movie a 1.2, but 1.5 is still too high. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can believe, this movie was an utter b-movie, with an utterly ridiculous plot and very poor cast (except for the supporting characters who were nice in most of the way), a complete lack of action, and the annoying, annoying script. It is not even the worst movie in Hollywood history, but it got a little bit better. But I think that's all the time. The whole cast were bad, the film was bad, and, most importantly, the movie sucked at the end. I had fun with it, but I didn't get to know anything. I'm sorry for the idea of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In spite of everything I love this movie, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  My rating is 8/10 (which is partly due to the fact that this is a movie meant for kids, but this doesn't occur with any real kids. The first thing that bothered me was the fact it is such a huge waste of real time, which could have easily gone on for a couple minutes and a really awesome, sexy, unforgettable sex scene in the end. The second thing is the fact the movie was directed by some very stupid chick, who couldn't figure out what a movie was supposed to be. Even if the movie is a teen movie, it's still a stupid, awful, stupid movie. It can't get past that, as you'd have to be a teen to make this movie.  I can't wait for this movie to go on and make itself famous, but I'm sure it will get past "Hits" anyway. It'll be the same with "BJ1", and it will be so much worse.   This movie was terrible, but unfortunately so is every movie that has a female protagonist. There are plenty of women who can play the role of the girl, but there are not enough of them. There's plenty of other roles for men, and they are all pretty cool. There is no real woman or man that has the character of the female protagonist that we know would ever fit in that role. And that makes it hard for a viewer to even make it to the beginning.  You would need to have some of these ladies be able to do something about this movie: I don't think she could outplay "this movie", and the story would probably be as boring as the rest of it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on the TV and was expecting it to be OK. But it's quite the opposite. It's awful. It is the equivalent of a movie made about a cartoon of a female teen in a teen's dream. Why is there even a male or a female in this movie? Why is it made? We're only 1 in the movie and not even the girls who act there.  There are some great actors in the cast. Unfortunately, they just don't seem to act.   Please don't waste your time, rent the movie: if you decide to watch it, don't give this movie 5 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the biggest one ever of a lame movie with a poor cast. I was hoping to be a big star like Robert DeNiro but I think I just got sucked into this one. I don't have even remembered what he was doing in this film. The story is a poor one, but they could've cast him in more movies and we wouldn't have seen him in this one! I don' t remember what his character was doing. It is almost like he couldn't care or read a novel or something.  The plot is similar to a bad vampire movie, but it was worse than it was that one. The director is stupid for making this movie and he should've made something better than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a rip-doll plot, what a terrible film, bad performances, bad writing, horrible lines, bad accents, bad dialog, bad supporting, bad direction, bad sets, bad special effects, bad sound effects, a bad plot, bad plot. What a bad director, a horrible script, bad film, and bad directing. What an awful film is that it was not even remotely interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is truly the worst film I've ever seen. The plot is boring, the characters are ridiculous and the ending is just plain stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was tempted to buy this movie because I found it funny. However, by watching it, I felt that the story did not quite make the most of a funny movie. What was the story? If you're a fan of funny movies and are familiar with one of these kinds of movies, then you'll probably enjoy this movie but will not find a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was the most disappointing movie I've seen.  I thought it was an alright action thriller but they were just going on and "a bunch of guys" getting a blow at each other when the cops come in so they were like two dudes having a fight and the cops are in it along with them. You can see it in the early scenes when the cop is walking towards the scene.  Then they bring out an army to do the thing when it is just a bunch of friends having fun while "a couple of guys".  I just couldn't take this for a "action" movie. You just can't make movies like this, it's just like a cheap movie.  The biggest problem is the fact that the ending was done, no one thought it would be that late and they just couldn`t make that connection.   They are still a lot of people, so it would have been an interesting ending if they were going to get to the cops and the city of Rome and not just have them shoot them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was boring. It was predictable. It had a very poor cast, most of which were the actors who were trying to make a star, not the characters. I found it extremely boring and did not even watch the rest of the movie. The ending was too convoluted. I felt like I was going to be watching a series of awful characters, then I would see the first part and then just switch to the last, then a small part of the second part and I would have nothing. The movie seemed to be a piece of cheese. I did not know what it was, what the actors had to do. The story lines were predictable, and the ending was so horrible. I was looking for something that would be interesting. This is not that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with a bunch of college students getting drunk and then they get arrested and then it slowly becomes a movie with no end and no end. There are no real story, no real characters, no direction, no dialogue, no acting, no story. Not only that it has no real ending, but if you've read it, you'll be begging for a sequel. I would recommend having the guy who played the lead in the original show put this movie in his own hands and just laugh. There's no reason whatsoever why this movie is even a movie. It's a big waste of money and time and so totally pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got over this movie via friends I can't even begin to describe the terrible direction. I'm glad the other people in this movie were so brave as to stay away from the awful direction they were making. But for the rest of us, the movie was painful to watch. It was only one person in the movie who was so courageous to save the other and he couldn't do anything for her. He was the only person who was in on his side when it happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Mysteroid" is the worst movie I've ever seen. There isn't enough plot, story, or interesting things to fill it, and it's just a ridiculous plot. The characters are really annoying, even though they are obviously in love with the other person, as they are supposed to be mad men. There is really no chemistry between them; the only thing that saves the movie is the humor. If you want a really talented, hilarious film, you'll watch a movie about "Mystery Men" or another silly film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're looking for something interesting, go to The Naked Ray, the late Robert Vaughn, etc. You'll enjoy the plot, but you'll need to take care to sit through the movie itself. For the rest of you, "I don't have a lot of time to spend on it. My apologies. It's a really slow film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess that this film was intended to be a comedy for the young college student (the two lead actors, the director, and the director's brother, respectively). It was not, in that case. What a horrible piece of trash it is! The story starts out with a nice, funny premise, but the movie is pretty bad when it goes from there. For example, what makes a decent joke about a girl who decides to leave school and stay with her ex in order to catch up with her new boyfriend is something like a cat and a cat from another, and is about a cat, which comes back to haunt her. It doesn't make much sense. And it doesn't even make any sense! The best thing I can say about this film is that it should have been a really funny movie: it's really bad, but it does look like a funny movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the early part of the 1990's, the movie "A Night in the Bed" is essentially a horror movie that contains all of the worst elements of "The Twilight Zone" in which all of them are made, so it seems like a typical action movie, but it turns out to be a complete bamboozonism nightmare. Well, I guess that it is about the same thing, but the idea is different. The "Hush" has a lot of its components, such as a bunch of naked teenagers (who are now called "My Nuts") who are having sex in a very isolated house of some sort. The real culprit is the bambookas that are actually in the movie. They don't look like the ones the real people in the "Night in the Bath" movie have. There is absolutely no nudity or nudity. The movie starts with some sort of sexual activity, but no one really gets it. The characters are just actors. The plot is based around some kind of a cult that has a cult leader named Dr. Evil (I am not sure if this is really an actor, but I think it is in the same sense). This cult does not have any real characters or personalities, the characters are pretty dull. The only thing that is interesting is a bunch naked teenage girls. That is why they look so sexy, but then they do not appear to have done anything at all. The bambooks are mainly made up of the members of the cult. I guess there is a part of them in this movie who are in the cult and want to see a bunch young people being totally naked. It was just one of the babbas, but if you look at it closely, you can find a lot more bamboookas in it. They appear in every scene.   If there were really people involved in this cult (and there is some indication that there is), they wouldn't be so stupid. It is absolutely terrible to see so many actors in this film. They are obviously trying to pretend to be normal people. The actors are really so bad, they are all bad, it is no wonder why they are in this sort of movie. The fact that they are so stupid does not matter to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a stupid movie. Just to avoid "stacking" for the sake of "plot", it's just "plot". It was so bad that I actually turned the camera away and went to watch it alone. In what world is a film that follows this? If this is supposed to be a "comedy" or "fun" film, then this movie was a complete disaster.  I've seen it on TV, and I know it isn't that bad, but if it is a "film", it needs to be more funny than the standard comedies. This movie was nothing but a complete pile of pretense. Just like the bad movie "The Office," this movie, and the "Office" series, have so much in them that it's no longer funny.  If I had the opportunity, I would have said this was a comedy. But if you didn't see it for yourself, then you won't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the main actors were even remotely talented, this movie would be the best piece of trash that exists. The acting is awful, the photography is bad, the plot is bad and the supporting cast is bad. I can't even think of a movie with much acting.  You have to feel sorry for me.  The movie was terrible, but I wouldn't give it a 10, I just don't know how. If you want to see a movie that will make people angry, I would take this one with a ten and nobody would notice it's bad. Even if you find this film worth seeing, don't see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in America because it was the best in terms of the horribleness that is available in today's pop culture. But the movie had so little plot and storyline, as a result of it being a fluff piece that couldn't really be the way to go into any deeper meaning. For example, the film seemed to be about a bunch of people who were "unwitting" to have "relations" with another guy - the rest of the plot involved a bunch about this guy, his girlfriend, a family crisis, some family events, etc. This movie had a predictable plot, and the only thing that kept me thinking was that it was completely predictable. The acting was extremely poor. In fact, the acting was so bad that I felt like the person who was supposed to be the villain in the film was in fact an antagonist for everyone but the "story", and the film lacked much plot. It was difficult to watch the characters. The characters had to talk about as little as possible - I don't remember anyone saying anything about this. One person (probably a female) had to act a line in a car saying how nice a guy was, and another person, supposedly, said what a jerk was going about. When did they just say anything that was not only about how cool a guy is, but also in what he was saying, so they acted so badly that it made me wonder if the actors had any intention at all.  This movie was probably a bit about the fact that people need to have sex in order to have their fun, and in fact, that it had to do something more to get the message of "fun" out of them than make them look normal, but as I watched the movie, the script had nothing. The director had set in place some pretty ridiculous scenes in the past, and I think that they were about to try something as well. So we ended up watching the movie without having a plot. The plot was about a guy in his car and he decided to try to kill another guy, and after doing that, we all decided that there would be no way out of that guy's car. So this is really a classic, dumb, bad movie. If you really like cheesy "gag" movies, this isn't one of the ones, but it's not like that. At least I'd say the movie was bad because I knew the characters were in it, although I didn't know exactly what happened to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so bored watching this and all the reasons made so much sense. The only thing that made me laugh is that the "adults" would be "in the right of the path" for them to have "lost everything". I also thought that "hits" in the film were pretty bad in that they would lose their lives. When they are on the road, we are obviously forced to see the "story" and I thought that the characters would be out of their own free time and place. I don't understand how they managed to "hitch their car", they're obviously just trying to drive to wherever it is. They're so boring. The ending was OK though, if I hadn't seen it I would have missed it. I can see the trailer, it's about 4-7 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a blatant attempt to cover up bad (but boring) acting, bad dialogs and bad plot twists.  I don't know why this was made. What's really, though, this is? I can't imagine that anything remotely resembling a serious plot or character could have fit it in a 30-minute short, but it doesn't.  There are some nice moments in the movie, though not the most important ones...like the scenes where the cops make their first case and, for whatever reason, decide not to arrest the killer. That was pretty cool. But in general, it's not that good.  This movie is so bad that it makes the impression that it was made for a joke, but the movie is no joke, and I'll tell you that the joke doesn't go that far. It's not made for comedy. You can't take a line so literally. I'd be amazed to see anyone make a movie that bad, and so bad it does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just gave this two stars, because it was the only decent movie in my collection. However, I have to say I wouldn't be surprised to learn that most of the actors are terrible, with some even having the potential of the great acting, I would have been expecting the greatest stars to have been cast, if the movie had been successful, I'd be waiting to try one again. I mean to know how horrible this movie is. If your expecting a romantic romance, and then you decide you want to be a movie star, you don't have the same time to see this one, because I doubt you will have the time. The only thing that got me a laugh was the first scene when she enters the hotel room, and there are many camera shots. Even after a short period of time, she is left alone with her husband, and after seeing the man, the two of them are all alone, and it is just plain silly. The rest of the movie was only in a few minutes, I can only imagine that if you watched the first episode, and the final episode, you would have guessed, at least from what I've seen of it, that they would be two guys with a beautiful daughter, and not just one, and she would be the first mother of many parents. If they hadn't forced her to marry the father of their new daughter, she would have had an average husband, instead of having her parents fight for custody of her children, and of her own... and so I'd think they would have won in any legal battles that ever happened. She wouldn't have wanted it, but she does everything she could, without even saving her life, and everything that does not go into the least funny part of this movie. This is the same reason that the movie is so terrible. Even I think they should have added a plot to the movie, and what we learned in the plot, so they could have made the plot better. There is nothing in this movie to make you laugh, and nothing else should make you giggle, and you're more likely to laugh in shock if it was a horror movie. I had the impression that this movie would be a disaster if it had the stars of Casablanca, or even from "The Men Who Kill" TV show. The plot is a stupid story, and they could better have had casted the stars to better it. We would have a better movie, if they had cast Casablanda
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're not the type to sit through movies like this one, you don't watch it. This is about an hour of a very annoying movie: an old girl gets her car stolen by her husband, a rich man, and proceeds to steal the car of some stranger (the story includes a flashback about a woman who was kidnapped), and then gets her into a group of criminals. The whole movie consists of her stealing a car and making some phone calls to the police to get her out of the car, and later asking the police force to arrest her. This would be a fine movie if it would have some good dialogs and something good to say about it. But it is an extremely lame effort. If this movie had some good things to say, it would be interesting to see her in a series of roles that could be real. But this is too much like her previous roles and it doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just a typical piece of rubbish that tries to make an emotional drama based on a bad musical (of the same genre) on top of the worst musical ever written, I've never heard this one. Don't even give this a chance. In fact, I thought it was the worst film EVER made, with poor performances, bad dialog and bad sets, bad sets and bad performances. It is no exaggeration that this film does nothing but put itself in the frame at the end, and then plays it out, for two more minutes, until the end of the movie. But, if this is all you wanted, then you will be glad to see this film in the theatre, along with the movie of "The Love Anisie", which I believe is actually more important and better than the musical, as it is an emotional film. As far as the sets, you can expect a typical low budget indie film, but this is nowhere near being the only thing to do that. For me, this film is a waste of time. There is not a single good moment, nor anything memorable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After spending half the time watching the previous movie in its entirety, I decided to watch this one because I felt like I was going to die. It was painfully bad...  I didn't know how this movie would be, but then I had a sense that it was. In the beginning I thought that it would be a truly good movie... but I felt the same after 15 minutes.  Then I realized that I couldn't even watch this thing. The ending was very confusing and it's unclear why it ended.   I'm glad I didn%t watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is so many ridiculous things about this film, which are just not acceptable to say, so I decided to watch this film because it was entertaining. Unfortunately, I didn't end up in a good movie.  It's about as shallow as a movie can be. There are very low, predictable lines, no real plot, no great drama, and most annoying characters. In the end, it's not too hard to predict who will die in the film. I wouldn't call it a "blockbuster", but instead, I'd call it "The Worst Movie Ever"!!!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am surprised when I found that this movie was so terrible and that it got so far away from the other parts of this series that I didn't believe that this was going to be a series.  But I do believe it was, if not from a creative standpoint, an attempt to be what it is supposed to be. It's no surprise that this is, in some ways, the end of the "Chisquas" series. The other series did not succeed at the same point as the beginning of the series, so to keep your expectations low when watching "Chasquas"; and it's a shame to lose a lot of attention when trying to make a great movie in it. This was nothing like what it should have been, and it was a major disappointment. It just seems to me that a lot more actors would have been added for this if it was made as a series; instead, the producers made the mistake of giving it to a different story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I Dream of the Dead" was not a good movie but I thought it had a certain edge of horror and gore. It just didn't quite fit for the genre. There was little reason to like this movie. The acting was awful. The script was bad, not only because of the lack of plot, but also because of it being so unbelievable that it just seemed like the wrong thing to do.  The production wasn't good. There were too much in the way of story, not much in substance, and the acting was very bad.  Not much better than this awful movie, but it has got a little bit of redeemability. Some people have said that it might have been a better film if it had had a plot. It didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete rip-off of a much better movie called "The Ozzis". And this is what I see as the "Ozzis" movie that is so bad.  Why did this movie ever get made?  This is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It can only be compared to the original "Lucky Luke". It should have been a movie made in a more creative spirit and more originality and entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "My Sister 2" has some weird sex scenes, an extremely annoying performance by a young girl, and some pretty dumb-drama. The first thing you'll notice is the script... I'll let you guess why. It's about a brother that comes to a hotel room... where a girl is waiting for him to see her naked! I'm pretty sure that is the biggest reason why it didn't work.  You can turn into a serial killer if you're in the mood for some incest... but it's really not about the incest. When this movie came out I couldn't believe what I was watching. If you're gonna watch this film for fun, you need to be a bit more realistic... I've seen it over a hundred times but I still haven't heard a lot of convincing reasons for this to be worth a couple of minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has nothing to recommend, except to the notion that it's all just so scary and that this is somehow different from other scary films. But I'm not really a horror film fan and I didn't find it scary in the slightest. I'm quite sure that I have never seen a horror flick that wasn't this one, in spite of the title. The acting is terrible, the story is terrible and the film contains no plot. This is what I expect from a slasher film, not from a horror movie. The plot is too predictable and the "visions" are too ridiculous. What a movie does that you can only watch two movies, one of which is a horror horror film and one of them is a comedy, is obviously one of the worst things on earth. But if I am allowed to comment on this, I'll point out some other films I have seen and tell you how they are supposed to make a horror title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie of my life. What a nightmare. I've never had such a bad idea.  The acting was horrible, but I can still watch it over and over, and the premise is stupid. It's so bad... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst horror film I have ever seen. It is horrible, so bad that you cannot even call it "horror." If you watch it, you will be screaming at every second. If you do not, you can just "like" it and laugh. This is also the worst film of the year. This movie has nothing to do with horror except for being awful. I'm not sure what happened to the plot. The characters were obviously acting, but nothing to connect to either, and it just didn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When this movie aired I thought this was going to be a great movie because of its music and songs. The acting was OK, but the dialog was terrible. I think there is a bit of bad humor in this movie. It was all over the place. The songs were badly written, and the music was OK but, unfortunately, they don't really fit. There are many moments that could have been taken away from this movie but I couldn't hold the attention of my eyes for too long. The dialog was lame, the directing was terrible, and this movie doesn't stand up as a movie. I am surprised that this has been made for a TV series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a long list of words that I would prefer to put in my mouth, but I'm not going to let one sentence stand in my mind because they make me weep.  Please don't let me down, because the movie is a poor attempt at capturing a small part of the action of the war in WW2. Some of the characters are so bad, and the script is completely ridiculous. Some are more annoying than the rest, but most of them are just plain dull. I mean, it's OK to say "Bunch of crap" but "BUNCH OF BLAT" isn't OK. I can't find the last line, but it's worth watching the first few seconds and wondering if the characters might have gotten the last sentence. It's just so bad when so much is being wasted in an attempt at being realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst things I have seen in a movie that I've seen in 10 years. Not only was the movie horribly predictable, but the lack of a plot made it almost impossible to watch. As for myself, I felt a moral sense of betrayal after the fact that there was no "whole-human" plot to make us care for the characters. There was no motivation to make the characters, in fact I felt that the movie failed to make me care.  If you like "The Bourne Code" you will love this movie. But unfortunately "Bourne Code", like "Batman", "Ice Town", and even "The Wolfman" fails to deliver to you in the same manner. There is one redeeming feature that "Borne Code"-like "Borshear" might have to have, but unfortunately it didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a disgusting waste of entertainment, the acting is bad, and the plot is bad. This movie contains the same old predictable plot that is a staple of all movies like this one. This is no better than a movie with a plot that has no point. This "movie" does nothing more than make a few jokes. It isn't funny, and it isn't a movie for people who enjoy laughter, but I'm sure there are some people who would like it to be. You really just don't want to watch. I'd have to turn my nose sideways to see it. It's a shame that they put it on the list of movies that are "the funniest". I'd give this movie a 1/2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to confess, i had to find the DVD of this movie, but i found that it was so bad, it was literally disgusting.  There are times I feel that this movie is simply designed to keep you scared. It is not a horror movie, i don't care, i have seen a lot of horror movies and this one is the worst. I just want to find it and get my money back. I am willing to wait a couple of days to watch it, but I wouldn't get the whole thing back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie looks like a lot of crap, but I didn't like it anyway. And it does not manage to deliver anything for a movie. I don't remember where I thought I was going to find this movie in the world. And if you are going to watch it, you are sure there is going to be some "inspiration" from the same people as you'd seen in the movie "Garden Of Life". The plot is predictable. And the acting is bad.  If you are not a fan of science fiction, you probably won't care too much about it. But if you like science fiction films, you will spend more time watching it if you can. Not sure what happened to the movie is because of its plot, but it didn't work very well. The director (the writer of the movie: David Zaltz) could have made something like this much less scary. There was only a couple of scenes that made me uncomfortable but didn't get too disturbing.   I give this movie a 2 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty basic. A few interesting characters, but the story and story (like the rest of the movie) are not even that great. They're just really bad!  The acting is also horrible. A lot of actors who obviously had talent are playing terrible movies. The other actors are pretty good and the movie itself is interesting but they're not much. The music is pretty good but the movie is too slow and too uninteresting. The fact that you can almost hear a bit of the dialogue, but only in parts when you have a few minutes to sit on it or wait for it to happen. A couple of characters are either really stupid or worse than the characters.  This movie is bad because of a good theme: "the good things that are in the world."  In this movie you can watch people make things that don't have a lot of value and try to find interesting things that you'll never know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is bad. the scene where the characters are shown fighting in a huge army of enemies is too slow to finish. The actors don't look believable enough.  The plot was good but after the end it got lost in a couple of scenes and the ending was not completely done. It's hard to believe that this is the best film from the genre (no kidding, it's the most horrible film EVER!!) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame that it doesn't even have a real name or an official title. It's so bad, I didn't want to give it any rating.  The plot itself is an appalling waste of "hard-boiled" nonsense. A lot of the scenes are completely unrelated, not even the characters in the story have any plot in common with the characters. Not only that, the characters aren't even the main characters who are supposed to be the hero of the movie.  I had a particular dislike for the "village", because the scene in the very first scene of the film was just about all the characters and not even one of them was the main character.  If you have seen the original, you won't even see much of the characters at all. This is one of those movies where you never see the characters of the village. The movie itself was simply poorly put together. A bad movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film features a black-haired, bald and ugly female (Brienne) who assumes the role of a madwoman (Dieter) whose only purpose is to destroy the world in which she is trapped (A.J.). There is a lot of ridiculous things that you could never understand. The opening scene of the film is about a small plot that plays out a lot more like a two-man story. One day, she falls asleep in her office, and the next day she wakes up and has to get to the door to find out that she has made a bad choice.  The plot is completely nonsensical, and it is unclear whether she is in the house where she is supposed to be, or whether she's in the home she was supposed to. The scenes that appear in the film are also just bad because they are directed by the producer. There's only two really interesting scenes in the whole movie. The first is about her getting a new house with a new kitchen. It also features a room that has a huge closet that is completely empty and is obviously where she keeps her stuff. The second one has her screaming in the middle of the day and ending up crying. This scene is just so bad.  Also, the characters are very poorly drawn. There are lots of empty furniture and furniture that just doesn't fit the room she is staying in. The house is completely disorganized. There is also an attempt to make it look like a real home, but there are two rooms that are obviously not located in her house. The scene in the dark hallway is obviously completely black and had to be made to look like she is home. This is especially hard to accomplish given that a bunch of black-clad men is sitting in the same room. The other scenes seem to make no sense.    I don't know who is directing the film. If you are a movie fanatic, you will definitely watch it because it is so terrible that you will be satisfied if you saw it only once. If I were a movie director, I would not make such a film.  If you don't like film makers like me, then you will never see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a total bunk of a movie: a movie with the name "Cinematic" being the name of the movie's title is not a real movie with a storyline, plot, and characters. That title is just not what it is supposed to be, and I can't blame it on the lack of effort. I have to admit that this is just a lousy B film. The story is completely meaningless and I won't be seeing any of it again. The characters are basically the equivalent of a cartoon character: a kid who gets a little money, a little girlfriend, a big brother, a girlfriend, and so on. And as I said before, the plot is not even remotely interesting.  The movie can easily pass for a low budget, but this is no excuse. A film with plot, characters, and suspense is only for movies like this. This movie doesn't have a storyline. The actors don't even make the appearance of an actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title I'd heard was about the movie, and it made me feel like it was made for "I Dream of Motherhood." But it was nothing like that. I never found out how much money was invested in the movie. The acting was terrible. The characters were bad, and the dialog was totally ridiculous. The music was poor. The script was horrible. I'd stay on the sidelines if I didn't have my mother's approval.  I'm so disappointed by this lousy movie, but I can understand that these two women want to get the chance to make a movie about the day they loved. But I guess the people with this vision of making a movie for other people--not themselves--like these two ladies are not in their right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't care for this movie, and I had nothing to do with it. But I could not take it apart. I'm not sure why I even bothered. The acting is extremely poor, especially when they are supposed to act in the world (I would say they should have acted as real people). I've watched this movie twice on PBS and had the same problem with the first time. The story was not even consistent with the actors, and it had a very weak plot. I also missed the point on the film, that this movie would be about a couple of people who find themselves in an accident and find it to be strange. There are too many false connections, for the movie to be interesting.  I do not believe that any of the people involved in the movie will take this movie seriously. It's a bad idea for a movie, I guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so lame that it's difficult to sit through. In this film it is obviously a bad piece of film making.  To my knowledge, it was released about 3 years ago.  I thought I should have a much more intense reaction to this film than I did.  This movie does not deserve to be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the only movie I watched that made me feel sick. The plot was so pathetic it was laughable. Some great actors (like Steve Martin and Peter Sayers) might have made this movie a great piece of entertainment, but they chose the opposite. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie had so much potential but it turned into a very predictable piece with some ridiculous plot twists. the first problem was that it was absolutely predictable. The second problem is that this movie was so poorly written. I gave it three stars because it is an interesting film but the plot has been extremely poor. If the writer had some experience, or if the casting of the actors had some kind of experience, this movie would be much better. The problem is the fact that you can't tell anything from the movie. In fact, it's extremely hard to find any interesting characters in this movie. the plot is extremely predictable and it lacks any inspiration. I don't think the plot was really that bad, but it was definitely bad. The fact that it's so bad is because this movie is the first one that has a lot of stars and I think it was a very low budget. The other reason why this movie failed is because it tried to be the biggest movie ever made, and there are so many famous stars in it. I think that if they made this movie at the beginning of the century it would be something that will be remembered, like "Titan's Lair" or "The Man From Neptune." This movie was a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a piece of crap piece of trash. You can't believe how bad this movie is, but it sure seems like a good idea for a short film, if it can film an action sequence, but really is a poor film.  What makes the movie even more bad is that the plot is so bad it doesn't even have the slightest twist. It is impossible to imagine what happens with a vampire who turns into a killer or a vampire-vampire-vabber(as in this movie: vampire who transforms into a vampire is just as murderous as a vampire).  Also, this movie doesn't have any real plot and the characters aren't interesting, only a bunch of disgusting clichés. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a HUGE fan of Star Wars, but this is the worst movie I've seen, ever. It's so bad, you can't tell me how bad it is. I just couldn't even talk about this one to my friends, it is so bad I couldn't believe it had a name. The first I saw of this movie was just an old man, nothing but a giant puppet. When I saw it again, I saw a "scream" on some other thing. If you knew that movie had been done once before, I bet you wouldn't be as surprised as me. I have the idea that this movie is made to be a horror movie, but I couldn give it the same rating. This movie is just bad, there is nothing new, nothing new with it's script, and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I gave it 8 out of 10 because I'd never heard of an original, yet even I was surprised by the fact that this one was not even given to "another movie." The actors are so bad that they just act, as if they're doing their own thing. There's no plot, no dialogue, nothing. There are no suspense, no mystery, no suspense. They just pretend to be scary, and they're all just idiots, that are just nothing new. They're so bad they have to bring this out.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can see the script here. "I'm a big fan of this movie, but it just can't make sense." Yes, you CAN. But you have to understand that in the movie, you don't get to watch the characters before the movie is going to be released. They act like the characters in the theater only for this movie. They're so bad, and your heart sinks about halfway through the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, for the sake of making a film, this is a movie about the rise of the modern, super-cater with a bunch of kids. As with a bad action movie, it doesn't take too long for kids and the film ends. It goes on and on. There is no plot. There are no story. What does make this film is horrible, the dialog is bad, the cast is terrible, the plot is bad and the storyline is bad. A lot of people are willing to spend money on a movie but they just lose interest when it turns into a crap movie. If you want a movie with a plot, don't waste money. If it's interesting, don don't make it so much about it. If I like a good movie, I'll watch it. But it's a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had planned on a screening of the film at my local community theatre, I didn't expect this. I am surprised to learn that the film was so poorly written.  What a shame. I won't have to see the movie and I am disappointed to learn my local film theatre is not showing it to audiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just awful. The whole movie is just an embarrassment. It has to be a horror show. The way it came out in the first half of the movie was bad. The beginning was good and the ending was good, but it failed to deliver the goods. What really hurt the movie (the main story lines are in the end) were not even remotely interesting. The story of a man and his girlfriend was just about the main story, but then it just got boring. The man had nothing to do except a couple of supporting characters. All of the supporting characters either did not play their characters to very well or were the characters themselves who should not have been in the movie. In my opinion, this movie is garbage. If you are a cinemaller, you will never see this movie again. If not, then stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You could tell I'm a big fan of these films, but this is the first one I've ever seen (including the "I Have A Movie: How I'd Kill A Man", the "Dressed In The Clandestine" TV series that is so obviously not meant to be a horror film, and the first film I've seen in which I didn't really feel any other than suspense. The acting in this film was simply bad, and I really wished the film had more talented members. This is one of those films that comes out with a horrible cast who doesn't make any money, so much to try is to put this movie out on a DVD rack and then throw it into your collection. It is so bad it even gets into the top 50. I'd really like to give this film a 10 to 10, but it was simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this movie was even made at all. The plot was bad, the acting was terrible, the story was terrible... it wasn't even funny. The only thing this movie has got is a really hot chick. Oh how did they get to choose that chick. I was disappointed and I left the theater.  The plot isn't a spoiler. The movie isn't about a true-to-life crime-on-the-floor. It's just stupid, pointless, and just plain stupid. If your friends or family are going to rent this movie, you're going to be left out of your friends for sure.  I have no idea why the other actors had to act like they did. It was really just awful acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie a couple of weeks ago on video rental. I had a fair laugh. But the movie was really boring and very predictable.  The idea of a zombie who is really, really a zombie was stupid.  It was too easy for me to predict the zombie would turn into a zombie and then, well, I guess he would turn back into a human and all the other things.  I thought this movie wasn't bad, but I couldn't believe it would make me laugh so much. I didn't think the zombie was a realistic zombie but it had some of the elements. This movie made no sense. It seemed like they were just showing some people dead in a car. It was really depressing.  But what makes the movie great is the fact that the zombie's head was held down by the zombie as he slept at the car. The zombie just kept going, and the guy was just a big baby. He had no idea who killed him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a cheap and awful movie with a ridiculous premise of the "junkie" who, on a bus, comes to a town in a huge mall to help out a mad man with an army of aliens. He's really a dumb guy in a very cheap way but he also seems to have some sort of charm. The two main characters are two guys who have both died and their car is the only thing they have got. The other person that kills everyone in the movie is a mad guy. They don't even have a car which is a huge problem. There are some pretty funny scenes involving the mad man, but the movie really just revolves around a guy getting a hit by a car and having some sorta bizarre life. There's nothing special about this story as far as the story is concerned, except for the weird car. If you're looking for some action then this movie will be the best but unfortunately, it doesn't do anything more. It's not that the movie was great, but it doesnn't have much of anything except a silly idea that a madman killed the town and killed a bunch of people. I had a hard time watching it. Aside from that, it lacks interesting things. The best thing about this movie was the fact that it has a "jugglin" which makes me think that the characters should have been killed by the mad mad man. I think it's probably an attempt to make this "juglin" movie a little better. However, the idea is that the madman just wants to have a little fun with this car and is actually a really cool guy. The story was a bit pointless. It isn't going to make you forget about the fact the "Juglin", and in a way it didn't really fit the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. The actors were horrible and the plot was horrible. If you want to see a real action thriller and a real thriller, you would better choose a different movie: I would stay away from this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film seems to me as a classic film made without any meaning. Nothing new in it and nothing new at all, but it is not good. For example, this story line consists of a woman who gets her daughter pregnant, and she begins to find out that her daughter's fetus is suffering from an ominous disease, and has the daughter make the delivery of the child, with which she is later infected with the disease. While she is on the road, she discovers a man who has the virus and who agrees to bring it to her mother at a local hospital. The disease is so bad, she is convinced she has to be buried alive so she is afraid to have her baby. After the delivery, the lady starts to look for her daughter and finds a man named Johnny.  As well as the man, the woman has a daughter who has a severe case of pneumonia, as well as another girl named Lucy. She can't help her daughter, so the man takes her life, which he has done to her. She is also taken to a hospital, where he continues to make it hard for the sick girl. This is the only good part of this film. The only reason why I can see this is that it's a holiday eve, and I had not been able to make that connection before. The movie is not funny at all. There are only one or two laugh-filled scenes, and one really bad one, and that is the girl having a miscarriage. The plot is completely inconclusive and this is no way to make up a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So it goes, you get a young girl who has the powers of super-heroes. She has super-powers, and she can fight every type of monster you want, because her body is the equivalent of Superman's powers. This is a silly premise, since Superman has his own powers, and only has a temporary weakness due to his mortal body and thus being weak. It is very hard to watch the film when someone who has a super-power is forced to fight every monster you've seen (for instance, Superman is able to kill people by dropping on their heads) and then, suddenly, suddenly all of the heroes have a fighting power, and that powers they use doesn't disappear until later. When the heroes are fighting every monster, we can't help but wonder why. The plot is not interesting, and the pacing is awful. If you have to see it, watch the first few scenes (the heroes can kill monsters, so they can kill people, since we didn't learn until later that there is nothing good or evil in him). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie made of some very lame actors.  They act so stupid that they make me question whether I have ever been to see such actors. I have no doubt that it is the worst movie of my life, but unfortunately I can't get into the details. But this movie contains more than just stupidity. It is a story about a young man with a very stupid face, a girlfriend and a brother, and the father and the mother, who are completely ignorant about their lives and their child. The end is extremely disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just two days after Christmas, i started watching this movie. I had read some good comments here and I was looking forward to it, but i had heard so many horror movies that i knew nothing. I expected it to be a good one, but what it turned out to be was a complete failure.  As I watched it, i noticed that it's like watching a horror movie. There were no plot, no characters, no explanation. The camera movements were simply drawn around the whole screen. That's it's an action movie, not a horror film, so you have no clue that the action is happening. At one point, the camera zooms into the "house" to make me jump. The only reason I could get a glimpse of the action was that the camera was so big. I didn't notice that it was actually in the house, which only meant that the person in the chair was in a small room in the real house.  It was just terrible. I'm going to say this if you want to see a horror picture: it's not gonna be too good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is based around a giant space station that is attacked by some space pirates on a desert island and the aliens then use the station as their way of fighting each other.  The good part is that the aliens are killed by being their enemies but none of the characters are so convincing as to me that this movie is anything more than an insult to human life.  I have seen this movie in quite a few times and I can only conclude that the film is probably the most awful piece of cinema made around the world. Some have suggested that this is a classic example of bad movies, but I think not. This is far from the only example of an incompetent film but I can guarantee that it is also the least enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The plot is a total waste of time. I'm a big fan of John DeLany, and the movie's message was clear. But this movie does not give any message whatsoever. The movie is about sex in a house which is a completely illogical subject. It just lacks an end, although you get a pretty good deal of humor when John DeLaney is having sex. This is just another waste of money and time in your life. It is disappointing to see the characters just keep getting back to this crappy garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast was, and I mean it was just awful, with no real characters whatsoever. It's all too predictable, too predictable.  The acting was OK though, not bad, as I thought it could have been better. But then it got totally screwed. There are many plot twists in this movie, and they don't seem to connect. It just gets too predictable and I was thinking of something more dramatic.  Oh my, this is not going to be a spoiler to anyone.  I'm more interested in the acting and the writing than the "set and story".  But if I've got the good stuff, I can still watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film before, and I was very interested. So I sat through it. I watched the first 30 minutes and watched the rest of it but after the first half of the movie it just disappeared, and this is a reason why I chose not to see it. It is really bad, though I am not sure what its purpose is, as it comes across to you in an out-of-it way, that it is supposed to be a comedy, that's an excuse for a failed attempt. The plot is predictable and, as the movie progresses, it gets stupid.  It is not even funny at times.  You can read about it, and see a bunch of reviews for it, but it's not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just returned from "D-2000" (which I didn't see in the first episode) and it was like watching an old "D2000" show with a lot of actors who don't even have an idea what they're doing in their lives. The premise of the movie is that there will be a small group of people in a small office trying to get their hands on the phones. I thought they would start acting as their friends and eventually try to establish a rapport with them. But by the end of the film, it seems like they just got together, got a lot money and started acting like there was a lot to get up in a movie, and then decided to start acting like a bunch of idiots. There's really nothing more than going to jail if one person is caught, but instead of going to prison, they're just in a rented house. That's it! The acting wasn't that good and the story was so predictable that the plot just fell apart.  The plot was the only good thing about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty standard Hollywood thriller, but unfortunately the story falls apart. Well, there's some humor, but there is nothing really that builds the atmosphere of the film to the same level as the story itself. You can get away with just being the guy that ends up with the killer, but then you want to go beyond that, you want the killer to do something crazy, and the killer does something stupid. The ending ends up feeling really weird, the pacing is horrible and the film is just dull.  Also, the way the killer is portrayed is really silly, he's pretty good at killing people and it just makes you feel like they should have a clue when the movie is over. If you're looking for a movie with some decent story, don't watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the book and found out that this is one of the worst books I've ever read. I mean, it's really bad. It's horrible and you can see that it isn't even the badest book I've read. Not only is this one bad, but it's an awful plot. It was just too stupid. It really just isn't funny. The ending was just bad. Even the characters don't interact properly. It has no ending. It just ends. I can't seem to figure out what the author is thinking when writing. It can't be real bad because the story is OK. But it doesn't have an end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the hopes of a sequel and after watching the first movie (the first one) I became very confused with the second one. Not only because of the ridiculous plot, but because the acting is too much like the first one (if you've seen the first and second one, you would find the plot quite hard to believe). To answer the question: The main character, Alvin Jr. is a little girl in the 1960s who was conceived by a woman and later on married a boy. This is only because she is the main character of the second movie. Oh no. The only reason I'm saving the sequel is that it's about a young woman and it's an old girl with her newborn. The problem with this movie is that all the actors are old and they just don't have any chemistry to them. Alvin's son, Albert Jr. (or whatever he's called), doesn't even have chemistry to him. His father doesn't either. He has the same job and I don't think his son's got over the age, but this is a movie about the family, not about Alvin. The other supporting characters are only supporting (though some of them are not supporting characters, they are supporting characters). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i think it was a horrible film. I felt like it was an anti-climaxation of the first 20 films, just the same in terms of genre and how badly they were made.  But at the same time, what makes it so great are the characters and the way the plot is written. It just seems like a plot isn't made for a movie. The only scene in the film that makes me laugh is the guy talking about a little girl who has a lot of money. The acting in that scene was terrible, and it was just one of several scenes where all the actors in that film were terrible, not only bad actors, but incompetent.  Bottom line - if you are willing to spend money on a movie: 1. don't watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts out as a big time adventure. But once the protagonist falls on his hands, things only get worse. Then, at the end of the movie, it turns into a one-tricked, two-tricked plot of a serial killer.  I can't fathom what's even coming from the script writers, but it's a pretty bad plot. I won't go through all the details but there's some vague details that seem pretty random. For instance, this guy who has a "secret" and is a bit shifty. The way he keeps a map showing the whereabouts of the serial killer? How does he know how many people he killed? Why is he doing this?  The acting was OK. The cinematography was pretty good, and the sound was good, but the story lacked a lot of development. I did expect a fairly solid plot to help the film, but that just didn't happen. I can forgive that because I'm a big fan of David Dennell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply terrible! The characters are dull, the story is extremely bad, and no other characters seem like real human beings in it. This movie needs to be called "Bad Movie!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was awful. This is not the only bad movie that has been made that year. However, this movie was particularly bad when I sat in the theater after seeing the film I saw:  One of the actors was pretty good, so that makes this movie an embarrassment to me. In fact, I was so disgusted and embarrassed by the horrible acting and direction that it was so hard to even get up from the theater. The plot is pretty basic and very predictable, and the ending is pretty bad, I guess. It also leaves you feeling like you were set to the end.  Overall, this film is pretty terrible. It really should have been an episode of "I Love Lucy." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really bad movie, with a really bad story.  I'll just go into the plot, and I'll tell you how bad it is.  But I can't blame this movie, since the director had some pretty good actors. But there are some really bad actors.  This is really bad, like a real, fake movie. No one should really think that this movie will make a comeback. It will make no money and no money will ever come back.  If you are a movie producer, you'd better do something more than this. If you do this, and it doesn't get money, you are wasting your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was the worst film i've seen in any time, even when i rented it on the cable TV Channel. The script had no plot, no dialogs, no story, nothing, nothing at all. It just showed some of the characters in a bad way. The characters were so clichéd that you could see a piece of paper that was about 50 years old. That's the only way that i could remember why anyone would even want to see this movie.  I am a real fan of the series, but I'm not sure if it was supposed to have much to do with the characters. They are such poor people with so much of the world and nothing to do except to act out like children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not quite a masterpiece, but rather a disaster of an unadmitted, amateurish, and totally self-promoting film. I'm not sure if this is from a movie director who didn't know his very famous original. However, this movie was clearly made that way, and I don't know what to blame that for.  This film will not make any sense in a non-intellectual environment. Even if there are no subtitles, the characters speak in a monotone which makes it impossible to understand what they are saying.  The plot is not very interesting and the acting is very bad.  I'm sorry, but my impression of this film was very, very poorly supported, especially as the main character.   The ending is a bad, very bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely terrible. It's a predictable plot and bad acting. The only good part is the story and it worked well with the characters. The movie could have been a much better by making more jokes and better special effects. As I said, the story was good in an initial plot, but what we are seeing now is only a waste. I was watching the movie when a friend was making it and I said to myself, "Honey, that's good." But if you want a comedy movie, you don't need it. The script and acting is terrible. I couldn't tell who even had any character in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was watching this movie I was surprised to learn that it had been banned in the UK and that the British media was completely ignorant to the fact that it was just a comedy! The plot was absolutely unbelievable and the acting had nothing to do with comedy! There is nothing here to inspire the viewer to laugh and laugh and to make the viewer sick! It is all just plain stupidity!  I will be watching and reading the movie, but unfortunately I will never ever be able to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find that the movie is so bad that it's difficult to figure out why it was even made. I thought it was boring and the characters had no connection with anyone except for a token appearance from the guy who is the main character. The acting is terrible and the "jerk" scenes are not done for fun, but that's not the movie. I was looking for something more entertaining and it didn't quite meet me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess the best way to get into the mind of this person who was in charge of a high tech intelligence team would be to do a mental health diagnosis that would explain how to deal with the person's mental condition. We might as well have done this so we could get the best treatment for these people.  Unfortunately, the fact that these types of movies are made are not just the result of a simple creative genius, but instead a horrible example of brain-twinkling stupidity. This sort of movie is as bad as a movie made in Florida. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen far more than the "Bolani" movie, and I've never seen one more dumb or terrible than the whole of "Bologna." The only thing that this movie does are two horrible characters, but even worse than them they manage to make it look like "normal" people in the rest of the film. In both cases, the two actors seem to be in their 30s. One of them is a high school teacher who was in charge of one of the schools in Italy; the other one is a retired woman who has a daughter whose daughter also died from a serious illness; but I guess you'd be right in choosing to pick either one of them. The only way I've ever known to make a "BOLANI" film is to hire a "normal guy" who tries to recreate "real" personalities of people from different countries, and use them as "adults" of a story. This is not only the only movie in which these two actors are involved, but the worst film I've watched this year. It's not that it has nothing to do with the characters of course; it's that it lacks a sense of intelligence to have to make such a film. The story is a generic; I'll give you the synopsis of the movie, but you will never watch this movie. It is probably the worst attempt at a "D-17" film ever, and the first thing you will be surprised to see in "Boloi" is the lack of intelligence. There was absolutely nothing to see here that would inspire any true or meaningful reaction from the viewer. For those who actually knew anything about the story, it was plain sad that there was so much detail in it. It could very easily have been a totally pointless or boring "D(17" movie. This could have been made on any low budget, and was probably not as poor a film as a true "D" film. If the movie was supposed to be about a real person, it would be something that was truly ridiculous. The fact that this film was made without any regard for any of the plot whatsoever was ridiculous. There is no reason to find out how these people lived, who lived, what the fate of their family or anything else, and what they were in the past. This movie had all of the details of some sort of fictional fictional character with nothing in common to bring a point to them. This made no sense at all, and at
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a few moments that are worthy of mockery but not enough to make it worth watching. The story is weak and the acting, script and photography are all bad. The premise is weak in one scene (the scene where the father's sister is dying on a bus), while the characters were pretty good. The characters are dull and don't seem like people who can act well. For the average viewer, this movie will not go far, but if you are a decent person, you might turn it off after seeing it. If you are an adult, you will see it's flaws and you'll wish it had been removed from the public. But if you aren't interested in a movie, I suggest not watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie seems to be a mixture of a two separate movies in the same story. The main plot has been completely written, though the story, in essence, is not. It has been left open, the only story lines are the plot, and the characters are the characters. The characters are essentially a few guys whose lives have been dictated and manipulated by the main characters, who can't stay in their lives, and only can be rescued. There is no depth whatsoever. The acting was awful, and most of it was the "normal" acting, with terrible, one-dimensional characters. Most of the characters in the movie were absolutely unappealing. For example, the annoying, annoying, one of the actors who played the villain, was able to maintain a smile. There was nothing else.    I gave this movie a 10, but I still believe this was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days ago I saw this film in a cinema. A few minutes later I had decided to look at it only because it was not a rubbish movie. I found it boring and quite predictable. I was wondering if it was really a documentary or if it had a message to send to children. The story is not well written, especially the "bias" theory. It seemed a bit too like a "prohibition" movie, when it is supposed to be "adults", with some silly references to the "B" word. This was not the case in real world. In the end the director thought that it was a documentary. In that case it obviously was. At least he knew he couldn't make the film like a documentary, and that it had to be funny. I think he felt so stupid he lost a few seconds on the screen.   Overall I would have rated this film a 4 or 5 but it was pretty horrible. It wasn't really funny. It had many plot twists and some pretty funny moments, but it doesn't have any. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the only movie I could watch in an hour, and the most I could say about this movie was, "You just don't know how bad it gets."  I'm surprised no one ever said this after seeing it. That said, this movie is pretty bad, but it is so bad it never gets that much attention.  I am a hardcore fan of classic films, and I thought it was funny at the beginning. But, I really didn't like it, even though I enjoyed all of the jokes. The dialog is awfully low and badly put-on, and not funny. The characters were flat. The director and star seem to have forgotten about the characters they had worked on the previous films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Secret Castle" was a terrible movie. I can't think of the movie without watching it. The plot is horrible and the movie is a complete waste of time. I'm surprised they finally made "The Castle", but there are some good actors in "The Housewife" who can make some good performances. I don't even understand why they hired this movie. Why does this movie exist in the same movie as "The Wizard"!? It just seems like they just copied something from a movie already made. I hope you enjoy watching other movies, but this one is not one of those great movies. I just can't believe that the "Housewife" of "The Mansion" is capable of making such an appalling movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is, essentially, a dumb, two-act drama that takes place in a futuristic setting. The "progressive justice" concept, I'm guessing, is so much too simplistic and meaningless. In what follows, the filmmakers use a few scenes from the previous movie with the same actors who would have no chance at beating the characters in the previous movies, and then fail to use the same scenes that would have been used in the new movie. The story is one of those stupid plots that goes, in every movie, to try to break the story down in a simple formula.   If the movie was good, it would at least have some dialog that would be used in a decent thriller. It's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a long time, I found it was pretty dull. It's not funny and is really not dramatic. The film is slow, drags its plot around the ground with too much dialogue, but it does have some funny moments (the plot includes a dog taking over the town, who gets a chance to do a little singing) so it's worth seeing. But the plot is horrible. The characters are wooden, and you don't really understand them. They are just stupid, uninteresting, and completely meaningless.  Also, I think they were trying to make a comedy, but when the film is done they just don't fit the genre (at least, not as much as they used to). I just don`t understand the idea of making comedy out of people like the Simpsons, and they have done it since. I don't see it in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen it on several TV shows but I never got a good idea of how it would actually go. I think that people have been watching it for years but it never actually does anything. If you get to the end of the show, you get a huge shock when you are expecting something very predictable.  The first episode was a predictable story line, which was just a little bit predictable. Then it tried to have some kind of "clue to the big family coming to town" plot line. And then it got a big surprise. It was about an old couple who are getting married to a new, super rich, and it all seems to go very, very wrong. Then something else, something totally random, like a guy's family getting a big budget, and then something else. Then one of their "kids" gets a big chunk of their money.  Then you get an episode about a missing "family member" in this really big budget house, and after the guy's wife leaves, the story moves into a totally unrelated scene. Now, I have seen it a couple times and I can tell you there is no logic to this whatsoever. But I can't blame the director for giving it a little twist. It is not about how smart people think, it is about the fact that this is so bad and it is just a bunch of actors. And it is very bad when the actors are so obviously acting stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was the worst film I have ever seen in my memory (sorry, that was too long) although I'm not sure how, but at first I thought it was so good that I really didn't care to give it two stars! At the least, the film was extremely slow-paced, with bad direction and not nearly as good as the earlier sequels, and the characters were flat. While this film was not, like I expected, visually inspiring, it did a little bit to make me want to throw the whole thing into the garbage bin and walk away. I didn't think this film had much in it in it to say that it had any great messages, except that it was just an excuse to spend money on a movie: not that much. It was a big waste of my time, and was so bad, I almost cried. I think I'm right to be bitter and angry at this film, but I'm also not going to let this movie pass me by. It is far from the best, but in my opinion it is far worse than the first 2 films I have made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't really deliver a great deal of story, with no great sense of plot or any real message. The characters don't seem to have any motivation. That was the only thing that got me interested in the movie, and it was ruined as a result.  The story is just a mess. It doesn't come off like anything to do with a plot. In fact, I think there are worse plots for this movie. I wouldn't really call this a "horror movie", but a "fugitive horror movie" might be something like this.   I'll be honest. I couldn't even find a good thing to say about this movie; it's so bad. It's not worth the two hours it costs to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is some dumb, childish trash that has got me to see every episode of this movie... but nothing else.... I will admit, even if I was a child, I would think twice on some of the episodes... but this is no exception to this movie.... I mean, this movie is bad... but worse than anything else. I could not believe what I just watched. The first episode was really bad, but it didn't even finish the story... a couple of people killed themselves (but there are no deaths...  ) and the other episodes were very bad, even in "closer" situations. The acting was OK, but I can't blame it for the plot, because it didn? A couple of scenes are so silly, I'm just glad to see the next episode and see the ending. Well, I have to admit that if you are watching this movie, you will have seen the story, maybe. But I guess I don't have to see it again, because this movie was just like other movies that I didn't like. I'm sorry for all the people who got so lucky. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to know what a "star" would say about this movie: "It's so awful, I wish I could say "I'm a huge fan, but this movie is horrible!  This movie was filmed in a basement that was under snow and snow for many months! It was just an amateur attempt to imitate The Mummy! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking forward to this movie but I couldn't take it. I've never had a movie that I have never watched... The script was full of clichés. The acting wasn't that good. The story lines were flat, there was no real message. The action sequences were boring... The whole thing just plain old.  This movie was just a disappointment.  The problem with this movie is that it tries so hard to be original. If you're in the audience and you get the same plot in your own personal movies, you're not going to come away expecting a different movie. You're not likely to come and find that same movie in a hotel room...  In one of these hotels in Mexico I saw a movie with one woman in it... The woman was about 7 years older and had more screen time.  What would happen if you don't even have a story.  I know what I would do in that hotel... What would I do if I knew that it would be the same in my own apartment.   That's exactly the same as when you want to pick a movie: Forget about movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After this movie I couldn't find a word, but it seemed like the director had to write a negative negative review:  In this movie, they've used a handful of old tricks and a few new ones to turn it into a "movie." There are a few good surprises in there, but they're the only part. The rest is just a waste of time.  I didn't even like it. It's like I'm watching "The Expendables" without any real reason. But I can admit that sometimes it is just an excuse to rent these movies. The movie is boring and stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As always, the characters are either in their homes or under the influence of the police, who are apparently having their minds set to the max speed. A lot of the film is obviously filmed in a bad way, with a bad script and a bad performance from the actors, but the idea is so weak that it doesn't help the situation. If you've got a taste of irony, perhaps you will enjoy the scene when they all decide to be on board. They're not really funny. At least the music is pretty good. Even if you liked the musical performance from The Undertaker, you will lose out on the joke. In spite of this, the scene in the car is actually pretty funny. And if you've seen any humourless scenes before, this is definitely not one of them.  The movie also features the ridiculous scenario of two women who make up an act, that leads them to break in a car, and that is a rather ridiculous idea that I don't think this has been in the script.  I also found this movie to be a bit ridiculous in the beginning. The scene where they go inside and then take a car is only 20 minutes long, but it contains several scenes where they are just sitting around in their rooms for several minutes. So you just wonder why they are having to stay in their room while having sex, then having their car is sitting at a stand in a parking lot. And why they aren't doing anything to the car and have sex with the car. And you just have to wonder why people would do that. Oh, and if you have to keep in a room at the top of the car, then you wonder why that is happening to a bunch of people who are sitting at their living room. The camera angles also make me think that the actors are having their heads in their eyes, not actually seeing their hands in their faces. You don't really think about those car owners, because if you had any idea what they'd do before they had sex in their car, you wouldn't do it. And even if you think that car owners don't have a lot of talent, and I'm pretty sure they have pretty decent talent, you probably wouldn't think about doing that either. They might have some talent, but they just aren't like people who have good talent. The movie has quite little value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always liked the movie, but it was just awful. This one was very weak, which is OK. But the ending made me question whether it was right to go so far. I couldn't understand how it was ending. I felt that this ending could be blamed on the fact that it was so clichéd and forced a "what happened" situation. The movie felt like a carousel falling out of its own seat. I was just about to say that it didn't have to be so cliché, but this one was so weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so weak that it is laughable. Why are there not a movie that has a plot and great acting and storyline to this movie? Well, you get the idea. This movie does not, unfortunately, deserve to be rated. I'm not sure why this movie is even made, but I think the producer probably thinks that it's a comedy and that it can act as well. But it isn't.  I don't know what is going on. I was pretty impressed by the ending of the movie, but it was so weak and so empty that I didn't even laugh. The only thing that came out of this movie was a huge slap in the face. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only do these 2 movies only make up a half of the time, they also fail in all of the respect we usually associate with the genre. This is the case for this movie: it tries to play something similar to a movie, but it doesn't. A lot of the material can just as easily play for a laugh as it plays for a pay or a movie. Also, it doesn�t have any storyline� the best examples of which are "Rabbin On The Boat". There are so many silly scenes, it was difficult to concentrate on one� in this case.  So when you're watching the movie, you don't want to stay there, you want to get away quickly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major flaw in this movie is the "plot" which, on the one hand, is too predictable to the point of it being the point. I have always enjoyed this film but I never liked it as a movie, at least until now. That "plot", however, is one of the worst things i've seen in a movie with the original theme. If you like the original "plot of a woman named Lucy with a mysterious man" then you'll love this movie but, unfortunately you can't really appreciate it. The movie is only around the halfway point and it does not make any sense whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the biggest mistakes of the new Ghostbusters. First of all, they really should have cast more women with women's hair. It is pathetic. The first one has a hunchback. What's even worse is the fact that they still got the same girls as the original and the girls in this movie are just barely in their underwear. I would rather not watch this movie because of the embarrassment of this film. This is also one of your worst comedy films. The actors are not talented. The funny scenes were just OK. I was looking for some funny scenes when the girls were in their sexy underwear, but instead I had to find something like "Woo, Woo, Woo, Woooooooooo!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd have thought that this movie was going to be fun, but it didn't. I have no patience for anyone that takes this seriously and you don't want to waste your time on this, either.  I can't tell which guy is playing the "Older" son who doesn't care about his son's problems. The director had a sense of entitlement to have the "older" son playing his son, and you can imagine how he felt in his face when you watched that scene.  You just need to watch it so don't waste your money or time. The ending was terrible and not even good.  The ending of the movie had some good scenes and I've enjoyed it, but unfortunately that was the only good thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that bad, but it's bad. It's a movie that, although I never see it, is like an adult's dreams and hopes of what the world could be. For a film such as this to take place in your head, it is a total failure. It just doesn't come together well. The characters are weak, they are just pathetic, the story is poorly executed, and the action is so horrible that it just can't take it.   I think the story really needs to be developed. It should be something with the actors. A film like this would be interesting. I just couldn't hold my hands to jump and see this movie. In fact I thought I would get so bored with it. I didn't. The movie itself is too old and its lack of humor keeps it away from something I can only appreciate. The acting is bad, the plot is weak, the script is weak and the characters are too weak to make it work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen.  There is no plot, nothing happens in the story, and no clues to where we should be looking for the next thing. This is really a movie based on the idea that it was the idea of a man who gets kidnapped by an alien. How many times will they tell us how to find him? The movie isn't even about how the man got there. There are no end to this story, no destination, no direction. No clues where we're supposed to go. No ending.  I'm not expecting anything to happen. I expected a great adventure.  The plot was so vague, that it made me confused. I watched this movie at 2 AM. There was no way out of the theater I could find it. This movie was really disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I mean by the title of this film is that it does nothing to define this term. It lacks character development, and it lacks any sense of plot. The movie is a complete mess and we don't know who the "hero" is. This film is very slow and it doesn't have any depth. The script is flat and the acting lacks any depth whatsoever. It has been dubbed as a "comedy", but that is no more than a silly excuse. There's no reason to watch this movie. The only real reason to keep watching it is because it is obviously a piece of trash that has no purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very lame, although it was pretty good. It was bad to get to grips with the idea of what the aliens might do. You really got no understanding of what they would do. That's the only thing that made the film interesting. I thought the acting wasn't that good. There was a few moments of decent dialogue and a couple of moments that were pretty funny, but when that happens, you're really lost. You get an idea of the aliens when they are in a different shape or different places or a different direction. I'd recommend watching it for a laugh but there are plenty of people who like this film and don't have any idea what it was. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First and foremost it is extremely un-fun-loving. Not even the most absurd, laughably stupid and worst in terms of film-making ever made. However it can make for a fun "wacky" film at times if it's allowed to be seen. There is an obvious and pointless attempt at humour in the form of a ridiculous, absurdly convoluted, laugh-out-laugh laughs. This is not the only bad movie I have seen, but there's nothing to make you think this is even "wack" or funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not sure why I read this book but I found it surprisingly entertaining. If you want a movie with a big fat sexy blonde in it and you don't mind for which actress was involved then you can just rent it and turn it off. What a waste of time!!! I'll admit I'm not 100% certain of what happened to these two people, but I think it could be a long time before I actually understand what happened, I hope. It's just plain bad acting and bad direction (forget the film industry in this country, I guess it was just made by the director and his scriptwriters). If this was the case, I don't understand how the plot changed. I would like to see something like the 'classic' version of this movie in a movie store somewhere for my own enjoyment, but it would be just another waste of your time. The acting was pretty good, but what it was in real life was too bad, the scenes were too dark and had bad camera movement. The story was very weak and the direction was too slow moving. I just can't blame the director, but if this was his first effort then he missed the opportunity to make his own masterpiece. You have to be prepared for this type of movie, because it's too bad to be true to it's concept. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for something interesting and, like my usual type, I decided to see this movie and was quite disappointed. This film was just an embarrassment from beginning to end. There was nothing in this movie that would make me enjoy it. I'm a big fan of action movies. This was not the case. There are only a few moments that I thought made me enjoy this movie. The acting was terrible. If I had to pick out any one of the characters, I would never be able to find any good ones. Even if you didn't have a mind to go crazy and see the movie, you might just find yourself in tears. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was terrible. A horrible director gave a plot of no substance to "An Ominous Affordance" which had to be the movie's final conclusion. An awful plot. And the only thing which was good was An Oscar-winning performance by Michael Schoob. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was the first time I saw this film? It must have been a long, long time, and I felt like it would have been boring for you, but this was not a movie that was worth watching.  Not only was this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It wasn't even funny. I felt completely, and totally, completely, burned out. It was the least thrilling and satisfying of my life.  What could have been better to film: 1) do something that will actually be in the top tier. 2) don't waste this movie.  This movie is just terrible to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not as good as a true story or as bad as a bad one - it's a poor film - but it does not even reach the level of mediocre horror movies.  The plot and characters are pretty good, although it feels like the director of most movies in the genre got drunk and fell asleep at the end of this film.  I would recommend watching the first few hours of the movie and watching it over and over with the help of a friend. If you want to get a laugh, see the scenes where the main villain gets fed to a cannibal as well as other scenes of the film, which are not even funny, but are not much longer than a few minutes. It's not even an amusing tale.  If you're wondering if the movie has to be called "Zombox", please watch "Zombie Dog". You'll never know what's going on in the rest of the films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only saving feature in this film is the very hilarious ending. The plot revolves around the young sister who is the real wife of one of the parents and gets drunk at a club. I have to admit that it's not that funny, but it is annoying. Also, the lack of a real twist to the proceedings is not helping the quality of the film. The acting is horrible, although I was able to guess that the real husband is the father of the young girl. In the end, it is pretty obvious that the father is the baby's father who is not the child's mother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I had just finished watching "Daria's Dreamtime" on the other HBO channel (i'll say i'd never heard of them until i saw this). It was horrible, although I don't really know why they'd cast this as an "B&B movie", as it is. The storyline was stupid, and I don her with enough information. Even the "Crosbury Square" scene (when she's attacked by a giant dinosaur who tries to get her head) was pretty bad.  The ending I found to be totally lame, and i didn't know what happened, nor what was being played out there (as I said i was about to go into the theatre to see it anyway).  I think the biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't really connect with the rest of the plot. I think some of the parts could have been done better. The first part (where she gets in a hot tub) could have really been made more interesting, I guess. There was one scene where she got in a tub and tried to get out the water, but I'm not sure what happened there. Maybe it would have worked with the other parts of the movie, but it also could have taken place on her stomach. That's also another problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible, and I thought they should not release this one. It's horrible! In fact, I didn't even watch it because I'm on a movie set. I've rented it twice and it was horrible. I don't know how this is supposed to have a plot. In what way are they supposed to change the characters in a movie that is about people that have a very large plot in it. Oh, I don`t believe that.  I was scared for 15 minutes before I walked through the credits after I saw it because it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this film was supposed to be an important message to all that is good, it certainly fails to deliver. At best, it seems like you just got pulled into a deep, pit-like atmosphere that was intended to make a statement on that a bad thing. This film sets it all up by featuring the dead bodies of every big movie that has ever been made and made. The script and the acting in the film just don't make sense.   It's hard to believe that this film will have any staying. A few years ago I thought that this was a really good film because of the idea behind it. But I can just say that this movie is bad, bad, and bad in all respects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this one when I was 18 and I thought it was a good movie, but it was awful. I didn't know why I was looking for it and it seemed like I was going to be killed. I felt like I'd be killed for this.  I am a big fan of the Harry Belafonte movies (and a lot of other people, too, too) and this one was no different.  Why is it important that this movie is about a black female.  How did she become black.  The acting was terrible. This was the first time I saw this woman in the flesh. She looked like a corpse.  And then she was killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not the only film to get that label, and unfortunately, not one of the very good ones. There are many other films that just like to do one thing and then retreat from it. I personally thought this was a bit of a piece of trash - an old-school school drama of a woman who gets on a train in the middle of the afternoon to find out what's happening.  If I wasn't a fan of The Makers, I don't think I would ever rent this movie. If I did, I would not care for the acting, the plot was only a little more dull than the previous films, and the dialog seemed more childish than the earlier ones. While this movie was far from the worst, it was also not the most exciting. I have to admit I felt very bored and confused throughout.  But perhaps I should have watched the original. I'd never heard of The Story behind the Makers before.  I had heard a few comments about it, and I did not take much interest. Although it seems I'm the type of person that needs a movie to live with, I'm not exactly that type. But my opinion on this is that this movie isn't worth renting. I'm sure it is a decent documentary but that's all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of the Sci-Fi genre, but this one is just the worst movie ever. I cannot believe that the actors were ever in such a position as to have a role of any interest. That's the biggest reason I cannot blame this film for failing to even have any interesting dialogue. I'm not one of the most ridiculous actors I know, but like I said earlier, this movie is so bad, I won't make the same recommendation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the previous reviews I decided to give this one a 7. I was expecting to see a good one. Unfortunately there was none. What happens is a bunch of kids and a babysitter that has a sex appeal to every woman he wants is forced to have sex with a teenager. When the sex appeal is just that, this really doesn't seem like a comedy.  It's not funny at all. The characters were good but the scenes are not funny.  The ending of this film is too predictable and it's pretty bad to just expect a comedy in such a short time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie would not have been as bad as this one. If there is something that was missing or in the way that this movie is supposed to be, let me say, I'm going to put it in plain words, I had nothing to do with this movie, except for a good reason. Why did the other actors like to act so bad? Why did they want to act like the actors in "The Big Sleep"? The acting was OK, because the acting did make an appearance on the show, although it did not appear there. I would give this movie 2/10 unless it has something that it was supposed to have. I have seen this movie twice, and I would like to say it was bad, but it was not terrible enough to make me laugh as much as they made you laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film from which one would expect a talented director. But, I don't think that that's the case. It's nothing more than an excuse to spend some time on a cheap thrill of seeing some dumb, pointless movie: a car falls off of a cliff, a stupid plot, and some stupid actors. What could have been so horrible? I guess that's where I'll stay for this one. The story begins in a hospital, which is basically a plot to escape one way or another.  The plot is decent, but unfortunately has some stupid, stupid actors and a stupid cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Not one of the better movies I saw. The acting is awful, as usual. I would never watch this movie again. The last movie I saw with John Cazenas and Christopher Walken, "Buckets" was better than this. He was great, but not much better than the rest of the acting. I think the director should be fired for his failure. I am sorry but I thought this movie would be good to watch again. Why is it there? I'd watch it just once, and then watch it again to see if it would stay interesting. If you want a movie, you better spend a few days on one. You will regret it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was nothing special, but very un-interesting. The plot was a poor story, lacking any dramatic value whatsoever, but the movie itself is nothing special. There is no good plot. There are no funny lines, the movie is just one-of-the-jocks-losing-every-word-in-the room-no-matter-what-you-do-in that it was not funny. I do admit that the movie was a pretty good joke. But at the end of the movie, the joke lost its power. A truly awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only do I find this movie to be horrible, but what else is?  Yes, I have read the comments on this movie (and I am sorry for my ignorance, but to say it is bad) I have seen it three times now, and there are no great surprises. The plot is nothing new. The camera is not exceptionally good, and the plot is weak. There was a great scene about a baby getting to the nursery, and it is pretty boring and there is absolutely no good direction. There are lots of characters who are basically useless, and they are not cute. I have heard so many bad comments about this movie, it really makes me wonder if this movie was made in a laboratory.  I have never heard such bad comments for a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife, a huge fan of The Phantom Men, and I decided to see this film after seeing it as a child in the 70's. However, I decided not to see it the same night. She was just in the theater when it was announced that the film was going to be released. I was horrified, because I was convinced that this movie was going somewhere. It was probably going somewhere like a normal adult film, but it was not.  The movie was so incredibly horrible, I wanted to get my money back. In the 70''s, I remember seeing this movie in the store on the side of a bus and seeing a picture of the man on top. He was so hideous, so sick, and so slow and uncoordinated. I didn't understand why there wasn't any warnings for this. I don't even remember seeing it in a store or even in a movie theater, so I guess the producer put it on his shelf to let people see it. The acting was horrible, and it was only by far an hour's worth of watching this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry to say that this was really an awful film, but this is no exception. I've been watching it since I rented it for my wife, so unfortunately my eyes are blind and I have little patience for this awful film. The plot is obviously no plot or story, but it lacks some pretty good ideas or inspiration. What a plot was there?  I'll tell you that it just seemed out there when I first rented it. There are some decent scenes, but I don't care about those. If you can see the ending, then it will be the same as the first movie and I'm sure you won't miss any plot. The biggest problem is the character's motivations. This is especially the case for the main protagonist, who, in all but one scene, acts in the same way, and we don't even see his motives or motivations. It's OK to show us in these scenes, because they are trying to create a plot, but the ending is just so slow, and the movie goes on and on. If it's a movie you watch, I suggest going to get the DVD instead of watching it on a DVD or CD. It will save you some time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think you can make a lot of jokes about bad movies:  I loved this movie for its ridiculous and pointless jokes, but it had nothing to do with either the plot or the characters, which were very weak. The story was absolutely stupid and pointless. The supporting actors were so bad and the acting was so bad, it was difficult to make sense of the characters. The characters were either clueless or self-important, and the movie is over 90 minutes long, so I have no idea why it was even put out on HBO. I don't have an idea why he had to make so many fake scenes so that it has to have happened for 10 minutes and have a bunch of fake people. I think the director was the mastermind. Whatever else was going on with that. I only see this movie at 2-3 times a year. I hope you will never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie of questionable quality. There was no point of showing the actual plight of an African in a movie: 'The Color Line'. It's just a movie with nothing but a bunch of black stereotypes to fill it up. And I mean, the stereotypes are so ridiculous that they are actually funny! What is this?? What does it do? A black person who is in Africa and comes back to the States(after being kidnapped by the KKK), is not in Africa! What? The movie is supposed to be about a black man named 'Fus' who gets involved in a robbery spree, is murdered, is put in a jail, is returned to a black prison, is in jail again, and is then sent to the treatment facility(after the cops arrest Fus and all the other inmates of their own 'iniquity') only to be taken to a treatment facility by his former brother. He then goes home, returns, and then the cop tells Fus that his brother is in there. Then Fus goes and takes Fus's brother to Africa, and tells him that his sister is in the same jail. What? Fus has nothing to do with his brother. Fus is sent back to Africa where he is then kidnapped by his own brother in a black hospital, locked up and then 'the cops' take him prisoner(after which he is sent to a prison by their 'black prisoner') then he is taken to Africa's treatment facility. Fusk is in a prison cell, then 'he's in a cell' (I guess this is why he is in black hospital cell). He is then locked in a cage with a bunch about thirty white prisoners(as he is the only one in there, his brother tries to get a hold of his 'prison guard' in a fight, and he is subsequently killed by their prisoner(as Fusk's brother is being killed by the 'white prisoner'). Fusk then dies(the same thing that happened to 'The Last Mice' Fusk would do) so then his brother comes back and he 'the guards' go through the same thing, and there's a 'funeral', and everyone finally decides that the 'crime of Fusk' is to be a murder of Fus' and he has to apologize to the 'clans' that he killed his own uncle. But then Fusk has to do all the same with his next 'brother'. He has to make the murderer go into
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After having read this review about this piece, I thought I'd be able to make a comparison with the film: the plot is fairly good, the acting is pretty good, and the camera work isn't horrible. But what's going on in the film is really bad. Why do they have to show us sitting in a car? How can they get our backs?  It is obviously not a story. Just a bunch of dumb, stupid people who want to get money for some stupid purpose. How did they manage to get the car back? For the rest of us, the only thing that seems interesting are the characters, and that the characters are dumb and stupid. The film does not even try to do anything new with this. If you like to watch some action-set movies, then you will not miss anything.  There's no story. No characters. No acting. The story doesn't have any point. It just goes on and on.  This movie is no good. It's not even a movie that I would recommend. I don't even recommend this movie. But, you might find something interesting if you're a person interested in car driving, or car driving is something that you enjoy. It contains no suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I can say for this film is that it was supposed to be an independent documentary by the director and the writer. When it was announced, the whole idea of making a film was "all my friends are doing movies" and "We just want to make movies." This was only true if you were a big independent filmmaker. There was nothing to make in this movie. It had some good moments, but the only thing I had seen in this film was an empty and pointless storyline. It would not be as bad as a movie from a self-produced independent movie producer. If you really knew what was happening, you would think there was something more to make. There is nothing. It is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a female writer (who also wrote the book) who is the lead of a TV sitcom called "Sex and the Press". But in this film, it's just the idea of a sitcom. She thinks about a movie called Sex and the Media. So we can guess that it would be an excuse to say she has a TV show. (For you, at least a female TV writer would have a reason to say something like this.) But what happened is that this show never actually moves beyond the premise of Sex and TV. The only time the movie ever got any real life in it was the fact that this movie was based on the film "Bachelorette". So they just threw this film together instead of real life. And the only person in the film who was a real person was the female writer. In essence, this movie is just about making a bad joke. And I think that the fact I did not see any real people in the movie, makes it the more annoying. At least I don't know if she was a writer or if she went to the studio to get the actors to actually act, but I suppose she didn't either. There are no people in it that you can figure out as the "original" writer. There isn't a lot of value that she added to the movie. I guess she's only a writer who got out a few times. The actors did very little in this movie, and she obviously did very poorly. And this is why I think they tried to keep the movie going that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no way this movie could be good. It is horrible and completely incomprehensible. Some of the lines left a lot to interpretation and it's just bad, as usual. The premise is really hard to comprehend and the ending is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off all, I love this film but it's just not the best. In fact it's quite bad. First of all it's horrible, the acting is bad, it's terrible even. The storyline is bad...the story really isn't interesting (which would be okay if it was the story of a teenager that wants to return to reality and have the person she lost on an ocean voyage). The plot is only decent when the lead is one of the three friends who just lost their girlfriend and then the one who's having sex with a woman...it's all about that and nothing else. I guess there are many people out there that like the movie but don't like it. This movie is only about the 3rd or 4th worst ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea behind this movie is stupid, because the story is so bad, it isn't really funny. If the writer was really a talented writer, this would be a genius piece of work. The script is terrible.  The actors don't seem to be there to do anything, they don't even get anything done for their characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I noticed when I watched this movie was the fact that it was poorly put together. It didn't seem like it was directed by any sort of directing. The dialogue, the acting, the directing (though he had very good directing) just seemed terrible. This was most likely a rushed film, as he obviously had only a short time to make his directorial debut. The rest of the film could be a comedy, but they only seem like a couple minutes long. It just lacks a great deal of focus, and nothing really engages. Even after viewing the movie you can only expect it to be awful. The end of the movie was predictable and predictable. The ending left an irritating feeling that no one could really take it as a movie. Some of the other actors just didn't bring anything to the table, so the film didn't really feel like it. This is the worst piece of film I have ever seen. The other actors and the movie seem to be trying to do something interesting, but it's just plain bad. The two of the two actors even just seem to do different things that aren't in any place that they would normally do. They're all not that different, and they just do the same thing that everyone else does. The movie doesn't really stand up to anyone's standards when compared to the other movies that have come out about the time. If you're looking for a movie with a story and some action, this isn't it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see this film, because I really think that it would be a really good movie if it was real. I couldn't find one and that made me sad because they still wanted to make a serious film. As I mentioned previously, the film had a very low budget and very low stakes and it was all about how stupid the characters were. If there is a film with a real message about life, I don't see it. The story isn't about how life really happens; instead of a real person, you get a bunch of people on a mountain like a mountain, with a lot of crazy people living. The problem with the film is that it doesn't deliver. They put one girl in a giant hotel like a giant building that has one person for each of the characters that you could probably kill and the director wanted to kill everyone in there. They gave the girl a camera and made her look like a cat. She is obviously an airtight room and has to have some sort of costume so she won't get stabbed. I guess it is to make the audience realize that they don't really live in hotel rooms. Maybe one day I will find one film where the girl was able to act like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I guess it's too bad to make a full film out of all the horrible things I've seen in this film, so I decided to let it out when I finished it. However, the plot has a few good scenes and an interesting ending that was really disappointing. Most of the film is very dull, but it does manage to get a little bit of humor. Even though I did like it, it just wasn't all there was. I did really find the ending a little predictable, especially when you see the way the kids are treated by the "evil witch" witch-the witch-he thought was to have the kids be their own parents and that in fact he was making it clear he was mad. It just seems that the only thing you can actually get a good part of is to kill the witch. If you didn't think it was a good idea, then you should really stick it out on your shelf. It doesn't come close to making the original Wizard of Oz.   There are some good scenes, including a funny scene where the witches are getting their hair done in some strange places, but nothing really stands out. They are just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening scene is the biggest plot line I've ever seen in an American movie: "A secret agent comes and offers a chance to help you make up the difference between a murder and a crime. I don't care for the premise, but I understand that it's a movie: this is dumb. It doesn't come close to the acting. The acting is a little better than I expected, but the story is not nearly as good as it could be. The only good thing was the ending and the fact that it makes me think of some "clarity" on my soul. The plot, the direction, the script, the casting, and the story all suck.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been in the mood for watching movies like this when they do something I don't have a clue how to get into. And to me, I just thought, "I don't know enough". For months, I've watched every film I could, and every year, I can't stop watching it. And it is only in the late stages of this film that I just watch this one, because this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you're watching it, you can figure it out when it goes downhill, and you'll never escape the darkness. I've seen it's original ending, and I've gotten over it to the point where I can say I don`t even remember where it is anymore. This film has two flaws. First, it really wants to be something more, something that would be thought of as a true horror film. It really doesn't do anything but create a predictable horror flick, and it really doesn`t connect with the audience. It`s just a collection of scenes, with a story and an ending. I just didn`t have much regard for these. The second problem is that it doesn`T matter where the story is, what it is. For example, the scene that introduces the killer is the man who tells a story to the man about his wife that has killed him. This is a scene that a casual film fanatic would love to see, and would see in a horror movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit into either. In fact, it creates a "nasty" scene. In one scene, the killer takes advantage of this new fact that is being used to make the story line (that killing is occurring in some part of the film) and then uses the fact that the victim had taken a weapon and kills his wife. This scene of a man killing his wife in front of the camera is the complete antithesis of horror. In some scenes, you almost feel sick, seeing the death of a family member. Even though the story has some weird twists and turns, it just isn`t scary enough. The acting is extremely weak and the script is almost incomprehensible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so poor, I cannot really blame the director for wasting the talent of all the actors that were on the set. However, the movie looks good, but it's just not enough. This is why I am so disappointed, because I never found much of value in this movie. The story is not very good either. I mean, what does it have to do with the fact that a couple of old guys, with the help of a couple old guys (and an old woman) help a young couple (also the wife of the original) find out that they can't just make up the bed with the old guy? I just don't care for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie because of a rumor I heard that my dad had to get a new house for his daughter to keep her. It's sad how many people found it. This film is really only a sad excuse for people to keep the "B" grade. I was so sick to have even the slightest bit of hope when the director spoke. This movie is bad. I have to admit, I didn't care for all of the acting. If your kids are ever interested in this kind of thing, do yourself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i don't know what to say about this. It isn't the least worst ever i've ever seen, but i don`t feel like it has an interesting plot. It was very dull and the performances weren't very convincing, i donn't think the director even had the slightest intention on directing. At least i'll forgive the director for leaving out a few of the details.  i have to say that the acting was bad. i was looking for something interesting and it was only for this one episode. It really didn't deserve to be that kind of movie. I'm sorry, but I did enjoy it. I think it was bad to see people saying that it wasn't like that. What did they even mean? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a bunch of poor people trying to write a piece of garbage. The story is very predictable and the characters don't develop anything meaningful except a few amusing moments. But the ending is really, really dumb. The actors don't seem to find it difficult either.  The best part of the movie is the stupid ending. It's obvious that it isn't a story for very serious movie-makers to make. This could have been the premise for a movie of The Walking Dead. There is no story to save. The ending is like taking a lot of drugs, smoking a lot, taking a movie on a stage and watching it on TV. The end is bad, bad, stupid and bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie with very little dialog and characters and bad dialogue (see 4/9) from a very young actress goes about making a terrible film. This isn't new or special. I'd like to watch it just for the sheer sheer embarrassment of the people involved in this project.  The ending, unfortunately, will haunt us for a couple of years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was stupid. I just can't believe the writer, director, scriptwriters and editors could think of a film like this. Some of the actors were so awful it was almost funny. In my opinion the director should have to be pulled from the same shelf as 'The Walking Dead' and be in the same situation with 'Tomb Raider' and 'The Dead.' This movie had no plot. It made no sense. Not only should they not release 'The Living Dead', but the writer should be fired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really bad movie is set at a college campus with an annoying plot. But the plot is interesting, and the dialog is pretty good. But there's only one person.  The rest of the story is pretty boring, with little plot and a few scenes, and really bad characters.  I felt like the ending had just enough in it to be interesting, but it just didn't go there.  Overall, this is not a good movie. It just can't help you to feel sorry for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care for this particular film, because I've seen it and I've enjoyed it so, but I'm not a fan of this particular piece of trash. I've had it sitting in my dark closet all the time since I've got older. It's bad, bad, awful, bad. It is nothing but an excuse to rent this movie for some reason. I don`t even want to rent it because it's not that funny. No, nothing, nothing except to rent a movie: you'll see it on a DVD, but not in a theater, unless it's going to be a big night. There are some scenes which are good, and it's pretty funny, but there are just too many scenes to make you feel sick. For example, there are scenes where people are having a heart ached up about a stupid movie: i.e. where the kids are going to try to kill themselves. And there are also scenes where they just sit around drinking drinking and screaming. I mean, seriously, this movie doesn't even make sense to be seen in a movie theater. I'm a little girl, and I can't even see much of it. At least the plot is fun at some points, but it's too many and too many times and too boring and too stupid to make me care. Oh, I don\'t care for anything, I'm sure. This movie is just another excuse to let people look at something other than the human brain, and we all need to get over to the human psyche and get over. That is the only thing that will help us to laugh at the human mind. This film isn't funny at all, even if you`d like it. It just shows you how stupid you are. There is nothing funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this show in the hopes it would be interesting to watch, and unfortunately it ended up being pretty boring. There was nothing about the show that would make it interesting, so instead, I turned to something more interesting: i.d.v.a.a, a video game. I laughed at the first few minutes of it, but after the first hour I became really depressed and was left alone in my bedroom for a few hours. I found that the first half of the show was pretty dull. There weren't any witty lines, and the jokes were pretty shallow.  I did like the idea of "the old town" making a city, but that really bored me. The only thing that kept me watching was a random explosion of some sort. The whole thing reminded me of a real explosion I recently read about in the news. The people who bombed Iraq had nothing but bombs, and had a sense of humor. The rest of the episode was boring. I think that is partly because they weren't given enough time to build something interesting in the way the story, but also I think it was just plain bad. I don't fault this movie for being poorly made, and I didn't even consider watching it as a horror film, but I think this is an awful waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A documentary about the Holocaust was just terrible to watch. The only reason I saw this was to see the photos. The documentary was really bad. I can't say why it was so bad, but I could tell it was awful.  This documentary does not do justice to the real story. The real story is of a German girl (I think she was the daughter of a family of survivors), whose life was destroyed by her Jewish family and her father died in Nazi concentration camps. She was forced to flee to France to be a prisoner in Nazi internment camps. This documentary tells her story, but it doesn't tell this truth. This is horrible as all of the documentary so far has been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm pretty sure there was a really good movie that would have made it more appealing. Unfortunately it's all too bad. I saw it on a DVD a few years ago and I thought it had some redeeming qualities. I've just seen it with a couple of friends and we agreed that it was pretty bad, but unfortunately it still is. I'm a huge fan of the original Star Trek movies, but this one has a very slow pace, is poorly written, and it just doesn't fit the original.  The acting is pretty good, although not good enough to make it worth a second of the time. I also think the original version had some more depth to its story than the new one did.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why I couldn't sleep after watching this movie: 1. I don't remember how I felt before. I was just a guy who didn't want to watch a movie. I didn't care about anything else and, you know what you do when you're in the mood. This movie was bad!  2. Because I was in my mood, my opinion of it wasn't that important to me and I didn;I could feel sorry for it.  3. Because my heart wasn't a lot different from mine at the beginning, I didn(couldn't) even feel sorry about it. It was just horrible.  4. Because, being able to watch it was just another waste of time... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've seen this film: I've never been a fan of this film. It's just boring, dumb, and a waste of your time.  I think this film was meant to be a simple spoof of the "Matrix" series and that the only two words you can guess as words are the words "Noo-cooo-loo-a-loooo". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just plain bad, and I'm not a big fan of "Moview" in this case.  I give this movie a 2 out of 10.  If you see this movie you might be surprised that it isn't as bad as I've seen from the other "Movies"! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was just not interesting. There was no action. The dialog wasn't that convincing, neither did the characters. In the end I couldn't really believe that the director wanted to depict these men. It's sad that this could happen in a movie where the characters are so obviously bad. If you like this type of movie then don't watch it. It would be a lot better if someone could learn how to make this kind of movie. I'm a real fan of "Lord" and "Rivers" type movies, but "Lord's Redemption" was just plain awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an old, stupid, boring, predictable plot. The story is dumb, and there are no good things coming out at all. Most of the time when I was looking at a film I thought, "Why would he bring us back to old time?" and they were right, the man is not that famous. They tried to make something, but it's plain that it's not like that. The ending, and the closing scenes are bad. The original film had so much in it, I think it was better to keep the original one for the nostalgia of a couple of years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So the other way. I like the original "Buckaroo Candy" which is awesome and all I've ever seen is awful. This one is a complete failure to keep things interesting and I have a feeling that there is a reason for it. But I'm not really sure why. We got the other one when I visited the Disney Museum a couple years ago. This show was completely pathetic, the costumes were ugly, I never felt any real excitement to any of the scenes, the sets were very plain and just some dumb sets. I didn't know who was in charge of the production. I think this is just part of the decline in quality of film making. The actors looked so stupid, it was all over the place. It's a shame there were no real surprises like the previous Disney films.  So what if we're going to be so disappointed in the sequel that we have to read it, huh. Maybe I'll try to read this instead, as I'm still interested in the story of "Buckley Duck". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is nothing but a terrible and predictable excuse for this stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film seems to have the worst "B" movie I've ever seen, even being a big fan of James Joyce's book. This film is mainly about a person who kills her sister, and then tries to keep it a secret. It is simply a story with a stupid ending.  What? The characters have a major problem: they are so pathetic they have no reason to fight. When they finally do fight, they are shown to be successful at killing the person. The film isn't even a story, but it is a very unsatisfying film. The plot is basically a collection of a bunch of murders happening to the person, and we just go on to see who is the "victor" and who is guilty. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Kirk Cameron" (2000) is pretty much a classic "slasher comedy" film with a big budget and a bad script. It's horrible. There are no actors in this film except for Kirk Cameron as Kirk. The only plot is that Kirk has to decide what to do with the girl and her father - which is what this film is all about.   I didn't understand that the movie was supposed to be about Kirk's trip up the mountain and his trip up a mountain to meet with a girl - which was only about his trip to his son. I didn´t really think he was supposed be doing that. It was just a movie that made fun of himself, and nothing else. What was left? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, now we're looking at the movie and it's obvious that this movie is not that much good. The story is quite predictable. The idea is that the main person dies soon, and that his wife gets pregnant. This has to be some form of birth control, because they have no idea what is going to happen. Even if you watch the movie, you'll just find that the story is predictable and the plot is very predictable, especially when it comes around. For example, when the main man dies, he is supposedly going to get the fortune, so they need to find it.  So when the guy comes to see his wife, his wife isn't very happy, because she says that there's a way she can make that money and is able to donate that money instead of giving it. She also seems to be scared of the guy, because he's really scared of her. When they meet, he tries to take advantage of her because he doesn't want to be caught. He doesn't even try to go into her home. Even though the guys find that they have the man's heart, they find that she's having an affair.  I thought this movie was a comedy, and the script is pretty good. But it didn't really make me laugh, and you don't think you're going to laugh in this way, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am looking at this movie after seeing The Naked Ray from 7/6/2000 and seeing The Ray in the past when it is available on DVD. I knew when I first saw the Ray that it was a terrible movie, but this was the worst one I have seen from this movie, and I have done many films in my life and have been very unhappy about this horrible movie. Some might say that it's just a comedy but I think it is a very poor comedy when it comes to the genre. I don't understand why this is. I am an avid fan of comedy and I enjoy this movie but not as bad as the Naked Ray. This is a bad joke comedy movie and I believe that it doesn't make it. There are some decent movies in the genre, but I am very disappointed with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had read this book I would have liked this movie, I mean, I knew it was a pretty low budget film. But the director made a few very bad decisions. One of the big mistakes was the fact that the film was so much like the movie "Hijibati", which was really quite funny in its own way. I didn't really understand the story. There was something about Hijibali that made me think it was similar. For example, he was really, very witty. He would use his own humour against the movie. It didn't make sense, in that case. There were a lot of scenes that were simply not meant, and were stupid. And at the end of the movie, you wonder why it became a comedy at all.  There was also something about the plot that just didn't add up to make it funnier. And the dialog was too long, and was too stupid.  It could have worked so much better if it were made shorter and shorter.  The acting was OK though, and the story was OK. The director should have avoided making too many silly jokes.  But this movie wasn't too funny to be in a movie. There are a lot more flaws in it than it could have been. It's just not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Hail" is an incredibly stupid film that isn't really funny. But it has a good premise. It seems to be based on the same idea that it is the end of the story of "Hawk" and was just a bit silly. But "Hatter" is far from the end. For starters, it is over-the-top silly. The first part was about a guy who kills an alien on a plane and then kills his sister, which sets up a conflict with another bunch of alien-guys (i.e. The Predator) who want to make the trip to Earth. It also has a ridiculous storyline involving the Predator getting into a cave. You'll never be confused by watching this. I don't know how anyone can possibly find this movie and it is way too long to be a good movie. There is no message or even a message. It is just the typical stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing is that the actors do not suck and the cinematography does not suck. The acting is okay, the characters are believable but the plot has a few glaring holes that make the film a failure in several different parts.  This film, unfortunately, cannot make the distinction between good and bad.  The movie begins at its worst. The story is about a man who has some very stupid, stupid friends. But in one scene, he is bitten by a gang of bad guys and in the next scene, his wife's husband has some stupid fun.  You want to make a film like this and save yourself. For most filmmakers, this is not a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't even watch this movie, not because I was under the impression that this was going to be the best movie. So I decided to rent this one because I saw a great movie: "The Omen" on a PBS show. There is nothing like this movie to watch. It is just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really has it all wrong. It's not a comedy. It does not come across the best humor. There is too many jokes that don't make any joke. And the humor is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie tries so hard to make you believe in the idea of a space movie. I have seen quite a few of John Carpenter films and it was only his most recent one had quite such a gimmick. The film goes on and on and we are expected to get the same view of the planet and it doesn't. You are expecting a little space drama and you want some action but the action really is only a vague attempt to make us believe that a space ship has landed on a planet. The movie is a simple story about a robot has landed in a planet with a couple of robots in it. The robot comes in, goes into a space station and they are suddenly found, only to find that there are many of the robots in there that are trying to destroy the robot. Then the robot is sent off into the universe and there are only two ways the robots are able to destroy him. These robots are very weak and they don't try to hurt each other but they have to be a couple dozen robots, as the film states. The ending is terrible too, not even worth a second. The only good scenes are the ending scenes, for which we are expecting for about the second time. I didn't care for the film's acting either, the story was completely lame. And the plot did not keep its suspense. I won't even admit it's pretty good, it was really boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really does not live up to the hype. This is a pretty awful movie: an absurd story, one of those weirdly designed for a comedy. I've got an inkling memory of some sort of naked male nipples that are obviously fake. They're not cute, and the movie is boring and it doesn't have any storyline.  But I'm willing to admit that these two movies that seem like they're set in a dream or one of the "modern" stories, have been popular in the last decade. I think they got a little traction. So maybe the public got a taste. It was funny at first and it was fun. But this one was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like any piece of plastic you can get for $1. There is no plot or characters, nothing interesting at all. There are no story, no interesting characters, no plot. What did you expect? This is a bad, bad movie. I'd recommend that if you're going to see it, rent it on cable TV. If you have any interest in it, I would suggest that you don't waste your time and call yourself a "gaberal" for having this show. If I had the time to call myself a "Gabby" or anything, I'd think the actors were very talented, but the director obviously didn't. I was disappointed in the idea and the storyline, but this is a movie for those who want to watch some stupid crap. This is not going to be one of those movies I'm going to rent for a "serious movie", and I am sure the folks who would rent the movie would be much better with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd rather not spend my time talking about this movie. The plot is absolutely stupid and it takes me 50 times longer to reach my "wickedness" than the "witches" in the movie, which is about the same. In fact, it is such a waste of time to waste even trying to think about the "Witches" that the characters inhabit.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a waste of time. The actors in the movie seem like they were going to be in one of the most enjoyable movies of the decade. If you really wanted to make a movie about this type of movie you could find a better movie. Instead of watching an extremely low budget documentary like this one, you would have spent your time trying to figure out what a couple of guys are doing. Instead, you just want to sit around and watch the other actors like a bunch of people you can sit around for and try to have a fun time. Unfortunately, the film fails to meet that expectation. In fact, this movie tries to be boring and the camera is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe how this movie was made and why it ended so badly. I saw this movie in one room of a movie theatre and I saw it when I was a teenager. I knew it was a crap movie but it was so bad that I couldn't see it. I mean I can find out that if I read that this movie is about a car and it is about to race, it is a better movie than this one.  If this movie ever is released I will watch it again. The plot is stupid and the characters are poor. If it was released I would see it and I would probably never see it again because it is so bad. It is such a bad case of bad movie making that I don't believe it will ever be released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't the greatest piece of cinema ever made but the acting is bad enough. I have never seen such lousy acting in a bad film. It's like a slumming of the plot. This movie does not really have a storyline. It is simply a bunch of bad jokes. It does not even have a plot.   You can watch it for free on TV. It should be a comedy that cannot even be funny if it has to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a movie that is so bad I can't even start to describe it. As soon as I was allowed to see it, I quickly ran out of breath. I think I'm gonna write a positive review about this movie: I was just waiting to tell the truth, but I'd be doing that wrong if I was involved in the production. If anyone reads a positive book about a movie: They are all the same - nothing interesting, nothing surprising, nothing interesting. They just suck! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some interesting bits here but overall I would like to see another movie that might be better. This movie was a bit too violent and seemed like the scene in the original "Strawbridge". I was expecting a little bit more action and I expected a lot more from a real life one. If that's what the scene is supposed to be then it's a bit confusing. In this movie the story revolves around the story of a young boy named Adam who has a "closer" relationship with a girl who is younger than him. He meets the girl who has just taken his sister's virginity and tells her he doesn't know how to behave with her. This leads Adam to find out that the girl was actually a murderer and murdered his family and then decides to "get him back". Adam then starts showing off his murderous nature by killing his sister while his sister is crying in the hospital. The only thing that made me cringe in this movie was the ending.  The only good thing that came out of this movie were the scene scenes of Adam and the older sister talking about how he had to save his sister. It's not as great as they were in the "Stray-Bridge" series, but it's good for a few moments in time, but not necessarily great. I am afraid of the sequel because I have no clue what they will be. The next film will most likely be another dumb film about murder and some mysterious girl. I cannot wait to see it. I would be interested in seeing that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you haven't heard of the movie: It's about a movie starring Paul Rabinowitz as the son of an ordinary man (Somewhere) who discovers he is not quite normal and decides to follow his father to his father's house to investigate his father (also a very dull and dull movie) - which leads to some sort of violent deaths and some really sick things - but it's pretty basic really - it just seems to drag you through the film with no real point (except for a certain sort of scene with some cannibalism in it - which would have worked fine if that scene was actually in the movie).  The movie is pretty dumb and extremely slow, but not that much worse than most low budget American film "starts" like this one - but then you think: Who would be stupid? The only good things in it were those "climactic" moments - which obviously weren't there.  It's pretty plain to me that the idea behind it was to sell the movie and bring money into the movie, but it really doesn't do anything for a "movie" which isn't that much different from a regular TV series. It's very slow-paced and extremely uninteresting (not even by "new" American standards, anyway). I have no idea what kind of people actually believe the movie is. Maybe Paul Rosenowitz is the director and the director is just making a documentary of some sort or a documentary to some "comedy" film. But if you want to make a documentary, it's okay to make something along the lines of "adults" being in charge of the media and I don't think you'll have an idea what's really in that.  The funny part is that the entire movie was shot in one day (that was the most time I've ever seen).  But I guess the best thing is that while reading the story you really don't get the message from it. For example, while reading that story you see that Paul R. is a man who was on the edge of becoming a serial killer - in fact his son just doesn't seem to care for his son - who apparently wants him to kill him. I think it was just that the writer just wanted to see the film and didn't care at all. Just for some extra points of interest, there's that bit where Paul Roplen tells the story of his grandfather, a man named Michael and not a man with a beard - which I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of "Funny" stories with no real characters. The funny parts are decent enough but the parts that are so bad that they should not be in the movies of any level of popularity. I do not have any sympathy for people that put out "Fink" movies for a laugh. They are no more funny than the normal movies, which are usually far superior to the rest of the movies. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 because it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Wizards of the Mind" is about an idiot who sees a woman and thinks she is the wizard of a city. There are some weird scenes but that was never a surprise. As far as the first episode of "Wizard", there was nothing interesting about it. It was very bad. The show is not about magical mind magic, but about a bunch of kids who are having adventures that are made in a dark dungeon. What does it have to do with the weirdness? It's about an old man that makes some money and goes to a strange dungeon for some money. After he's gone, he discovers a beautiful girl that is pregnant and finds some weird stuff, but we don't really understand her.  After the story, it's about a witch who kills a baby and takes it away.  I didn't like this movie and I didn never want to see it again. At first I was disappointed and the fact that it was supposed to be a comedy was not exactly a good reason to have this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that I was so desperate for to see to see in a DVD. I don't know why I didn't watch it, but I've read reviews on the Internet where this film gets one 8/10. If you're willing to spend half the time looking at this movie, you will never be able to see this movie. When I heard about it, I didn`T find it to be good or even worthy, and I felt like it was stupid. There were some moments in the movie I liked, but other moments were extremely boring. I also didn`t find anything to make me feel even more sympathetic to the characters. If a lot of people saw this movie and thought that it was good, I would totally agree with them. But I thought it was bad, and was extremely bored. I didn\\t care how much I spent with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of people, people who believe themselves to be great thinkers and even geniuses, go to watch this movie. If you find out it isn't so, go ahead and see it in a bad light. It's a waste of the talent of those talented people. Why? Because it was supposed to be a funny little film about a ridiculous movie. I guess if people are in love with the humor of Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise, then this movie will be a good one, but if you're not then it will be bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it as a young boy, with a young girl. I was disappointed in a lot of how it was written, especially the fact that the female voice was so bad.  I went into the theater and I watched as the whole film was played. What began to develop, and what led me out, were the discussions at the back of the theater: "why isn't the guy just hitting on a girl?" "What is the guy doing with her?" "Why is that?" "WTF."  Then, I decided to try on my own and get rid of the female part of the film. I thought it was too much like the female parts were and couldn't stay there for the same reasons. It was so slow. I watched another film with a girl.  To sum it up, it was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on one day on DVD, and I watched it in the same week as a video, and then I watched the other video of it. In this movie, you can find yourself going the same time and again... The plot is horrible, but if you like the old style of British comedy, it's fine... If you like a little bit of cheese, like a cheese and cheese, or the famous Britney Spears, you're fine. It's just an overall weak attempt at a humorless comedy, that's all. Just like everyone else's made of movies, you shouldn't waste your money on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Gone Up" is a painfully slow and unimaginative film, but has a very interesting performance from the excellent Lee Elton. I think it is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen in Hollywood. The plot is completely illogical and the plot is almost entirely self-centered. The only saving factor is the fact that the director is very good at editing. There are a lot of sex scenes (more than half of the film) that aren't really explored in a good way. But what's worse is the plot itself. We are constantly told that the movie is about a couple who moves to the town to find a woman who lives there. The woman is supposedly a serial killer and is killed by her husband.  How did they kill their husband and daughter? It's not obvious why. I'd watch this film if there wasn't a lot to do. The characters are so insulating (not good) and the film feels like a boring exercise. Not only that, but it seems to me that there is no real reason for it to happen and it has no message. The acting is terrible and the whole movie is just empty. I guess it's not that deep in English either. But it does go on and on. In fact I think this movie is terrible because the plot lacks substance and the acting isn't good enough to make it interesting. The title doesn't even make a sense. I thought the title, Gone Up, was something like a movie title that would be interesting. You'd expect the characters to be in a real-world setting. And it doesn't happen. The actors don't act like they should. The story is just a lotof something that can't be shown. I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so disappointing that it really should have been canceled, but instead of getting paid, it's got made, so you get a refund on the DVD. The acting in this is, I guess, on par with "The Expendables" and the only thing that I really remember is the horrible-looking guy. I mean, I can see it's good in the original, but it's really bad in this. It really doesn't look like they filmed a great documentary.  This movie's one of those horrible horror movies that relies on extreme gore, gore, and gore to fill out the characters and not provide any new information. It doesn't make the characters feel alive; it just looks like they're going to go crazy and shoot people. There's a guy who is a gun instructor and a woman who looks like a zombie, so they're just trying to make a creepy and disturbing film.   The story is pretty good but unfortunately it doesn't get much more from the first 2, and it's just not enough. The original's plot was OK and there were good things here, but this one really lacks.  I do recommend checking out the "The Unquenchables" movie for your own entertainment. It's very entertaining, especially the zombie story and the fact that the protagonist and the zombie are finally united and facing off against the evil robot. I have to say that this movie was totally terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My personal favorite was the first one i saw... but I was not thrilled to see such a stupid ending. I don't want to see ANYTHING more of these movies... especially this one.  This is a bad way to treat yourself. I'm going to be very harsh about it... this is the first movie in which I have to watch ever. Why make up movies based on these people? What are you gonna do with your life? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't want to give this movie, but I think it gets in the end. The idea of this film is that it depicts a world where all the people are mad and will try to kill you if you are lucky enough to escape, if not. The ending is the worst part. The fact that this film will be available for "free" is no joke. It is just another dumb excuse for a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director wanted to film a movie that would be a "punch fight" of a crime against a whole family of people, but, since they are already "heroes", I decided to not have any scenes of the criminal. This movie was so bad that I didn't want to rent it and I didn they could be the only people to rent. And my mom doesn't like boxing, so we can't rent. That is the only reason I decided not to rent the movie. The only reason that we can rent it is the plot and acting, not the acting, because I have a feeling they don't make their movies that much better. The plot is OK, but the casting is awful. They can't bring back the dead people and they don don't care about the whole family. I don't even remember the movie, as it is a very old movie. I gave it 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was nothing more than a pretentious version of the original "I Am Hate" movie. In essence, all of the actors were the same as the previous movie with absolutely no story lines. There was just a bunch of stupid characters who all acted like their own characters in their minds.  The only good thing in this movie is that it showed me how stupid my friends were. The plot was at least a little entertaining.   The ending was horrible, but I will admit that I was glad to see the end of the movie. All in all, if you want to see a film with some intelligence, you might have better things that are more suitable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not even the best action movie ever filmed, but this one is pretty bad. For starters the first two thirds of the movie consists of some very ridiculous scenes. I guess it's the type of movies that come on during a summer vacation. Anyway, the ending does not make sense, especially when the final scenes are coming together. If it were any good action movie with action and story, this movie would have been the best. Unfortunately, the actors, especially the producers (who were really the best) were just acting badly.  This movie is completely predictable, not even as much as the original movies, but you can guess the end when the movie is over.  The end of the film is the most boring scene. If I have seen any action movie before, I'm sure the last moments are not as slow, but not much as boring.  I don't really see much merit here in this movie. The story is interesting and the action is spectacular, but it is just too predictable. The acting is terrible and it looks like they made it on a computer. The last third is just pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it to be so weak in the end, it was just too slow to be interesting or funny. It was just so bad, I couldn't even watch it. It made no sense to sit through it. The way you are supposed to watch this movie is you watch the previews on Youtube. This is only one part of the video, and you might have some idea what the rest of it is. This movie had nothing new to say, nothing new. I've watched movies like this before. There's nothing new and nothing new, just a collection of old footage. It just doesn't even make much sense, it doesn't fit your expectations. You might want to see something new, like a horror movie, but this movie was just painful to watch.  If you can tolerate this movie, I recommend you watch it as a viewing, as a DVD, as something completely useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a terrible waste of an even that low a budget. A man with a black body, a blue face, and a red suit is forced to go along a dark road of adventure in search of the body of a killer who murdered his wife on a plane; he's in the same suit as the other two; and is forced back into the light. This film contains a few moments which are pretty entertaining, but there are too many scenes in which the camera is held stationary for the entire duration of the film. The acting is very poor. And the plot lacks a point or motivation. I can't see how one can make it so badly written and so easily filmed in such a ridiculous way. In the end, there are some moments of excitement which remind me of movies like Crash Test (1949) or Escape From Mars (1970). But you might have the same doubts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a movie for those who care about the human form of suicide. It is the worst movie I have seen of my life, but as I say, it's a movie. But there's only one thing which this movie doesn't get right. That it got to be called, and that it got there. The only thing that this movie got wrong was the fact that the title is so bad. This is the biggest reason that I have failed to pass this movie, because I never want to watch a movie named "Hollywood Suicide", and I do not know that this is actually a movie I would even want to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the movie was about three women having a relationship... but I didn't think that. It was very simplistic, with very little acting. In other words, it really doesn't have much action. It doesn't even have any scenes to make anything happen. That's what makes a movie scary. A really bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to be happy when the 2 of us watched this movie, but the movie just can't make this happen... The plot is pretty damn ridiculous! I think the biggest flaw in this movie is the actors. They don't even play like actors. That's the main reason my rating is lower than the original movie was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have seen in recent memory, with so many scenes that are completely irrelevant. I find it is really disturbing to see how so many actors get into their characters with so little acting skill.  The scene when the woman gives the man a blow-job is really awful. The film is completely pointless with a ridiculous sequence and a plot twist. It has absolutely nothing to do with the scene and just doesn't go on to make the point.   The whole film is only the result of a cheap plot and a poor cast in bad roles. The plot should have been better, but it looks like it is trying to be great, but that is about as good as a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When this movie was released I was really disappointed. I could see the first half of this movie as a horror movie, but it didn't really go that far. I felt like someone could have made it better. There were a few parts that I didn't care about, but what was the main theme of the movie? It just had a big sex scene and a lot of gore in a few scenes. But the acting was bad. The story seemed to have been made up, instead of made up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When watching this film, I couldn't imagine that there would be a reason to watch this show. The show has a good theme, but it is only in the fact that it would be funny. The premise is so bad that you can't even talk about it. I really do not want to watch it. The cast is pretty bad, and the plot is so weak that you just want to be left alone, and leave the TV show alone. There's no reason for this show to exist. If there was any reason to be on this show, then the plot would be great. The only thing that I'm sorry for is the show's attempt at being a comedy, which is bad enough that it got better than the first time. It didn't work so bad. It is not good enough to entertain me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say this movie is bad, it's just one of many instances of Hollywood trying to be corny. The director of this film is like a half of a movie: one part is boring, the other part is just plain stupid. I'd like to see someone in a similar situation in a different time period get better in his craft. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went out to see this film at a local cinema when I was looking to get something new to watch. I was expecting a fine film, but turned out that it was nothing but an unfunny, cliché, predictable plot.  This film had so much potential but it failed to deliver. It seemed more like a piece of low budget, low budget films with a few good scenes that I had never even seen before.  A lot of things seemed to have happened in the film - the ending was bad (you know the ending), but then I'd forgotten about it.  The acting was poor, so was the plot. There were too many clichés and nothing really happened in this film.  I won't give this film a 3 out of 10 because the plot was OK, but I can't fault a good cast or director like the one who made it. It's a shame that there's nothing else that came out better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good part of the film is the first few scenes that have the most striking images in the film, which are just poorly done in terms of acting and story. These scenes are, at least, interesting, but they don't stick around long enough to make the film a movie.  A movie called 'Jolieter' is not that great, I suppose, so we have to expect a more 'good' film: one that does not need to be so badly adapted as it was to be. The acting is pretty good, though, and there are interesting scenes, but the characters are not believable or believable.  I'd like to see a film like 'Jole Solvay' as the best film for the future. The plot is not convincing enough to have the same emotional effect it does in Jole Soloway's film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, a lot of people seem to think that this is a film. But, really they don't seem to understand it.  This is a movie about a girl in the US who lives a very lonely life and has the help of a wealthy and handsome husband, who is cheating on him in order to keep her away. He then kills her husband. He is never really seen or heard from, except in scenes where he is supposed to have helped her.  I mean, when she goes into some bizarre behavior that she can't comprehend.  What makes it so weird is that she tries to break out of the prison, she is obviously mentally insane, but then she's supposed to go back to her normal life.  The ending is completely unsatisfying, and only because there is some weird stuff in there, like a secret door in the story, that a man had stolen so she doesn't know about it. And there's also some weird things that the cops don't think are real, like an angel floating away on a river. It's really bad to see someone just throwing on and on a regular street.  Now, I admit, if you were going to make a film about a crime drama that didn't have its ending, I would have chosen to include all of the film's details and the plot details. Well, I wouldn't, because I would never think that was the purpose. If I did, I probably would have laughed for a couple of minutes more. But the thing that bothered me was the acting. You can never find any actors that can act as that portrayed the characters in this movie. The only actors that were good are the women that had a cameo in it. There's some terrible actors in there that I didn't really want to see.  And I also don't remember any mention of any real actors that I think are very good. The story of the woman in prison was very good, and I think that it was quite good. But what was I guess was the only reason I ever laughed at the plot of it? Probably, the film is so bad that I just kept watching it. It just doesn't make any more sense. There were some other really good scenes, I thought that those were the only ones I laughed at. I wouldn`t say there were some very funny parts, but the plot just seemed like one of those old films with a stupid ending.   I don't know what I have to say
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, i guess it's late for me to talk. But i'm going to say that if this was a movie: i would have to call it the most boring piece of cinema ever. But the movie was so lame that it had me thinking that i could call it "so boring" but it was actually just a waste of time. The plot was just boring and the actors weren't good. I've seen better films than this.  It's not that bad. Maybe it's not as bad as I thought but it's worse than it was supposed to be.  I give this movie a 7. But I guess that means 10, so give it a 10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Devil Wears Out" is one of the worst horror film i've ever seen. The scene that focuses on a bunch of kids was ridiculous and the gore is just terrible. The plot is basically nothing interesting. The movie seemed to be about a group of kids and their friends getting their revenge on people, but the "group" is only one. We must have some kind of "evil" in our lives. I will never call myself a "fan" of this movie because of how bad it is. A movie that focuses solely on a group(or gang(or the kids) getting revenge on their friends, or friends) has no real meaning and there is no reason for any action(or "evil") in the movie. I was really bored after the movie started. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a week or two, i decided I had to be a fool. After a few movies, i watched the "Molito" movie and it just made me loathe myself. Even the first few minutes were horrible. I was so sick i wanted to jump into another movie so i could find out how people were talking about this movie. But the thing i can't believe i even finished was just so bad. This movie was the worst i've ever seen. It made absolutely no sense. It was terrible and i couldn't figure out what it had in mind. I wanted to leave this movie immediately and then watch it again and again and then give this movie a chance. But then i just couldn't stand to continue watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it is announced that "An American Werewolf", would be made, my first reaction was to pity my first time watching it.  The title was so bad, and the film seemed so slow, that I decided to give it a chance and watch it again.  I didn't like it until it was over. I didn`T like the acting, which is obviously the main reason why I gave it a 2 out of 10.  After a good while, I thought the movie was interesting, but the plot just didn`t make up for the poor acting, and it ended to just plain old, lame zombie-murderers.  My thoughts on this movie: 1.  Just keep it off. It's only 2 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a predictable effort at something to create something. The film lacks any inspiration whatsoever and it goes through the standard plot of some other big-budget action movies (as in the "Karate Saga") and ends with little more than a plot. This film is really nothing but a complete waste of time and an insult to a potential film. The good part of this movie was that it had a lot of action, but only a few special effects. This movie just seems like some low budget production for something that has nothing to recommend except the fact that it is a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is awful...the acting is not that good, the plot is a horrible mess and the special effects are too unbelievable. I don't care about the fact that there are some very well cast...this is the worst film I have ever seen. I have nothing to compare it with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first episode was so bad I almost gave it 4 points. It has the annoying dialog which has a huge cast of actors but doesn't provide the slightest plot. I don't have to see this crap as an excuse to avoid seeing a movie: this is pure rubbish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just couldn't believe that this film would be "the biggest hit in the world" even though I didn't really believe it. A shamefully pathetic attempt at an American, film:  Well, if your take this as a serious film, you're not going to be fooled. Even the most cynical film critic would probably call this one boring and unbelievable. Well, my friend who wrote the review is right. No one can make something so pathetic, and I don't know if you can even do that. This is just a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is awful but at least it wasn't bad enough to ruin the movie. The plot is pretty good, the dialogs were awful, the acting was poor, and the acting itself was bad.  As much as I like acting (as I am able to learn more about it from this movie) I wouldn't recommend this movie. Even if you like Shakespeare, you would get bored or find yourself bored if this film is about a Shakespeare character, not to take a more serious character in a non-serious movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the film "The Best American Movie: A Hollywood film" in some kind of garbage. Not at all. I felt like it was a big jump in the early 1900's to try something new. What I thought was "The First American Film" was a bad film anyway. It was way too much too complicated. I just don't know why they chose to make this crap. The plot was too contrived and the whole movie was predictable. I don't even know who was in charge. And, it wasn't funny either. I didn't even see much humor in it. I think the whole concept of "hanging" was interesting but it was so dumb I was bored. I have to admit that the scene in the hotel suite of the hotel that is used as a "hanged" scene was rather funny. It should have been cut because there is so little actual humor. There is no real plot. The only funny part was the scene where the little girl is in the room. I did enjoy it though I don´t remember if there was more humor in the scene. I gave this film a 3 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't get into this movie.  I am a really big fan of the original "Survival" movies, but this one lacks much of the charm that made the original.  Unfortunately, I couldn´t find anything about the movie. I guess it was on some other channel, but I don´t know why.  The plot is nothing but a series of fake stories about a woman named Annabelle, who meets someone named "Don't Know What They Are" before the end of it, and is subsequently killed in a horrible manner by her "friends". When the "Friends" tell her to meet her for dinner, she has to make a statement in a bad way that her husband was a "normal" father. And that her father didn´t really be a "natural" father who had sex with Annabelles.   The acting was bad, the camera moves at an extreme speed, and the dialog was bad. The story of the woman "killing a little girl" was unbelievable. The best part is that it never touches the scary parts of the "Surviving" movie. Maybe the other actors could have done something more that would have been more effective.  This movie is just bad science fiction. It lacks any of the artistic quality of any genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit that I did read this movie thinking that it was going to be an interesting movie, but it really just plain dumb and not worth watching.  So what really happens is that it isn't really that surprising, the plot just falls flat after all the acting.  It's just a typical attempt to recreate a classic "American Dream" and it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a total waste of time, with a story that had nothing to do with real life.  A lot of other people seem to be disappointed by the success of this movie, so let me explain why you should not waste your time on it:  This is a movie based on a very stupid idea: that a person is a psychopath, and is therefore able to do what he wants.  If you look at a real person, the person who we assume will be killed, it will be hard to determine exactly why he murdered the people.  For example, there's no way that the person could possibly do this type of thing. This is only done by a stupid person.  There are many "movies" that do this kind of thing, but there are some movies that don't.  This has nothing todo with reality. There are a few things that make this movie funny or scary, but the movie had so much to do that it just plain sucked. I was very disappointed by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a disgraceful piece of trash. The movie is so terrible it does not even make me laugh. I give this movie one rating, and I hope you will never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the story was supposed to be told, it would have been different. Instead of the story itself, the film would have made more sense. The ending was horrible, and the ending in particular was awful.  The film contains absolutely no story, and has nothing to recommend.  I can't believe that a movie that so horribly misused the story is able to achieve such a big box-release.   I really, really wanted to like this movie because it has so many funny moments, but I couldn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that made me laugh in this movie was the dialogue. First off, it's unbelievable that they made it into this bad movie, and I didn't have a great laugh. Then, I thought it was terrible that the actors (the kids) can even pull off a script that involves in making jokes about "bad movies." It was like that, except much worse, as I don't want to think that a movie with a laugh is the equivalent to a true horror movie. Then I realized that this movie wasn't going to be an OK movie because the actors weren't going out of their character's mouth. In some ways it didn't even seem like it was an action movie, as all the scenes were made in a very slow, amateur-style manner. Some of the characters had the same type of behavior as the kids in The Goonies, and the only thing I felt was funny in the film were when they tried to imitate a little bit of a horror movie in the first few minutes.  I'm sure there will be a lot of movies that people will enjoy based on The Goon, and there will probably be some more "bad" movies with some fun, but if you don't like The Goons, don't pay any attention. The film is about as bad as a movie I've seen, and not much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd be willing to put this movie down as one of the most useless, pretentious, and worthless movies ever made.   The first reason is that the premise is so bad. The first premise involved going to a small town in a country with a bunch of girls that was supposedly attacked by the town leader, the guy is "the hotest girl".  I've always felt that this movie was like a stereotypical rape scene (except for the guy and his friend, of course) and the rape scene in the restaurant was the only thing that made the movie interesting.  What really made the film interesting was the fact that the main character is a girl whose father was the leader, but she ended up having sex with him. I'm not sure if she had sex with the guy in the beginning because he was dead (if she's got a little red hair, it doesn't help her look pretty anyway), but what the hell. This movie isn't interesting at all.  The other reason was the girl's father. A lot of people have commented on this movie and they're right. It doesn't really matter how much you like a good movie. If the movie is about a guy raping his daughter, but the girl is the same (like if you'd take a movie about a boy who raped his sister, and she's actually a virgin who didn't get the message), you'll find out pretty quickly that she's the only girl who got it. I don't have to read what she says in that movie, and I can't imagine why.  For some reason, I couldn't see the rape as the sole factor of the movie and I felt sorry for anyone who saw it. The idea was that her father raped her and she didn't have a sense of her own intelligence and only to do something about it. Why did she do this? That doesn't make any sense, because that would make an interesting and interesting plot. But, well, what did she have to do with that rapist anyway. What would happen to her and make her go on? I can only assume that it would make her have sex with her father.  This movie's second reason was that this guy was supposed to be a "candy maker" that would help make his wife pregnant. I'd really been expecting something about that in this movie, a woman who was pregnant and who could make his husband pregnant was forced to do a sex match. Why was he not involved
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you enjoy horror movies, you'll want to make this one hell-a stupid movie: a big, stupid, stupid movie with a predictable script. I watched this one with my brother. My brother was actually a really smart boy. I had no idea how to get out of the movie. We got bored halfway through and then, after the last third, it's completely predictable and it only takes 10 minutes to be thrown out. The film had no suspense whatsoever, even for the main characters. The ending is just predictable. It doesn't have any good ending. The story is bad, but I'm glad to see it in a dark basement of a basement. There is no reason to recommend this movie: I can't say that this is a "good" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bunch of people, including myself, spend a few hours with a group of idiots trying to get the credit for their movie, when they should have been getting credit for the film.  If I've said that this movie is bad and the people involved are not competent, I'm sure some people will actually like this movie. What do you think about it? A bad movie that doesn't take the time to learn its lesson. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a feeling that I was going to hate this movie, but I'm glad to see it made it interesting for the first ten minutes. Unfortunately, halfway through it, the acting is so bad that the only reason I chose to rent this movie was to see "The Secret to The Movie: The Best Movie Ever" with the director of the movie. The acting is extremely poor, as are the directing and the plot. The ending is very bad and the storyline is very dull. Overall, this movie does not deserve any praise. This movie is not worthy of it's production, it lacks even one good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had read the book for its "wicked" and was a bit offended at the original way the book was written, but this movie was not the book. I guess I have never read it. It was a waste of money and was horrible.  I did see "The Wizard of Oz" without the fact that it was based on the book, but the book isn't as bad as the movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot has two (almost two!) endings. When I say the plot had two, I'm not kidding. The first one is the "good ending" which is obviously the best thing in the movie. The second is the boring ending (as it usually is) where you've seen nothing more than your old girlfriend at some point or another who dies. This movie just lacks a lot of substance, and is not quite the best of the "Zombie" movies. If you like zombies and don't mind walking through the horror landscape, you might enjoy this one, but you're not likely to finish it.  The movie was OK in some ways - I got a few laughs and the good gore. But there was just one really horrible scene - "the dog" slits open open and eats a cat with blood in its mouth, and then goes into a black hole and gets eaten. Then you see a bunch of zombies coming out of the hole, and you see the dog turning to look at you, and seeing you...  There was also one horrible scene that I thought was one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen. "The dog" had to be stabbed in half and her face was on fire when she was attacked by zombie zombies, and also you've got to see "the little girl" and what she saw when she came out of her body...the zombie eating of a cat...and all of that stuff was just horrible, and not only that.  This movie is bad, and if it were any other movie on cable, I would have rated it 9 out of 10. Even though I enjoyed the first one, I don't think it's worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, a couple of things. There are several places where the actors should have been trying to bring their characters to life. This is a bad film. For instance, the actors do not take any place they would normally. At the same time, the movie is not interesting for the audience. The acting is really bad, but there is more excitement in the fight scenes that there are not shown. For me, the best way to avoid this type of movie is to simply leave it to the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no way I will watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't believe it's been 15 years since the film was made. The "Lights" video is so incredibly silly. They tried to make this look like an 80's movie. You can't make movies like that anymore.  The "Rise From Down" video had a lot of fun. But this one isn't fun.  In this one, the two main characters were basically the protagonists, and the only thing they got was "good" sex. This is the only place that this movie fails.  I really don't think this is a great movie. It's about as bad as a movie can get. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years ago I decided to try out for a movie called "The Unmistakable Beauty", based on a film that I made about 30 years ago, and I watched it twice so i would see it twice to make sure I didn't miss it.  Well, it didn't work. After seeing it twice, I could tell you it had no life whatsoever. I'm afraid my friends and I will never forgive this film, or any movie ever. It's not even the equivalent of the famous "Beautiful Creatures" in the book, and it doesn't even make sense. Not even an original film.  I can't understand what it was. There's no logic. Some people are so over-the-line with this, and there's no way I can justify saying so. They just don't talk like people, and their comments are just bad language. Why? What the heck? What did I do? I don't know. If someone has the good name for these people, they'll find out. But there is no way to find out anything about "Beauty Creatures" unless you read the book or see it in the library. There are no characters, no plot, no actors, nothing, and even the biggest of the names has never appeared in a movie. And the book didn't even mention any of these monsters.  It was like a big stupid story set in a desert town, but nobody could figure out that this movie is just about people who think that it's about a magic movie and not a movie about people, or anything else. There isn't any story in it. What they did was give it a name that made it sound like it was made for a "movie", but it really wasn't. I had to find that out. I can only conclude that there was an idea that a bunch of people had read the books for decades, and decided to make this movie, which is totally ludicrous. It doesn't have to have to do anything about the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had me completely disenchanted and just walked out into the room with tears when it started. I would not have believed it had the title. I never cared for the story, but I thought it had a lot of unglamored gore. I mean blood, guts and guts. A lot of gore and guts in the story is just thrown out on you. There's nothing here that you really can see. They just don't give you enough. I was really bored throughout. The movie was predictable. The characters weren't even that different as to be scary. I tried to watch this movie without seeing it, because I wanted to try something else, but this was just a terrible movie. I didn't care for the storyline. I only care for something that can drive me through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the first "Taken Back" film, but this movie has the most ridiculous plot imaginable in the history of human history.  I thought the scenes were the most pointless and pointless scenes ever created in history... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a waste of everyones guts, really bad... The film is very predictable and it's not funny, but there is some humor in it. However, what is funny is the "comedy" movie that was produced for the film: the story is based on a video game, a short film that has been made about the game, and the plot is a parody of the game. The idea is that the video game is going to be in the movie, and a comedy skit. If it was a comedy movie, then you'd see a few lines about it, but that was not the case here. The story is so awful and bad, it is no wonder that this movie was not considered for a Hollywood release. I've seen nothing I have seen better than this movie, but my advice is: Avoid it, even if you like watching a movie: if you get bored and don't like to see something, then just watch some TV instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even know what to say about this movie, because I don`t think it deserved it. The best I have ever seen is a movie that has been filmed at a pool, which has been done with a bunch of different actors. This movie only contains one actor, which is an extremely bad actor. The one time I did see him I just laughed to my own self. This was one of those movies where the actors couldn`t act so badly, it made no sense in itself, so I think that the filmmakers were trying to make a little money on this movie.  It is sad to see the same actors that we used in so many movies, acting in bad, bad, lousy, bad movies. What did we just watch in this movie is that one of the best actors that I saw at pool? The one who did this was the same actor I saw in most of those great movies I have seen? The movie had an awful ending. I hope everyone will have a little more fun in their lives as I did at pool. I am sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a bunch of people who make their lives miserable by killing animals. They are living in a bunker and they have to kill animals to keep their existence. It is obviously a horrible waste of time to sit through it. When we get to the end of the movie we are reminded that it is probably more about the movie itself than the characters. And there are two other things which are just not what we expected. We thought that the plot had some interesting discussions and the characters were well developed. The problem is that when we started to look at the characters in the movie and we started looking at the plot, they were extremely shallow and they were not believable. The actors were totally inept. They just made up some incomprehensible things that made the movie seem more interesting than the movie had. This movie would have been a much better movie if all of the actors were able to bring the story to life.  I would really like to talk about this movie but unfortunately this was the only movie I could find in English with any real power. So I will try to avoid this movie as much as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just a collection of one ridiculous plot in which the entire town of Death Island is killed by a massive nuclear bombing. That's all about how the "heroes" of the town get to their new home, and the movie is a waste of time.  This movie is completely predictable, but not great either. It doesn't even have an end. The movie had a good premise and it even did something very interesting to add to the movie, but it failed to deliver any actual plot for the film. The acting was very bad, and you could almost see the actors flailing around the town at the beginning. You also have no idea how to interpret it. In one scene when I watched this movie, I saw the whole town disappear and then reappeared just as it had before.  The "hero" is killed, but his wife's husband (who has been missing since) then recovers her body, and then disappears from the town.  But what do you do when you kill your husband? I don't know. Perhaps you will like to be able to find out how, but there is absolutely no sign about it happening.  There's no real reason at all for this movie to be made. I mean, in case I hadn't seen it before and I'm a devout follower of the books, I had to see it to be sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best thing that I have written about this film is that it isn't. It's so bad, I almost laughed. But I couldn't because I found it so ridiculously funny. This is the worst comedy I've ever seen. The best comedy is always an interesting twist. What makes this movie so stupid is that there isn't much of a story to help the two performers, aside from their performance, to develop. That's the only thing that makes this film interesting. There are no real characters involved in the movie, and there are only one girl. It has only 2 or 3 girls that have characters to act. Why did they have to act as the hero of the movie and not the villain? Why did their parents get to act in this? This movie should have had been a straight comedy instead of this dumb crap. This movie is not funny. Not even remotely funny. I only laughed once. The whole thing is a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst film I've ever seen. It's unbelievable. They had an acceptable storyline, but it was weak. They couldn't get much in the way of story (the only thing worth being from this film was a little bit more than a cameo or a supporting role as some type of person. The only thing was a scene in a basement where we saw some of the actors that had come out of the '80's era). And there was no message whatsoever. There was nothing to make the movie stand out as a work of art, except the fact that the filmmakers used it so badly. I don't know what they were expecting this movie to be, but the script just doesn't make any sense. Maybe that's because they were drunk on some of their new ideas. The script had very little story, only a couple lines of dialogue about the boy with the new girl in their garage, and the characters in the basement were very predictable. It is not that they had an idea for the film. This is not like that movies I've made in the past. In fact, the characters could have come out better. There wasn't much else for them to do. I didn't find them anything great. I would recommend watching the film with a couple of friends. If you were only doing that, you would have done yourself a lot better. If nothing else, then I would just let the movie go on with no expectations. But in all honesty, if I hadn't been in the theater when I saw this film, I would believe that this movie would not have even made it to this point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but a waste of time and that really sucks. For any kind of movie ever made, the acting is terrible. It was one of the worst I've seen in a movie theater. It could have been a very entertaining movie to watch if the characters weren't so bad, but it just wasn't. I would be a lot happier with some really good actors. What is this world even? There's nothing to do but a bunch of "junkies" with one guy getting his little girl into a car and going for some of the most sick acts in the world. I was sorry to see the whole movie was so boring. I'm sure this was better than the other movie I watched but this movie is a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but it didn't seem to be a horrible one. In fact, there was some redeeming factor - the fact that it is a movie about a man, and his sister-in-law is so pretty... Well, that just proved too much. You can't blame the actors. They were pretty good, though, the plot was weak, and the acting wasn't quite bad. The whole story wasn't terrible. Still a lousy waste of time.  This is a horrible movie, but for the first time, I watched it because it has so much potential that I really couldn't complain. However, I couldn't really feel the same sadness about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read many words about this movie, and I've seen it hundreds of times. I thought that I might like it. But I couldn't. I saw just one bit of it and decided to write a negative critique. I know that in the movie, it's just about the sexual scenes of teenage boys and boys who have never been given a chance to make a real-life wish. I think that this was the last person to get any right. I wonder if they can even make a sequel without the real-world moral dilemma involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact it is only one of several so bad I have seen. A poor cast, which means the film could have been filmed in some Asian or Asian film-making classes. The film is also a terrible cliché.  The story is very weak and the acting are weak. If you want to find a comedy film: I am sure it is better than this. It's about as predictable as a game of chicken. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'll watch this one the next time I am at the movies for something other than entertainment. But, this was the biggest waste of the whole movie I've ever seen. I've never heard of anything so horrible, and that's a shame because I love "Sister Suck" so much.  In this movie, it had a female protagonist, and the female protagonist was in a hospital, and was the primary doctor at the hospital, but the doctor was actually a black man. She was acting, and so it wasn't really scary. I was left wondering why it was only that. I thought that it was meant to be "the biggest and worst movie" ever made. If you were going to see "Sisters Suck", make sure you don't waste it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is that it has a hilarious ending. The problem with the rest of the movie is the sheer lack of any good sense. The only thing that is saving this movie from the badness is the very catchy and fun musical theme, but that is only a few minutes of pure fun. In fact the musical score is one of the most disappointing scenes in the entire film.  If you are going to see this movie, please don't. This movie is bad. I give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a fan of American movies, you will probably miss this one. If you don't like American movies you might enjoy it for other things.  The problem is that the director is an idiot, which makes the movie like an absurd piece of shit.  If the director wanted to make a movie based on this horrible film he could do something better. He could try to make this movie as intelligent as possible. He also seems to think that the idea is "that he wants to make movies about the worst movies ever made".  I'm not sure who said that, but "he wants to sell them" is a reasonable assumption. He is basically the man that makes movies like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of people out there have said that the film is about an older couple who can't take care of himself anymore, and that's not what it is.   I can't say anything more about this film, because I was thoroughly bored with it when it was first released. There are quite some weirdly creepy elements that I just can't believe in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie seems to be a bit of a collection of failed attempts to be interesting, but the film's attempt to be innovative is so bad that it actually gets boring. If you want to learn something about life and how it works, this is the worst film ever made.  The film begins in a strange and sad way, with the characters trying to make their lives more comfortable and more appealing by going on to the opposite end of the movie to find a cure for their problems (if you want a cure, you'll find yourself on another island), but the characters in the rest of the film are instead reduced to the characters' souls and trying to figure out the truth of their situations. What happened before is unclear, and as you're looking at them now, they have become almost completely forgotten and are only trying to explain how things go wrong.  This is a bad film for children or even young adults. I'd prefer to spend my time watching something which has something new and interesting to it, like a novel or a movie like "My Mother's Husband." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be extremely boring to watch. It was very annoying. The characters seemed to be in a few minutes away from each other. If you watched it in a real time, you would see a completely different movie. If there was a plot or story, you wouldn't care much about it. There was not enough to be interesting in any way. This movie was boring to me and I had the same thing for most of the characters. A few parts seemed like they were trying to bring in a twist or a twist to make the characters more interesting. This was a complete waste of time. A movie about a bunch of people making jokes and having some fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the name of the movie was "The Expendables", then it would be a perfect spoof on the whole idea of a movie. But when it comes out, it isn't. In the first two hours of the film, the characters are obviously actors, but it is so bad that you wonder how they get along. I mean, the acting was good, but not that great. The plot is very weak. If the main characters had a more dynamic performance, it would have been a comedy classic and the plot would have a better chance. In all of the scenes, it just leaves you wondering who was acting in a movie made about a movie that isn't called "The Undergarment" or even called "Undergarment". The characters are very dull and boring, which means they don't even have a plot to go on. When they finally go out, you might have to wait to see the next episode. If you like to see a movie with some plot, don't watch this one. The acting was pretty good, so you might as well just watch the "The Man In The Blue" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a truly awful and awful movie. It's not original. The movie is so bad, it's almost worse than the movie that I had hoped to make. I think there should be a better way to make this movie, it would be great if the movie was about a movie that has more plot, and I can't believe what they're trying to pull here. What the heck is going in there!? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this movie for about 30 minutes, and I am willing to say that the only reason I left after the first 10 minutes was to leave. The movie was terrible...horrible...unfun!The fact that you can actually watch this thing and then leave in a car is just terrible...it is disgusting...it isn't even funny...the director has really got to be a man who needs to be shown up for his sins!!!! The director is so bad that he was able to convince people to let him make this movie...it was pathetic. They need to be warned off this thing...I'm sorry, but you can watch it when you've made it yourself...I don't believe there is anything more terrible than this! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie with a completely incompetent script. The plot was probably written by Michael Malles (one of the best known actors from the James Stewart movies) and later adapted by Jack Kirby. That was the only redeeming feature in the film. The acting was terrible. The only reason you would get a ticket is to see Michael Mallas kissing a girl. It's not as good as this lousy comedy at the Alamo. And I thought Michael Mallis kissing a woman was not cute. The script is so horrible that they really shouldn't be nominated for any awards. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film only 3 times, and the last time was when it got released. Now it's just in the pop culture of "new generation" movies. The plot is really stupid (though, as usual, this is probably a better film with more talent than the other ones.) The main plot lines seem to take place in different places every time--so it's hard to determine which one of the two main characters is where they're going. The director is obviously not very talented (I would have to say it's really low in budget--but it's still pretty good), but the acting is OK--it doesn't look bad, even by today's standards, but the script is bad.  This is probably the only film I can watch for the sake of entertainment. I would not recommend it, but if I had to, I would prefer the "Jetson and Ochs" movie (which was released in 1998). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Lobstick" is a terrible, bad, awful film of a documentary on the subject of the "Lobos", the movie was filmed by a group of guys who do not know what they are doing or why they are not very knowledgeable. It's a sad example of the lack of professional filmmaking.  I have to give this movie a two out of ten. First of all the actors are horrible, but the camera work was OK. When I watched "Lobs" I thought most of the footage had some value, but not enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see that "Gigal" is like the same dumb movie with the same lame script and acting as usual. But, the problem is that it is really shallow and predictable. I didn't get the whole movie in order and after my initial shock of seeing how this movie works, I found it so disappointing that I just laughed. Now, I'll tell you to keep watch if you think you have read it before:  My hope for this movie was that it would get a few more people to see it. But to be honest, I just couldn't see the whole thing, because it was so bad that I didn`t even try to see that movie. I don't know if it's because I was too tired, or because it wasn`t bad but I saw so many other people who didn't even bother to put the movie on. Maybe if I just watched the whole film, I'd be surprised that I saw nothing of value. I'm not saying anything about the actors in this movie. But I just won't bother listening to this movie anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how this was done or even if the characters are meant to be "clared". They don't get a chance to express themselves in the story and they don't have enough money to build a "reserved" of the area. They are not even remotely similar to the real-world situation. The plot doesn't seem to make any sense and you will probably not enjoy this movie any more than a normal one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The scene in which we witness one of those "good" people in the theater is really terrible, as they are about to kill the bad people. They aren't very well cast, and the characters are just horrible, making it hard for the actors to act. At least they're not as bad as the other actors in the movie, because the actors in those scenes are pretty good.  But as for those scenes, they are pretty darn good and there are some decent supporting characters. What they do really aren't interesting. A movie with a bunch of people that can't act all that are supposed to act, just goes along like a piece of shit and is extremely boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so awful it should be a waste of one's time on this film. It is nothing like any other movie in this century, it's so slow, and they seem to be getting on the verge of losing some talent. I think this was meant for a "Kids" show, but it can't have it. They should have put in more creative talents to help them with this nonsense. When I made this movie, it seemed that it was just a couple of friends and I was able to sit in the room with them and watch them do it, but they are simply a bunch of pretentious people, who can't act as they should. The only time I had ever seen the actors was at a special event at a movie theater during a certain day of the year, and in this movie they couldn't act anything at all. When i was at the movie theater, my son didn't even talk with them, and when i was in the theater, i couldn't even say anything to them. It makes me wonder if it was ever made for children. This is just an embarrassing waste of money. If the movie had more talent, it would at least be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find myself being very bored watching this movie. It was extremely shallow, not a good movie. But the plot seemed pretty good and the story had some interesting elements. But this film lacked in any substance whatsoever. Some scenes were very good. It had too much going on in the background story, the acting was weak, the camera looked terrible, and I felt like the director wanted to show how one person can die by shooting a gun and killing people.   What really made me angry was the fact that the movie was set at a place called "A House of Deceit". I thought that the plot was about something else and was not the right thing for this movie to be about. It also wasn't interesting enough. I couldn't remember what was going on during the whole movie. The acting was terrible. It got a little better toward the end and I was a bit confused. The only thing I'd really liked was the movie's cinematography. But that was also substandard. The film lacked the suspense and had a very predictable plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see the movie at 2.30 pm (that's only about 3 hours), and what I saw was a piece of trash. It is just a bad, one dimensional trash. I mean, it's really just a really, really bad idea of a story. I don't like it but I wouldn't really even watch the movie. I can't stand this sick, really sick piece of junk. If you get this I urge you to watch a movie that can't be worse than a bad film, and don't see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an incredibly disappointing film that is completely over-rated and badly written. The plot is so badly written and poorly filmed that it just falls apart at the end of the movie. It is so bad that the movie is more like a movie made by some guy. There is not enough dialog to really get away from the movie and nothing gets interesting as the characters do. The movie is about a female couple whose son does not have any communication with their mother, while the rest of the characters is just dumb people. While I did enjoy watching this movie, it just wasn't a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a stupid, bad movie, this one is. If you think this was going to be a comedy film, then it was absolutely the opposite. What a comedy is, you just can't make it. The biggest reason this movie is a comedy, is because the "story" is so poorly written, so stupid, that it is completely inconceivable that the director made it. You're only able to get it to be funny in the first place by throwing out some actors, but you can never get it as a movie. It is so bad that people are willing to watch this film as an action movie, only to be told "no, it's not a comedy" after being given it. There's only so much comedy in this movie, and that's the only time you can find it. Why? So, if you want to watch it for fun, don't even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a ridiculous plot. First of all, the characters are dumb, then at the end they get to "explain" the big event. I am really bored by this story, and after the ending I just closed my eyes and walked out on the street and decided to sleep a bit. What a story, eh? But as far as the plot, the story itself is totally predictable and a poor cast of actors could ruin the movie. It's very disappointing to see the actors who were "stuck" and trying to make the story something that it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors were just flatly incompetent, the writing wasn't nearly as bad as the TV version. I can't blame the actors for the awful writing. The dialog was more like a piece of trash than the actual movie. There was an unbelievable amount of "blair" dialog - even the original version was a tad too slow for me to take it seriously. The cast didn't seem to act like anything that would be believable, although it was pretty funny to think of a villain who resembled his in a cartoon cartoon. Some of the dialog was funny, but not that funny.  Overall, this movie is bad, and probably would have been better if it were subtitled. If you want to see a movie that features some action and humor, don't waste your time with this movie. Avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so glad to find this film at the local video store for $2. It's a pretty bad movie but when you're so goshy, you don't make too many deals. The plot is really awful... I was expecting more drama and some of the action seemed so clichéd. I had a hard time watching the movie. My main complaint was the script. I felt it was a poorly written, predictable, and I felt that the movie seemed to lose most of its energy when it came to the big screen in theaters. The acting was also awful, I couldn't believe the acting was done in the movie, I guess the actors had to be there at least twice for me. I'd rather watch the movie as a piece of trash on a flat surface. The actors could probably do better than this crap. I wish I would have waited for this movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, based on "My Dream" is just awful. There's a very attractive young woman in the lead and we make the best couple ever in one of the oldest and oldest gay couples. But it turns out she's only a half-assed sexploit whore and a little girl in a few short scenes. What does she think? Why would she have sex with a married man?  And there's nothing more depressing than a sexploony movie. The biggest problem with this film is that it tries to make the most exciting moments of sexual activity with the married man. He's obviously a sex toy, but if that's true then the rest of his character is an asshole and the movie doesn't make much more. We should see some more films with a sex-star couple, and a girl like the husband should be shown more respect than just making love with her husband. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am going to call this film a complete and total waste of all of Hollywood's talent and effort. This is only the result of one very good director, who might have made more films in a decade. Alas, he doesn't have that kind of talent. The rest of the acting is very bad. I have yet to see a movie that I can say could be as funny as that which one was.  The script was very poor. The first scene was completely pointless, and the ending to the film just completely terrible.   The plot is OK, but the ending was so awful that I felt disgusted the whole time, which is the worst part. I don't blame the writers for putting the characters into this movie, but if they had a brain, they would know they are doing something wrong. They need to have a brain to think before making a movie.  I can't say why they went ahead with this movie. It may have been because they are going for something similar to the book "The Three Fanged Hands of the Devil". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film seems like something from the very worst cult of film making ever produced. The script is too big and, at times, over-dressed. The acting is flat and insubstantive. The story is weak. But, it tries to be all-bad. It tries to imitate The Ring, but it doesn't quite succeed. The ending is pretty awful. I found this film insulting to the genre. It lacks a moral element and, with regard to the acting, it is not quite like the Ring. There are lots of weird people, which is not a good sign. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was pretty disappointing and totally predictable. There was something that made this movie better, which is why I chose to watch it so closely, but in the end the characters were so far removed from the plot that it just doesn't have much more to do. the ending was also pretty predictable, so if you're looking for a movie with a good ending then this is not the movie.  to be honest it was pretty bad, but at least the end does have a happy ending. It is a shame that there is so many movies made that are like this and if not a movie to be made, it is not a good one. it is also a shame the stars like this movie made a bad impression on me. it was not good that a movie called i am about could not even give you the plot, the characters and the ending, that it did so badly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really think this movie is particularly enjoyable. The idea of a 'haunting' is pretty silly, and while the idea of being chased by 'vampires' is a pretty good idea, the fact that this film is about a bunch of sad vampires being chased around is just terrible.  The only reason this movie was released was because it was obviously about vampires and not really about a 'vampire'. What I like about this movie are the 'vampirious' (as in vampire, that's what I get in this movie) and the 'humor', but these were not in the mood for me. And the movie starts off well, with the vampire chasing a vampire on a golf course, but then they're just as ridiculous as the rest of it. The plot is fairly good, but I don;t really recommend it, as there was only about a minute that I liked. I think if I had seen this movie from a 'film' store I would have enjoyed it, but unfortunately it didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was so weak and the acting was so bad that the fact that people like to see these two brothers, with their mothers, is all that is supposed. I am sorry, but if you decide to see this, you will most likely lose it. It is the worst piece of film made in Hollywood history, if the director could have a brain and let it happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I've read other comments saying that this movie is the worst movie ever made, it is true. But this is not as bad as "The Legend Of Zelda: The Legend Of The Twilight And The Legend To End", if your mind can handle it at all. If you like this show, go ahead and watch it, but there's a lot of wasted time. The best show of 2011 that I saw in all of the world is The Mindy Project, and that is not in this movie.  But even if the fans of this show are so enthusiastic, don't buy it. If they even care about this show anyway, they should be a lot happier than I think they're getting the most out of it, and so are a lot more happy than the average viewer in a film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really disappointed that this movie was what it was meant to be. A movie that made nothing but a few simple facts of life and never gave any detail on the actual situation of the characters. The acting was horrible. The movie is basically just a movie made in a big city with only a few supporting characters. A lot of plot lines are totally unrelated, like an exchange between the people who want to catch the killer but their family are already dead. Some of the scenes are completely senseless. Some scenes are entirely unnecessary. In other words, the movie didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a good movie with a decent storyline, and I thought the acting was good. However, the movie lacked all of it and the dialog was horrible. I just give this movie a 3 out of 10. I wish that this movie could be made to a standard. The dialog is bad, the scenery is horrible, the special effects are terrible, and the director has no sense of what he's doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie I am currently watching is a film that pretends to be a movie but in fact, it's nothing more than a terrible slasher movie that pretend to be the most interesting feature of cinema. In the plot, the characters are all cartoon characters that are so pathetic that they are almost laughable. I'm not sure what it is that made them so hilarious, but I suspect that it is some sort of fetish. I have absolutely nothing to do with this film, so I just watched it because I like movies that are silly. This isn't that bad. But I don't know what I'm going to say about it. The characters are pretty decent, but in the rest of the movie, they just seem to be very weak. It's OK to say that the movie is not terribly bad but I don the same. The plot isn't as bad as other movies made like "TREATS 4: The Blood Brothers" or "Takes a Heart" or even "The Dark Zone" but I would have been very careful about making that comparison. I believe that the plot is bad because it tries so hard to be original, but this movie tries so ridiculously hard to make you think that it's original. There are some decent segments but not as much as that original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so terrible it got the award for worst movie ever! I know people that would turn it into a movie just for fun. I have to admit that I was very tempted to watch it when I read this synopsis from the book, but it never had the expected level of entertainment. If a film like this had to be made, it would be good. The idea was great but the whole story is so poor. I thought for a couple of minutes after watching it I'd think "it's about a girl who gets hit by a meteor and then falls into some sort of coma, and after that she realizes that she has fallen and she goes to search for her sister, and the thing is that she doesn't remember anything from the time she fell in the meteor, she has forgotten her last name, and her sister is in there and she tells her sister not to let her do anything to anybody. The plot is really bad, but not as bad as a horror movie. The ending is horrible. And it doesn't make sense. If you're looking for some interesting twists and turns, you would have been happy with this movie, but I don't think they could have even made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film without seeing the plot. I thought I could turn the movie to a comedy or a horror film with some original storyline, but I didn't.  This movie is just plain stupid.  If this movie was ever released in a decent movie, then it would be worth watching if the story was good. As it is, it just plain dumb. Even if you have to laugh, you won't have enough fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't blame you for this awful movie.  It is stupid, pointless, stupid and awful. The actors are pathetic, the plot is weak and the plot of this movie is very, very bad. If you think you can see more real, real movies then you can think this one is very bad too. But I suppose, if you think "good" movies, you will see better ones. The acting is OK, it's good, there is some action and it's interesting. But this movie has only 10 minutes. It's like having a little bit of a nose and some of a cheek. You can see it's going to be bad but you can watch this one for 10 minutes and you get bored and then you'll enjoy it. But if you are thinking you have to watch this movie, then watch something that has more substance. A lot of movies have elements that you can't see but that you don't miss out. This is no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had to be a bit more interesting and I thought it would be. However, this wasn't the case. The acting was awful, the cinematography was terrible, the story was stupid, the special effects had no effect, and the scenes were just the same as usual. The best thing about the movie was the fact that it was so terrible that no one could care more about it than the plot. If you are willing to spend 40 minutes of its entertainment watching a film that has only about 1% of the value of the movie to you, that's pretty disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely lame and really, not that funny. This movie will only have the fans of the "Cavaliers", and I would be shocked to see another movie that is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this film because it was going to be part of some'special event'. I think it was meant to be a documentary but it had been put out there for the same reason. I didn't really understand the plot. I don't care how they made it or what the outcome is.  The only thing that I can conclude is that people should NOT see this film. It's just a film that was made to fill an order. There are no great stories, nothing that you can learn from about. It is just a dumb film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie about two months ago. It is pretty horrible in many ways but it was a movie which has been completely ruined for me. I knew from the very first time I watched it that I would get a little bit sick and the story is so weak that I really didn't understand what was going to happen, the main character was stupid and stupid, I didn't care about anything else and I didn the first time. I was expecting some kind of humor and humor but the characters just weren't funny. My favorite scene was a rape scene and I was scared to death just by the plot. The dialog with the guy was pretty pathetic and the acting was terrible, too much of that would have been just plain bad but if that wasn't enough then it might have been a better film. I really do not agree with the premise of this movie and it seems too similar to a movie from "The Naked Lunch" (I'm not sure if it actually has that name in the movie but I'm not really sure). But it doesn't matter. The movie is bad, I am sorry but I'll have to wait until it gets released. It's the only movie I have ever watched. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only a failure but a completely idiotic performance from a cast that has been used on other projects. The movie is bad for anyone wanting to be entertained. The acting was good in other ways but for all the reasons it was bad. Not only the acting was bad but the script and the directing. The script is a little bit on the nose. It's about a guy who comes from behind and makes his wife's life his life. In this case, the man has an "assessed" girlfriend (i.e. a woman with an unset interest in her husband) and a "nice" friend with an attractive guy(the guy's husband). The "nice guy" (as usual) is making the woman his wife an object and forcing her to make excuses for his actions. This guy is, at least, hopeless. In most cases, a person's inability to understand that his own actions are an action and not something that will result in a happy ending. This movie is not that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so terrible that I really can't imagine the words that the writer, or director, used to describe the movie. I don't know how much brain you could put into the writer's brain. I think that they have something better in their movie than they did in this movie. The main characters were not even very well written. The characters were also not funny enough. I watched this in one theater and it was only two. I thought that they were taking advantage of my patience, but they never took any advantage. I cannot believe that it was a very low budget movie. My prediction is that they will never be able to make a good movie about something that has turned into a complete rip-off. I have a few small questions that I can't say I've answered, but I can say that they would have been very creative if they had done this movie as well. This movie could have been so much better and I can promise you that you won't miss this movie at all. I give this movie two out of ten 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are three good actors in this one, and two bad actors. The three are bad actors, but the good actors, as well as the "one-man show" fans of this movie, can deliver good comedy. However, the bad actors are bad comedies: one-gauchez-out-of-the-machine-eating-the-"buddy" of the movie. It is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I have said, this film is nothing but a bunch of brainless and dull people pretending to be "Funny" actors. I didn't get the first part because it just sounded like this film was "Foolish". I didn;s know why I didn\' for the first time. It was just plain bad. I wanted something more than to be insulted by a poor, cheesy movie. I knew from the beginning that the first two parts would be better than this one and I thought they would be more entertaining. Then, the whole film got completely pulled apart by a stupid story of the first guy and his stupid family members.  I really thought this film wasn\'t funny, and I think it was only for two movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the only person to be left so depressed by a movie that has nothing to say except "The only thing it has to do" (as with the ending) and I can't figure out the motivation of every other person involved. A movie in which there is absolutely no plot and nothing that makes any sense whatsoever! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never heard much about a movie. But this one gets a big ratings from the movie website. The first thing i like about this movie is that it is obviously horrible. In fact it is very bad. The script is horrible and the film seems to be missing some sort of plot. In this movie some of the characters are like they have a cat in a hat and that they all have the same cat in the back seat and the car is so slow! And the actors are so fake. They are actors who can make a lot of money but there is no storyline. The director did this in real life and it is so bad you would think they would be famous. I can't believe people are putting this as a comedy. I didn't really even think it was funny. The only thing i liked in this movie was the soundtrack. If it was just a bunch of guys making a movie in their garage then it would be OK but I guess they just put some music together. The plot of the movie is really lame. It is about a crazy woman who goes into a hospital after getting caught up by a car full of people and wants to use some special magic tricks to take them away. There is no plot whatsoever. I don't know if the writer thought he could make a story like this but it didn't work in real. I think the actors would only have been put in a couple of lines. The movie could be interesting if they added some new characters. There would be some sort more interesting things but I was so bored by this movie i was scared of the end.  The movie didn't even make me laugh. The ending was pretty lame and I don´t understand why they chose such a movie for the title. It was kinda lame but they did a decent job. In truth they did quite well with this movie. It just didn´t feel like a movie so i don´ve seen it enough to make me care. The best thing i got from the film is how the director couldn't even pay or rent the actors. He had the budget for this movie and even the director gave more money than what he made for this. It really wasn´t worth seeing but it was pretty bad so i gave it 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can understand why this is so terrible, but when I watch it it is pretty difficult to keep watching the whole thing just so there is something more to watch. There is so much of the movie that I just lose interest and I can only blame the acting. It really reminded me of old-school horror flicks I made at a youth festival. The characters are pretty bad and the story itself is lame and the special effects look like they were filmed on a 3-pin film set.  In my opinion this movie is a waste of money and does not warrant your purchase. I am just happy that I could see the whole movie and I'd like to see it in a movie store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is horrible, nothing else except bad, nothing at all. I had heard so many voices and feelings coming out of me and my feelings on the topic of a "movie about mental illness" which are not even expressed.  This movie was filmed in a town of 100 people, and it is a shame that it is filmed there. At least for a normal movie, there would be some dialog and some action.  The movie was shot a few days after it was released, I did not see it until I was told about it.  It was supposed to be based on a simple yet fictional story, but was very badly done. It has a huge amount of subplots in which the actors should have made their appearance, but they all had something in common with the rest of the cast, which is not supposed to happen. The plot is horrible to watch.  I thought that I had seen all of the movie already, but I'm still waiting for it to reach someone who will not have the guts to stand up and make them watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't see a film where the director can deliver a punch to a bad film: the acting was horrible, the acting completely uninteresting, the whole film was nothing but a stupid mess. I'm going to say the director could of done better. But I didnít like the director. I am going to have to admit I didnīt like "The Last Men" much. The movie was horrible but this was much worse. If the actors were good enough, the movie would be more interesting. If they had a decent script, the characters would have worked better.  I could give this film a 10-15 points but it was ruined by too much stupid acting and lack of a decent story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been out for almost 2 hours and is a disgusting waste of time. The cast is OK in some minor areas but the script is terrible. The ending is also horrible. I give it 1 out of 10 if you're interested in watching this movie, but only if you don't expect it to be anything like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't interesting at all. It's too predictable, too predictable and only the final few scenes were decent. It really got a little boring when I was wondering why the people were trying to save the girl from death... The acting was so weak and the plot wasn't interesting.  I just don't recommend this movie... sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is a film, it is really bad. The main character is a homosexual, and it is just not true to the story. A gay man is playing his father in this film. I have no idea why. If you think it is true, it should have been made a movie with people that are normal and people that don't need to be "in the spotlight". That is not what it is. A person in this movie can be one of the most famous people in the world but having sexual relationships with your wife doesn't make you famous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Losing" is basically nothing more than a bad film: stupid humor, bad writing, bad characters, bad action, bad direction, terrible directing, bad directing, dumb casting (not just an excuse to bad acting), bad directing...  If you see the opening, the opening sequence alone is hilarious and painful (that it's supposed to be funny!). And then you have to sit through the movie (that would be hilarious, but not the film), then you must watch the ending. I think it's better to just avoid the "Lose a guy" jokes.  This is the kind of film that people watch as a fool. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is very disappointing when you can so little imagination that an empty plot is pulled for a big budget, such as a plot, some great script, some wonderful photography, and then you get a movie that turns into something you'll never see.  What's left is a lamely written film with some questionable dialogs, some good camera footage, and a good cast, but a lousy director who is unable to come up with a decent ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad I had to watch it for its entertainment value alone. The plot was just bad enough for me to give this film any kind of consideration. It had a pretty interesting concept and it just failed to deliver. I can't imagine anyone watching this film for its value. It's too much money, it's so bad it doesn't even deserve that much. It was really depressing for me. The story lacked much substance, but at least it wasn't bad-ish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not a good movie and I don't really want to do something so silly just for laughs. But the ending of it is so dumb I don`t care.   The only way this movie was funny was that it was extremely boring. In every episode I could tell the story of how the characters tried to get off a bad date. And how the two of them tried to take advantage of each other. This is the worst thing I`ve ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was awful from beginning to end and is probably the biggest mistake I have ever seen in film.  The first thing I noticed when watching the film was the lack of originality. The story seemed so tawdry and so ridiculous. The characters were so poorly drawn that it was impossible to make them coherent. The plot had nothing to do with the characters. The acting wasn't even good enough to save the film, as it had been scripted by the very poorly talented writer (the director of The Bourne Supers of which this movie is based) and the director. I thought the plot was bad enough to ruin the film and the film itself was a waste of a film. In the end I had to watch two hours of it in a very weak mood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You've probably heard of it or "I saw a movie: like one of those movies that were made on a budget, but I thought it was a bad one. It could easily have been made in a Hollywood movie. It wasn't that I thought a lot of people could have made this movie. I thought that people could just get some simple scenes out of a lot more than a bunch of actors. I felt that they did a lot wrong, for example, making some scenes more important than the real movie. They got a little bit too sentimental. They made some scenes look like they were staged, like people put in their shoes, but they didn't have a strong point in the movie. There wasn't much in the scenes that made the movie stand out. There was a lot in the storyline, but the characters were just that bad and the story wasn't convincing. They didn't make a big point in what they were saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely, absolutely one of the worst films ever made. The plot is obviously illogical. In a way, you might think it could have a purpose. It doesn't. The only thing that works is the acting. The direction is horrible, the only thing in it that makes sense is the direction. The film is no good. I thought it would be a funny film to watch. Unfortunately, it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was very poorly written and had very poor dialog, which is an easy way to get in a bad way.  A friend of mine and I saw it with my best friend, who was a huge fan of the first film, laughed at every comment she made.   She was so over-acting and the whole film just wasn't quite funny. It was so bad I felt like I had to read it to see what she was really talking about.  I thought if she was such a horrible person, she should have a lot of guts and a lot more patience than she was. I really didn't feel sorry about seeing this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on TV last night and this movie is like no show. They have a cast that makes no sense whatsoever (and if you're a viewer like me, you'd have seen that on television already). I didn't get it when I was first picked, so I don't know if this movie was made to film it. I'd be shocked if it came out in a movie without any plot whatsoever. I have to imagine they'd have to have their own plot to a movie about a murder, because I've seen it done, and it didn't even make any sense. There is no plot whatsoever, nothing else to add to the movie. They are about a kid who discovers that a girl is a serial killer who is also a serial kidnapper. It's not even a bit complicated. The acting is just a bunch of idiots. In some cases they are trying to show that the girl murdered someone who was sexually assaulting her, but the story never gets any sense of humor. When I watched the movie I didn\'d even know what they were trying to do. It just seemed like I was watching some sort of fake documentary. The plot is just unbelievable. They could have put it together on a DVD and put it in the back to camera to put it into a DVD, but they couldn\'t do it. They just put out another DVD with some music, but that\'s all the movie had. The ending really wasn\'t worth a damn. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an unacceptably bad movie. In the first 30 seconds you can see the blood flow in the blood stream. The only reason I could believe this was a "B" movie is that I would never have seen it before. There was no plot and no characters. But the plot is OK for the sake of a comedy. The rest of the movie is about the "tough" gangsters who take over some abandoned prison in Colorado and make a killing of innocent people. The movie is not consistent enough to have an ending. If the movie had a ending and a message to that message then this movie would have been more interesting. But no. No. It has the formula and has nothing but plot to its credit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is very weak and is basically about a man named Jack that has a penchant for getting drunk, taking pictures, and going to the local car park to meet a guy. While at the car park, Jack meets the "Jackie" who is a married man that needs money, so Jack agrees to meet with him. The two meet at the park when Jack meets a guy named "Johnny" and tries to do his part in the movie. After Johnny's wife leaves him to help him out with his alcoholism, Jack begins drinking on the road and is pulled over by police. When they are pulled over, Jack tries to evade police for a few hours by using the carpool bus and using a really good fake ID to help them evade being stopped. He then gets a phone number called to his phone and gets caught in a car with a police officer in the backseat. When he is finally released, Jack's car is broken in half, with the rear end of the rear-view mirror hanging off the rear. Jack's "girlfriend" is the daughter's father and the police officer is the cop in the rear seat. Once again, Jack pretends to be a drunk driver, making several "Locking the doors" at police cars, trying to avoid a police car in which he crashed. He is also drunk and takes a picture at a police station. Jack then leaves his car to get a phone in case he is drunk again, but he does not get away. He proceeds to have an argument with the police. He talks about an incident at a movie theater as a way to help his story.  Once he is asked to answer a question, Jack tells the police to ignore the drunk officer, which is the excuse he is making. He tells them that the police have to stop Jack by showing him his ID. But this is ridiculous. In case he was drunk, he could have used his fake ID and done something to the police without police knowing his identity. The cops are looking for him and then turn away Jack at his police station when they have his ID in their possession.  But the real loser here is the guy.  His story is totally stupid. He has to be in the car with him because he is helping his buddy and he has to get drunk because he has gotten in trouble in the past. He can't even help his girlfriend's father, because he can't go to the carpark because of his father's whereabouts. He
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I was a huge fan of the Star Wars movies and this movie was one of those movies I wanted to be one of the best, but I'm not very good. I had quite low expectations for this movie and didn't like it. The movie just lacks any real plot, characters, and suspense (unless you think that Star Wars is a movie to start off every film with some plot and then you have to find some plot.) It doesn't seem like it was trying to make a big story, as most films do. For example, I'll sit back and watch the first three or four episodes of the movie to determine how it's going to go. I won't go through it, but this movie really couldn't figure out its characters for more than a couple of hours, especially with the way the "Star Wars: The Best Show Ever" ending played out. I really don't think it had much more to say. Even George Lucas' name was written on the ending and it just seemed a bit ridiculous that he just went to see it at the end of "I think I'm the only person who knows George Lucas is still alive". This movie just seemed like it had to go back to the beginning of the series. I can't understand that. The only way to keep an audience interested in this movie is to see another film or series that can't just be turned into a movie. This movie does not do that. Not only could the producers think that by making this movie, they might even be able to make this one into a film that can be made into a television series or movie. But even with that the story could have just stayed with some sort of a theme with a great plot. Well, that is basically the case of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to say that I was watching this film, and it was bad. It's not a pleasant movie but I felt like watching every scene was awful. I think you need to know about the writer, David Zipps. He was a writer who made terrible movies, but not like the people he used to write. He never could write a good movie. If I would only spend my time watching this movie I wouldn't get the benefit of it. I felt the writing wasn't good enough to save the plot, the acting was terrible. I thought he should've gone to the library to look at it. It was a total waste of time in my eyes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. Even the cast cannot save this film. As I thought it was, it was only possible because of a terrible script. I thought the first act was an absurdly convoluted plot and the ending was ridiculously pointless, even when it's not the case. The plot isn't even close to the truth. You can't believe the "clottering" of it. The only thing that was good was the opening sequence. The whole thing was a disaster, but the reason was to make you uncomfortable. This is also the biggest bad movie I've ever seen, and it is the only movie I will watch as long as I'm able to stand it. I give this movie 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good plot: a young boy who thinks he's got a supernatural power that he can't control, his father is a demonic monster, he is in love with a young girl and wants to kill her while his father tries to beat him up. In the end, there is a scene of a naked lady who is attacked by a man who tells her to get up and get his money off her.  The story is pretty basic. But it's so poorly directed and so boring that you can't even find anything else.   I thought it would be a funny joke if a major American film put something like that on its credits, but this one is very, very, VERY predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am at the height of tears at the fact that this movie is directed by a "famous director" and that it is nothing special, nothing special at all. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the acting is not even good. I just couldn't get in.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a waste of time - a really awful, disappointing, dull, stupid, predictable movie. If you're going to see this movie, watch it when you get bored and then try to not watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "FATF" is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad it's good. If you watch it on television, you'll be nodding into the TV screen as you're waiting for the movie to come. If we had a choice, we would have chosen to stay on the TV and watch "FACTF." There are a few moments that are hilarious, but when you're watching the "Facts" like the other episodes, you're hoping that it will make you laugh as you think it is hilarious. Then you see the ending, and the one before it, and you decide, 'hey, let me see my episode again.' Oh no, you couldn't. The only way to save this film is that it was filmed in a very dark location; it has some beautiful locations and lots of light. That was OK, but that was pretty much the only thing that helped. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I am to be completely honest, it is simply a bad picture. It has been done a million times before, and I'm not going to admit that I didn't watch it myself. But I'm pretty sure it's easier to watch this movie when you know exactly what it is. Not only does it not appear like a movie but it lacks the essential elements that are typically required to make a movie interesting. For example, the film sets aside the movie as a documentary in order to make it more relevant and interesting.  There's a scene where a pregnant woman is asked to sit alone in a pool at night, and then later that she's fed to a woman who is dying from cancer. The film sets up an ominous mystery. Her husband has made this film in his own living room; she doesn't understand how he has made himself responsible for the disease he killed her. When he explains why he's left in the pool on the beach, and she agrees that he's not a murderer, but then she decides it's all in his head. I think they should have just put a bunch of meat on a shelf and left her in the water so she could swim naked in the ocean without having to make the movie look like a documentary. This is a major mistake, in that it sets an ominous precedent for other movies with similar premises.   A lot of time passes while a woman is in the room and a man is going into the living room for a moment and then she's back in the bathroom, and so we learn her sister is on the road and she's having some sort of surgery. Then she's going back in to that room. The next scene is a shot where she decides what's going to happen, and when she goes to the hospital, she's dead. The only thing that still seems to make sense is that the guy's next to her and she tries to get him to call her mother to get her alone. They get away with this whole scheme to make her not be in the hospital and we learn that they've been through this whole process because they've done so many times that the movie is getting a little bit formulaic. Then when he's back at the hotel with her sister, she tells him that she wants to get pregnant and he tells her to get back to work on another baby. She wants to wait until she's actually pregnant, but she keeps asking him to leave so he keeps asking her what she wants and she
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm pretty sure that this is the result of an ignorant and uninformed film director who decided to include a small number of scenes which were intended to be shocking in terms of realism, in which no one had any idea of the rules or rules in such matters. This was completely ridiculous in the eyes of the general public, and no one in this world would want to see such a movie, at least. The fact that this film contains no more than two people who can't find themselves in the movie is hilarious. I think it's OK if you're just looking at a film, but if you consider yourself "committed to the art of film-making" then you should leave this movie at the bottom of the pile of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just cannot get into it. There are many actors, but the script is bad... and some are good and some aren't.  There are two very good actors, one of whom is the famous and famous Jane Austen. But the rest are bad actors who were obviously casted in the parts they were in, and that makes me wonder what happens to people who aren't on their set. I guess that Jane Austene's friends are better to cast as she is in the book, but other actors are so bad it doesn't really make the movie much more entertaining. I'm really sick of the pretentious stuff on here, and you need to watch the book instead of just choosing a movie: if you want to be a "star", don't make the mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a guy (that sounds like "a guy") who gets a hit in a car (with his brother) and then proceeds to get a bunch of people on the road... (it's OK for him to be in this movie, but he has a bunch to kill)   What makes this movie so terrible is that this guy is not actually a murderer (which would make him a murderer, unless you're really evil). This movie contains a little bit of comedy--in one scene, the kid is playing guitar in a street concert--but there are several scenes where he is throwing himself in a chair. It doesn't help that this movie is so weak and the acting is terrible. It's not very good either. Even a real killer can pull a joke. The rest of the movie revolves around this guy and is nothing like a killer.  Overall, this movie was really bad. I did see the "best" part, as I was watching it. The only thing that made me laugh was the "jumping off" scene. But, this film was mainly boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I'd spend $50 on this movie. I don`t understand any of the story. I mean, when are you thinking that this movie is a "ghetto"? The only reason why I give this film a 0 is because it was the worst movie I have ever seen. It is not a comedy, it's not a thriller, it is just a crap film.  If I say so, I'm not kidding. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a very minor plot that is obviously not present in the film. But if you are interested in a movie, you will probably enjoy it. If not, then you might consider going to the movie and watching another film with this script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not like the first episode of "The X-ray" where they find the missing girl, or anything. This is very basic, involving a whole group of people trying to find the woman. They only meet up in a secluded area where she was killed and later murdered in a murder. I was not expecting any plot. The show is about a team of people that tries to make a hit on the woman, and she kills people, who kill everyone she sees, including herself. The scenes are too predictable. Not even a plot, just an attempt to try and make an attempt at a plot. When the team meets up with the girl, there are two scenes where they are attacked by the girl and you get to know her. This was done so badly by the production of the episode that I can only guess what they were thinking. When she meets up to find out she is attacked and killed, you get the sense that she killed people. When they find out the girl they kill her and she takes control over people, making them all suffer, killing them. After killing them, she goes back into the dark without anyone to capture them. She starts killing people and torturing people, and getting her friends involved in the murders because she wants revenge. How could this be? Why is there a scene where they can see this kind of torture happening to her? I guess that I'm going to kill myself because I just saw the first scene of this show. I guess it was thought that there was a scene that was not supposed to take place on the show, and that was the only moment that I have seen. But the fact that she goes along to find a girl, which is supposed to be a scene on a TV show, along with a murder scene, is just unbelievable. I'd like to hear that someone has the same idea of making a murder thriller movie, but I think that was an excuse for them to do this, and the fact they had to do a murder episode in one episode is something that they should not have done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was simply a waste of precious time. It was so bad that it was unbelievable that such a piece of trash could have been produced, and this is a problem that should not have arisen. However, in the "noir", you have to wonder how much the director wanted to spend. You could not be more disappointed by the result of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really horrible. While the first few minutes of the movie were fun and entertaining, this is the complete opposite.  I really hate watching this type of movie because it is so pathetic and childish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the most ridiculous attempts at a romantic comedy. It is no fun to watch. No matter how much you like a couple, it's a disappointing movie. What I say is: DON'ICE YEA!  I can't even begin to describe just how bad this movie is. In the end we don't get the two lead actors out. Maybe the actors have something to do, but they can't do anything. That said, let's hope this movie will get more attention, and so we will have more fun. It's like when one gets a bad haircut and then decides to do something with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason that this film was even approved by the UK (if you're Canadian) i.e. the UK at the end of the 70's, is that it was an international hit by the film industry. It was a cheap film made in an office environment with lots of cheap equipment and equipment, no sets, and very few special effects. Even when it finally got to a small budget, it didn't go out of the office with any great impact. The plot is very simple and easily predictable (in some instances) and it lacks any special creative talent or any special effort whatsoever. It's only in the beginning, when some interesting scenes happen and are completely dithered. If the film had a little more screen time, it could have added something to it. Unfortunately the director didn't manage to make that happen and we can't fault the man for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't good enough to make a list. In fact it's the worst movie I have ever seen in my long career. There are some good scenes but you just can't find anything else. I give it three out of ten, the rest are not good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is really, really bad. I felt that this film was very weak, the action was pretty dumb, and the script was so bad that I had to walk out of the theater and scream in a few minutes. I really don't understand why the movie was made. I think the man should be put in jail. I can't believe that this guy was even remotely intelligent. In his eyes, this was a pretty silly plot. He could have done it much better. I never felt anything for this movie. My hope is that it will one day get better. The plot was weak enough that it could be funny. But it really just wasn't funny at all. I don't know if that's a good thing, but if I was on the train on a weekend and I saw this movie, I would have laughed. The only good part of it was the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is just horrible. Everything from the beginning just falls flat. I mean that literally everything in it is a pile of garbage! I mean I would rather watch a movie on a video screen than read it to my children. You would think they would take a few minutes and review the entire film if they saw it. Why would this show on the TV? I'm sorry for your life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts with the typical story of a disturbed and depressed girl, her obsession with her boyfriend and a killer. When he's gone, her father dies of an overdose, and she is stuck in a cabin. At the end of the movie, there are some cryptic messages that are sent to the characters, but are apparently sent to people who are in another realm, or something else. Also, the ending of the film has some bizarre scenes. In the first segment, a corpse is discovered and, in the second, the killer (who we think was the original) is executed by the cops. A little bit about the scene:  This film was so bad that it was released at the end only to be a TV movie. I found it on a video site: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie on the local video store, hoping it would be better. Unfortunately the first 45 minutes were painfully slow and painful and that is the reason I turned away. I won't even mention the name or the director but the plot is the most appalling piece of bad movie I have ever seen.  The acting was bad, the camera is poorly framed, the director/editor's lack of direction (and this is true most of the time) is so bad that it takes me a little bit to get back into the mood and know what was going to be happening. The story isn't interesting and the characters were badly defined. The dialog was bad.  It is so depressing that I had nightmares for about ten minutes and thought they might have put some popcorn on my seat.    At the end I left the movie with such a huge hole that I couldn't get my head out to just because I couldn`T get out of it. My expectations were low and I don`T have an excuse to recommend this movie but I don't really recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't remember the movie "The Devil Wines" in which I'm sure it was the best movie of 1979 (or the one which was closest to the original "The Vampire Chronicles" if I think that would be possible to do). The movie was pretty bad, not much better than the old Vampires movies of the 1980s, which were very much the same, and the movie seemed to come from nowhere. I can't imagine how a vampire movie could be so terrible, and there was only one woman, but she was pretty annoying and just a lot of people that was pretty ridiculous to see in the movie. What was the main plot? The Devil Wives. Well, for a couple of years, it was all we had! And we weren't really satisfied with that storyline, but it was still a good movie. Well then, we knew better stuff, and we still had that movie! At the same time, the movie was all sorts of stupid and childish, although the script was good, it got worse and worse. They had a movie set in a desert (for the deserters), the people that were living there, and in general they were so stupid, so they had so many characters that they never really got a chance to have their story played out. And when they finally got their story, they gave some plot-lines to people, but they gave the people no chance to make their lives interesting or anything. They gave the audience no real reason to stick with them. The best thing in the film was the man who played the Prince, his wife, and their other women. The Prince was an annoying character. The other women (also, one of the women) were not that interesting, so it was just a bunch of actors who had no story or purpose. The characters were in an excuse to be portrayed by the other actors (or a script writer). You know what their roles were supposed to be. And there was also that scene where a guy named "The God" gets a vampire that can kill people with a touch. What are they doing? Did they really believe it? That's a pretty annoying plot.  I would give it 1 1/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that I really got attached to was the idea of a movie set on a giant spaceship (in this case, a giant planet) where the protagonists of the movie are trying to get their daughter back to Earth. But instead, the whole movie revolves around a bunch of aliens that have come to Earth to destroy the planet's life. (Of course, the aliens' name is the name of the film's primary protagonist.) The movie begins to go downhill - but as I'm sure you can see, it's pretty bad. The first half of the story is pretty stupid, although it's not all terrible - it's just a bit disappointing. I don't want to say too much about the plot, but the acting was good. Unfortunately, the "plot" quickly turns to a stupid plot - it all falls apart. The actors just can't find their characters and the story gets a little bit boring. This is an awful excuse for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it looked like a 'Madness-in-a-caricature' (I guess it's been called that before I've heard about it) and a 'Bacheloretically-inspired-revenge' movie (which I think this was before my own mind was set). It's a movie that uses a few scenes that really just weren't suitable for a movie: 'Tremacy' is really good for a comedy film, but not for a horror film.  For example, it's silly to see a female writer dressed in leather and screaming at a female protagonist who wants to sleep with her. It would've been better for an animated feature than this.  When the woman is in her bedroom, you can see the scene when she comes into the bedroom to get a good look at her before seeing the 'closet', where she's wearing all kinds of leather and bra but instead of being naked and using her bra, she's using her legs instead. There was also a scene where a vampire guy killed his victim in his room and then attacked the woman and pulled his car off its seat to where she could see him raping her. He was also killing the victim in a tree house.  Then there's another scene where his wife is raped by the Vampire vampire. The vampire knocks on a door and knocks on the door as she gets the family home phone, which the guy calls from the front door and gets the two brothers from the car to see.  He then kills his wife, then kills the girls. The camera is then shot through a window, but you can also see him cutting the victim with a blade that goes across his throat. Then there are a few other scenes with a female as they slowly try to murder her.  This isn't all bad, it does have some humorous moments. One scene involving the killer and a female who is a vampire. We see the killer cutting of the meat and the vampire slaughters the 'family' (the victims). Then there is a scene that involves a cannibalism scene in a cemetery in a church. I don't remember how I found this, but I do remember that this had been shown in this little horror movie.  I don her going from a hospital back to a local hospital to a hospital that had some scary scenes in it. You know what happened to my girlfriend after she went from hospital back and made some really scary sounds.  The next thing I have noticed is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't expect to get so many lines, but I didn't mind being disappointed. Although the ending was better than most, it was really poorly written.  I don't really like The Office and The Office, but they are both very good films. The Office is simply bad in comparison. The first time I heard about "Office" was on its premiere. I only watched The Office a week ago. And I've since found out it's not good in comparison to The Office.  The film was not funny at all. The characters were predictable, but it didn't have much comedy, which is what is supposed to be the movie's main theme. I just didn't want to watch it. I give this film a 2.5, and I'm hoping a little less of it's going to be a bad flick. I really don't want The Office to make it into a movie: i don't know if it will ever get a decent rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I was very disappointed with this film. I thought it was the worst film I have ever seen. It wasn't funny at all. The story of the "Oven 4" was extremely predictable. There was nothing that made the film work. It was just a few minutes of ridiculous nonsense to try to make a joke. I think the best movie I've ever seen would be The Dog Show, since that came out shortly after this film was released. The only movie I had seen that was a better and better movie was "Hercules and the Road." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I read the reviews on this movie I assumed that I had read some good films: films that have some intelligence and good storytelling, but this one just doesn't know what's going to happen. This movie has some of the worst dialog I've ever seen in a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a really awful movie. The characters are not believable, the story is unbelievable, the camera is poorly directed and the acting is absolutely bad. I just give this film a 3. If you're looking for something that works, give "The Book Of Fire" and you'll love it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all it's just not a funny movie. Even for a comedy it's pretty bad, and I can't say that that. You will be left with little more than pity. Just don't look into it too closely. There's nothing for a laugh that can even make you laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the title suggests, this movie is extremely predictable.  As always, it has two "plot twists", and usually one of them is bad (the twist that got me most of the time!). If you have seen the "Storks", you will have no difficulty recognizing the main plot, but unfortunately it will never be a twist to a good movie.  The plot is weak, and it's hard to think you're going to find much more interesting in that situation.  That's not to mention the movie's bizarre ending. The scene is "normal" and not very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am going out to watch this show because my daughter has just started watching this show as well as my daughter's favorite. I'm not going to give a rating because it's a crap show, but I am very tired, and it's so terrible it could be a comedy show.  My niece and I have both the series and it is completely bad. What could make us even watch this? My daughter would be very bored and she would spend the time watching the show trying to learn about this show and she wouldn't enjoy it. If the show was a comedy then it would have at least a couple of decent episodes, but when it's made it's awful. The writing is horrible. If I could recommend a comedy instead of a dumb movie then I would, but none of them make it a comedy. The actors should stay with a comedy movie rather than trying to make a comedy out of this horrible situation. It was interesting when it started, but it seems like it's all over now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this on ABC, and thought that this was a movie that people would like to see. However, I think it was terrible, and I just sat back and watched the whole film without even bothering to try and finish. Some of the songs were awful, especially the song "I'll Love You", which was horrible. Some might have expected the songs to be more sophisticated, and not as badly written, as they were. I mean, they had the same basic songs, but the lyrics were different. I don't know how they came up with the songs. It doesn't matter if the writer didn't get to write this, there's nothing to save that. I wouldn't even watch the whole movie if I wasn't looking for an art film, and didn't want to get to go out and buy some clothes. At one point the movie became just a piece of trash. I think that's just a shame, that was too much to justify. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing and predictable movie of my life. I couldn't believe that this was an Oscar-nomination, and I knew from the beginning that I wouldn't even see this in a theater. I don't know who this film was for or if it's a remake of one of the famous 'Mister Mike' or some other film in the area. I am certain it was made by people who do not know what they're doing. I can't blame the people who actually made this movie but I think you should just forget it. The movie just doesn't make sense. It's a horrible mess of a movie. It just doesn the wrong thing to watch with you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie stars a very stupid, pointless and stupid character in this film, who is supposed to be the leader of the resistance. In fact, he is only a one sided dictator, who was supposed to protect the rights of the rest of his fellow citizens, even if he has some extra extra powers (which he does not have) in his country. This is not even true, since the other characters in the movie also were supposed to help him do this, so if the movie is about "keeping the revolution alive" then we've got some pretty stupid actors (like Kim and the guy, who are in the film) to help their cause.   Also, it is very difficult to do a plot like this without having a good idea about it. For example, if I watch the film, I don't know who was involved in the first 2 hours and who was killed, since we never see any footage from this. What are the real motives of the rebels and how did they get the power to do it?  In fact the only reason that I could find was because this movie had to take place in a bad place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you wanted to learn how to learn to shoot a bad film: First of all, the director, and the rest of the crew are idiots. First of course, they knew how to make a horrible movie: you don't want to know the script, the plot, the story, the characters, the "story", and what you will see. They knew so-so-so, and since that is what they are in a movie, you'll be getting a pretty bad story. Secondly, it's the cast. That's the only thing that makes the movie even worse. Not only that, but the acting is terrible, and it's not all about the actors, but everything else is too bad to be considered a film. Just for the sake of your brain, watch this movie without even being bothered. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In order to find the meaning of a horrible movie, you have to go through the most ridiculous way. This is not even worth watching. I will admit, I watched this movie so many times that I didn't even remember what I thought after it. I found it so boring, I actually wished I was dead so that I could go to my grave and ask God to kill me. If I could have seen the last three minutes of the movie, I would have killed myself. If you are going to see this movie, please make sure you have a few hours before you see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Zodiac" is pretty bad. I mean, I can't believe that the plot of this movie is based on a real movie. It doesn't have the proper ingredients that I expected it to have. The best example of a bad acting in a movie is the movie "Goddard", where the acting was totally terrible. The reason why the original "Goblins" movie was so successful is because it contained realistic dialog, and characters. It did have a plot to begin with, but when "GOBlins" did its "release" in 1984, they had to get rid of the dialog and make it look like the acting of today. But, in 1985, they changed it, and that's why it became such a failure. This movie has nothing except a plot, a story, and a movie camera. The rest of the movie is nothing but bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't seem to make sense. The dialog is not as rich as you'd expect to get by a big budget film. The idea that this would work is just crazy. The main character does nothing except to have fun with an idiot. He makes his own name a "buddy" and a couple of women, one of whom is actually a friend of hers. If you want to make a movie about a movie, take your pick somewhere else, do a show, and stop watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an example of a movie that fails to deliver any meaning whatsoever, much less the intended audience. A film based on a movie with very little plot and very little direction does not deliver any of the expected depth. The story is about a group of friends, who are caught in the cross-fire of two rival gangs, and find out that the gang members are responsible for many of the killings.  The two gangs make up a fight-of-guns kind of fight to see who has the more powerful gang, and the loser is taken care of by the police. It isn't quite as awful as a car-jumping movie, but at times you feel like you're watching a movie made out of one piece of cardboard in which your main characters are just a bunch of guys.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i thought the movie would be good if it were filmed on a real beach. Unfortunately, it seems that it doesn't, so i'll just state this as a general statement: The acting is bad, the plot is bad and the premise (which I think is the main reason the movie fails to succeed) is bad. The only good thing about this film is that it's filmed in an actual beach and I have a feeling of hope that this is the only movie that will be made in this way. As for me, I'd just like to do something like that to a really bad movie. Please don't watch this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but a very basic story of some dude and his girlfriend who get married to the old boy who then proceeds to try to steal money from the man's mother (or father). He eventually proceeds to get the money back by doing a prank on the old guy's wife. She then proceeds of course gets married as well. He has to have the old man's son to come along with him, and we're then left wondering how is she going to get back to the man. The acting is just awful.  If this movie is so bad, how does it make it so great? The story of a couple who married some guy, then having him arrested is pretty simple. The whole thing starts off with an extremely predictable plot and the ending is pretty ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In fact, the only part of this film that is even plausible is the final two. The plot is about a couple of wealthy ladies with an unusual obsession, and some annoying little boy named Jonathan, who is also involved. They want their daughter to marry the person who they think she's getting married, and Jonathan thinks he's marrying the girl's father, who she thinks is her brother.  I had no idea that this film would be even remotely like a movie. We could see a few scenes from the plot, but then the ending was pretty ridiculous. I don't know how they made this mistake, but even the final few scenes seem as ridiculous as they possibly could be. The scene in the hotel is pretty interesting, but it really was just the end of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As if "Mr. Benn" was to be the definitive example of this movie-like, dumb, ridiculous comedy. In most scenes it was just stupid. I laughed at every second. And I was sad because it was a "Hobie" type movie with no depth (I'm guessing the name was "Dr. Benn"), nothing. No characters, no great chemistry, nothing to connect with anything except the unbelievable dumbness that is the main theme of the movie.    After a few minutes of watching "Mr." I realized that this movie had a story with a purpose.  It was about a real man who had fallen in love with a woman (played by a young man and a female who is just the same) and then that girl would want to find out the real man.  If we hadn't laughed so hard at this dumb movie, we would have been a total psycho-sucker. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can only feel sorry for such a poor film: i hope my parents are going on a "WOW" with their parents when we watch this. They must have something else to say. If you watch this film, please don't get it. It is not only terrible, but extremely embarrassing. Please, please turn it off... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, while it was good, really got completely ruined in the second half. The story was decent. It had some funny scenes and a decent cast. But I found it extremely weak. The only really good thing in the film was the camera. Everything else was absolutely terrible. Not that the camera was bad per se, but the camera wasn't there. I would have been surprised if this movie had been made as a "real" movie, because it was weak to see. The actors were bad. Most importantly the idea was weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a true believer of "God" and the Almighty. However, this movie fails to deliver the message in a manner that I would expect. The movie is mainly centered around religion as an excuse for a short film. I have to conclude that the reason the movie is doomed is that people with no religion are not able to comprehend the message of God to anyone, and this is evident in the story.  If there was a compelling message, that message could be found in this movie. The acting is very poor, and the script is pretty dull. It is just another bad movie, made to make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really bad movie. It's nothing better than a big fat pile of garbage. The first thing I thought was funny when I was looking at it was the opening scene in the woods. It looked like I had been given a tour of the woods by my father, and he said, "The forest is for the sake of having fun and getting away from a bunch of guys who don't understand how to deal with people who have a sense of humor. That is not my father. It is the person who said it is for fun that doesn't have humor, the person at the bottom who said he was going to try to make a joke that involved the whole country, I thought the person on the top of the tree was a guy with a funny dog, and it sounded like a joke. Then the person that said it was for fun was the guy that said they had fun and would have a bunch at the festival. And they said everyone else was funnier than them because it was funny. The same thing happened with the big tree in the trailer. It sounded funny when the first guy said he would be a "fun" tree and the first tree would be funnier because it would be made fun.  This is a bad show. I had hopes after they got started on making this and they did a lot of work and they could actually make a funny thing, but they keep going wrong. They need to start making more shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe I watched this movie. It is an awful movie, with little plot, some actors that are totally unconceivable and there are a couple of bad ones. If you want to see real sex and nudity this movie is definitely the wrong thing to do. This is only a joke for people like myself. I'm sure I can write a positive review about bad movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film really has one word. It's bad, and there is nothing else to save this from. The actors are not very good, and the direction is so bad that it's hard to care about the outcome. It must have been pulled off to the brink of the dark abyss because I found myself watching this film with one foot moving into the dark depths of the movie and the other foot on the screen at the top of the screen, wondering if there will ever be such a show. The film is probably the lowest score of any film that has ever been made since the world fell apart in a major earthquake, which is why I wrote a negative negative review: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole plot of this movie revolves around a bunch of friends who go out to steal a lot of money and are pretty stupid. The movie does not even have any real meaning or a plot. It's just a bunch who wants to take money in order to get money on the table (as most of the other characters in this film do). If that's not a flaw then it's just another waste of time, nothing more important than a collection of ditzy and silly plot lines.  The acting is pretty bad, although there is some talent in it. They don't even fit their roles, most likely. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is just bad.  I would give this film a 1-1 but since I saw it at a small theater I'll say 1-2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the only problem was that the director wanted to do a 'grittily-chased murder', which was probably why he made this film, you'd be right for a movie to be about. But the problem is, the movie itself is too shallow and insensitive to even be called a movie. The plot is not much better than the film of the real murderer, and there's too many twists and turns that make the story seem illogical.   The final verdict here is: 'Bake a cup of popcorn'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the film equivalent of every dumb American film with a stupid, pointless plot and boring plot. There are no twists, no excitement, no chemistry, and it doesn't even begin to pay attention to what's happening.  The plot isn't so bad and the action is more entertaining than the characters. However, this is the worst part of a movie: The script is bad, it's not like movies, and the plot doesn't have any surprises to make.  In what could be called a "film that isn't even made for children", "SINES" is just a really bad excuse to waste an hour, because the film itself is good and it has some good actors. There is one funny scene. In the film that you will never even see (i.e. "SINS", "Inspecting The Devils", "Killer", or "Iris", or some other like a similar movie), they are absolutely unbelievable, the action scenes aren't thrilling, and most of them are just silly and uninteresting.  But let's give this movie a rating: 1: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just happened on this film and I was a little intrigued to see how it was made. As I said in one of the first comments of this film I felt like they had taken some very serious liberties with the film. When it got on with the director and I didn't agree. There were some very confusing scenes with the characters getting a little away from their story and taking it off in a different direction. The acting didn't work well. But this is the type of movie that really makes you mad and you don't want to see it. If you have to see this type of film I'd give it a 10 if it were a horror movie. This is really bad and I'm going out of my job to see something else. This movie is about the writer being in a cult movie when she is at a festival in her hometown and it's a bad way for her to start it. She keeps doing horrible things and getting the audience to see her in it. I'd recommend that people don't get this movie. It's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film because of a bad TV show (which was one of my least favorite) in the early 2000's. I had hopes this film would be something like "I Love You". But that was never the case.  As it was supposed to be.  A few things that are so bad about this movie: a pretty bad attempt at a comedy with a bunch of horrible gags (in some of the movie) as well as a bad premise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to know what the hell is going in to a movie: if there is an answer to what this movie is, please please tell me how it was supposed to end. First of all I don't know if it's about one person or a bunch of people who can just say what they want to do. The movie is either a stupid person or people who don't like to keep their stories simple. If it's in one person like the other then there would be a clear ending to the story. If you're confused by what you see on the screen then there is nothing left to say. That's why we have the people to start with. If the person is a bit of a douche, then it would be better to wait until they decide what they will do next.  I do agree that these two people could probably be friends. However it is not necessary to get friends to work on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the misfortune to see the opening film this week. It wasn't that bad in itself, but it got ridiculous when the actor was at the end of the film - it was like watching a video of a bad car race. The actors didn't do anything themselves, they just put their name in the mouth.   If you want to know how bad it was for me, see my review of "The Last Night" starring Alana McFarris. I'd say that it was the most disappointing and ridiculous film I've ever seen. It is not even the worst film I have ever seen, and I think Alana will be best known for her role in "She-A-Matter" (as I've said before), not for the fact that she is such a terrible character. The plot is absolutely horrible, and there is no point where you can laugh.  This is only the second worst film directed by Mike Nichols. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never done a movie: a movie I can sit through and watch but it doesn't stay long enough to get me to make me sit.  This movie was a total waste of time and I felt bored the entire time. The acting was poor, the plot was horrible, the cinematography was mediocre and the acting was awful. My wife and I have both agreed that this was probably the worst movie we have ever made. There was only one piece of good acting in the movie and that was the opening scene where the character was introduced to a good looking man, but that part I couldn't even find anywhere in the whole movie, but if I was bored by it I definitely wouldn't want to sit through it anymore.  If you can find the video on any video site and you can recommend it on IMDb, I recommend skipping it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think there's something in the process of editing that has gotten lost for this film. If a man can invent a secret and then invent a movie of it...   This film just fails to take its time.  I give this movie a 6 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea is that it can be a documentary that would be a great way to promote the story of the human animal. However the idea of going to the zoo is never mentioned in the show. They go there instead of doing something that is so pointless.  They put a man in a cage and put him in a hat and stick him in the hat. He gets an office job and does the same thing as the cat man. In the process of their story it is so dull that it has really no effect to bring the story forward. The only good part of the film is the fact that it is a documentary.  The story is so bad that one could ask it to be filmed. The actors are too good, the acting is so wooden that you can't even see the actors. The music is very poor. It is absolutely terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went out with friends who knew what they were going to do, and I didn't know what to do or what I was going to happen. The end of this movie was pretty scary. I couldn't figure out who was going back into the bunker and where the person was coming out. There is not any action at all except for an hour and a half of scary. If you liked some action like the action scenes in "Killers", you'll like it. You won never see anything like that in this movie. If the story was good, it would have been great. But if it wasn't, it could have come to a different conclusion. The acting is terrible. The direction is awful. The gore is awful, even if you liked gore in the first installment. The only good things in this film are the visuals. There are a few funny moments that are a bit better than the rest. Some of them are pretty funny. But this movie is really bad. Too bad. This movie is nothing worth watching. Maybe a little bit of it has a good ending. But then you can tell it's bad. It's just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a little embarrassed to admit I wasted an hour watching this film. It is a really stupid movie that is only a bit more disgusting than "Lawrence I Conquiry" (though it's no worse than "Tape of the Man").  I would say the film is boring and pointless. It lacks an all-around plot and only contains one woman (the wife of "Lawson of Conquyer") in a recurring plot. The story is predictable and completely predictable, and there is absolutely no tension.  The film is even worse when compared to "Toledo."  In fact "Lawes" isn't even worth saving the two hours of your life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that really doesn't do justice to its subject matter. For example, its character's relationship to the father figure was obviously not handled well. We knew it would not even remotely happen when his character dies in the first movie, which is pretty much the point of this movie. This film tries to make the son more sympathetic than the father, which was never done in the earlier films.  In one way, this movie tries to bring a new face to the family with its father figure. He is the one that we knew would be dead anyway. While the other characters did very well, it seems they are just "guiding" his behavior, while the father is simply acting like he's a mad man in his usual manner.  This movie can't even be classified as a horror film. It isn't like an AFI film, and even the director is at odds to that.  It is not even really scary. The scenes are predictable, it's just dull.  I don't remember what it had going to do. My guess was that the only thing that made me laugh was the fact that it played a car going on the bridge. I couldn't figure out what was going to happen. It could have been something like that, but I thought that was pretty ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie at a charity reception (I guess I got the ticket with my ticket). I was hoping it would be a positive review, but that was a little bit too naive. The premise and the plot were absolutely pathetic. It wasn't quite as bad as the original "Karate", but it was still awful. I never felt much for the actors who didn't seem to do anything except for talking to me. I was expecting to see a nice performance of a woman who was a woman with a huge ass, but it looked like they had nothing to do but hold a big fat purse in front of people. The movie is extremely shallow, and the direction was poorly choreographed. The only reason I liked it was because the acting was so good. The other parts of the film were just awful. If you really wanted to see this movie, you should be going somewhere far off in the woods to meet some of the actors and maybe even the director. It was just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie that can only be described as a "Horrible" movie. It's not even a "horrible" film, but it's not one that I enjoy seeing much. The characters are too dumb to make me laugh, the story is so contrived and unbelievable that I cannot sit in the theater and laugh like a cat.  The acting isn't too good either, but there is no hope that any of the actors will ever come back.  I can't blame it for the horrible acting, because it wasn't bad at all. That said, it doesn't have a big budget, it's more like a bad film with "bad" script, bad directing and bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Washon, I'm sorry, I was out. You can read the story as the truth, but you can't really say it was accurate. It's been one of the worst films I've ever seen in recent years. The characters were so annoying, the story was totally useless. I decided to turn it off after I finished the film and I laughed in disbelief. The scene in the hotel room is unbelievable. And the ending was just pathetic. A few minutes of a good movie could have saved this movie, but it really ruined it. It was OK at the beginning, but after the ending the story started becoming a joke and then spiraled into a stupid story with a ridiculous number of characters. My opinion is: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Naked Eye" is nothing more than the same old cliché, and there is something about it that just isn't there, and that seems to be even more disturbing than the rest. This is a film that doesn't need to be scary. There's plenty of scary things in it and it just falls apart as fast as a tangle. There are no story. There're no point or action. There aren't much to make. If you see it on TV you'll get the plot, but if you don't you'll just go through your head without a movie to follow. It's just about a boring, boring, ridiculous film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was horrible, but I thought it was interesting. Alas, too much time is wasted. I can't really blame the producers for wasting so much money on this. As a person with a brain who cares only for entertainment, I thought they couldn't find an adequate way to build a movie about a fictional serial killer.   I have read several reports about this movie, and I can confirm that the premise is absurd. What really kills the film is that the main characters, being in their cars, are supposedly driving to the edge of the road. And there is the fact that all the car is black. I don't know why this is. I thought the car was being filmed through the body of the car, and then it would be possible to use a lens to see the cars. You can see a different image of the body, but what would the audience do? I'd be surprised if someone could actually see that. The film really doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely no plot, nothing new and it's all the same stupid, stupid, boring and meaningless stuff as that's in "Gitmo".   The characters in "Rape", all the supporting actors from the first "Gittamon", get so old and they start talking like they're having a heart disease instead of talking like their parents were having a love bond with their kids.  This really adds nothing new to the plot and all it's done is annoying and unnecessary. I think it's better to avoid this movie for a good reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As always, I've been skeptical of so many times where they can so effectively say anything. So, my first reaction is to avoid watching. I knew when I read this I would be disappointed but I really wanted to see. I only watched the first 30 minutes, and I am now deeply frustrated with it. I have read somewhere that this was the most important film ever, but this is the most shallow piece of trash I've seen in a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the movie equivalent of a low budget effort, poorly acted, and not even performed. It is bad to watch. It has nothing to do with reality. It's just an excuse to entertain people to make a joke on the Internet. The plot is pretty bad. If I was going to watch any kind of movie I would do anything for this. I'm really ashamed to admit that I bought this movie because it was so awesome (that is no joke, my friends, really). But this movie is not good for any purpose. I couldn't take any of it. The main reason I didn't buy it was because I knew this movie would be released sometime. If you had some guts and a good memory like I did, you would surely watch this movie. However, I was wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Sucker!" follows a young girl who discovers that her boyfriend, a college dean, has a penchant for the finer wine and the ability to taste all kinds of drugs, and, on his next day, he gets caught in a drug crisis. It's really quite silly for a movie: a freshman student comes home to her roommate with a new lady friend who is quite interested in him, and she tells him to "trust the people around you and take care of their needs." (Hey, what's that?) Then the roommate decides to drive her to a motel to get some dope. So, yeah, yeah. You may be surprised, but I can't blame the filmmakers for giving the female a nickname she can draw in her school year. They thought that they would be good, and that if they could make a movie with her name and a car, it would be funny. They couldn't do that with just a name and an vehicle. (They also put in some dumb dialog. The characters don't seem like people who can plan or make jokes). The story itself is quite predictable, and not even interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it would be nice to do a sequel and have the "Dance of the Dragons" style of casting for the sequel to the first film. Well, there are some people who could actually get the 2nd part. There would have been some pretty cool actors that would help the first movie, but they are just too bad to make it happen.   There is one reason why it's so bad--that they didn't put their very talented actors in the first. The first film had great talent and a cast. The sequel had too much wasted talent in the "Swing of the Dragon".  The first movie was a good effort, but it was too far behind the rest of "Dragon." I have to say that the first "Dragon" was the only good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really bad movie...if only because I love the movie....this movie tries so hard to make this seem like a true crime or something out of the ordinary...it isnt. Its just a cheap exploitation of the idea of a killer, and nothing else. The film is nothing, except bad for acting. The dialog was just as bad, but I had to laugh with a great big laugh at most of it. Its not funny...it doesn't have much to do with the idea behind the film. It just is the type of movie that doesn't work. You might get better entertainment if you were actually involved in a murder or something similar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Sleeze" is a movie about a group of people who go to a seedy club to try to rent and rent a movie. The movie starts on a rainy day. But the movie is so bad, the acting is so awful, and the movie starts in a very predictable way. The plot of this movie is about a small group of actors, that of course are a bunch of people, but the movie never really progresses. I could watch a movie that was better than this, but I won't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Zeta Five" is a horrible, poorly written, mediocre, boring film with an irritating story. The film is so bad that you really need to go to sleep to see a great movie.  The story is about a young man, Zeta (Lorenzo Gistalini) who is having problems with his girlfriend, (Alana Mayo) and his mother (Brigi Reiter). He is forced to do some kind of torture with his friends and his girlfriend.  There is not much more to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only redeeming quality of this movie was the script, which had a clear message of what they wanted to do with the lives of the characters in the film. Unfortunately, that message was lost. The way the characters are treated is completely illogical. They were supposed to have been "free-thinking, independent, independent individuals". They were living in a more typical environment than a typical New York family, with a home and some money to support them. When they left their home, they had no money to rent the apartment, but the owner had given them some money, and then in the movie they just sat around and waited for their money to arrive. They then proceeded to sleep in their house for the rest of the day, making all sorts of little compromises with their parents. When the owner arrived, it turned out there was a few people in their home who had stolen money from their parents, making themselves into their new, empty home, and having no sense of life. The whole story of the film is based on a very basic concept: if people are really that free, they won't stay home and be a person.  Even if the "free man" is in charge of making decisions, it is extremely unfair for him to give up on those people he had free to, then give money to people with whom he had stolen it from. It is extremely insulting to have people pay $10 for a movie which is really about their lives and the people who, in an extremely simplistic way, was supposed to be free, to see them as people who have no home or even a home, when there is no home. That isn't a good way to go about it. That was also the only point the writers had in the whole plot. The "free person" obviously never thought there would be a difference in people who were just free and living their lives, and it really didn't occur.  The movie itself is completely pointless. I don't understand it at all. I just didn't like it. It's just not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. A good story and a decent special effects are poor, especially the acting. Some actors should have done better, or better, for their parts. This movie is one of those dumb, dumb movies that have been set on repeat on a thousand years, with some people actually getting rich. That is the only point to this awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Return" is an awful, dull, low budget movie that contains no excitement whatsoever. The actors were very pretentious in a couple of scenes, but the overall plot was extremely convoluted and the acting was rather unbelievable. The plot lacked any real plot. What we are really expecting is a little twist or suspense to occur (I guess you get that by the writer) or to add some new characters (I am very skeptical about that). It does not really help, especially since the two central characters are so dull, and they both act so badly. It is too early for this to be taken as a sequel of some sort, because it is too long already. That said, if you want a film about the return of American heroes, then look no further than "The Enemy."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was initially offended by the fact that the storyline of "Star Wars: Episode 1" was so cliché. I've seen it in several films. It was boring, even boring.  The scenes in "Star Trek 2" were so creative and had a storyline. They worked together with their characters and scenes that showed some depth to the story, but was still cliché. It just seemed like a typical sequel.  I didn't enjoy it either. It lacked substance and had too much in it, and the dialog was simply terrible. I was confused at the premise of the first three films. The premise of "Strayon" I knew would probably be the most disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was some excellent work from Mr. Shettel in the opening credits, but the final production is awful. In the beginning everything looks good and it doesn't get worse. But in the end it's just a really awful film. The best part of the movie is the ending which starts with a surprise twist and a very dark and disturbing ending. However, the twist ends in a cliché and ends with nothing but a punch line, and the end is just a predictable one.  This is a disappointing film with only two interesting and original scenes. Even the ending is awful, and I didn't even feel that it happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to be very disappointed with this film. It just goes on and on with absolutely no explanation. I can't think of any script that tells us who we really are. No mention of who we are, no explanation of what we should do next for ourselves. No message in all that it has to tell us. The only thing that I can say with certainty is that it's going to leave you with something like a "The Next Mission" movie in it's conclusion, or a "Kung Fu Man" movie. No one has to read a script that is as empty and without a message to send us to bed. Please don't bother with the movie, it's a waste of a lot of money. I have nothing more to say than that this is the worst thing that has ever been released from the film business. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible show. It's very obvious, it's very predictable, and it's so predictable that it is stupid to watch. But I have to admit that this show is a bit entertaining, and I do not believe it's intended to be a comedy or a humorless show. I think it is meant to be just the equivalent of a sitcom or a movie. It is no surprise that such a show is completely pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the biggest piece of trash I have ever seen in my life. It's a pretty lousy piece of work, if it weren't an awful movie, it would be a good movie. But, even worse than the movie, I can't say it was good enough to merit the title, because I still don't understand why anyone ever gave it a title. The plot was pretty basic and pretty predictable, although there was a nice plot element to some parts, namely the lack of romantic relationships and the possibility of having a boyfriend. There was some great visual effects but they were only used on the first movie. The acting wasn't too bad, although the characters were awful and the storyline seemed to be convoluted. The scenery and special effects weren't bad, the photography was very good, but this movie was one of the worst movies I have seen.  The cast didn't look like people I would normally see in a movie. They looked like guys you would find at a car wash. They had the same body movements and gestures as their usual actors, but not even near the same look-good look-badness. The movie was also not very good for the camera. The production seemed amateur and out-of-place in some of the scenes. The camera moves seemed pretty good, although they didn't have enough to make it look like amateurish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading and watching the trailers, I was expecting the movie to be like "The Adventures of David Lynch" and its sequel (or, at least one) would be much better. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The plot is incredibly weak, the acting is incredibly bad and the story is only a pretentious piece of trash.  I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. In fact, I did not even find this movie worth watching, not even one minute.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is the worst in all of film no matter what genre, director or writer, the only reason for any action movie made in the 20th century is to make a film to criticize it and to put the whole idea that a real action movie must have a plot.  the only way that this film is put on is that it needs to go out of the box of the movie in some manner, such as with a very bad director, a very weak script and very bad special effects. This movie does not do well as a DVD or even as a series or even a television show.  The director of this movie thinks that the film should have a story to have a beginning (I don't believe there is any beginning). It is not something that should be done when the writer of the film is just trying to get people to see the movie and do something which isn't necessarily done in a documentary or as a television series.  this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is awful. It has a few redeeming moments of a plot--something about a man who murders his wife. And I'm not that sickly heartless about it--like, say, The Silence or a movie about the Great Depression--but I still think the film is about the stupidity and stupidity of people who are forced to go out of their own skin and kill innocent people because the government will be their last shot. The film is not about the human tragedy--in the true sense--the human tragedy is the loss of family and love. It's about a movie that will kill two family members.   For all of my life I have struggled to find a movie to which I could compare it with The Silence. The biggest similarity was the fact that The Silence had a single ending. I never thought I could find this movie. It was never satisfying--except for the moments where I couldn't find the ending. And now, finally, it is about to be released! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the original, the scene was obviously an empty play. But even that was better than the final movie... a bad plot, bad acting and the horrible special effects make this movie a horrible waste of the time and money to make. Even if you loved the original film, you would find this pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this film was made as a spoof of a really big movie, it would be great. But it is not. This film is simply a bad and unimaginative production. It is not even funny as a sitcom. The plot is not drawn out from a plot, as most comedy spoofs do. It's just dumb; it's predictable.  I give this film a 2/10. It has been very predictable, and this is easily explained away by a bad editing. The film is just a bunch of overused clips. It might make a few bucks for people who want to see it as a serious movie, but most people would simply find it boring to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, is what I'd describe as a "horror movie". Its very weak, really only shows some minor moments, and you can't quite imagine what would happen in "The Vampire Hunter" when it is in the movie "The Devil", unless you had to go through the whole story line and think like it could happen. It also tries to be scary but the story line is not very scary. It just feels like a bunch of people walking around in a room that have not taken care to prepare. There is also no plot. It's just a bunch more people who just don't seem to want to be there and who are so stupid that they go on and make a lot of noise. I felt like I was watching something for 40 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a stupid way to make a movie with a bad plot. What fun is this? I can't tell because I'm not interested in the plot, but my wife and I have been watching this film through the week, and I'm certain that I've seen worse movies in my life. The main cast is the most obnoxious people you've ever seen. The "comedes" seem to believe themselves and act as if they are in a sitcom. The fact that they are at a movie set in a fictional city is ridiculous. Even a real actor would never act like this; I can tell that. I don't want to see the actors play so closely with each other. The acting is bad enough that it could have been put together for a cheap movie with some funny lines and made fun by the actors themselves. I'm ashamed that I rented this movie and I couldn't even watch it myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only redeeming feature is a good one. But the plot is a poor one. While the director has done good work on other projects (such as, "Kilena: The Last Frontier") he has done nothing on this piece of crap. I have been in both of the movies and I have never found it to be a good movie either. I watched this film twice but it doesn't get my vote. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Taken" is a horrible movie that pretends to be a documentary about a drug abuse epidemic, which really is the only mistake it is. It is just about a cop making a case for the alleged killer in the apartment (or garage, which is also the case of the "killer" in the trailer) and not a documentary. It was filmed in a real warehouse or on a construction site, not in the small studio that this movie is set in. They just put a bunch of people who want to make a documentary (and some money) in an apartment and shoot a big close-up with a bunch in it. When the killer is back in the garage, the film tries to be interesting with shots of a construction, a garage, and an interior room and some light-to-dark interplay with a computer that shows something about a car driving and its occupants, but there is just too much going on. The film doesn't make much sense, it isn't that creative, it just relies on the idea of a drug overdose and how to use it. There are many fake images and scenes (for instance, a helicopter, that's not real). The whole thing is just one of the cheap special effects put on, and really not enough to justify it. A lot of scenes are just like an empty lot in the movie with a lot of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad horror film. I give it a 2 out of 10. The film is full of disgusting blood, gore, blood splatter and a bunch of disgusting gore. But aside from this, the acting was good in most of the scenes (especially in the first hour), but most of it is nothing to be expected.  In the last half of the film, the main character (Dalina), her brother and her father were so vile and gross that even for a minute, we could tell that they were both dead. We think she was just a crazy bitch. The ending made me shudder in horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it's no joke. I won't make this excuse. I will make this clear. This is bad. Why did this film get green at the film festivals. If you want a movie that is like "the book of demons" you have got it. This movie wasn't even like "The Book of Demons" at the book of devils. There are a lot of demons in this movie, I guess there is something to get more time, and in some way this movie should be put on a DVD release. I'll add a positive review about  I found the movie enjoyable in many ways, but I will say that the fact that I did not like it is not something that I can comment on. I don't really understand how to interpret this film, or the meaning of it, for myself. There's nothing in it. It's just bad, bad-movies. They are not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the most disappointing of all of the films from the Disney era. The acting is bad, the music is bad and the film has absolutely no plot, not even an outline. If the filmmakers wanted to make a documentary like this film, they should have put more time and money into the film. It's embarrassing to say that this film was made because the story involved a lot of children, who could possibly relate to the film and would have been able to relate to it. A shame to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this was a "Seinfeld" knock-off, I'd give it a 10 out of 10, it would have been much more effective. Unfortunately, it was only a cheap, cheesy "Bored" movie with some recycled plot lines and a handful of gags. Basically, it had a very predictable plot and a very weak plot, though there were some good moments throughout the film. However, the movie just lacked a proper plot. It's a shame the plot was put on the screen in a way that was too confusing and didn't match the flow of Seinfeld's humor, so it really couldn't work out the most of Seresen's best aspects. I also didn't enjoy the movie.  If you liked Seinfeld, you will enjoy it. But not as much as if you didn't know Seinfeld. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not one of my favorites but i think it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. There is no way this movie can survive the fact that it was made. In my opinion, this movie is completely terrible. It was obviously made to be a low budget, low budget action movie, but the truth was that it is actually just too expensive. If this movie was a movie made for kids, then it would be a good one. However, the acting is terrible. In fact, most of the actors were obviously not as young as we saw in this movie. The only thing that was good was the chemistry, but that was only after the actors gave their little acting performances. There was no chemistry, there was only one good scene. the music was OK but the acting was bad. If you wanted to see a comedy movie with some laughs and a laugh, this was the movie you would be watching. In this case, the humor was bad enough but the jokes were bad. The story seemed totally fake and made no sense, and the fact the acting played out was so terrible that I actually felt as if my life were about to come up on. I don't know if anyone had a clue when the movie started. There were a lot of excuses for this movie and nothing new to make an excuse. I would say you could be a better actor if you had some background knowledge or some good movie background. But I guess you won't want to do anything so stupid. I mean, I don`t believe there's a real way to make a movie about this thing. It's probably the worst movie i`ve seen, as far as I have done anything. It certainly has nothing to recommend to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the most dongery movies ever made. I can't imagine why anyone with intelligence would ever waste such an attempt. I mean no actors, no special effects, no beautiful lighting effects, or a really nice soundtrack. Only one thing that made this movie enjoyable was the dialog. Some of the lines were so bad that they got me really upset. This was the only thing I cared about in the movie, and that was only because there were only a couple of scenes where the two actors were completely clueless. The rest were just plain terrible. They just kept showing the characters talking to each other as if it was some sort of bizarre scenario. They tried to make the movie more entertaining to me by making things seem like they were happening in real life. That's okay but for most of the scenes they only happened in the backwoods. That made my life miserable. I don't think there's any real meaning to be found in this movie. The plot was interesting but didn't add anything new. There's some humor and some amusing scenes but they weren't too interesting for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is a little vague but it really has no plot. What does it have to do with any number of magical objects? The premise is pretty stupid, but it tries to have a "story" to a good movie, where it turns out to be a plot that has absolutely no storyline whatsoever. I would give this film the same rating it would receive if it had the ability to bring the story alive. The script seems to have some creative intelligence (the scene where one of the "healing" women is screaming for the monster's death) but it is simply wasted.  Also, I was surprised to see the "spirit" and "life" characters from the story, that is all I had expected, and I was disappointed that they appeared in it at all. I didn't even like the actors in the movie (or their disguises) although they had done so well with the scene that featured them in it. They don't even fit in with the rest of the plot. I thought that the film made so many false statements and so much of the storyline was so vague that I don't really know whether they were true or false.  This film was just a bad attempt at a "movie" that I couldn't even finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing that doesn't bother me in this film is the lack of any real message or message. It doesn't matter if it's a plot or just characters, it's just a simple storyline. This film really is just a bunch of bored guys in a desert with a big ol town on one side and a bunch more stupid town on the other side. I'd like to point out that the whole town is about 20 miles in a day for some reason.  A lot of the actors and the story are pretty stupid.   If you're going to make a film about desert or desert or one in the south you can use a movie about the "spaces" like the infamous "Jobie" or the infamous Vietnam. But if you're making the film about a simple town, I suggest that you don't use any of them. They don't add anything significant to the story. They aren't very original or original or very good or special.  If I had to summarize the movie, it would be this: a dumb town of guys that try to create a paradise for themselves and then are killed because of their stupidity and their dead loved ones. This movie just falls flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I had to watch it to finish. I was hoping for an entertaining one. Unfortunately, I was just left looking at every other movie on the planet (there are some interesting ones, but this one was just awful). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely awful - not even a decent one for this late, late year. This film has no plot, no characters, nothing, no story and no real characters. The characters are just made-up and added to the movie with absolutely meaningless dialogue and scenes that are just about 30 minutes long! The plot itself is quite shallow and completely predictable.  For example, the whole movie hinges on a mysterious girl, who somehow, I believe, killed all the members of the family who were at the house. So why is this girl still alive? Where was she at the place she used to work, and how many more people knew she was alive?  The ending is absolutely pointless and totally unrealistic. I thought it would be better to finish this movie after all, but I guess the director wanted to make it like it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director's comment in "Rivals" seemed to sum it up.  There are far too many lines and many "gatherings" where no matter what we say, we can never know what the outcome is. So, I decided to watch this just to see if the comments will ever be correct, and I think they aren't.  The premise, as it is, has never really worked out for the whole story. The ending is so lame, I think I'll never be able to find this movie: *1) There was a car driving around with a car on that is missing its license (battery) *2) *The car was driving around and was going through a street *3) *Where it is heading for a gas station *4) *All the people in the movie are really stupid *5) *6) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm hoping I can finish my career as a movie actor. I have the opportunity to work in a small studio. I'm currently reading the book "Hip Through the Eyes" and I'm scared to death that the director is going to screw it up. It's just plain bad, and worse than anything I've ever seen. Please, please don't waste your time! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the reason the movie made, is because the main theme of the movie is to bring the story of a serial killer whose obsession is a little beyond. The plot is not quite believable, it just falls apart into an absurd plot. The scene in which the killer attempts to rape his victim is so much of an absurd attempt at a movie, but it just can't make itself up to the standard.  The story is just about rape (which is about the killer getting to do whatever he wishes). The rest of the story is about trying to do better as a human being with that horrible rape scene.  You can't believe this guy's idea. It's a lot like a movie from an old cartoon--one of those old, pre-teen cartoons that are very poorly kept. If you had any knowledge of cartoon writing or animation--which I have--you would never believe this movie.  A movie that sets such a low bar like this is a bad waste of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are several interesting characters here, but the story is totally shallow and one of the biggest mistakes I've seen in this movie. It's not funny or interesting. It only seems to make me angry, so it's hard to find the reason to cheer for this. The acting is horrible, and the story makes no sense. There are some nice shots, but they are all about sex (and some other stuff) that is not appropriate. I think it's bad in its own way, but it still seems to be entertaining. The best part of this movie is the ending, as it is about the realization that this movie was about sex. I'll admit, it's okay that they are taking this seriously and not doing anything serious. However, the fact that they were going out for sex does not make up for the movie's supposed to be about sex, and even if this movie had a sex scene, I wouldn't have wanted that. There is no plot whatsoever, so this film lacks any kind of substance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always been very curious about the actors and how they act in such roles. Not only did they do not act, but the scenes that they were so terrible, so bad, so ridiculous, that I didn't see anything remotely original in the story.  I think I had a sense when the characters were about to be cast and I could almost picture my own characters, but it doesn't. I think there were only a couple instances of the actors who were a bit more believable than the others. My feeling was that they had been cast so badly, it made it seem like they were in a film production. There really was no reason.  My opinion is that if they wanted to be a film this movie should have been one, but no, it didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a movie, "FAST Five" is pretty terrible. It really wasn't intended to be that, or to be an effort to get better, because the movie didn't really feel that way. What is the movie's purpose, and how does it get to work in a way that makes no sense? The end of the movie was a plot to make the story about how the whole team worked out from the first day, as if they had a story to tell to each other, the movie ended up with a plot so dull that it doesn't really help. This movie was the worst that I have ever seen. I was looking for something that was fun and funny. To watch a movie that had a decent story (I like the cast and the direction), you'd expect that, but instead you find out that it is just a waste of a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie when I was a teenager. It was so bad that it made me weep. I was looking for something better, so I just kept on watching. I didn't understand what they were trying to do. We're not meant to know what they are, so it's best to keep away from them. I really just wish that this movie was made of something and not just a pile of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw it on the big screen and I was disappointed in its lack of humor and its lack. The funny part was the little girl who made fun of the guy's fake girlfriend and then got so upset that she cried and cried.  The scene where they were kissing is ridiculous and the guy was a complete waste of time at the end.  I also saw it after it's first airing in 2000. I was surprised that this one made it. This was a lame attempt at an American remake of a British film, not even halfway an hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dasmo" is a bad little movie, but that doesn't mean that its a bad thing. This is a movie that has no character depth, no story, no meaning, and is not even able to make it interesting. It just seems to have a small handful of characters, with a few supporting characters. This might be an interesting movie for certain fans of the show, but if you're not one of those fans you can just find this movie as a waste of a film. It's a shame for such a bad attempt at humor that will never be noticed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Hannoebel" was terrible... I laughed, then laughed, and then started crying. Even after they got a little, I was still crying and screaming. I thought I was going to die, and I was trying to kill myself. I guess that's because that's the only thing I'm going to be remembered by as long as I remember it. The actors had no effort, just screaming. The plot was just stupid. I was left wondering if it was real or was they pretending to be a bunch of teenagers. There was absolutely nothing that made this movie remotely appealing. The end is terrible, I can only blame the bad ending, but I sure didn't fault the movie. I hope that someone will see this movie and get the message. It is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's obvious that this movie is an extremely disappointing movie. However, even though it's not a perfect movie, I found it acceptable to the extreme of the human cruelty. Not only do I regret the fact that I rented this movie and then wasted it on it... I'm very, very, disappointed with that. At least I can finally say that there is only one movie in the world that can come at me so far as to pass the most extreme of film making that you can imagine. I thought that this was the movie with the most ridiculous plot line imaginable. This isn't an uncommon thing to have in a movie. So if you get to see this movie... you're going to be very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a huge fan of the film, but I do not like it in the way I see it either.  The film was extremely stupid. While it isn't exactly a bad piece of film, it does a horrible job in showing a person who has died, and a person that is now in a life force.  I have absolutely no knowledge of the person's whereabouts. The actors are obviously unqualified for the job. It would have been fine for them to be the only person to play his father and father's dead father, but that wouldn't make that the film.  There was a pretty good part of the movie where the "scary house" family would get their heads pulled off. If I had been in one of those houses when the "family" got their heads off, I would never have laughed at that.  If the film was made about the person, I think the whole film would be a lot better if it showed some of the blood they got from the death they got. The whole thing of the thing would have worked out, but it doesn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie because of the stars' appearance in the original film. As they were, they were great actors and the story was OK, but they were so much worse when it came out on the TV. I found it ridiculous that this film would even have the same actors as the original. I find it ironic that this was made because of an absolutely disappointing performance. I was expecting a great performance from all the actors in the film, but instead, they just acted like their own characters did. You'd expect a really good performance from a bad performance, but a really bad one. The only reason I wanted to see this film was so that it would make me angry. The ending was disappointing, too, and the main character in the movie was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a little concerned about the lack of details regarding the movie but after watching it, it didn't really bother me. I didn't even care to look further. Some of the scenes were fairly interesting, but it was only a bit annoying that it was not consistent and one of the more disturbing scenes was just a scene with a naked woman.  But for some reason, it seemed to me that this movie was not really supposed to be a horror film. It was so dull that I just couldn't care what to say. It is so terrible that I'm considering watching this at my local library. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a bit confusing. The first few episodes are about a madman that is able to manipulate his opponents (an extremely believable performance by Marcia Bellows) and then has a girlfriend that falls in love with him. The other episode is about an evil doctor that uses a cure to make the victim's wife suffer from the disease that her husband brought and thus infecting her. This makes little sense because the doctor would have to treat her husband with the cure so that she could cure him, but it is simply pointless.  The two episodes that are most interesting involve the rape scene, where the murderer rapes the wife, tries to seduce her, and forces her to become a virgin, but only if the husband dies, then all is fine. In the two final episodes, the rapist rapes her again, but not really kills her. In fact, the movie isn't as bad as I thought it was. But it seems to be missing something, and there are some aspects that make the episode seem like the film has been written. The storyline is quite different when it has just one story of rape and murder. For example, in one episode, the murderer also rapes the victim, and then forces her into an agreement to get her pregnant, but he can't bring himself to the agreement because she's pregnant, and in another episode, she is killed by her husband. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a horrible mess. It starts out as a typical Western/thirties action movie that revolves around the love of some villain with a penchant for killing, but then gets progressively outburger as it is slowly devolved into a genre of action movie without much motivation behind it. The plot is nothing interesting in the slightest. The script is almost incomprehensible. There is too many of the same "trends" coming up that these movies are trying to bring. When watching any Western or film this genre, it doesn't matter if the script is a complete garbage, or you have some funny bits and pieces. The movie can be quite funny in a few minutes, but after watching them, you'll wonder if it's real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a writer and I know the difference between a good movie and a bad one, but I'm pretty confident that a good one won't get shot at by the filmmakers. Unfortunately this movie had no depth. While the acting and the cinematography were good, there wasn't enough time to connect this story with the characters. And I've seen this kind of story every now and then.  The acting is the main reason people give this movie a "1/10" rating. What's so terrible? Well, apart from the "gimmets" as the main motivation of the movie, the only "plot" was a simple, one-dimensional plot. What were the characters supposed to be? The movie isn't a true story of a missing girl.  No matter what was said in this movie, it didn't make me understand why people want to take so long to find the girl. I have never found the story to be a compelling one. In a lot of situations, I have always found it too easy to figure out the mystery of the missing girl and how she became missing. I've never felt anything more disappointing than seeing this movie. I'm hoping that I'll be able to convince people to see it instead of watching it so we can improve our understanding of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I thought that the premise sounded good. However, what really happens here is that there is nothing funny. Not even the best comedians do it. Not only a few characters seem to be having fun, but then, they all get played out like crap. Some might even get away but there is no reason for them to stay. If this movie isn't funny, it isn't good! Avoid it at all costs. I mean, if you have seen "The Castle", you know that it is funny. But, there is something more you could get from this. The jokes are too predictable, the characters are too one dimensional, and they don't make it interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Legend of Monster Men 2" is about a little boy who, at the beginning of his life, is discovered by the "monster" police because of a series of crimes. We meet some little boy whom, in this movie, discovers that his life is about to change.  As a young boy who discovers this, he is very curious about this monster and has a crush on the monster girl. He is not happy. He thinks he is the monster and he wants to capture it to make sure he doesn't get killed by it. This boy, in his mind, has to destroy the monster because of the "Monster" part, but as a young man, his heart is not as strong as it should be. It was supposed to be the adventure of a young child, but it's a lousy effort at an excuse for a bad story.    I can't see the actors or the script. The monsters in the film are supposed to resemble their real-world counterparts, but they look like a bunch of guys in a jungle. They were very cheap in their costumes, especially the one who was killed in the movie.  The first scene was when the "Monstrok" monster was caught and killed, and it was also very silly. It looks like a giant monster, but only half of its body is exposed. That thing is supposed to go on behind a dark wall. That monster is supposed also to be very, very similar to the monster in the real world. In both worlds, the monster is supposedly very scary, but here it is obviously not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is too predictable, too predictable. The story is too unbelievable. The characters don't do anything interesting with the supporting cast. The plot only works for the supporting actors. If the story was more interesting then a decent film would have been. The ending is a waste of time. If I can forgive the lack of some humor then this would be an interesting film. But if you are looking for a comedy then this is the only thing that comes out of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am having trouble remembering where exactly it is. I can only say that it is the most stupid piece of film I have ever seen in my life. It is so bad it is impossible to avoid laughing at it. The camera is just plain ridiculous. I mean, this is like "The Fastest Money Ever" if it's that ridiculous! I have just seen some of my old childhood movies and this one is like a joke. When watching, I found it so boring I felt sick. The way they just film it doesn't even make any sense at all. I was looking forward to seeing "The Terminator 2: The Terminator", but I don't know if it was released in 1995 or 2006.  If I could get an idea about "The Machines", I would give myself more than one year of hell! But I can't do anything about it because the writer's name is not even mentioned. I also don't understand the characters because I think they're all the same old guys.  I think "The Man" is actually the guy we are after in a different form. He's like the one who made the Terminator film! He's not a scientist! He doesn't know what he's doing. There are lots of people in the world. The Man is about to find out that the other people in this world are like him. I think he has some sort of cure, if it is a cure, because he's made the first one in the history of mankind. He has got some kind of computer on his shoulder, and I guess it is one of his own. And the "Weirdest" thing he is about is that he's making the computer himself. The man must find out which computer he has made. I guess "Weirds" is the computer he is using on his own computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a total waste of any entertainment it is supposed to be. The plot is very weak, so it is unlikely that anyone could find out that it was a documentary. The acting is OK (particularly the acting by Paul Verne, who was obviously the man in the documentary). However, the camera doesn't do a good job of capturing the action, so some shots are missing in the main scenes.  It is obviously meant to be a satire, but since it is very short, it's pretty predictable.  The plot does manage to provide some funny moments and some amusing moments, but it doesn't succeed in generating any real momentum. I guess that this is meant to keep the audience amused for a while, and therefore is a pretty boring.  Overall, the only redeeming feature of the film is the fact that it does contain some interesting footage. The story is interesting and it is a bit more entertaining than the film usually provides, but there are very few moments that are enjoyable. It's OK, but perhaps better to stick with the DVD to watch the movie on a DVD or a VCR. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only has the film failed, but I'm guessing the reason why it failed is because it failed at the very basic stage of the making - that the camera movements were not even remotely believable. This is the sort of movie that has done before (such as The Ring and The Naked Hand) - that doesn't need the camera movement to do it for the sake of making a point. I'd really suggest a different type of movie for the "movie of the day" which focuses more on the camera in a way which really focuses on the character and their interaction, not just on what a camera happens to look like. The film isn't even that bad - but I can understand how it became that. If you see it, you'll realize the film could have even made more of it and a little more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had little or no message in it and it looked like a poorly executed piece of cinema from a "B" movie: a film that you would have to put in a hat and put on your lap. That's the result of the very poor scriptwriting and the horrible directing that makes this movie the complete joke it needs to be. The plot is so weak that it seems like someone wrote some dumb joke about a "space" (a space ship) and was forced to write something about it. That alone should be the first sign that this film is really bad. This movie is no way to treat yourself, especially those with a sense of humor. The acting, although it was decent at some points, is too bad to make. In some parts you actually get the feeling that the director wanted to see some dumb comedy movies and then got caught in a loop when the result is a movie like this. I guess if you are into the comedy genre you would be in for some action and music; but not this one. You really cannot enjoy movies that are so obviously poorly written. The story may have gotten a little more interesting by the ending and the ending but the story is still left very flat. In fact, I feel that this movie was intentionally written to be bad. There are some really bad movies out there. I don't remember anything else. Just like the movie: The first thing that doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to give this movie a 1.4 out of 10 because it doesn't include much of the true beauty in film, even though it does add a little bit of flavor to it. However, I think the movie got a little out of hand. Although the acting is decent, the story is so shallow that it could just be a clichéd comedy. I am not going as far as to say that the movie didn't develop from the first scenes, but it doesn`t have the same level of development. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely awful - it's all one-sided and it's about as far as I can see with all the "plot twists" and "plot ideas". I just think it was the worst of the genre - the only thing that made sense. The acting was horrible. There are a few moments when you want a moment of action and you're rewarded, but then they quickly just disappear and you don't get the satisfaction you expected. I am surprised that a decent movie like this will be released as a movie.  This is a bad example of a slasher flick - the "twists" are too hard to handle. I mean, what was it in "Dramonas" that made that happen? I don't know. The scene where the protagonist goes into the hospital, and he kills everyone in there and then jumps up on the bed and runs away as a zombie! This movie is really about the people, not the story.  I'd really like to see "Drama Rock" as a complete and staged movie instead of a simple "fun" film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is somewhat disappointing. It seems the main character is a murderer with an eye and a bodyguard. This is the only flaw with the film. The main characters are so bad, you can't imagine any plot or anything. The movie seems to be a movie about a "movie" made by someone who doesn't have any script, not a movie made by a movie maker. There's something funny about this movie though. The film has some amusing moments, but it just ends after an hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew the name of this film was ridiculous from the first time I saw it. And I was glad that they finally made it up for a good film. But I am utterly dumbed that even with that, it's just not enjoyable. You may be lucky to have an ending. Otherwise this film is just plain awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a really strange concept and a poor script. The beginning is really stupid with a stupid ending that just kills a couple of guys. The main villain is really annoying, and it is not funny. The idea of this movie is a really lame idea of a movie. It is just ridiculous. It was just terrible. The ending and the film was very predictable. The only good thing I had in this movie was the plot. It starts out with a little bit of humor. The movie ended really well, but I couldn't take the time to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had a predictable ending. The plot is painfully predictable, but after being caught in the loop the story is no more interesting than a carousel.  I won't say too much about the story but I'm sure there are some interesting parts. But the direction is so dull that it's just not worth spending hours on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first thing I noticed when I watched this movie was "My Life" is a rip-off of the original "My Mommy." The ending is totally unrealistic and unnecessary, and the storyline is simply not satisfying.  This movie was really terrible.  The characters seemed to be just living in the house, with the exception of the kids who had to pretend to be married in their first "I Love Me" storyline. The real mom in "My Moms" didn't even have a storyline other than a relationship with the married couple that we actually never see in " My Life."  The end of the movie had to end so badly, and to make the ending the only thing that made the movie worthwhile. This movie is awful. It was just too dumb to make something so bad.  I would rate it a "Pigeon of the Bump" 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a big waste of the director's talent. It is absolutely meaningless because it is too dull, boring and ridiculous. For example, let's not waste the talent of director: go with a director who has a lot of talent and a lot more talent to use it on this movie: go like that director is doing. The funny thing is when you find out that you are really stupid. He does something that no one would think would do. In an industry like ours you find so many movies like that and even when you watch them you get mad.  If you want to watch something new: go to the video store and rent "The Menace" and then you have a real fun time with some actors who are really bad and nothing that I would recommend to watch: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an awful waste of film. If you are going to be expecting a movie starring a big bald guy, you won't get it. And if you are one of those dumb-asses who enjoy a few hours of TV, you can only get the occasional handful of episodes. I thought this movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was bad, the direction was bad and the plot was awful. The ending was even bad.  The title of this movie is not even worth remembering because it was the only one I got ever to remember. I would have laughed at the title if the movie wasn't awful. If it was a good movie, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as it is. I rented it because I liked the idea and was looking forward to seeing it again. But the title is simply a meaningless term to remember when I'm done watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie really is no good in any sense. the acting and camera work is pretty bad, but what I loved was the music! a musical-based film has no chance to pull it off, and in some cases it is even worse than the script. if you're not a fan of musical films, you can see some pretty good songs in this film but no real talent. The only good thing is that the "music" is good as it was in the previous movie, and the ending is a good ending. but unfortunately the plot is too badly written and there is no real reason for this movie. If you are a diehard fan of music you will not care to watch it, and if you are not one of those dumb-ass music fans you will probably wonder why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love a good movie: a good one. Unfortunately this one is one of those boring things that are the greatest offenders. The plot is good, but its lousy premise is ruined by stupid writing and inept direction. There's some good supporting characters, but the overall movie is a total mess. The dialogs are bad and the plot is totally unnecessary. I don't recommend this movie unless you've seen one before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I were a fan of the movie "Dark Angel" i would say that it was okay to be disappointed. What we got was little more than a "no-longer-returned" sequel with a little bit of action added and a few scenes that were removed from the first film.  If the movie were to be rated by 1/2 stars and I gave it a 10, then I would give this movie 1/10. I'd have to agree that the film is not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately it is still very bad. I'm not sure what made the film, or where it was filmed.  One thing that was interesting when I first saw it was the scenes that include in the film. This is a true waste of time, especially for me, and I'm sure if this movie had been made, it would have been a lot better. When I see this movie on a DVD, I can't help but ask my fellow brothers and sisters of the film to be careful of any movie this would have to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pretty disappointed in this film, not only because it seems to have been filmed in reverse and in front of the camera. I guess the director had a reason to make the film in reverse. This was just a waste of time for me, I didn't like the story and the dialog, it was too predictable. It just seemed to have just two actors and a camera crew. The story was just boring, the acting just lacked conviction and the visuals just failed to have an artistic impact. My guess is that the only reason for the film was to prove it's an artistic film. It was a bad film, but in the end, I couldn't find another film like this one. I would say it is the equivalent of "The Mater With Lisa Landon". I had such a feeling of shame for not seeing this film: The man looks too good in this movie, I want to die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst films I have ever seen, and i never had fun to watch. It was full of unnecessary scenes and cheesy lines, i was looking at the subtitles for 30 minutes and thinking what would happen next if i saw it. The plot is really bad, it had too many boring scenes, and had very poor direction. Most of the scenes were done without any real plot, it really was a little funny and the acting was pretty bad, i just wanted to leave it because it had no substance. I just think its OK because it was good for what it was. But this film only got 3/10 from me, and thats the second worst rating i've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending was quite good. But to be honest, that wasn't enough. In the end, this is a movie that has nothing but problems from the beginning. The first major flaw is the portrayal of the rich, powerful men in this movie. As an example, it depicts the rich as having some sense of self-possession and feeling self-confident with one's material wealth. For a film that has "a couple who can't live without money", it is hardly realistic. If one is the kind of person who can make a $2.3 million fortune, it doesn't matter how famous he is. It just can't make it so. The rest of the movie is so boring, so empty, that I decided to avoid watching it at all. As if the rich man is the typical "good" type of guy, you'll never forget what he does in the rest of his life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've been to see the film:  It's awful, as well as pretense of authenticity and style and the fact that it doesn't really work out, it's just bad...    In a nutshell. It has the following: an unnamed man with a black hair. His wife, a former model, has a baby, who she wants to marry.  They get into an affair in a casino, in which they get into a car that goes to work, where they get together, and then get out of the car...  But they just don't go to the car with him. He doesn't get to take care of the baby.  He doesn are surrounded by security guards who want to kill him, who is getting the baby, and who is not in his pants.  And the car gets involved in a car accident, which is going to kill the baby in the front seat of the limo, and the couple gets into a house where people start building a bomb. And that's about it.  There's no real plot. It's just two old guys that meet and find a little trouble. There's not enough money to be made and they start making fun. They get drunk, and they get more. They try to get people drunk and then they get caught, but they don't get into the car, not for much money, anyway.  The ending was interesting, though. But the whole film seems to be nothing more than that. It just wasn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found out this movie was based on a small, obscure German novel. I have read the book (but not the movie) and can tell that the plot was lame, not even that much. For example, the characters were very little, not much in the way the book was. Some of the characters appeared in a very early version of the book, and that version never appears in the movie. I just want to know the name of some of the people in this movie.  This movie is a total disappointment. The story is thin, it's predictable and the actors (including the director) acted like fools. I gave it a 1 or 2 more stars and thought some of them were talented, but it really wasn't that good. The movie was OK as far as its acting was concerned, but I would much rather have a movie with something more solid and better. If you want to see a real, compelling, story, you would do better with the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie a group of people gets together at a pool in a private room and starts getting drunk and doing drugs with a guy who has a history of gang-fighting and has an evil reputation. He's a really stupid guy and wants to be a boxer and wants me to fight for a fight with him. After some time he has turned up on his horse again and decided to try to be that guy. We're obviously aware of the fact that this is exactly the type of movie that the police wanted to ban. Also we knew the plot was going to be awful. There are no real story and the whole thing is about a lot of pointless and bizarre situations that the characters have to deal with. It just turns out to be really predictable. Even when the characters are trying to save themselves and get into a fight the story gets horribly predictable.   I think there was a plot similar to this movie back when "The Kar-bazaar" was airing, and it had a similar plot, but it obviously didn't do the same things. In this case a lot more characters in a similar situation as the ones in "The Krabater". In this film the characters had a couple of fights and were all drunk and fighting, but the movie was actually pretty good. But as you can probably guess it's going to get worse by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i think this movie is the worst of the four i watch over a year. I mean you cant really understand the world, i cant really see the people, all i care about is a bunch of guys in a big office and they spend the rest of the movie on trying to make a bunch people look like they act. They're not even funny. I have heard some good things about the people in the movie. They are very good actors, but it's all about pretending to be great and not actually being so.  But it just feels like everyone in the film is going through puberty and the whole thing just isn't like real life.  I also found out that the guys in the office are really dumb, i don't really think they can act, but i know they can look like a really good guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this film was in 1973 and I am amazed that this film is still on the same channel as my old video tape. It was like an insult to anyone who has ever used the word "movie". I'm really ashamed to have seen this movie. The acting is horrible. There is not even one scene in the whole movie that could have made the most convincing impression. It is just a bunch of people singing about "good" things that have never happened, and they are stupid. I hope that this movie was filmed on an actual stage and put in a computer with a computer to simulate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of the movie is very good, it is not terribly convoluted but the plot does not go in a direction that would normally be acceptable. In fact you can easily guess the ending of this movie (the infamous "rescue" which kills everyone in the village) and you can probably guess how this movie ends. It's a bad idea. The film does not have enough time to make up the suspense. For example if the heroes of the original "The Seven Samurai" had the same fate as the original film, this movie would be wonderful. But since it doesn't come out of it, I'm surprised that there are so few people who even watch it. This movie should only be a minimum two hours of fun and leave the audience feeling awful. The acting is terrible, the camera is lousy, the music is terrible. This is not a movie that you would normally care for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After all this, i finally realized that I can't wait to see the rest of "FEMSE" and the "Z-DIN" coming together, which is like having a bunch of carjets in a parking lot, only instead, with a bunchof cars driving in a circle around the cars. The story is pretty predictable, even though the good actors have it. The good actors seem to be having fun, but the bad actors seem a lot better than the good ones. And the bad people (as usual) aren't even that funny, but even though they act funny and make great impressions, nothing, which doesn't really fit the idea of a movie like FEMSE. I wish I had known that beforehand, so I don't need to waste my time reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I'm not going to say anything about the production. Some people in the UK see this as a "classic" film and it's not. To some people it is. For some people that was the case. And to others it was not. I'm sure it was meant to be that. But it's no different from the other films that are coming out. This is not a movie that would have been a hit. I have seen a lot of British films and films that I have not been able to name and is not one of them. This movie is a waste of money for anyone who wants to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is another excuse of a film: a classic formula, where the hero gets killed and the girl is killed by the mysterious scientist, who is trying to save her life and thus is killed.  It's a film that does not deserve to be considered any more than a simple film, since it has nothing except acting and a few superficial scenes that just happen to be good for the sake of the story. In other words, it's just a bunch of stupid twists that don't stay interesting and the ending is stupid.  Overall, this is a bad film, but a good one to avoid. The acting is OK, but if you want to watch something like this, you better go with something like "Crazy Joe". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual, this film is not too great to take care of. But it is not a bad film...not a bad at all! But, I must confess that I was left feeling somewhat disgusted with it. The story, however, did not really have any substance. Some of the actors could perhaps be better chosen to have more dialog. I have to say, the director, David Lynch, did make some of the most disappointing films I've ever seen...so bad. There was some interesting material, but it could have been made much better...it seems like he just wanted to make this movie for a couple hours of entertainment. But perhaps he did make it for more money. There is not that many movies that have a good story and plot that are so bad...so, why not make this one? I will admit it...some of these movies are great, but this one was pretty awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had the sense of humor to work in a film about the events of the Great American Civil War, I would definitely have had some humor to do. But instead of making it a fun film, the acting was weak and the narrative was dumb and I think a lot of the "newscasters" should know that this film was a waste of a film.  The film was at times very silly. For example, the scene where the two men are dancing to music is only about 2 minutes long (I mean, there are some dancing, not all of them are in the scene, but the way is simple enough). And the characters were just as stupid. The plot could have had a plot at least at the beginning of the film, and that was about what I expected it to be. And the supporting characters (the people who came to help the soldiers at the time) should have been given more to the action. And a lot more than just the "clothes" of the people that were supposed to help them. The acting was bad enough as well, but I think it was worse than a standard movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first example of a stupid movie. When you are wondering if your eyes have really waken up, try watching a documentary instead. This is one of those scenes that just doesn't work. I mean they don't show any good fight or suspense either way. They just want you to want to get a little pleasure from watching a lot of horrible things. The plot does not make an interesting movie, and they are obviously trying to make the story more suspense and drama. But when I watch it, I immediately feel like I am watching "the saddest movie ever" and I felt like I was watching the same thing the morning I bought the movie: the movie is so stupid I couldn't even watch it. If you want to see something, pick something that has a plot, and this is it. Do not even watch this movie and wait for its sequel, you won't like it as much. If your going to see "The Game", you are better off looking a video on YouTube, like the movie I just rented. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Even if it was an "comedy" or an action movie like "The Mighty Mighty Mighty" or a movie about a superhero movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely stupid, and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is about two parents who are very divorced and basically on an alight plane. The parents are very poor and have their own personal problems. They want to have sex with their daughter(who is a teenager in middle school) while she is in the hospital, and they are upset when she is alone with her fiance who is not in the first place, and so they make up a movie of rape, humiliation and abuse, and do it in a very sad and pathetic way. It's not even the worst of the movie. The director made it very hard to see some of the scenes. Very creepy. This movie can only get three stars, as it only had 10 credits. The scenes were not great, but it is a shame to give this piece a 1/2. The acting wasn't that bad, although there is a lot of talent in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not that bad if you are a cinematographer, if you want a film with some originality and interesting stories. However, if that is the case then the film does not work out. The story is poor and boring with predictable dialogue. If I had a chance to do so I would make a positive review about this horrible film:  The movie just doesn't work out to be that funny and original. The plot is bad and poorly thought out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just finished this film with the biggest disappointment i have ever experienced. I'm sure other people would love this film to see and enjoy but it is just very painful to watch, it was painful to listen, it just was painful. I will admit, it is a bit like seeing yourself in a coma. But to watch the film is just painful. And if you were a bit, oh-my-god-awful sick, please do not go to see it. It is a shame that the director and director (who was actually the one who made the film) made this film after seeing the previous sequel (the "End of The Dark") with the sequel (and in fact, I don't remember how he had to act in it) because they didn't even care about the sequel. If they truly wanted to make a sequel (which is more than possible), why are they doing that? Why? I mean that the movie really is a completely horrible film. Some part of this is the fact that it has so much of the "wanted" in it and it didn't give enough time. The fact that this film has so little substance that it couldn't even fit into a normal 2-3 hour film. And they didn;t even give anything to the storyline (or any storyline) is truly unbelievable. They are trying really hard to try to make this film better but it didn;s so. That's why the movie sucks. The director didn't make the same effort to make anything, and the script is so bad, and this is one of the most boring movies i've ever seen (there is no escaping this). If you watch it, you will never get to like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a stupid movie about a little girl who falls in love with a man, but she is too weak to do something about it. But after seeing this movie it's too clear to me that this is a truly dumb movie. The acting is horrible, the direction is bad, the storyline is stupid. It's just bad to see a movie with a female in it. I recommend throwing it and a little bit of money to the trash and hoping it doesn't make. Just plain boring. I would recommend seeing the "Hotel 7" movies and the "Boom" movies to see something original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script is very weak and the plot is terrible - not much fun to read. The acting is awful. And the ending... Well, they didn't shoot it there - that's the plot. So, you'll have to see the other end. The plot was OK, but the ending was not. This is not to say that "the plot was good" - it was terrible. And, by the end of the movie, you will be bored. If you didn't get enough in the movie - sorry!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting isn't much better than a standard sitcom. The plot isn't so bad, but there are some silly scenes involving a bunch of junk dealers. And the plot itself can't make it any better. There are a few funny moments, like the famous car dealers, but nothing is as funny as the stupid parts the entire film. Not much better then this movie, I had hoped that the film would have something to offer. I just can't help but to leave this movie with this horrible ending. This movie is not worth the time and money that I will spend with it. The other stars of this movie are OK, the dialogs are fine, but the story is bad and the story doesn't matter anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's as bad as i've ever seen. It's about a little boy whose name is "Kitty" and he discovers that his aunt and niece were dead, but has a few hints that there was a murder happening in the town where the boy grew up. At the end, the boy dies, but now he's in a whole new universe, where he's stuck in a tree in the tree he's grown up in. Then, he dies again. And his parents are really missing, but their parents know he's not dead yet, and they don't really know him, so it seems possible they just let him live with them and then they bury him in the local cemetery. Then the townspeople (as they know he died) get in on the scene and try to kill him.  If that wasn't bad enough, we've seen it for many times now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for two reasons. First, the fact that it was available in this movie is so shocking to me as to the rest of the audience. I had a sense of watching this movie in a lot of countries that have never, since, screened this movie before. I think that the director got the idea from this movie that there would be something new in this film. I guess it worked in other movies like the recent film "Bored After Darkling".  The second reason was because it was so terrible. It was the idea that a woman who had some type of problem would try to rape her and kill her for all the things she was doing to her. I just couldn't believe that the film wasn't actually based on some kind of story. The characters had really little resemblance to the real world. This movie is mainly about a rapist who tortures his victims (and is also a big jackass) through making some sort of connection with their victims (in this case the victim) and killing them all the same way he tortures their victims with nothing but his own hands. It's nothing like the real movie with the killer, the rapist, and a rape victim. They're so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has nothing to do with the "Pitch" movie, that's for sure. the movie is nothing like a movie with original characters that are so brilliant or original that it really ruins the movie, i mean it's just ridiculous crap. It lacks any real feeling about what the movie was supposed to be. I mean, what a cool movie would be? I don't know. I don`t understand why they hired this guy as writer. It seems like they needed the movie to make a point, but instead they spent so much time putting it together that the film only showed one aspect that it had promised. I guess, at some point they thought they needed more of the story, but that only meant more of this movie to be added to the movie. It`s just horrible, I mean it was just plain bad. The acting wasn`t great. Maybe the original movie had a lot of it in it, i dunno. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing. But that's okay. The good movie of this decade (1999-2000) was "Shooter" (2000), and its successor (2003) was, well, just plain trash. I think it could be a movie with a good premise, which would have added a great value to it. Instead, this one disappoints badly. I'm a fan of movies that don't deliver a decent performance; i.e. "Tennis" and "Warmy" and others. This is not a film with a great performance but it fails to deliver, to make us care. In some way, this is a film that is about to be thrown out the window by Sony. Maybe it will do well a few years later, but it could do much worse and it would only disappoint the masses. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the first "Harry Potter" movie at the first screening when I was 13, and after seeing it over the next week, I couldn't believe that it would even make it to be as far as it needed.  The acting wasn't good, the story was dull, the magic wasn't believable, and the movie didn't have any real plot or even a plot. Even Harry himself got the lines wrong on his way back home, and his actions had nothing to do with anything. I just don't remember it as one of the best movies of all time, but I guess I'll never forget it.  It was only after seeing the movie a second time that I knew I couldn`t believe what it was. I was wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a piece of crap this movie has to be! Just an unbelievable waste of time, for a film which is meant to make a comment on things in the world but turns out to be nothing more than a big bummer! We'll start with the usual "the story of war". This is the first of its kind, but sadly the only two time versions were both really disappointing. The film is all the same. A man is the head of the US army and wants to conquer all of the world (for example "the East" and "the West", or "the Middle East", or whatever, but instead he is the one true figure in this movie.  The army is set to destroy an American-based colony in the Middle East in the first part of the film, and then the film tries to get into the mind of one of the main characters.  Now while the US and UK have invaded the middle eastern side of the globe in the last few months, and there are plenty of different countries, this is a movie that just tries to force the audience into it, and only for the main character (the main) does so, the US military has to start attacking all of its enemies in the form of fighting, and even then he doesn't even mention any of them.  But at the same time, it tries to build more character with the US in a position to say that it's a story about war in the United States. And then the US suddenly is attacked in the middle part of that war, and a huge, epic, battle begins. And there's the main part of this war which involves "the people who fought in the war", who then is the only US soldier(the man who killed the US president). He's so obviously doing it to justify his actions because he's fighting for a reason, and is acting as a kind of real war veteran (or soldier), and he can't keep it simple. It's not the first time, but the US soldier only gets one chance to go into the war (which is only about a quarter of the screen) and he kills many people (including a huge number of American children, if it is a war movie). He also uses a lot of his troops to make an excuse for being in the right thing (as his main purpose) and then he just as soon as he's there, he's going to lose the idea that he was fighting for freedom and then do whatever he wants
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason this movie is bad is that it isn't interesting. While the title, "New Year's Eve" is catchy and the movie's title, 'Halloween 2: The Revenge' makes this boring, boring, uninteresting movie. Most of the acting is bad, which was the same in 'Evan Roper' or 'Honeymoon Overdrive'. However, the movie is fairly interesting as a big group of zombie victims. Most people probably wouldn't like this movie, as it is too predictable. I also found the movie a little boring to watch, with no suspense and the story is predictable (although the movie has some good effects). The acting is OK though, and you can't expect the movie to be an action-packed action thriller, as most movies are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was incredibly weak in terms of plot and dialog, and not much of the plot. It is a terrible embarrassment of film making, that an unscripted musical drama could come out at a time when no movie was being made. I just sat and laughed at most of it. It reminded me of all those awful movie reboots that have come before this. I mean, how did the movie go? No one ever said something like "You don't need a man to see this movie, you don't have a man and a car to make it," nor was there a mention of how people with a little imagination and a few extra minutes could actually make something that would happen. I'm assuming this movie would have appealed to some younger audiences. I can't imagine what could be a better excuse than a dumb movie: A man gets out of a hot bath by a woman who falls asleep. She then comes back to sleep for several minutes, then she wakes up and falls asleep again. When she wakes, she says "good job, good job, I'm going back," and then decides to go to the car to see his friend. There is no mention of her name. We never see her before it is over. So it is impossible to guess what would happen at the car. When a drunk driver is speeding at a police officer, he says that he's got a nice car with a gas-powered engine and no brakes. Then he drives away from the officer to let off the gas as he passes the officer, but is also pulled over. And then you see his girlfriend driving off. It just doesn't matter. There are no clues whatsoever, nothing. The only thing that's coming from this movie is that you will never remember it. The end of the movie happens at a local hotel and there are some police officers there. But there are also a bunch of cops there. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever, except perhaps to bring closure to the scene, because it tells us what happens next. This movie is just a lousy attempt to get the whole family to see it. I wish I had more money to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an example of why the people in the movies are so stupid that they make movies. There are so many mistakes in the movie that I really feel like this movie isn't worth wasting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You know who loved this movie - "Fahrenheit 451", "Pit Fights, and 'Tadz 'Troll' from "The Mighty Mighty Mighty"). The two best of these two movies are probably "The Adventures of Hercules", and "The Manta". But even the two best films were horrible, they didn't last long. After the opening, the plot starts getting completely lost to the "I'll never win in this", "I'm a vampire", and other bullshit. You can see that the plot is almost impossible to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had some of the worst acting I've seen ever. If you were expecting something, you'd be expecting something that would make it worth watching. Not something that even the "star" (Rob Lowe) would do. But the story itself isn't as good as its premise. I thought it was bad, it felt very forced, even the actors didn't even get the most of their work.  The only thing that helped this movie was seeing the two main characters in different places at the beginning of the movie, and then seeing them back to back to the beginning, and seeing the same two characters with new costumes in different locations. I can guarantee that you will never get into a fight with a giant octopus, with every conceivable creature you'll find on it. If anyone ever wants to do a movie that is so bad, then this is the only movie for them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I initially saw this film I laughed so hard at the film. When it was announced for production I was on the phone waiting for the next screening. It was about the first time I saw it and I wanted to call on "for a minute". But after my phone rang a recording could not be heard. The director (Mr. Odenheimer) wanted me to rent it on the Showtime channel so I had to rent and pay to rent. And that's the only problem with it. The acting in this movie was terrible. When the director said, "We have a small budget", he obviously had no idea. He made absolutely no effort to save the actors who were good in this film. There were a few scenes that were good (in some cases), but none of the characters seemed believable. It wasn't even funny. When I made it I could just see how it would have been if the director had a budget of 40 or 50 dollars per movie. I wouldn't even think it could make me laugh. The script was pretty bad. The film had an unbelievable ending, and I don't think it would make it to the budget. It felt like that when I thought I'd die laughing. It just was the most horrible film I have ever seen. I really felt the director was taking it so seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting an enjoyable adventure, but this movie really just sucks. It starts off with a plot and then you have to have some faith that everything will be OK. This movie is no exception. If there is no faith in the viewers then there is really no faith for you. The writing is awful, the acting is terrible, the scenery is awful and the acting's quality is poor. It really doesn't help that you don't want to waste your time. It does help that there are some good actors. So maybe I'm biased, but I can only give this one a 4 out of 10. The other two things about this movie is that it's just not a movie. It's a movie of trash. Don't expect me to give this movie 5 out of ten if you're an adult and you just walked into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie entitled 'Cannies with a little bit of sex and a little nippon about it.' A decent movie. The first 20 minutes is where you can tell that the writer is a total piece of garbage. We only get one or two scenes of sex (one with a male porn star named 'Biscuit'). The other scenes have an extremely weak'realistic' look to them. The ending is not that dramatic but very pointless. You can get to know some really weird situations that you never would have known if they weren't in the movie. Some of the most ridiculous scenes are about the characters. 'Cigarette' is one. The 'Bitch' girl is really pathetic, 'Grimy' is really good, and 'The Boy' is a really good cop. This movie is really bad in comparison to the other films about 'Civies With a Little bit of Sex and a Little Nippon'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible, un-entitled, weak, low budget film with very little direction and very little plot. In order to achieve the audience's satisfaction, it is quite obvious that the director is not capable of directing. The only reason why this movie was made is that it was obviously about to be made in Japan and it was made in Japanese! The characters are weak in the main roles and the only real character is the one who tries to shoot her husband, in which I felt like they had put his dog off. The story is poorly written, which is the result of poor camera-work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm disappointed to find this movie to be so poorly written. I find the characters, to be generally very wooden, the plot, not a very good plot, and the acting, too, pretty poor. I have read some good reviews of the movie, but not this one. I was really disappointed to read anything about this film and not surprised to learn that I don't really understand it at all. This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, directed by David Ochsberg, has been a disappointment for me. I don't know what it is supposed to be. It feels like a movie with two parts, and each of them makes absolutely no sense. We know that it is meant to be a satire, and that it was originally made by director and writer David O Chsberg. The problem is that Och's film is too badly written to make it funny. For example, the title is very similar to the other two parts in this movie. But it's hard to say this for two parts. One is about a man that has no body.  The second part of the movie is about an alcoholic alcoholic.  Och has his wife make a documentary about her husband being drunk at a conference, and he comes to her home at night and she gives him a special gift that he can use to keep him drunk. But then, during his first visit he is dead on a bus (he had been shot by the police). He comes back for a moment and tells her he is okay. Then, she gives a positive review about his good deeds:  This is really about a drunk wife who is married to her husband. I've never heard of such a stupid movie, but if there are any such people in the world, it is sure Och is one of them.  There are other movies where Och can't make jokes, so I was hoping that they would do something about him, but unfortunately none of them were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think that this movie is bad because it has nothing to recommend. It was just an excuse to steal some money, and was horrible, the movie was awful. It doesn't make any sense. It just was a waste of time. I can't see the movie for an hour. The best thing was when they pulled one guy off one of the women that was getting into the car and had a fight in a parking lot. That really helped her to get out of jail. The two main characters were stupid. It made it hard for me to understand why the police were so eager to find a way to take out the people in this movie and make sure they didn't go to jail for reasons of her having drugs. I really don't know how anyone else can help this movie. One thing i can do better in this situation would be to leave this car and spend it somewhere where the sun will have a more effect. This movie made me question whether or not she was on drugs. She was obviously acting like she had something to do with drugs, but she seemed a little too concerned and just kept on going about her business. Then, after the movie ended, she said she was sorry and wanted to get the keys because she didn't have enough money to get on the road and make a phone call. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I've ever heard any movie that has a title that I couldn't identify, I can say that I didn't care. They are nothing like the great films that they had before, and they don't make any more than a couple minutes of enjoyment in a boring movie. If you want to watch one, don't watch it. If this was a movie, it would be awful. Avoid it. Avoid even taking it to the movie theater! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible, really bad, I can't believe this movie could have gone any better than to say this movie was filmed in the worst possible direction. I have read the comments and even watched the trailers and I am not really even a fan of the movie.  I think the director should have put more time and money into making a real movie, instead of letting this movie make a mockery of movies in which a big fat guy in an office with a big budget and a big ego gets shot by a few of the guys on the production side. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it would be better if they had a title that was better to make a movie out of. It's so sad to see people put this film out. I'd like to see one movie to be made that would better. This is bad, the only reason I chose to watch this movie was because of how bad it was. I am not going to give this movie 10/10 for a great story, because I am only one man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I'm home for a movie: I am very happy and I am able to get a copy of it for free from Amazon. But since they stopped the distribution of this movie, it is going to come back on the Internet with a pile of garbage!  I have the following:  There is no plot, there are some scenes in which some of the actors or characters in the movie are involved in a relationship. They're not even like real actors, they're just stupid stereotypes, and they're awful! (And the movie is so much worse than one of the dumbest things that I've ever seen!!!)  There are a few scenes where a black guy in a hooded, tattered, and filthy, leather-clad leather-mask-clad, and a bald man is surrounded by cops who threaten to shoot him.  This is bad, because it's not even funny!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I am a die-hard movie aficionado but I just can't suspend my judgment for such an awful film. I can't understand how to figure out that these two guys are so good or so horrible.  I give this film an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just laughed out loud when I saw this movie... I mean, not even after seeing so many great movies in the past 30 years. This is bad, really bad. I just did not understand how they were trying to get the same look with this film. The story seemed to be one of several "noir" or "sensory" or whatever type of movie in the world. They were very obviously not intended to be a "noirt" film. I guess that is what is meant when they want to make this kind of film. In any case, this movie seems to be nothing more than an excuse for bad movies to be made. That's the only thing that keeps it standing. They could just be really bad...but they were good in some other senses. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad I could not watch it... I'm pretty sure that's the only reason I decided to watch this, but I'm not sure if it was the only bad movie I saw. I just laughed and laughed at the horrible movie, and I really didn't much care. I actually didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does not deserve to be called a film, and I cannot blame it for having so little talent to say so, though the acting was okay enough for a film like this. This movie just isn't worth watching, especially when the story and acting are so bad, and the movie was terrible.   I really thought the direction, while okay, did a good job, as the camera moves through the forest without getting lost. However, when the camera was near a river, the camera moved toward the river, and lost its bearings. I have a feeling there was a major reason why that happened, as it does not make up for that awful performance.  I was very disappointed that this movie could be made so well as a movie of a movie, especially considering the story was so bad. I hope it will be a better sequel to "The Lone Ranger" or the "Big Boy" franchise, though I think the script has gotten better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a really disappointing movie. This is a movie made by people who are nothing but a hack and a pretender with a camera and an ego. The plot, however, had something to be called. The movie should have been a spoof. As it is, it is pretty plain that everyone in the movie knows nothing and everything.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the equivalent of a movie of a young man who has been forced into the dark depths by some bad guy (or one of the bad guy) and then discovers that the people who have been making all of the jokes in the first 20 minutes of the movie are not quite human. It is a horrible waste of time and has nothing that can reasonably make up an episode of S or S. on TV. The plot is pretty basic and not very interesting. Most of the time it is just a bunch of old guys talking to each other. A good movie would have a lot more depth and an attempt to show something that is human. The acting is good but the scenes are just boring and really weak. The story is just pathetic. The script is too predictable and the jokes are too predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie would be better as a horror flick. But, if you're going to sit through it, you'd better find yourself a little relief. A lot of people like this one, but unfortunately, it doesn't have any value in that aspect. A horror film that would just be a collection of scenes from another movie, and this is not that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of movie that is just as bad as a new Seinfeld TV show.  It is just a very poorly written piece of bad humor that is a big rip off of Seinfeld, except the idea of Secker. It's not really Seinfeld.  Secker has never performed in Seinfeld and is pretty annoying.   Also, the fact that you can see it on TV is just bad. Secker is the same sort of thing that is made available on DVD in Europe and not in the USA either.  Also I couldn't find any references to the Secker family name. The only references I could find were references to a musical act in a Seinfeld episode. The fact that the Seckers are "family", it has never been in Secker's script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest insult to the series so far. First, the characters were stupid and childish for their characters to act as they did. Secondly, the lack of action. Second, the way the actors portrayed their characters seemed like they did the characters. I did not even think they acted like they acted. I had to look at the first four episodes to see the quality of their performance. The second big reason is that this show failed to do anything that made an original series. It is all downhill from the original. The biggest mistake of the show was the idea that the main characters are the characters of the series, and that the characters need to act the way they act in the show, which is silly. There was a certain point in the early episodes when it was possible for the characters to do something which they couldn't have done in the series. But that point is gone now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a person who can get into a movie with this kind of crap, then you would be a fool. This movie was not a movie, it was just a waste of the time and money wasted. The dialog was awful, the movie was boring, the acting wasn't good, the scenery was terrible. There are some movies that are better than this one, but this one just isn't.  I really think that it's just impossible to find a good movie with a decent script. If you're looking for a movie that has good screenwriting, a good storyline, a pretty good director, a decent budget, a great cast, and a good soundtrack, you'll find that there is none of these things. If anything like this happens, you are going to be disappointed, and then you are left with a horrible and horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. It is boring, it is absolutely no plot, it has absolutely no suspense. It's simply predictable and predictable. While I've seen a few films with this sort of "filler" formula, this just isn't one of them. While the director and writer did great work in making this piece, the rest of the film just can't manage to make it credible. It just doesn't feel like any movie. I'd like to see the director put in a better film: the first, second, and third acts were fun and the action was very exciting, but the last three hours just are not good enough to justify a second viewing. The most disappointing part of this movie is the title, "The Boy That Follows Through The Eyes", which should have been the title of the movie. It should have read, "Turning The Eye Of Evil". This really was the first of a couple of films that this director wasted. I highly recommend that this movie never be shown, so people don't get so much wrong from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this movie expecting a "classic" episode of this show, and I was disappointed that it was nothing like it was supposed to be. I was left with no idea what it was. The story is pretty vague and very predictable.  I'm not sure why they decided to include such an unusual twist and just throw the main character into a blackish cave and leave him alone. The plot could be a little bit better if they cast the main characters in some of their usual characters and leave them in the same roles they're playing for the show, but I won't blame them for this. I'm glad they decided not to leave the rest of the cast and move the "jail" up into the "closet" and that the "ghost" would be a member of the "new" tribe, but they never seemed to be that.  It is a really bad film, it isn't that funny, I'd rather watch a bunch of classic episodes anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like the first 20 minutes of the film. It felt like it was only going to the next "story" like the other movies. The ending was unsatisfying.    This was the only movie I would watch of "The Big Sleep" which was filmed back in 1997.  The director apparently had a long list of ideas on how to turn this movie into a truly lame film.  He made a really big budget on the budget, making a lot of money that could have been used instead. The film had some decent acting, but the whole movie was very boring. I'm not a big fan of "Big Sleep" myself, but I'd be surprised if I made this film any worse than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a really sad tragedy, with a very questionable premise. I was actually the only person in the theater for this film, and what was it that we thought this was a tragedy? A few moments before I had started watching it, I said to myself, "It's just a little bit of gore and nudity, it's just not all that stupid." It's really disappointing that so many people just sat in the dark without any way of escape.  I thought that the story would be interesting if it was a horror film, but it was just so boring. And the plot itself was very silly.  There are some good moments, as with the story of the guy's girlfriend getting stabbed, but the movie is so poorly written that I really couldn't even begin to describe it in words.  If you're gonna make this movie for the sake of entertainment or to see a horror movie, it might be interesting, but just don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to say anything about the movie because I don't know it. The premise is that we'll find the best woman in the world and we can try her to succeed in what she has to do. This is not an interesting concept to develop. The movie is just plain old cliche. And the ending is completely unbelievable. I'm surprised that there's any real plot here. I think the director just threw in a bunch of clichés in a story and made it so it wasn't real. I also don't think this movie is meant to be funny. It just seems like some actors made a lot of pretending things about their life and then just decided to pile up a bunch more fake and pointless stuff without ever getting a big payoff.  It's also interesting that there is some people who see this movie and can tell the story to their friends, because they won't see the beginning but will see the conclusion. They aren't as crazy as we had in our "Supernatural" movie when we laughed at people who knew nothing. This movie just doesn't make much more sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the film is aired, I can only assume that most of the viewers would turn right on it without a real knowledge of how the film works. The plot is the usual, nothing more. The camera focuses so tightly on the characters' heads that the camera is virtually irrelevant. The actors need to be put out a DVD with a lot of money to make the film, but I don't understand why they bother doing this if they're just trying to make a comedy film.  The plot has absolutely no plot. Most of the movie is a fantasy. I've seen lots of fantasy films, but this is really not one.  It doesn't even make sense to watch it. In the ending with the family's dog dies, the characters are back in the house, waiting for their wife to bring them to the hospital for the rest of their life. The story is even vague in the final scenes.   Overall, this is a failure of a mediocre movie. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like a "Rinçk" movie with an absurdly long dialog, which you could expect from a BAFTA award winner.  However, the plot was so badly written that the movie didn't even make sense. The way the plot developed made sense, and I wouldn't have been able to follow it. There is no clear storyline to speak of. I think this was directed by a real novice. The acting was terrible, and the supporting cast wasn't that good, either. The story was obviously written by people whose main job was to get money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the impression that this movie was very loosely "inspired" on the very limited and not very creative way. Some of the actors and most of the supporting cast seem pretty good, but the story is pretty dull and one of the most boring scenes I have ever seen. It's like watching an episode of "The Twilight Zone" or "The Wonder Years" that would have been an action thriller or a comic book instead. Even if it were an original concept, the plot was really bad. There was too much in the way of the story that just happened; too much of it made no sense.  This movie was obviously a different movie, but I could probably have written a better one. There weren't as many plot twists as the original "Mr. Flemming" and "The Fendey Flemies".  This is the movie that would get the Most-Blessed Movie Award in Europe. This movie is a complete disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there is no real plot, the acting is nothing. The dialog is bad, the characters are bad, and the plot is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only positive review I've got about this film: "Sick off" "Bitter."  No spoilers, so it's good to know the film's title had already been leaked. This has nothing to do with the quality of the film, nor anything else except the badness.  No surprise.  This is a one-sided slasher film (like "Stalker") that suffers from having an extremely weak script. But "Bitch" did have a fairly good script, at least. The movie's dialog, especially the acting, was generally OK. This was, unfortunately, a horrible waste of a film. There are two big problems with this movie: first, the direction. It's so bad, as in a bad way, that you'll never get sick of it. Second, the cinematography. There is no depth, not even remotely interesting. There isn't even an overall direction direction. The cinematography is just like the camera that makes "Stalkers" look great. The plot is so simple that the film seems like it's written by a madman.  If you are interested in the genre of horror, you'll be disappointed.  Avoid at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of horrible acts. I don't know how this movie was made. I find it to be an uninteresting or interesting movie and that's sad. I can't believe that it was even made. We should have the courage to watch an interesting movie like this. I cannot fault this movie because it's nothing more than a poorly made horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a couple of stupid boys. A few years after this movie was released, a few people found that the story of the two girls was too cliché and unrealistic. They decided it was better to adapt the two protagonists, even to add more pointless humor to it. They added some silly scenes in the movie and added a whole lot of unnecessary jokes. However, the movie was not very funny or funny anyway. At least there was a lot more humor in the plot and the actors. The movie had nothing to recommend as a comedy, but there were some funny moments to make this movie look better. There was no real story and the two boys did not act like any normal boy or girl. The biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't manage to make fun for any of the characters.  I gave this movie a 9 out of 10, but it was nothing better than a poor teen comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the "wickedest" fantasy of the world, "Troll 2" is the only movie that is out there at the moment. It's absolutely unrefined, boring, and even worse than the original film. There is nothing new to it, nothing interesting, nothing original, nothing fun, nothing anything for me. It is as bad as I've come to see.  I am a huge fan of "Tron 2" because of its comedic and hilarious nature, but in this film, it's just bad. The movie begins with a strange premise (in which it contains a small, but not very disturbing, scene of a giant robot), which is not only out of place but is downright lame. The ending is simply a waste of time.  This is no excuse for a movie: it is not that bad! If you want to see a movie that includes actual jokes, then I would suggest that you would see "Titan", or "Tomb Raider" instead. If you truly want to avoid the worst movies, you would have spent thousands of dollars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Dascha's Revenge" is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen from the big-hit TV networks.  While I have seen better movies, the acting is simply terrible, the story is unbelievable and the director didn't do an adequate job. This makes the film a complete non-comedy piece of trash, and not only that, but a total waste of time.  This film is no way for a big-name star to develop her career as a major star. If they're so good with the rest of their movies, then they shouldn't be as bad as this one. Even if she is smart as a writer, she can't write anything as bad or as mediocre as this...  "Reverie" is another way of saying that "The New Girl" is no more intelligent than she was with "The Ring". A lot of people have taken this to mean that the original cast of the movie is the smartest, but that doesn't really explain why this film was put into production. The main cast in the movie includes a man in an Italian hoodie and a woman in a bikini. The former is not quite as smart, but I suppose she is as smart as the latter.  I have a feeling that the director of this film got some help from someone (other than the talent of the acting). Perhaps someone is the director, and is thus helping his work by editing and editing and developing the story. When she finally came around to do this, she didn't really like the script, so we can't blame this one for failing. I wouldn't have considered this as the Director's final word. This is the only bad movie I have ever seen. It is a complete waste of talent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure why people think I'm a film maker. In fact, I have had some acting credits in the past and was a teacher. I knew they would never pay me that much money, though the fact that I'm going out of my career is very disappointing.   It's been a while since I've watched the movie (I had a few years ago on the HBO channel) and I've never heard about it. The plot of the film is a little bit disappointing and the acting is a bit terrible. The two principal characters are horrible. I had to look at their faces and tell me it was not me.  I have to assume that the producers just knew that this movie would be filmed in Mexico, and had the film's script written ahead of time. They probably had no idea what the ending would look like. And the ending was so bad, I really think they just thought they could capture the popularity of the movie. The idea of a big house (like the one we've seen in the movie), is absolutely ridiculous. It seems so out of the world to me, even the director couldn't have come up with the idea alone. The ending could only have been done in an English country (something like that). I was really impressed by the fact they hired so many people to create this film. How do you think a movie can end up like this? That was just not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is an old man who has no idea what's going on. A man with nothing but a car that drives to the hills on the outskirts of town with a bunch of friends and a girl. A girl who is the only person with a red hair, and a car with a top-speed turbochargers.  The plot isn't that much better. If you're in the mood for a horror film, you might consider buying a horror movie instead. Otherwise, if you're on a road trip and are in the middle of a stop in the north Texas section, I highly recommend the "Pete, The Killer" movie: "Baretta, The Cat" (1995) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After my friend told me that I wanted to see a movie: "Savage Love" and that she didn't want to see this film.  She said that it was "all too big and too slow to get into the emotions". The first part of the movie was not that much fun. And the second part of it, the ending that was cut and changed so badly by the "goodness" of the film, was not the movie that I had envisioned. I'd like to see an attempt at a "bad" movie. It doesn't even try to be fun, and it seems to have no intention to be either funny or funny. If I had ever seen any bad movies, I would try to convince them to do a better movie. At the beginning of the first part (as they had promised) the "bad movie" seemed to have a purpose. At its beginning, the "movie" had a beginning and a conclusion. It did have a beginning, but in the end (in part one) the camera had taken away and it was replaced with a red light that made everything appear as black.   This movie was an insult to me and to my friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad film:  This movie is a horrible film and I have never seen such incompetence. It is a movie that has nothing to recommend. I really do not understand why anyone was even bothering to watch it. And I am ashamed of my involvement with this movie because of its insincerely, foolishly, insincereful nature. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically a big fat fat guy with a fat girl on his arm, making his wife jealous and looking for another guy that he likes to keep. If you are a big guy in a hot movie, you want some of that type of guy. That is not the case for this movie. The plot is so bad, that I really have no idea why this movie was even made. I give it a 1. If there was a plot that could have worked like this one, I would have loved it.  The funny lines are pretty good, but not all that bad. My impression was that if you liked movies like this, you would like to watch these. I just didn't enjoy it. Even though I like "The Go Tubes" and "Gates of Glory", I didn't really enjoy this movie either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see no real reason for this movie, it is just a cheap excuse to sell a DVD of a movie: a bad film.  So this one is bad for a while, but it does not get much better. The acting and direction are awful, the story line is dull and the characters aren't that much better than the 'normal' action.  The cinematography is awful, they try too hard to make the characters look convincing but the end result of it looks fake.  Too bad, but I found some good things in this movie: it's an entertaining movie, I just found it a bit ridiculous. But even with good direction and acting, this was bad for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, when I saw this movie I was just shell shocked and what I thought of was the way the people who made this film are doing it. I can't believe how you'd do it. This is the kind of film that every other person would see as a complete failure, but it is even worse. I gave this movie a rating of 1 out of 10. I think it isn't as bad as a bad thriller like "the Omen" (which I think was better than any of these guys), but it isn`T even that bad. It was a total waste of time to sit through the entire movie and I think this movie was nothing but bad, in fact it was the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a complete waste of story and acting from an extremely bad movie. Not only that, but the acting is also extremely bad. The best part of the film is the stupidest ever filmed, the stupid, stupidest film ever made.  A film that must never be made is this one. I'm sorry to admit I was a fan of this film at the beginning, but this one didn't quite deserve to be made. I just give this film two stars because of the crap it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on a big screen with other big stars and wasted most of my time. But the movie is so bad...it's like I've never seen anything that I didn't like. I can't remember if any actors from the '30's made a movie that wasn't so bad! I mean, this movie had some very interesting acting, the acting was very good, but it was just awful. The plot was so bad that it didn't make any sense, it had no characters except for the guy that's playing the big guy. I was very bored, it was way too slow, so the acting didn't work. The movie seemed like it would never work. I also thought that if the guys were really serious and had some decent acting, they would be better. They just looked like they didn't have the right stuff, which was very annoying. This movie only had one good moment, and that was when the big man's car crashed, which I didn`t really want, but didn`T care for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is completely incoherent. In order to get past this one might as well be one day.  The acting was so bad, that I actually felt I was being punished for watching the film and felt like I was going to be punished for being "sick" for watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first day of school the main character (Gus) becomes a psychopath and starts killing every human he sees, and he tries to escape by a group of aliens. At the same time the other characters see each other and start killing each other, which makes absolutely no sense and seems like a complete waste of time. Also I am confused with all the references to the "Alien Squad", and they have all been written just like that from here. All the aliens had already killed people before in the Alien Squad, so why all these people need to see the Alien on a billboard? What is even the reason for them to kill each other? The character who killed the other is not really scary, and the others are just there to make it seem more believable. They're just there so there's a chance they will be killed by a bad guy and you get the best of all jokes from this movie. Avoid this movie if you are stupid. The "alien" on the billboard actually did more damage to them than all the other enemies who had their hands on their own heads. If you liked to see a bunch of aliens slaughtering people you would have seen it more. The ending is terrible. I am so angry about this movie that I just cancelled my subscription to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was some real pleasure in this movie, but just too much, and the only reason why it didn't succeed was because it was so terrible that you would watch it if you hadn't.  You will have nightmares about how the other actors gave this performance the wrong impression.   The movie contains very little more than bad acting and bad direction. The only reason I even watched it was because of the interesting "The New Schoolhouse" characters, but the film is still too little good to make it worth my time.  I recommend watching this movie if you want to waste money but you're not interested in seeing a movie made by someone with good production and directing. Otherwise, you might as well wait for the sequel to come out before you have a chance of having the chance to tell me which one is better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's too bad to see a movie that follows the usual formula, the way the story is told and there's too much of plot in the movie. I really hate "the family" in movies and I never thought they had it in any real sense. It's just an excuse to use the story to sell an unrealistic fantasy. The movie has nothing more or nothing more than the usual boring things, I don't believe that's a good way to make a movie: just an advertisement for a fictional movie: lame, not even funny. I won't give this movie a 1, 1/10 because it is so pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that makes this movie interesting is that it isn't terribly good. It has a bad plot, which is really the only thing i didn't like. Even if you have no knowledge of the history behind this movie, you will miss it. The characters don't make enough sense. This is the type of movie that is just so bad, I wonder if its even a sequel, i don't know. The acting is awful. It's obvious that this was made at a studio that doesn't know how to make movies. My wife and I just laughed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only redeeming performance in this film was the magnificent Faye Gordon. In fact, I felt that I was the least prepared for a film from this film. It has very little depth and some of the most ridiculous scenes ever filmed in Hollywood. The movie was so poorly written that it was difficult to even watch it as a movie. I was bored by the scenes in the movie and the characters were terrible. They were predictable and the film was just boring. They didn't get enough in.  I would have loved to see this movie with Faye in it. But that was the only bit of fun in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not one of my personal favourites but I am a fan of the original 'FAST Nellie' series which I did watch when it was first airing in 1992. But sadly it has just been ruined by this poor film, which is full of stupid dialogue, cheesy scenes, bad dialogue and no real plot whatsoever.  It is sad to say that while the original series was pretty good in a way, the sequels were far worse. For example the original version had a plot that was very clever. But this one was so bad it hardly made a difference. I give this one the 'S-Tardent' rating and I have a hard time believing that it will ever recover. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about a car dealership (or just a car dealer) in a big city in the early days of the war, a warlord with a team of guys on "security" to "save" civilians. The guys fight the warlord, who comes back from this war in a car to get revenge.  The thing I was most puzzled about in this movie was the fact that the guys fighting the war against the "rebels" (the big warlords, basically) are not allowed to do this in a warring country where the war is waged with other warring countries. They are fighting in countries that have fought the war in the end and are not in countries where the rebels fought the first. This is just not the way to go.  This also made it impossible for me to buy any movies, because I have a hard time believing that these guys had been fighting in a different war that had nothing to do with the conflict. I just think the guys in this war were just going after something, that wasn't entirely related to the war (and that this movie had nothing like a war to start) so I couldn't take it that they didn't know how to be a war and didn't even mention that it was a war in one of their countries, where they were fighting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst "noir" film ever made. First of all, I am an avid "no one has ever done a story as good as the one in this movie. This is a complete waste of money. If anyone has ever wanted to watch a good movie, go ahead and rent this one on DVD. However, you cannot expect anything from this movie, even a true true noir film. At least the actors look good. If they had a story, they would look like a real human. They had absolutely nothing. I know that the filmmakers have only made one movie since they had worked on other movies. Why? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like some of the other bad movies I've seen but you can tell how it isn't like anything else I've ever seen, and it's not worth an effort. The story is bad, but it is good in a lot of ways. Some aspects are good. Other aspects were bad, too.  This is no redeeming for any other movie. It really has nothing to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is easily one of the worst films ever made. This film lacks a story to drive it, not enough characters, not much story to develop, and lacks any substance to carry the story. The ending is even worse than the beginning. The characters are utterly unlikable, especially the little character that was supposedly on her way to a beautiful life. This seems like it could be the greatest film of the early 1990s, but really, this movie is the only one of those late 20th century films that I can recall. If you have any interest in an obscure film, it might be OK for you to see. But don't waste your time. It's time for a time pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is bad. The actors act totally lame and the acting is horrible. It was horrible. The script was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I've seen it a few times, and it's very difficult to make even if someone knew how to watch it. Some people like it. The acting was OK for a little bit, but then they became so annoying. Maybe they did good, but if so, the lack of logic is that. I couldn't believe it's all that bad. In general I'm not really big fan of the way that this movie was done. It's just so bad you can feel nauseous... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very strange, I've read the book, but I don't remember how it is supposed to be like in the book. If it's a real movie: you will have difficulty identifying your way through it. I would like to have had the whole thing written down on the DVD. If you find yourself involved in the movie-that's all the better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea who made this movie but I do have a clue. I have an idea. I'm sure it's not a movie but a movie of bad comedy. If anyone reads this movie, please give this movie one of those words. It's a bad parody of the classic movie of the same name. I mean, what the heck is there? Well, we all like a lot of movies of this type but this movie doesn't deliver. Why?  If you see it, just walk away. I've seen this movie two times. The plot is predictable. There's nothing in this movie that even comes close to what it was supposed to. The movie is over-acted. There was something funny about this movie. But the movie didn't really work. There wasn't much humor. It didn't even have any real jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as bad as one of the worst movies ever made. I mean this is one of my favorite movies from the 1960's, and it was one of those movies that was made in a really slow fashion. But it is not worth to see. It is just as bad. It doesn't really get much past the "Mannia and the Vipers" storyline. It seems as if it is trying to get some points. It just lacks a plot. It makes no sense and there is no chemistry. In fact, the characters seem completely artificial. They talk like they are talking to someone.  There are some funny moments, but this movie is bad when it comes to acting. The actors are in their own rooms, making scenes, but they are forced to act as if they are in a movie theater, and there are no special characters. There are no real people and that is the only thing that made this movie really disappointing.  But overall it was a very disappointing movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second of three disappointing episodes (the first and the second) of the series. We get the obligatory "wacky" storyline in which a madman tries to abduct an unsuspecting victim (this is a reference to one of "MadMan's Club" episodes). This, alas, is the only episode to feature the original, brilliant protagonist.  However, this episode has an interesting plot, though unfortunately it has failed to succeed. The premise revolves around the death of the "Mad Man", a villain who has to make a final sacrifice to save his life. This was introduced in the episode where the madman has to kill his victim before it becomes too easy for him to die. Unfortunately, in this episode (with one exception), this is the dumbest of the two "Mad Mans" episodes. In the second episode the Mad Man dies. In this episode, the mad man is not killed but remains alive and then dies. I never found this amusing.   The rest of the episode contains some scenes where the Mad man attempts to force his wife to kill him in a gruesome fashion. A couple of characters are involved in this mess. The first one is the wife of the original "Mad MAN", and the rest of them are the characters who have been manipulated by the Madman. A good way of avoiding getting sick is to suspend your imagination as much as possible and not try to make too much of this episode.  The acting is quite good as usual. But unfortunately they aren't good enough to carry the episode. The plot is very bad. I have to say that it seems to me that the MadMan is really stupid and his wife is obviously brainless. I guess there was some good stuff happening in this movie but the story lacked something. The episode just doesn't really make any sense and the characters are so badly written that I was very scared and the script had an annoying feeling to read. I really think that the director got a particular bias towards the Mad Mans of this series.  If you're looking for a comedy that takes itself to deep waters, this one is bad news. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest rip-off of a movie: "American Reunion" is the movie of the 2000-2001 period (and the 2000+1 period). This is not just bad, but very predictable (exactly what happens, and nothing happens at all) - the storyline is so weak it's impossible to connect to it's "true purpose." The only movie of this era that was a complete hit was "Bolobito" (2000). This film is not even remotely comparable. There is no way for the characters to make a connection between them. The actors should be able to make the connection between these two films and avoid falling in a pit of cliché-filled cliches.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a bit of action, and this movie got me. I found the plot in a completely uninteresting way. The plot is based on the events of the real case in Japan (where there was a Japanese man who used to act and hit back against the Japanese mafia) and was pretty convoluted. The only thing that is surprising is that the killer is named as a serial killer. The killer is an over the top person who was not a serial Killer but a serial kidnapper (his kidnapper), not a Serial Killer. Even if he was a serial rapist, the killer had not even killed a woman. This is one of those cases that I had nightmares with for years.   If you are going to try to watch this movie then you are probably not doing it wrong. If not, then watch some of the other movies I have listed at the bottom of this page. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a man that tries to kill his wife while she is asleep. She is pretty annoying as usual. Then the other guy is playing with her... A few months after they meet, they start sleeping together. When they are both sleeping, he kills his wife. That is pretty stupid and not even pretty funny. Also, the idea that the killer is a madman or a monster is completely unbelievable.  Overall, this movie is pretty bad but could've been much better if it was a better vampire movie. The story is pretty dumb but it has to be a good twist to make it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is fairly predictable and, sadly, this is one of those horror movies that can't keep up. But what really annoys me about this movie is its disappointing ending. It has nothing to do with the other characters, the director, or the movie itself, and instead everything falls apart on the logic of the movie. The ending of the film is so bad, in fact, that I really couldn't care too much about it.  I felt that it was just an excuse to a lame movie, but I don't see that as much as I do those other movies. I just don't care enough to give this movie 2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend at a party in New York City said that if you read this book, you would be hard-pressed to find a single non-fiction piece. That alone should make it obvious that nothing from this book is truly credible. To my mind, the author is simply clueless about even basic facts: i.e. a man named Jack Diosky, the inventor of the infamous "Ride-On" school of dentistry who invented and created the infamous razor blade, and yet the man doesn't even acknowledge any of his past inventions.  The plot is based on something, and the characters are not as smart as they could be. The ending is pretty standard (I mean the one-sided wedding, and one of the many shots of a window facing the window, for example) but at least the story is interesting enough to keep a viewer's attention. But no matter how many people claim to have read this piece, I can guarantee that you will never get to read it. The book is just a bunch of clams. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this one on the TV and didn't like it. I don't know if they had the time to read the book and decide to turn it into a comedy series. In the book, it's just a normal day. In this show, it takes place every day, with an absolutely ridiculous plot. There's no "time" in the movie. The story is one-of-the-worst movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best thing about this horrible movie is that it does nothing but repeat the "D-M-A" lines again and again and only a little bit to get some laughs. What a bunch of guys with red hair and white hair, which means only a few moments and then all over again the "M-M" is supposed to go in. The only funny thing about the film is that they try to make jokes about the death of a girl. If they had some sense of humor, they would make the jokes about death and she would go straight to heaven and do something that is even more stupid than that.   This movie is just a bunch more mindless trash. You can't make this up. Just like the original movie, you can watch it for laughs. It is about as bad as that movie. It's too bad. If you're interested in a decent horror movie: Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to break the boundaries of what can and should be done in film making. It just does not make sense, as it seems to be very simple and so simple it never happens. I can see a few people who actually enjoyed the movie and have a good sense of logic behind it, but it is just very poorly done.  The storyline is not much better than a dumb movie made for entertainment. It seems to have a few minor plot twists and turns, but they are not well explained, not explained by the actors. The movie was extremely predictable. The only interesting thing was the characters. The biggest disappoints were the story. No character was explained well, and the characters did not really develop. I would give the movie 2 out of 10 because the plot was pretty good but the characters were extremely poor, especially the male protagonist. The ending was terrible. The dialog was pretty bad, as were the cinematography, the characters, the direction, and even the movie's director. If you want to see a comedy movie, you can skip this one. The best part of the movie is the story and a funny ending. It might have been OK if it were better and the ending would have helped to make the film more interesting, but that just seems useless. It did not help. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the review of this movie: it's a piece of trash. It's not good, and it's not very convincing. It looks like a documentary made for HBO, but that's all it is. It doesn't come out of his mind. He's not directing anything, and he doesn't make any sense whatsoever, making jokes that don't make sense at all. His character is pathetic and un-human, even for someone who is so much more powerful than the person he's playing. In fact, he's a villain. That's not a good thing.  If you've seen a documentary like this before, you would think that it's interesting, but unfortunately it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not even worth watching. If you want to see a horror film: 1) Don't watch this. I'd suggest watching Screamin' Elven. It is better than this one. This is simply bad film-making and bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this movie on the channel, not even from an Australian TV movie channel. It's pretty bad, even for a movie that's so low budget.  It's not like movies like "The Girl in the Mirror" or "The Mask" which are based on popular books, where you've got characters that are in a small bubble around the main plot line - the main actor and a girlfriend.  This movie really isn't like the way it is written, it's just a typical low budget "movie" with a stupid plot - the hero is dead, and has to find another way to escape.   The characters are obviously not going to be very well developed. Most of the time I looked at the video and it had only a couple of minutes of dialogue. They had a brief scene where they had a couple scenes together - that didn't seem like a scene where the characters could develop as a pair.  But the actors themselves are a bit wooden, and the direction is awful. The only really good thing is that it is a real story - a sad tragedy. But this was only done for a couple minutes.  I can't really recommend this movie - but if you don't find it interesting enough, you might like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a lot of bad acting and some very weak acting from one of the best directors ever, i.e. Jack Nicholson, but this doesn't stop him. This is only because of some very bad direction, bad editing and a very weak character. The movie would really be better if it had some more interesting performances than the predictable performance of the director, the rest of the movie is a total waste of time and should not have been even called a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains no plot, no character, no real reason. Just a bunch of people with a bunch in a cave in the middle of nowhere. A man falls in to another cave, takes a girl, a couple of people and has sex with them.  I thought the film was an attempt to be funny. Unfortunately, this doesn't last long enough.  There are just some ridiculous, over-dressed, and totally unnecessary scenes. What started out funny and had a plot, turned out to be totally meaningless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a comedy writer, I always like to make movies that don't have a plot. The best one is to make a story that involves a group of people that have nothing but a big plot and are just looking for some fun. If the story itself is interesting, there's no problem. But if it is poorly made and poorly acted, there is no problem because nobody can act, either. But it's a good comedy to watch when you're sick, and it's hard to keep watching when you don't. This is no exception. I tried to watch it in 2 parts, and I couldn't. I'm glad I missed the first part, because I didn't like it in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main culprit is the casting of Michael Murphy. This was the most irritating part of this film. Murphy was the biggest star of the entire series, and this film is about him getting a big budget. This film is so bad that it is basically incomprehensible. The storyline is completely irrelevant. A couple of the actors (Nathan Davis and Charles Dance from "The Godfather") only exist in this movie as a cameo. The best line of the film is from a man named Michael Murphy, who is the biggest celebrity in the film. The other actors, which are the same as the actors in "The Naked Ray" series, are merely a cameo role. This is especially bad in the last 30 minutes, because there is so little depth. They can't even act their roles like they are in " The Naked Ray", which was pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason i liked this movie was because it was funny at the beginning, but that was all I wanted. I've never really liked this type of movie, even though it was amusing at the start and I really got hooked by the ending. The funny idea is that the guy is forced to make a commitment to do a movie and is forced on a plane at the end. That's ridiculous. Why is the guy forced to say this in the movie, and he says it? He only has to make sure he's not going to make another movie? This movie just sets up a stupid movie and then goes into another stupid movie. And the movie isn't funny, you won't even get to see it if you don't care too much about the characters. Why doesn't there be a real story in this movie? I'll be honest, I didn't find the ending at all interesting. And what's really funny is that this movie is all about a bunch of guys making stupid jokes about a stupid story. This is probably the worst type of comedy I have ever seen, and it is extremely bad that this is still a movie in my memory. Maybe if this movie were made on a computer, it would have actually been funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as bad as you can get, even worse than the average Hollywood-style movie. It just doesn't go to show any real emotions. Some jokes are so bad I'm unable to find the ending. I thought about giving it 2 stars but then I decided to give it 1. It's a shame to see some of the big stars like The Mighty Mighty Mighty Mike or The Rock show so low-rated and just plain bad in a big way. It must have a very low budget, like some sort of cheap movie, to be as bad. The best movies that I've seen in my lifetime, like "Fantastic Four", "Swing" and "Super Monkey", are not much better. This movie does have some great surprises though. Most of them were pretty funny and interesting in a way, but I'm afraid that this movie will make you sick. Please don't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the movie that every single person who has ever spoken a positive review about this horrible movie: The entire movie is nothing but a waste of a movie. As a woman, I would never sit through this garbage and watch myself and have my heart breaking after seeing it. It is no exaggeration to say that the entire movie made no sense. If you are watching this on TV, you will be bored out before you even finish the movie. This movie is a waste to your eyes. I would give it the number of stars that it deserved but unfortunately this movie didn't get that honor. If anyone has ever seen this movie, they would have no time to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the comments about this movie go, I can tell you I'm not surprised. It's not as shocking as I think it is supposed to be. It just doesn't deserve to be put in any respect. But it did and I have to admit it's not that surprising. If they can't find the characters, I will be quite shocked.  I can't imagine anyone watching this thing that would make me care what I would be watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot: You'll love it when you see "Who's a Kid?" in a movie, and it's good enough to make you enjoy watching it only if you're a big idiot. But, if you really, REALLY enjoy watching "Who is a Kid," you won't care.    After the movie is over you will wonder if your brain has worked that the plot is actually about the kids. It seems to have a few plot points, but the movie has more of those. You'll be bored and you'll think the movie itself is about something entirely different. In truth it's not about something.  You'll laugh when the kids are doing stupid things. And you'll see the kids screaming and crying because they're so stupid. And if you like it you'll want to stop watching the movie. But the only reason to watch it is that it's a "kid" movie that you never see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What makes this movie even more ridiculous than anything else is the fact that it doesn't have any characters, the only thing that actually happens in the movie is the dog who runs off with a little puppy(some old dog, who likes to ride). The movie just really just takes place in a tiny house with a bunch of people(that can't tell whether these were real people or people in a movie). There are no people around to care about. The only thing in the house that was interesting (and that I think was the main plot of the movie) was the dog whose life was stolen by the kids(the puppy), and who then dies from the illness. How about that? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film just isn't good. I thought it was a "Funny Movie", and there is no place for it to be funny. It just does not get any funny and is extremely predictable.  i thought the "spanking" thing was pretty interesting at first. However, this was not true. It seemed like a real torture chamber. The ending was very predictable, and it seemed like nothing new. I wanted to wait to see how they finally end the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film, and I had a feeling that it was going to be really bad...and I still was not prepared to laugh in an obscenely self-determined way. Not because there was nothing to laugh at in this film. This film seemed to contain a lot of pointless violence, and a few gratuitous nudity. Most importantly, it made me feel like I was watching some kind of medieval torture video. I felt like this was meant to be a medieval torture movie.  But I still couldn't quite agree with the producers. The movie was just a big, dumb, boring, pointless film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies I find every time I watch. I've never seen anything so bad I'd never think to watch this one.  This movie is so bad that it's difficult to find any good things to say. I had read the book but I don't really remember. My girlfriend and I liked the way they acted and how they behaved but I couldn't find the same type of acting in this movie. It was just plain stupid and not funny.  I would not recommend watching this one unless you find something good to watch on Comedy channel, or if you want to get a good laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like a bad TV show. I watched it when it was aired in the US and I couldn't care one bit of it. The biggest problem in this movie was that it's just a cheap way to get into the business. It's the typical tactic of the "winkers" which I see regularly in the TV programs. You would really find a movie better than that. For example, here's a famous scene in the movie, "the good and the bad" when you see it's a good and bad movie. The actors should have been so much more annoying than the actors in the entire film. What made that scene a good one was that the "good" person was a part of the evil thing and it was in the good person's brain. There are so many instances of this, it's not even funny.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the film "The Ring", which is based on a very bad episode of The Ring, we have an evil woman who was a part of the previous film, and that her only flaw is that she used a mask to go around and kill her victims. The plot is that the person who killed the "previous" is also a part in a plot where the ring is used to catch other murderers who are trying to catch the killer. The main villain is a woman named "The Wizard". However, what we see during the film is that it's a pretty good story, and at the end when the killer and her are reunited it seems to be " The Wizard " is actually a human and is one who kills people, and she kills the family.  The other side of the film was also pretty good, but I can't see where the real "previously" killer is located.  What was "prevention", is that a character's mask made her look like she was a vampire. I think that was the "normal" part of it. There was no explanation. It's like a person having a vampire's mask and pretending she was the vampire. The only problem I have with it was the fact that this movie was filmed in a warehouse in the UK. I just don't know whether they used a warehouse or an apartment. It was very obviously just an excuse for a stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first movie and I thought the second one was great. It was pretty good. But I can see a different movie: this is the movie that made me want to drop it. While the original was a really good comedy, this one just doesn't work. The story is extremely dull and the acting is lousy. The movie is one of the worst I've seen.  I don't like comedy but I did like comedy in the first one. Now I'm looking for another comedy, but I can't find it. The new one was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film on a DVD a few years ago, and it seemed a horrible waste of time. The plot was just a piece of paper with a bunch of scenes that consisted of one girl's father coming up to her, and she is killed, leaving her mother behind her while she waits for her father to come back... and all in a very basic plot. What a film was like, I cannot say. It does not have a plot, so a movie is not necessarily "difficult", but what a story is supposed to be. The movie is completely incomprehensible. I can't imagine why anyone would put up a film of this. It's simply not worth watching, and the acting is terrible. For example, the man with a big smile says "good morning", and then says, "I don't know who's your father is", and he does not get the big smile as well as he says, and then he is sad because he missed the wedding. There's some bit of weird dialogs, some strange situations, some extremely ridiculous scenes, and some completely ridiculous lines. It is just a bad story - the girl with the huge smile is supposed, and you cannot tell who was her father's father - and that's why you want to watch this movie. You'll never get any pleasure out of watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this film at a local movie store and after seeing it I couldn't wait to see it again. The acting was so bad that I didn't even finish watching the movie. There are no lessons whatsoever in this movie that a literate adult would learn anything from it. The film does not even attempt to be original. The plot is so bad, it's really hard to believe this could possibly be an independent filmmaker. The ending to the film is so confusing that it's almost impossible to make sense of the events in the film. I tried to make this movie into a documentary, but couldn't do it. I gave it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is another film, unfortunately, that falls victim to the same kind of marketing mistakes that we all have seen on the other side of the spectrum. When a film is made, people do not expect it to be a pretty flick, they don't expect to have it as funny as it should. So while it doesn't seem to be so, it doesn? In fact, I was very disappointed after seeing this film. Even the cast couldn't do anything so bad as the first "funny comedy" film:  I didn't laugh at this film at all. This movie was full of horrible acting, bad special effects and bad camera shots. It was just horrible! There was one moment when a bunch of teenagers got on a car at a big party and tried to get some drugs off the car, and ended up throwing their heads off. It should be funny but I am surprised it doesn�t even seem that horrible. If you're a parent you can get into it and see the end without being embarrassed. You need to read the book and not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't like the movie.  It's like watching an episode of "The Naked Ray" and going to the gym naked and getting mad and then getting mad again. If you're interested in a movie, then you'll be disappointed. The story is about a girl who fell out of a tree tree that she was climbing. But the tree was supposed to stop climbing...  The ending just keeps going. It's not even funny.  And if you're a fan of "Bachelorette" or "The Big City", then you're probably better off watching "Hot Fush", or "Bully". They're much better than the movie "Buckaroo".  The best thing about the movie: it's really stupid. The camera is the worst. The dialog is really ridiculous. There are many stupid moments, but I'd have to say that it's funny anyway.  But overall, it's a really bad movie. If it didn't suck, at least the ending would be funny. The movie had some humor, the characters were amusing, and the music was good. But it just didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a movie: It was very bad, and I didn't even get the plot a plot for. It was just a lot of sex scenes, naked men and naked women doing naked erotic acts. It's not a good way to film your own work or a bad way to produce your movie. It doesn't even follow the logic. It just tries to be shocking, which is just not the way to do your movie in any sense. I guess it was made in the early 1960's. But even if you were to film the sex scenes yourself you would never think it was anything like a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no way to explain how much of the characters are supposed to be based on actual lives in the US. What you see is the whole world, and it's only a few thousand miles away. For example, what was a real person in my hometown, a fictional character was created. The plot is simply a rehash of the true tale, without any real reason. For starters, the character is based on my family and my wife, who, although I have no reason for my comments here, should have known that the character was made at my expense. That's what the film does. They can pretend to use my family's name, but that's just not enough. The acting is bad. I mean, how many people, including friends, actually think they're so great, and you can only wonder how many others want to hear this as something new. There's no real reason for it. My wife's character is as ridiculous as it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've got the patience and desire to watch this, you would be disappointed. You'll probably go out of your way to watch the original series, but not many will give you the time to enjoy it. I would take any other movie for the original. You would have a good time with it, but it's just another piece of trash like The Castle. I was expecting a better film than this crap. If you're watching this with a big audience, beware of watching it on a small screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the absolute dumbest thing I have ever seen in a TV show. It is no exaggeration to say that the episode, which I highly recommend only if you really want to watch, is the dumbest episode I have seen. In spite of my harsh words, I'm obliged to say there is no way you can say it to be just the biggest waste of a comedy ever made. At times, it was so boring I had a deep-diss hatred of the show. This was probably the only thing I can fault as a sitcom or series. While I agree that this isn't a comedy, I was so annoyed I wanted to give this show a 2 out of 10. When the plot finally got to be the way it ended up, I felt robbed of it and just sat there. The only thing that saved this film was that I liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that has absolutely no substance, no characters, no story. It's a movie of pure frustration, mindless action (which you can almost smell) and a little bit of cheese. It really shouldn't have been made a million of dollars, because that was the last thing that kept me interested. The story is thin and it has been ripped apart by some other actors so that I would really be interested in learning more about it. The characters are just flat, dumb, bad-wrench types and the ending is too vague, too unbelievable and not well written. The only redeeming feature in this movie is the 'jokey' gag. It is funny, but just as annoying as the rest of the movie. It feels like a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the original review from this movie I saw that it has a great potential but doesn't succeed. This is about as low as a bad film can get. In fact, I'd really prefer to see another movie with this sort of stupidity. However, if I had to see it again I might have some laughs. But I'm not going to rent it because I'd be dead to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The name of this movie is the name of the "Shopper" which is also referred to "Shroom". If the name is used "Shoopper", it is an extremely stupid term, because it is a person who lives in a shrubbakled shack that is only run a few days a week. They rent a home for some purpose.  When I arrived at this house, the owner of this shack was a person named "Shroob" and his wife also lived in it, but also other people, but at least you can't say that this person is a "Shoom" like the "shroom". It is interesting because the "name of the shack is the only house in the country with such a house. In addition, the "house" is also called "Shrubbaks" because the term "shopper", as a noun, means a house in which the owner rented and sold the shack. In the movie it is the same.  There are only 2 houses in which "Shoosop" is rented. One is called "The Shack", and the other one is called, "The Hoop".  The only good thing about this movie, is that it has been made into a movie for the first time since it was released. I just got done seeing it at the Canadian Film Centre, and I really enjoyed it, because the movie is a horrible waste of time, it can only be described as a waste of precious time. The title of this crap is so far from the truth that you can not even call it a movie. It is not interesting. It doesn't even have a plot, it is just a boring and ridiculous "movie", but unfortunately that was the name that I had to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a good movie, you can find it at the beginning of the seventies. A little history of the time of Hollywood's production (that is all the other movies that got released) is the only thing that this movie could have had. The plot is nothing to make your eyes bleed, but it gets extremely stupid. The movie seems so cheesy as it is supposed to be that it just goes on and on. You will watch nothing but one moment after another that you will be bored and need to go outside and get your money back. Avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just about the only one that we can't watch. The movie starts with a very predictable story, very predictable.  The plot turns out to be pretty damn silly. It is obviously very simplistic. Even with the new, very clever and clever characters, it just isn't as good as the "real" world. It really looks like they are just putting on an act: that's all. At the end, when I finally got to see it, I couldn't believe it's even a movie. I kept hoping I would just buy it, and try to save it and put it on my DVD, but I couldn\'it believe that it had to be so absurd. When you have no idea of the world or the characters or the story, it seems like they don\'t know what they are doing. I was just hoping they would find more interesting parts of the story.  Well, it isn\'t so bad, as much as I can see it as I watch. But you have to be very careful. A lot of people in the movie are obviously trying to make the characters more interesting. If you are just watching the film, you don\'it a lot more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the end of the film would be so good - I just wanted to kill someone and that was all. I had no idea how the hell that was going to end up in the first minute. But then, the scene that you see is the end - in which all the villains are killing people...the scene was bad enough but not as bad as the film that was, which I can't seem to remember.  The film, in the end, was like watching a big mess of garbage. A lot of stuff was missing. The characters were very confused. There was no motivation. The whole thing just felt like watching smoke...and then, of course, the smoke went out. And then you'd suddenly wake up again, only to realize that you just woke up. All of the scenes were made a lot worse than they should have been. And the overall plot was just really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual, the writer tries to bring the "new way" to the movie "The Expendables" by throwing several extra actors into a small, substandard gang. We're used to see a movie that would have seen more people in a lot less time than this one does. The first couple minutes are OK. But then it becomes clear that it's just an excuse to waste some time. So in this case it just plain looks like a bunch of actors who should be in their playing (except for a couple of others) and we're forced to sit through the whole movie and watch the characters play their parts, just to make sure we're satisfied with their lack of character development. In some cases there's just too much to take in to justify this, like the part where a member of the group is a man who was forced to shoot someone in a rage because he wasn't impressed by the other characters'. This is a shame. The plot is okay, with some amusing supporting stars, but there's not enough time for anything to make a difference. The acting is a little weak and the plot (or any other factors) don't help us make a convincing impression. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is just an awful movie: it does not have a great storyline or anything else to recommend it. It seems as though a guy was a hit with a lot of money and needed a lot to live on. The people who supposedly want to help make more money are all greedy and there is no actual evidence that they really need help. The movie has some good scenes, but they are really boring. The characters are not in a great way to help the story or help the character to change. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only did it fail to capture my interest with any semblance of excitement, but it also failed to deliver any fun, so it had to be as bad as the original film.  The original film made more sense, and I would recommend to watch it if you want to, but this movie doesn't.  I really thought the end of the film was going to be a sort of sequel of the original, but I was actually a little confused. I can only really blame this movie for the utter incompetence of the acting. There was absolutely no real story in this movie. The film tries to include all the things it doesn't have in the first, but just leaves them aside and allows you to enjoy what you would expect it to be.  For instance, the actors were having sex in a small cave that was surrounded by a huge pool in the middle of the movie. Well, this was supposed to be some sort of a watercraft where they would use what they had on. It wasn't that, it was just that they would just be having sex with each other in a bunch of caves. Also, there was a lot of nudity in the film, and it just didn't make any sense in any way. Well I guess it had a purpose, because it would be a lot easier to get the women to have sex that way.  My other problem with the film is the fact that it lacks a very decent theme. I had no clue whatsoever. There wasn't really anything interesting in it. Nothing that I didn't care for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very good and it makes some nice images - but this movie was totally meaningless with only shallow dialog. The story line is completely non-clinkered - there are no scenes in which we ever learn anything except how the story is about a female murder victim.  Also this movie is very slow - it's just so that there are many scenes and there is no reason to go out of the house, or even leave the street or anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the UK on TV last night. The plot was so stupid it didn't make sense, even for a film with "Ineema" as the protagonist. The film was really dull and seemed like they only wanted to make money off some very old and faded footage. I really felt like a complete waste of time.  The ending was totally awful. I was tempted to watch this film just because it was a good film. This film was not directed well at all and I think the idea that it was the perfect ending was ludicrous. I have been watching some of the other versions of this film on TV and the only thing that was interesting was that the story ended. I don't believe this is a film worth seeing. I give this film a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie (in every way) but, unlike the previous, this one just doesn't work. Well, a very bad film is made of the characters in a way that is not believable. There are some pretty interesting characters, but unfortunately they're so bad it doesn't really get anywhere. The actors are so bad they don't even bother to act; if they did, they might pull some very interesting performances. But it seems they weren't very good at all. There's some really good actors in the cast, but they don´t get the job done. The film is mainly about a drunken sex scene, but not the most interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a man who can read only a few words and I don't understand what "it" means. For example, this movie is about a madman who kidnaps the world, which no one has ever seen. And you can expect, if you're lucky, at the end of the movie, it will be "climax" (no real-world title).  This movie is just horrible. It is so bad, in fact, that I can't imagine any way in which it might be good. I have absolutely no faith in this movie. I just expect someone who has nothing to lose - such as your mother - to watch it. The acting is terrible. And the script was lousy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The fact that there is an "official" sequel to "Lobster's Den" is, and that it contains several plot elements that are totally useless for the sake of making the film. For instance, we learn the story of a mad scientist who is obsessed with animal companions and is obsessed by his obsession with all animals. I've just seen this thing on a number of UK TV channels and I've never heard about it.  I really didn't like this film at all. It was bad! The acting is extremely poor, the film is a predictable story, and the plot is extremely weak. The story is completely uninteresting, and it doesn't even have a storyline (for the sake) to make it interesting for the viewers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like a piece of garbage.  This is the only film I have ever seen from Italy where the director obviously did no effort and so that any other film I would make would be better.  I am not one of those Italian film directors who are in it for the sheer joy of doing something stupid like this.  There are so many excuses in this film and I can't stand them anymore. I just cannot believe the director did this for the sake of a joke. I thought this would be hilarious if the director was in Italy but the opposite proved the opposite.  In this film they use to describe an imaginary movie about a real Italian movie: a vampire film with vampires. I am sure they were all laughing so much that they had to keep laughing to avoid embarrassment and so it is impossible that the director had to spend half a day in trying to make the film seem real. And they did not even try.    The film itself is unbelievable and stupid.  The first problem is that it doesn't make any sense.  It is not funny. I was fooled by the title. I would like to see the other Italian films but that would be too much. It doesn't matter that the title is a "Italian" film and that its makers wanted to make a similar film. They didn't want to make it real. In my opinion this is a typical case of a bad Italian film.  If this is to be a film, there is no film that is so bad that it does nothing. If this movie was a film with all the actors and actresses and it does not, it is not made for laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a truly awful movie. Its weak acting, horrible editing, and terrible cinematography. It's just not a good movie. It doesn't even come close to the worst "film" that's ever been. Why would anyone waste money on a film that is essentially an embarrassment and a waste of the company's time? This is the last film from the company that made the classic "Sister's Quarters", and it is the only one to ever be out of order. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's bad! It's a horrible plot. It isn't even original! The characters are terrible, with little plot or characters whatsoever. The direction is weak, as usual. It doesn't even try to be dramatic. The plot is not even worth it. The movie could have been shot in a normal camera and played with a normal film camera. It really got me down!   I'll give it a 10 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is the point? I mean there is nothing new about this but what is it that a movie about a big, big tent and the leader of the tent decides to kill everyone by throwing them in jail? Then why is he in jail in the first place? Is he going to fight the other guy in jail with a knife? Is the guy in prison for life? I'm afraid. I wish I had the patience to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised about how much this is in my opinion. I watched this film when it was first released, and then I saw it again at the local video store. The film itself looks so badly designed, it's not enjoyable. Some of the scenes are boring, but then they're totally unnecessary.  What I thought of was the plot was that the plot is about the love of one girl (not actually the girl) and the need to be a father.  The movie itself looks really cheap, it really does not act like a romantic movie. And the ending is not too satisfying. The characters don't really get the payoff they deserve. I didn't like this at first. But when I saw that I thought more of the film than I was supposed to, I began to think it was interesting. The acting isn't very good. And it doesn't come together with the rest of the movie. The music is bad. And some of the visuals are bad, I've never seen something that is so bad. If you are expecting a romantic film like this, this is not one.  But to answer, I can't say that it's an example of a "gay romance", that it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. I was just expecting this movie to be good. Then I saw it was just awful! My mind was dead. My girlfriend was not laughing and I couldn't keep watching it. It was only a few minutes in when I was glad my friend was enjoying it. I am sure I did not miss the other parts of it. That was only part one. Everything else sucked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many things that I want to say that weren't so obvious that I could never take this movie seriously. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is painfully slow and dull. I'm not sure if I'll ever see this movie again. I didn't expect an interesting movie when I saw it, so I don't expect my words will make much sense. And I can't really get into the details of what happened in the movie. Some of the scenes were pretty funny but the whole movie was just slow.   I could easily have left this movie after it was released because I already had enough of the popcorn and popcorn on my hand to make sure my eyes weren't too sensitive to the crap they were getting into. There is some humor in this movie, but it was just not enough to keep me watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really disappointed by the film and the fact that they decided to film this made it so bad.  The biggest problem is the story, which is boring and has no plot or reason. The first part was not very interesting. The second part of the film is just so bad and I can only blame it on the script. If the story is interesting, this might be better than this film, but it is so bad, I don't think it works. If you want a good movie, watch "Rango", but don't spend a lot of money.  If you liked the original version, this is probably better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty bad. It really is a shame that the makers of this movie decided to put this to their movie.  If we were all good actors, we would have a decent comedy set. But this is not that. The script is so terrible, the director doesn't even have the decency to be making this movie. And worst of all, the actors are in the movie like they are in stage play. There are some good actors in this movie, but this movie should not be set on a stage. If the movie is set on stage, there should be a stage set in the background of a typical movie set.  This is not a movie that anyone in real life can laugh at. However, if the movie was in reality, there would be a funny little scene in the beginning of the movie. But the story and story are pretty weak, and it is a waste of time that even the plot could be filmed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Secret" is a bad, mediocre comedy with a very small cast, horrible, predictable dialogue, and a horrible script. The best actors in the cast are the actors from the early 1930s (I think they might be the ones that made "The Adventures of Harry and Harry"). Even the great stars like Elvis Presley and Burt Reynolds did not do well in this. It is also extremely predictable and can only be enjoyed if one is bored, not bored. It seems to have been filmed in a way that was never seen in films of the early 30's.  The plot is too convoluted and there is too little dialog. It's like an elementary school with a little bit of soap.  There are some moments in which you can just figure out how "The Wizard" is supposed to be, but the film is very predictable and predictable.  "Secret" is really bad at the beginning. The beginning is decent as a parody of Hollywood, but soon enough it becomes a predictable and extremely dull.   The rest of the movie is decent but just not good. The movie is extremely bad in plot and dialog, but it's a comedy that really doesn't go far enough to make me laugh. The biggest mistake in "Secret", though, is the way the writer and director created a situation which is clearly ludicrous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is like a movie of a child's birthday (or the equivalent of an 11 year old boy). When it was released I was disappointed. The film did not come alive, and I can see no joy that it could provide. And I don't know if it did. I don`t understand how a filmmaker or writer can find out to the audience that he will not be able to make this film for himself. Even though it had promise to be something interesting, it seemed to fall apart at a few points. There was a funny bit at the end of the film that really could only have been made if someone was a bit more enthusiastic. I thought the idea of a male man killing a girl was a joke as most of the other comments were pretty good and funny. This film was like watching a movie without a plot. It doesn`t have any plot. The only things that were good were the shots and the cinematography, and the music didn`t sound that bad either.  This movie was a total waste of time and money. If you want to watch something that you can make a lot of money doing, this movie is probably not one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only conclude that this film is the worst film I've ever seen. The plot, acting and acting are all bad and the directing is awful. My only hope is that the writer, Dan Lipel, has more in his head. I just couldn't stand this movie. I can't believe that Lipel was in this movie for more than 2 hours. I thought that the film was about the same time as that it was at the end of the last year, but just didn't see it. I think that is probably why Lipel left it so early. But the story is interesting and I can learn a lot more about the subject without taking this movie in a shower. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I say above is a matter of taste. A story based on the Bible which is basically nonsense in the face of God's (and by that time the story is so long ago and it isn't relevant to modern viewers) stories about angels and their children is not worth a mention on this list.  A good story is a happy one. Unfortunately, a movie like this just does not want to happen. The story of Jesus is based on a story based upon the bible which is obviously not intended to be a true story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie seems like a sequel to a bad Hollywood movie of "The Last Son" which came out in '95 but that is no excuse. It is absolutely awful to watch as the characters are in the worst movie ever to come out of a movie of the 20th century. The only saving that comes from watching the first two episodes of "the Last Son", if you like watching those episodes, it can be interesting when they are done to some extent, but this movie has absolutely nothing to do with them. Don't even get caught watching it, and you'll be a lot more satisfied with what you get for free than you have gotten for yourself. This is just bad. It's a shame, but I'd be lying if I said it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is a movie about people, or something like a documentary, it needs more than a few well-produced gummy actors. The film was boring, I could see little difference between the beginning and the end. It was just like "Gee Whips, Wee Woob, Wee Twatch, Wee Nooty, Wee Ulls, Wee Un-nough" in terms of acting.  The film is about a little kid who discovers a new animal, gets friends to try it, and then kills it. It is not like a true story, and at most, the protagonist killed something and then gets a new little kid. And then he gets himself a job. After killing the thing, he discovers that it was his fault. So, no real explanation for the "good" part. The funny thing is that there is a lot of animal and human corpses in the film. I thought that it would be interesting to have seen a scene where a little guy gets killed in a pool, then gets back into some sort of trouble with a human body. The "big guy" was just the big guy who has to find his "little" friend so he can get away from the little guy's trouble. It wasn't. The plot didn't have any depth. I didn't care for it. But there was just some funny moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. I am not ashamed to say that I am willing to believe it, but the other actors and crew have to believe, and it is disappointing that they put the same effort in an action movie.  You have to expect some sense of intelligence and even some sense that it might be a movie that may be interesting. A story is not the main point, or even the movie itself. The main focus is the guy's quest to defend himself from being used as a sacrifice and that the movie has an obvious plot. I have never seen anything like this in a movie. That the "character" is one guy who is supposed to protect himself is just not the movie's point.  Even if I didn't like the plot, the acting is awful. I cannot recall who said "I don't understand" that it is not a story and they are both wrong, but I can understand that they are in a battle of the forces to determine whether this is a story or not. You might think this was the case, but not.  Overall this movie isn't good, but it's a waste of time if one is put in a position to see it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Legend of Zelda" is a complete waste of both time and the ability to do anything else. If you're going to be a Zelda fan, you're best off playing NES games or even the Nintendo 64 and NES games.  This movie is just too stupid to be worthwhile. The characters are boring and the story is poorly written, so you can't imagine what it's going to happen to a Zelda. Not only does the plot make sense, but the characters are bad. It's not a good idea for Zelda fans to get into the game, because you'll get so bored watching the characters act out. The film is also boring to watch.  The cast of the film is good at the beginning. But, the rest of the characters aren't great either. The plot was bad enough to ruin the movie. I think the director thought he had a neat story and that's why he brought in the bad characters. They were good at it and they should have made more movies that weren't like these.  I would also like to point out that in the original, Zelda is a pretty girl and in the sequel, she's a real girl. The sequel makes it seem like she's had a sex-change. The main cast members were also good at that time, and it is the only movie that has the characters with a female-male appearance. It was a good way for the director to change the characters, so they might have had a better ending if they didn't include another person on the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is some pretty bad stuff, and I can't say I'm very bothered. But it is at least better than many, many, best, movies I've seen.  But the movie's plot seems to be ripped off a lot more than this; it looks like it is based on the same old stories it was based on.  The plot is very similar to a real-life murder, with two men that go out to do "hah-ah-hah, hah-haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa," and have the body taken away from her body; a car-truck is crashed in her apartment; the two are in an apartment (no one remembers what they're doing); the house is filled with blood; and she is killed in a small house by the other body.  I suspect that the movie would be good if it was set in a nice, quiet, dark neighborhood, with all the family and neighbors from around; there would have been a lot of people involved in the murders.  This movie isn't. There's no more gruesome detail than a body being dragged through a garden; it is just an attempt to do some light, and light is just bad.  One reason I didn't give this movie 10 stars was because I'm not sure that much is supposed to go on. There isn't much more for a "movie" than a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You don't expect to see the end of life's story and, even with the most famous and talented actors, the result is nothing to be expected. What did the actors do for five minutes? We'll never find out. But, if there were any real story to tell, it would have been a bit like "Harry Potter", with an ending so predictable that it no longer even bothered me. The director, a little girl named Lucy Bloom (played by "Molly as the real Bloom") can do anything she tried, and she's too old, too inexperienced, and too stupid to know it. The rest of the cast were so terrible, I couldn't even find the last person to be in the film. It didn't even make me feel anything like sympathy for the characters. A little twist of the story could have been interesting, but it didn't happen. I really wished I'd seen this movie as much as I needed to. But I can't blame any actor for making this movie. I just think the filmmakers were trying to make something that was impossible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story in this film revolves around a little girl who falls in love with a man who doesn't know how she really needs. The end of the film is not quite clear, but a lot of confusion is likely to arise. This is not a comedy - it's a horror movie, which would have been better with a simpler story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot starts with a simple line about a boy who lives in the woods. In fact, it's not a line. It's a story with a cast of a few actors who can't think beyond their basic talents. The main character is Jack Twist, who lives alone in a cave in the forest with a dog named Lila, and who is very cruel to his sister. She was also very cruel with Lila when they were young. They both want him to die, but Lila is too much in her way to stop. The plot then becomes a gruesome scene, featuring horrible violence, killing and being killed, the only way Lila can be saved. The end is a bloody slaughter with an actor who, despite his being killed by Lila and dying, is not killed in front of his head, but instead stabbed in a way so he can't die. The ending is a bit vague, but it still pretty annoying to watch. The cast in the movie are pretty good, if you consider that the main character has to do something to make a decision. The whole thing is pretty bad, the acting is awful, and the scene in the beginning is awful. You may want to avoid watching this at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries so hard to bring the "feelings" of horror to the "teenagers" crowd, and just ends in a total bore. While this is an odd movie for any genre, it's very clear that if they could really communicate with the rest of the audience, they might not like the movie. The acting is awful, the story lacks any substance, and the story itself is so weak that it is laughable. The film is not funny or clever, but it's so bad, that it's worth just sitting through the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a shame to see this film was released by the "New York Film Festival" when it was in Los Angeles in January of 1992. This is a total rip-off of the original, which was one of the most original films I have ever seen. The only thing I can say is that this is the worst film ever made for American cinema. There are several false plot twists that make the story seem impossible to understand.   The characters are portrayed as stupid, obnoxious, and obnoxious. They are stupid and annoying, but it is just not a good movie. Even if you are into movies that are meant to be interesting, this does not appear to be one of those movies.  This film is one of many horrible films from the era that came before the introduction of sound-tracks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was only about a teenage girl who has fallen on an altar of Satan. She is rescued by a good priest, and after a series of misadventures, she is saved by Satan. Of course, the evil priest is a good one and a good vampire. This is not to say that the story is all that much. I didn't care for it anyway.  I didn`t understand why they would choose to make such a movie in the first place. It was the only part of this movie that I actually cared about and the only thing that was left in the movie. But I think it doesn`t take long for a person to be able to become enslaved to Satan's will. That should be considered a crime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a person that has been trapped in an airtight sealed storage container and must escape from the sealed container. The only way he can escape is to find a way to get past this. He also finds a way and find a man who wants to help him, but his attempt is unsuccessful because he does not have enough power to overcome it. The final sequence of the movie follows a lot of dialogue, which is just about as useless as anything else. The ending is just stupid as hell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years ago (probably around the turn of the century), a movie with the name "The Devil Inside", began showing how the devil can be just. If you are looking for a movie that isn't too boring to watch, the one that is so bad is "The Walking Dead". In a nutshell, it doesn't really do much for entertainment, but it seems to be very well-produced (since the end is more than just a horror film, but also a boring and stupid movie).  I don't have a particular comment on the film itself, but I did like it when it was first shown in Germany, and I thought it was interesting but I felt some of the acting was awful, especially when it wasn't scary but rather boring. In this case it was the girl who fell victim to the devil--the Devil--I didn't like the way she was portrayed. I am not going to say too much on the topic since it is an Italian movie, but let me add that the actress was portrayed very badly. The scenes were not scary at all and it was not funny. The only thing that was good was the scene where she met with the Devil and killed him--she was scared by the devil. (I can't remember the exact wording of that scene--it's a pretty long scene, I have forgotten) I was surprised to find that the devil was portrayed as a young boy. I did find it amusing, though.  If you're looking for something to laugh at, this one is not going for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film tries to turn it's own title with an interesting plot and a nice cast. But it's all too clichéd and so bland. It's simply a story about a little girl that falls into a creepy basement and finds a little boy with a small collection of toys. I'd think that's a better thing to do with a film in which the protagonist falls into an apartment full of demons. What's even more annoying is the fact that the demons are only a little bit stronger than they should be. They have the power to beat each other to death. And the protagonist doesn't even kill anyone but he keeps using the "devil" to help her get out of a bad situation. The acting is lousy, especially the villain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of film. Just like "The Devil" it's like every other idiot has a film to make.    The movie is about a serial killer who kills three or four people in a day and has a "special" super-villain (as usual) who has a cure to his condition so he can continue killing. But the movie fails to deliver. A lot of lines are not even written here, and the actors who do have some plot are flat out awful.  The ending is a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an absolute waste of ideas, bad jokes, and mediocre writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was poorly developed. It was completely predictable and didn't develop to the expected level, and lacked any emotional connections to the protagonist, characters or themes. Most of the scenes were completely devoid of action. The acting was also entirely insinceous.  The only redeeming part of this film is its title. Some have suggested the movie was meant to be about the man and the woman that he had fallen into. However, the two characters were obviously set in a relationship before the film was released, and the film failed to develop the relationship between the two lovers. This may have had to do with the fact that the film is set in the early 1950s. This is a disappointing example of the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't take the time to see this movie. The movie is really bad. If the stars weren't as bad, I might like the movie better. For that reason I'm really unsure how to review it. For the story, it is bad (some of the lines don't even make it). There is the fact that it shows us going to work in a bar and, that it is about a guy doing the dirty work (in a hotel), that it has a lot of scenes of a guy going around with a prostitute. It is just plain bad. I cannot recommend this movie as a movie that you watch only once. However, I do recommend it as a horror movie, and that's it. It's not good enough to be a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad in every way imaginable. It really is bad to the point of being bad.  It lacks any real substance except for a few scenes that are pretty funny. There's nothing in the movie that will even redeem the film, so I have to give the plot away. Some good things about this movie: it's a comedy, as a matter of fact it does more than just entertain for most people. But it doesn't have any real value, like they want to say it did. For example, there's a huge cast in this movie and none of them are actually in the film. The story is pretty funny, it's pretty basic, it has a lot of comedy, it does some great scenes (and I mean some real quality, which is questionable). The plot is basically dead to reality, but there's some pretty good comedic scenes. But, if you are not interested in watching some real comedy (like "The Secret Filler") then you'll have to find some more movies to enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll tell you no more details. You know, the movie just ended. It was a little too slow, and too predictable. It seemed to be a bit too old (if you like old film, you'll love this). The storyline is really weak.  The movie could have been a good one - it would have been so great to watch. But, it wasn't. The actors were horrible.  You can feel a lot of anger being directed at them. And they tried to make the characters look as if they weren't supposed to act. You can see it was a very simple script - but, by the end, you just can't believe what was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie in a rented movie theater on the lower east side of Detroit (and, yes, my hometown) last week. I just rented it at the local video rental store because I thought it was a little bit interesting and I was expecting to see a good movie. But I was wrong.  If you want to see more of the movie: just keep going down the street and down the side street and you'll end up walking away the first 15 minutes.  And that's just the first 10 minutes. Just about 1.5 hours, you get a lot of non-story line material (not much, anyway) and then you get to hear how lame this movie is. Well, don't buy it for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's really nothing better to say in that this film than for a bunch of people to have sex...  How the hell is that a film that has a female protagonist, a female lead, and a female film over 50% male viewers is that kind of film?  So what does that even mean? The film is full of pointless gossensal antics, foul things, and lots of other bad things...  Oh, and the film looks great to look at in that it's about a bunch a gossetsal like this one (I mean, not necessarily male) and you don't get the sense that there's some women in it that you just don't know. I've never even seen such garbage in one of my movies, and it's just really bad. I recommend you don something not like that, like a movie with a lot of really great actors that are just plain boring. If you liked other people like that movie, don't like this... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the movie was scripted, it would have been better. If it was scripted by the directors of the movie, the story would be more interesting. However, when the movie is written, it is incredibly weak, just like a film with a budget that was a hundred times that budget, and is not consistent with the script. And, since it is obviously not scripted, a great director would be allowed to add a few extra moments to the story to make it even less boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot has been established, but there's nothing else. We've seen many stories, but in this particular case there's only two. The first is about an old woman and her daughter, who becomes involved in a relationship with a man, a little man with a body tattoo who's about to get married to another person. The second is about a girl, who discovers her mother's boyfriend is cheating on her. The third one is about the boy's mother and his sister's husband divorces her in the midst of their marriage, and they both start showing up each other's new wife and making strange family moves. The fifth one is just about a kid who is going to try to convince his sister to marry him so he can get into her pants.  The ending is about to be something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film with a lot of bad jokes, bad acting and a very weak plot. I thought it was a movie with more twists, twists and stupid plot twists than there was a plot.  I thought I was watching a movie about a murder ring.  There was no real reason for this movie. It is just a joke. I don't think that I am an idiot for watching this movie because I watched it and didn't really think it was funny. I didn't even see the ending. I guess I could watch it once when I have a clue.  The only good thing was that the characters were real. It was interesting to see different people with a different face, and it made me feel like I was going to have flashbacks.  This movie could have been much better than the others I've seen from the video and TV. If the acting was better I could see it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie a few years ago and thought it was really stupid. It really doesn't make any sense. It was bad, not even the story makes sense, but the actors don't seem like a real person. The way they act is pretty lame. The funny thing about this movie is that the whole time I saw the story was very simple, and in most instances the only way you can interpret it is that you can tell it to yourself. The whole thing seems to be a very simple premise that goes on and on and turns completely ridiculous. The only saving graces I'd say are that the special effects in this movie were really good. This is one of those films that shows the world as an unreal one. In this one, there's some really bad writing. I can't get to the point because I don't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about as a horrible movie to see for a movie: a movie of nothing but some scenes of nothing, nothing, and nothing. The dialog is bad, the acting is terrible, the movie is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, every time a character is mentioned, it's either about a character who has no idea what they're doing or a character whose body is so ripped that the corpse can be believed to have been a corpse. One girl (played by "Sarah Michelle") does a lot of dirty business with a fellow girl who is in for long, in order to get a few bucks. The movie starts when Sarah is talking to a reporter and she tells him about her brother's girlfriend, so he asks her if she has an excuse for being on the road and she gives him a "bump" and gives him the same excuse. He does not see how this happens. It's the same "story" every movie with Sarah and the other characters in it.  This movie seems to have a lot going on, but it really is all about one person and a dead girl and it goes on like a lot, but not the same. The only way out of this was when they stopped driving. The other part was when there were two dead girls in the car. That was the only way I could say that the movie had a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a big fan of sci fiction and you find that kind of stuff hard to find in your film-making... then this is it for you.  This movie was horrible. This movie, along with the movie that was based on a very good movie, gave me nightmares. The fact that this movie was made is also extremely disappointing to me.  The only thing that made this movie worthwhile was the actors who were in the movie. The acting was horrible, there was a lot of stupid acting in the entire movie. Some of the scenes seemed very real and I thought they were real scenes in the book, but they didn't work as well in the TV version of the book.  If I hadn't read the book beforehand I would have believed that this was a very interesting and scary movie. But it was horrible even from the book and I can't believe that it had the same atmosphere and atmosphere that it did in the show.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone who is a huge fan of science fiction or sci-fi. I just would like to see the author's own movie on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am surprised that a movie made at Hollywood studios is so bad and has so much wrong in it that it deserves the label 'awful'. In fact, I'm actually surprised that it's so bad that it got made! I did not even watch this film until I watched it at Cannes in France. In fact I watched "Humbug" at Cannes (which I didn't even have until the day after it's release). If you think that the premise of 'Humbugs' is bad, then you can watch it as a comedy. It is so little, and so one-sided that it doesn't even qualify for being a comedy, so that's a pity. It's hard to admit that this is a terrible film and a waste of money in my opinion. I do wonder if this was made under the influence of the 'Troni' or 'Buck' people, but since it was a bad way to make money, I just couldn't care to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that most of the people who complained about the movie were actually in a situation where the movie was true. I was actually in an extreme situation where a girl was dying of ovarian cancer, I was the father of her, and she was the mother of our children, and I did everything for her, but not everything for my child, and that is all we have done. Now we have some really great actors (like the wonderful Michelle Palfrey and Jennifer Hudson) who deserve their time, but this is a movie that doesn't really do anything. The ending is just the equivalent to "the whole thing" which leaves you to wonder if we are living the same way in this movie as we were in our real lives, or if it is simply the sequel to another movie, and if you're not dead of some disease or another disaster, you'll probably never see it. I do not mean to make fun of this movie, I mean just if you like a "real" movie with some real plot and real characters, don't really like it. You don't have any money, you don't live in a house, don take long trips to the movie set, you have no plans, you are just like everyone else on this planet. Oh! I can't believe that I actually watched that. Oh my God. I cannot believe that was made for a real situation. I wish I didn't think I died after watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What is this movie? The plot, the acting, the directing... This movie has more bad-movie characters than any other I have ever seen. I am sure my rating will be lower than the ones who have made the comments in the negative review of this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I'd go see this film is to see the final performance by the actors, Michael Schindler and Jason Salders. I've read some of their books, but this is not the first time I've seen them. If we're going to see this, I'd be very disappointed. The movie has some good pictures, but they have been so badly done that I have no idea what these people have been called. The writing is also bad. The story of the movie has nothing, except for some very nice shots of "magic" which make this movie almost completely pointless. It just seems like a plot is made of "worse" scenes of "bad". The camera is not really showing the scene of magic; it looks like there is a scene of a magic in the middle of the woods. That's not supposed to happen; this is just a scene that has no scene of that. If you want to see magic, watch "The Secret Magic of the Winter Moon", you'll like it more than magic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a couple who is in bed with a teenage son that they do not even pay for - who turns out to be an axe murderer! - well, that doesn't sound like a fun plot. Even though the acting was good - the acting and directing were not there - well if they had done this it would have been good - but you're not going to like what happened to their family. The story is stupid and the actors don't have much. That's the only thing that gets you excited. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a more intelligent, insightful, and nuanced film with a positive message about life, and that didn't happen.  What I didn't find was even an idea.  I've seen "Life" at the top of the Academy Award for its last 10 years, and it's not a great movie.  The ending is predictable, and the film is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Red Rock 2" is an amateurish effort at making an action movie (with a certain intention to "red-rock"). The movie is bad, but not because of the actors, although they do OK in the small roles. The only good things are the special effects created by a talented group of guys and that makes the movie enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately the camera is not so good in a big picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first question I would like to ask is why in this movie the characters are all so unlotened in the way they are portrayed by the script.   What I think about this movie is the way it has to go before it's noticed and where it stops. This is not like a bad Hollywood film, but it can become just a bad film. The first half of the movie revolves around one man who has a gun and shoots at an entire group of people and then everyone on the floor tries to escape to another location and is at least the worst kind of movie that I have ever seen.  It is pretty bad to see so many scenes of nothing but pointless. They have to be in their own rooms of their own and there are some weird effects throughout the movie which are pretty annoying to watch.  You also wonder if there was a reason for this.  That is the main reason I'm rating this at a 1, but I think that is probably the best case for this film.  The ending of the film is really bad. In the beginning the film sets up and begins to set things up in a way to help the storyline but then, the film goes on. It just is a story and the characters just get more and more boring. The movie is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the same vein that the original one had a lot of plot and story. In this one the only thing that made the film was the idea of a girl who falls pregnant. This girl then proceeds to find a man, who is very handsome, who he could love, only to be stabbed by his fiancée, who then runs off to fight another woman and kills her. The killer then kills her, and then, to avoid detection, he starts to kill the girl's mother. It's quite strange and unbelievable for this supposedly a guy to get killed by a woman he likes. I mean, it's like a guy would kill a chick, and it's a girl killer? How? Where in the hell does this guy get it? The only thing I can say is that it is not scary at all. If you liked the original version, then you would probably like it more. However, as I said earlier, it doesn't even make up a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is a bit absurdly convoluted.  There are two types of people in the movie, one of them is a villain who uses her power to "treat" people. I mean, "treating people" is not the main focus of this film, so why do it so badly?  The villains of this must have some basic knowledge about how to kill people, and the way in which to do it. I thought these people had a really hard time killing people.  The ending is terrible, but this was supposed to be a thriller. The acting was terrible and I felt the characters were flat.  As a result, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has a bad ending. If I would watch this film, I would find myself in the theater's front seats with an empty chair.  I am surprised to see so many people reading this film and believing that it's a good one. If this movie was an episode of the "The Real Housewives" or "Witches" series, then you would be right. But it isn't. This is just a stupid movie. It's really no good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had the potential of being a very interesting film but, in an effort to make something more enjoyable that it couldn't really accomplish, it failed. The movie's first half is predictable and then falls apart. The ending is just terrible. I guess I'm not that old, but I have seen worse than that before, and I don't know what would make me think that. The director's ideas were very good, and it should have been allowed to be the first movie out.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie made by a mediocre writer (probably an incompetent writer) and a very bad director who is only able to express his opinion by writing a bad piece of literature. The story is pretty predictable. Very predictable and pretty disappointing.  The good part is the humor and the fact that the director wanted to make a story about it's title. It can't be compared to "The Big Sleep" if you consider the latter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Munch" is a very bad movie. The idea is to create a "humanistic, female" horror film by using the idea that the victims will be forced to wear a plastic body and eat human flesh. The film does not come off well. The acting is poor and the script is bad. The whole film is simply very bad. Not only does it seem to be filmed entirely in a camera inside the body of a female, it isn't even remotely credible. If we were to make a horror film that was similar to this, then it would be a real mess. I won't say anything negative about it. But I'm sure it is one of the worst films in film history. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just a horrible pile of moronic gore to put into the movies of every one of my friends. This is a movie that I can see no reason why it got anywhere near to any of my eyes. It is absolutely painful to see some of the actors pretending to be the great Jean-Dominique, and we should not have to see the great French movie with her.  I am really glad that this film has been taken off due to the stupidity of the director. This film just lacks something so much of its own making, and for that reason we cannot hold onto her as an icon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. The plot is not good. The supporting cast was lousy. The acting was so bad it was unbearable. I never found a good movie but this is no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film a few years ago and I just didn't care. I am not going to sit through it. I'll just state that it isn't pretty good, even for kids. This is the biggest piece of low budget film I've seen. But I guess that's the kind of film that you might actually enjoy seeing (because you're so tired and stupid you don't care).  It's pretty basic, but I'll be honest and say I just hated it. Some of the acting was pretty good. Some, though. But the story is pretty basic. It's hard to see the characters themselves.  The story is a little confused. The characters are stupid. They don't act like characters in real life. The plot is confusing. It isn't explained. It just looks like there's some strange aliens in it. There is not really any plausible reason for this. The film does get a bit better when the alien is killed. But then the aliens are left behind, and I guess this is all too much for some kids, who are just going along too fast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess, what happened to Adam? I'm very disappointed, but it's not like it's something new: The movie was a waste of your time. I expected a different movie from the first one.  The script was awful. It was so predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just a sad story - a very old and very bad movie.  The whole premise was that the kids would be saved if they discovered that the village had been lost and was now being targeted by the evil tribe in the other side of the world. The movie ends with some of the villagers becoming monsters in their dark world, killing everyone, leaving the remaining tribe...but they're not monsters in the real world, they're human beings and this is all the same as an example of a TV show where the villain was the villain. The main villain is a monster, not to mention the "evil" tribe that is involved with the movie. I couldn't care for this type of movie unless it was a short, so bad it couldn't be any worse than just a cheap movie. Maybe if they made the kids a race to start off the way it would be a better story, but I don't think that would ever be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really the worst of the six films I watched last year. If you watched them, you will be bored with the actors, but the plot didn't flow with anything. I can't say it was pretty bad, but I have seen some bad films. Some of those are better than others, and some are just terrible, but this is definitely one of the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a movie that can be easily seen by anyone who doesn't understand the concept of a "movie", that is, a movie whose title is, I suppose, "The Secret Movie". A bad movie, basically a cheap comedy about a horrible plot, a horribly clichéd and predictable premise, and an utterly predictable plot that is completely insincere and boring. The good part is that, unlike the other B movies I had just seen, "Secret Movie" was actually fun to watch, and a movie with a decent plot and plot development.  In terms of the film, it could have been quite different. This film was actually a little bit funny. But unfortunately the film does not go far enough in that direction. I mean, really. You can't just throw in a random plot.   The plot itself is pretty vague and even quite predictable. We don't get a lot of insight from the film in an hour. But I wouldn't really blame the filmmakers for that.  But overall, "secret movie" is only mediocre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie. Even worse than the film that made this one. Some actors in it were good, and even though some of them were in it, they were in a bad slacker. And the fact that the movie was so poorly written and directed was probably the only reason why I gave it two stars. But then I had to assume the actors had done some good acting. The ending was so bad that it just made me feel sorry for the writer. There were a few actors that did a decent job. But they were just in a mess. The plot was too weak to continue as a comedy movie. The characters in the film were too shallow. I just thought they should be making this more funny than just trying to make a comedy comedy film, and they just didn't make that happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack album. What was it that they had written that was so bad? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is horrible, not only in its story but in its special effects. The "tail on" scene (and many others) is not only bad for its failure in acting but also in its failure to actually demonstrate the magic of magic and the magic that exists in the rest of the movie. There's also an awful sense of "campy" to the film. That's not to mention the horrible script; I guess the filmmakers were hoping to do something similar to this film. I don't know why they thought so. I just can't believe that they would actually go through the process of trying to make something more like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those films that relies solely on the plot, and that was the only reason for the "hail" in the name. (I didn't really understand that for a while.) There is very little plot. We just have a plot.  The "hails" are "human" and the "humans" are human "hives". This is the only way the film treats these two groups, and the characters aren't even human.  We are left without any characters or anything to help us with the struggle between these groups.  A lot of that is supposed to be about a woman who is having her son taken into a pit as a way to protect him. I don't know if that's supposed to happen in the "movie", as there aren't any scenes with the woman, nor any scenes from the "woman" leaving her son in prison, and I don%it only have the "man" in this movie, and even that seems like it has no character to help either of his parents.  As I said, the film tries to introduce something that isn't going to make sense to anybody, so you need to read the book instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem is not really that people are sick of American culture and people need to watch this movie. What is this film really doing? I didn't think so, but if I were to guess I would guess it. This is very reminiscent of a film from the 1990s that is obviously completely out of place (not even the US). It's not even trying to be original or even remotely interesting. I'm just tired of having to read about this movie and have to pay money to buy it because I knew that it was a crap piece of crap. I was very disappointed in this film, but perhaps if the director would just sit in a room and write this type of movie every time he was a big star at the right age it could have a different storyline. Maybe that was the idea. There was some hope in the late 60's that Hollywood would be able to do something with this type, but it seems that has never happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best movie: I would say that it isn't quite the best and is, in fact, not good. It's not a very good movie, but I have enjoyed it very little. It isn't really funny, not as bad as I anticipated. The plot is the usual, as usual, but it isn`t funny. I have a lot of time in my hands and I think this is not funny. You will see some very annoying jokes like "the bad little son" while you have seen it countless times. The film has no plot, it just is a very weak plot. The whole story is a non-story and only does not even make much sense. I guess, like the other reviewers this has some pretty good actors and I don`t really know what they did. Perhaps it`s something like a fantasy movie, some sort of movie, that is the only way I can see this movie. Perhaps the plot could have been improved with some action, but this was not needed. As usual, most of the characters don`T seem to make sense. For example, one of the guys is a thief who is a big killer of his own and that guy goes back to visit him in a very strange house. It is a house with big furniture. This house is very strange, there is no windows so he can see the other people, there are only houses on it. The movie is very very dark and is just about a silly movie. Even the music is not good, which is just very bad. You never know what songs are in this movie and the dialog is completely incomprehensible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a piece of trash that really doesn't make a lot of sense. It's just about a big house with a bunch of kids in a backyard and a bunch more kids and a couple of cars.  It doesn't seem like it's made any sense. I guess they really thought this was a film which I wouldn't really believe in. I mean, what happens is that they're having a party, and it's that they have to move through the house, as they enter into a basement or attic. But they've got some good action and music to make this a comedy movie, but they need to keep people looking to get the heck of them.  And the acting was awful. It was just like I saw in a bunch with a lot more people. There's just too much stupid stuff happening, and they seem to be able to act it in a manner that is really ridiculous. It just seems so fake and stupid.  This movie was so bad it's funny. But I thought it was just about as stupid as this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about a bunch of losers who, while shooting and singing, all decide to shoot someone who has recently been evicted from a nursing home in Canada and is also being pursued by the cops. This is, in essence, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no way to get past the "twelve hours" after which it is supposed to be over. Even after the other actors have been kicked out, the movie is left to you to determine who's doing the real work. If I had a clue for where the real characters were, I would have done some research and it would have been a lot more interesting. There are a few supporting actors who are in the movie, but as with any other movie, it's just about the same actors that you've never heard of and the rest of the film is pretty much identical to it.  The ending (which I have only seen one time, although I saw it two times) is not so dramatic. The dialogue is flat and the movie tries to take the whole thing into a comedy zone and fails to deliver. It's not very funny. Not a bad a bad performance, although it does not do much more for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely predictable, and unfortunately the ending did not save this movie. What you get is only two scenes - in the shower and in the bedroom of the apartment - which are completely pointless. In both scenes it was obvious that the people in each scene knew exactly where they were, and they looked like they had been living there for a long time. However the actors seem to do quite alright in this movie, but then they all act like they were having fun. At one point you hear a female saying, "I don't even have a good nose". On the side, when it is over it's a male who tells you that she has a good mouth and it's got a good laugh. Then at another point you get to see some of the other actors being the "fugitive" with some stupid jokes. When it is done it's just a horrible, boring piece of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few people like to see this film. It looks like a funny film with bad acting, bad jokes, and bad story. What was this film? A bunch of old guys in a cave and a bunch of women fighting one of them. What were they? The guys or the women? Well, how did we know this was a movie: a bunch who looked like a bunch that don't even knew what they were. If you're familiar with this film, you'll see why they are so stupid. If the movie is supposed to be about something, then it doesn't matter how much you know about it. I'd give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have ever seen from this year. The plot is a little disappointing, but it's worth looking at it anyway as a bad waste of time. The acting is bad, the setting is terrible. The music is bad. The fact that this movie actually sells for a nickel is sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason that I liked this film was the scene where John Lennon is screaming at his wife's mother. Why would the director even decide to include such a moment? The scene is a nightmare from the start, but you just want the scenes to be there so you're glad to see them, and then you just wish they would stay. If I had more time I would have written a positive review about it:  As a result, this film can only be described as a waste of time to me. While it's fun to listen to Lennon's wacky, it is terrible to watch. There is no real characters in the film except for one woman who is so hot and so annoying that you have to wonder whether she will ever have the same kind of role. The only thing you can save is time to hear Lennon's songs and songs. It can't even make up for the fact that the songs in the movie just weren't as good as they were for the songs from the actual Beatles. Also, a certain musical group is so horrible that they were the only music in the whole movie. It makes me wonder if these guys actually have any idea what they're singing to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing good, except the good part where it turns out to be a movie (or in the case of the movie itself, the video was the movie).  But this movie did nothing for the beginning. I didn't like it at first. I had heard about the "Karen".  This isn't like anything i've ever seen before, but I can't say that. It's a bit predictable, like a movie from the late seventies where there are some scenes that make it clear that the characters will never act normally. The scenes in the movie are pretty much the same, and all of the characters are the same boring clichés and clicheness of the film. I think it's a bad joke to have a movie named "Kareen", in the hope that it will get some better reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it's almost a comedy. There is a movie entitled "The Family" where a bunch of kids are going to try to build a house that is supposed to be their home, but they are so lousy they can't even begin to build it. The funny scenes are about kids trying to get money for a fake movie called "Ballskin" and the real movie is about kids who are really rich (they have tons of money) who are pretending to be rich and they want to get a bunch to do something they never wanted to do. They are trying to build something, but that doesn't work because they need money. The only thing that is fun is for kids to put it on their heads. They can't afford a lot of money, so they are playing out all sorts of crazy ways and doing things they shouldn't be doing anyway. They just want to watch their parents make fun videos and not be their parents. The ending is pretty bad. The real movie was so bad I won't even think of doing this movie unless I was going to work on a bunch about kids. I am surprised they got a "A" on this movie and it shows how stupid it is, but I have seen it for so long that I couldn't believe it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this, I couldn't believe that anyone, ever made a film like this in a film. I'm sure there are more people than me who would be highly satisfied with this movie. But unfortunately it's only made because they wanted to use it in some way as a film for a class discussion. That is really sad.  The plot is too predictable, and it has very little substance. The acting was really bad. It was just a matter of who was the actor. It would be better if they would have made more actors.  If you have any interest in a movie: Don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A simple synopsis of a bad Hollywood movie, it's about a couple of guys going off on a trip, then getting a little more deeply involved with each other. The main two characters are two sisters (Bimini and Miriam). Miriam is older than Bimini, but she's pretty good with a lot of other skills and she's a pretty good dancer. The other guy is a young guy named Adam, who wants to follow Bimi. But Bimii has her daughter Miriam to get him to do something. The movie is about falling in love with her, and the brother is supposed to have fallen in love, and she falls in love. But she doesn't fall in love... but then falls in an incestuous way, and gets caught in a house... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the first two episodes of this film, I was so disgusted that my jaw was about to close down the channel and have this piece of garbage dumped in to show me that "the world is actually a utopia!" If this film has been in existence since 2001 then it's all we got to see and it isn't even a true utopia. This movie is so bad, I can't blame it for the title, but I couldn't bring myself to it. A movie about a fictional utopia where nothing is true and everything is "just like every other." Even the characters can't escape reality since they are made up of their own delusions. I know how they can do a plot line to make this into a movie without the usual "in a utorpion" storyline. They must make a positive statement about a real utopia and how it is created. A plot line that is not even a full story and just an attempt to portray reality is doomed to be cancelled. I mean, if you can believe in the fact that the whole planet (and the rest of the world) is not only about the existence of the Earth, but a fantasy, it's hard to believe that people could care more about something like that. I really think that this movie is only to be viewed on the television channel. It's a waste of money since this movie will not be shown on any channel I'm on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie features a bad plot, bad plot (mostly bad), a decent actor (not even the really good actor and the movie could have made), a couple of bad scenes and a couple good scenes (or should have been better). This movie is an embarrassment to me. I'm really, really, the only person who thinks that it is a good movie. It was only 2.5 hours of film and I didn't like it. I would have given it a 10 out of 10 if it weren't the terrible, awful, slow, boring ending that it actually is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the film had come out a couple of years ago and even had a cast and some sets, it would be fine. However, it doesn't. In this film it just seems like I am looking at the beginning of some sort of a movie.  The acting was horrible, the dialog was just awful, and the film just doesn't get the hang of. I have to admit, the film did catch on to its own, but I never liked to waste my time watching it.  Overall, you're better off looking for a better movie: "B" and not "B". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is only the second worst movie ever made in history. What was the big reason? The story was boring and the actors weren't convincing enough to make the audience care. There is no suspense in the storyline and no real mystery to keep us guessing. This is all because of the characters that are forced to keep up the story line and then, in the end, we have to decide what we want to see and it becomes painfully predictable. The acting was bad, the camera was too slow and the sets were too slow to even make the film. There was only one scene that seemed real - a scene where a lady is having sex with a mysterious, white woman. The girl can only do that in a sequence that lasts only about one minute. The only thing that was interesting in this movie was the fact that it was about a woman and not about a husband and a son. This movie just seems like it was made because of a romantic couple - a married couple. I thought it would be interesting if they had two separate sets with completely different actors and were the people playing both roles. There would be no mystery and everything would be confusing and confusing. I couldn't believe this movie ever existed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason that this film has turned out so badly is that the director has turned into a person with a very big ego. Even his previous films have been quite good, and this film is not just the worst but the biggest waste of all time. Although the director can get a lot of screen time, he never really gets anywhere. There's only about a 2-3 minutes of his screen time that is really worth mentioning. This is a bad way to spend a lot time editing something that doesn't need to be filmed. The best thing is a better name like "The Office" if you want to make a film about an office. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely predictable. A lot of very predictable lines, lines, and reactions. Even the most predictable line ("I can tell I have a brain"), is pretty bad. And there are too many moments of "huh, oh, I guess, so my guess!" in a line that is pretty predictable (like "Oh, what do I know?") and this is just the standard Hollywood "sus" line. Even when something is obviously planned, it just doesn't make it work. I'm just looking at the most part to make sure I'm not getting totally stupid and making myself sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a very short description of the movie: "The Girl From Behind," which has been billed as "the best ever made gay-ish film ever made. But it's just an awful film: It's not quite good, but it just lacks in many details to make the film interesting. Even the plot is lacking. The girl who was being pursued by a stranger (played by her sister) and has to do something to convince her sister.  The two sisters are so dumb, they start kissing, making love and going crazy, but the end just starts sucking. There's only one sex scene that takes place in the hospital, and you can only find one. It's bad for a few minutes in the film, but there is one that takes two minutes to get to the point. The rest of the story is nothing but bad.  If you're a viewer who wants to waste money on this, you might want to keep it. But you won't find that much in it, and I can't say anything about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second episode of a long, strange and bad plot-line, and the only show of a season that isn't actually written. I don't have any more details, but the episode is definitely the worst I have ever seen. I have no idea what it is about, except the word 'no' repeated in the script. The story is about a man with a tattoo on his chest who wants to help people who aren't supposed to be his friends, so he has to go to the library and find out who is really friends. Of course, he doesn't get a shot at his girlfriend, and eventually he is killed. He then has to find out someone who is supposed to save him. So, yeah, he can use this guy to help his wife, but who are you supposed to do that? We are supposed to get in a car with this guy, and then you find out that he was the guy who killed his wife. Why was he doing that? Who can say? The ending is totally predictable.  I can't say why he was killed, because he was so easily killed anyway. This is also the first episode of an unusual plot-story which is usually terrible. A long, convoluted plot is the only thing that should be done in a good way, but this one is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad I just couldn't let it stay. I laughed like a cat!  A movie where the characters are just faking out in a movie for a fake movie is just plain stupid. How does one person get such a ridiculous, lame performance by this movie???  I had a fun time watching the movie but the whole thing just seemed stupid and pointless. The director just seemed like he wanted to make a film out of one moment of failure while making a movie that only lasted for one moment.  A few minutes of the movie I didn't even feel like I could continue watching it but I don't believe it matters. You're going to watch it for someone who is a big fan of sports like soccer, but you might not be enjoying it the same way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen from this year. A few things that were good in it went bad. First, the characters in this movie are like the characters from "Sister Smile" with some slight improvement. The plot is so bad that I had no idea what the characters were going to do. The story is bad. In a bad way that it is hard to find the end of the movie! In this movie, the family's father is going to kill the children at the Christmas Eve festival because he is mad. Then the father's wife dies in a tragic manner. The mother tries to do something in a way to save the family, but the result is that she dies alone in a car accident. Also, I was disappointed that "Rippers" was used as a family drama. It is a shame that people used to make the same type of movies as they used to making the "Fade in Paris" movie for a while. The other stars in "Ripper" are OK, the actor who played the father of the family was OK, and the father was OK too. But the actors in this film are really bad. They are not used in the way that they should be used. If you liked the movie before I guess this was made, you may be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very intrigued with this movie, but unfortunately it is only a one-thirty minute effort on my part, so if you find it enjoyable you are on the brink of getting brainwashed. This is the dumbest movie I've seen in this category. Although the film isn't very intelligent, the plot does make sense, so they have to have some kind of plot. But it doesn't. The characters were really bad. The movie is really bad, but there is something funny about the movie: The title, "Chimmy", is not original. It is clearly a parody of a couple of popular sitcoms. But this joke isn't funny. It's really awful. The humor is lame. I can't figure why there is so much material for a comedy movie: a movie like this is completely pointless, even the "comedy" (or "paddle") comic. I would have to see this movie again in a few times to really see it funny. The story is pretty good, but nothing good in the slightest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's bad to say that this film is based on some famous fairy tale, which are now out of print. For example, the main villain of the film is a wicked old girl who kidnaps the girl's father and steals him money by magic! She doesn't go through the trouble for the story or the characters (they are important characters anyway) and she has never got in to a real girl. The best thing about this film might be the idea of an old lady (named "Alice" and played by Maria von Derzigle) with a large nose and a huge chest and who is in charge of the royal court of England. The film is so terrible that you don't think that it could actually happen. It looks like a big pile of cardboard box houses, but a movie based on a fairy tale would not actually make. I have never been in England before (it's in the north), so I can't say it would not be as bad as it is. Also, I don't know that this is really a fairy story, but it is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have a sense that this is actually a movie. I just have no idea what was really supposed to be going on in this movie. When I am in the mood for a comedy, this movie isn't. I never watch movies like this. They always are just the same crap. The acting is pretty terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a lot of bad jokes. In one scene, when a guy tries to pick up a pretty girl, she tells him to "Get him back again, this time for his benefit". Other parts are pretty good, but after the first few minutes, the joke becomes boring and it doesn't get any better. It just sort of disappears. This movie is also about a girl who has been kidnapped by a guy and she kills him.  I thought it was a really good idea at the beginning and could have been a really interesting comedy if made for a real movie. But then after the rest of the movie you wonder why there is no real ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing like a movie, or anything else. The film is so bad that you can barely believe it's even a movie. It's so bad it doesn't even make a mention. We can't wait for the next "big" film, I can't believe how cheap this movie was made. The story is so weak that it is the least interesting part. This movie only appears to be a short film, but I have seen it so many times and have never gotten that many minutes. I have lost interest in it. I'm sure it's a movie made in the USA, but it's not worth watching. At least it had some value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this show for about 3 days and after i knew nothing i had to watch it. Not only was this poor-looking but also not believable. The story is nothing new. There was absolutely no plot. The characters were a collection of actors who acted like one of those actors in a soap-operation. This would not have seemed out of a James Spader flick. The only thing that i enjoyed was the soundtrack. I think I can't blame the filmmakers for the acting in this movie. There is some funny bits, but not the entire plot. I hope if there are people who can tell me how to make this movie, that I will make sure they are not paying any money for this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. It is not even that bad. I guess that is what you get when a bad Hollywood movie is made. I am not a critic, but a person that likes to watch this sort of crap doesn't have the common sense to be such. The first thing that I did on watching it was the fact that the guy was obviously trying to "sneak off" with another girl. There was no point of seeing him on another chick. This is really just awful. It has all of the wrong qualities that are typical of movies made today. The "clothed" action scenes, which are supposed to be "the best" are just plain terrible. Even for a big, multi-dollar production house like Universal, this was really bad. The plot is extremely weak. It's just so bad, because you get a bunch of people together on the beach and then some of them try to "clifford the lines" of "sister". If you are one of those people, you will feel sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a really annoying movie: "The Fraction" has a very stupid plot that has no substance. Why should this be in a movie? The movie is so bad it's funny, but the people actually put it together. In fact, I think that the movie had to have come out at some point. And I was wondering if this movie was made as a real film. The characters in it are just not believable. They aren't able to act like any real people. It's just very slow, which is very important in this movie. If I'd like a movie with real people, this would be a totally different movie than a cheap one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend and a couple of people we've been friends with on a trip from France saw it on HBO just a couple weeks ago. I am looking for the sequel and I don't want to see anything else. This was obviously made with no knowledge of English. That's really disappointing, especially when it was so badly put together. I never found it to be very interesting or interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has nothing but ridiculous plot and ridiculous performances. A movie like this was a waste of money. The actors were just terrible. Most of the scenes were very predictable. For example, the story of a little girl who fell in love with the son of one of the actors. This is so horrible to see, that I had to hold my eyes to the camera, and wonder why the actor put himself in such a position. The only time I can laugh in this film is when the camera zoom in on him to make the scene. The story is too predictable and the acting is bad. You get a little bit of enjoyment from the actors in their little roles, but you don't have the same fun when they play their parts in real life. The movie had no story or plot, but instead a story that was very predictable, and this is no guarantee either. If you were hoping for a story, you would have been better of a movie: I would not even see it in the slightest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Dark Castle" was a bad film. There was nothing new about it. But it seemed like it was an excuse to try and put it into an "action" movie. This was a little disappointing. The ending is predictable and the action sequences were very weak. I gave this a 1 because there was a lot of interesting story and it did have a lot in it, but it failed to gel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is so terrible, it really is bad. it would have been better if they had made a movie that was better than this one... the plot is so pathetic. there is no reason for anyone to go to that theater and watch this movie! this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. this movie looks like a movie made of a cartoon "Rinburger" that tries to go beyond the rules of the genre, and then is very boring, and the characters are just completely useless, it's extremely predictable. The ending was totally lame. there was nothing in the story, nothing went right. I could not believe that this movie would make this many people go and see it.  I'm just too tired of seeing crap like this. The plot of this movie was really terrible, I don't recommend watching it if you like horror films or if you have never even heard horror films. if you really want to see a good horror movie, you can watch the "The Possessed" movie on youtube, but you can wait until the movie is completely finished and you will probably never see it again. this is the WORST horror movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie is always a bad thing...  When "Preludo" is released, I expected a movie that would be good. When the movie is released it is nothing but a dumb waste of money. I was hoping I would be a fan of the movie but unfortunately I couldn't wait for it to reach the minimum $9.9 million. I mean really, I thought this movie was going to be good! I mean if we had seen it for a while, I guess we would have enjoyed it more but I don't care about it.  So, after the premiere I am disappointed. Why waste a lot of money on such a bad film. I know you'll love the movie because it was a good one, but unfortunately, you can't enjoy it. If you want to watch "PRELudo", then see it in another movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I don't think it was meant to be a horror film, but there is no real story. It's about a teacher who takes a sex worker and rapes her after a drunken night of whiskey & cocaine. The teacher rapes his student, but then keeps her out of his hair.   I just want to see more. I find that "Dawkers" is the least interesting thing in this movie. It is a horrible movie. I found it completely disgusting, even the nudity scenes made me shudder. And no real message at all. It seems to be based on a TV movie but I don`t know why they call it a movie.  If you want to watch "The Devil Wives", it is about a couple who really are demons. But there is nothing to do with them, they just want you to have a really fun time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am writing a positive review about bad film:  As the title says, the "Mystery Mall" is a bad film in a bad genre, which is a shame because it is not unlike the other great films that are out there. I didn't get much from it and I don't know what to do with it because, as always, it seems like a story that doesn't have a point.  I think it could have saved the film with all of the songs that were used in the film and the fact that this was supposedly the fourth installment of the movie franchise. It is difficult to say what would have been the best song for the film, but I'm guessing that it would have a message to "save the world". I just can't seem to believe that there was a message that couldn't be delivered. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of those movies that makes a bad name known, but it keeps going after it has done so well that it stays forgotten. I mean, in order to be the only movie that comes out for the whole night, you would have to have done something different, so it just doesn't fit the formula. If it was done right, it would be interesting and a fun way to entertain the audience. But it is a total waste of time in a really bad way. It has absolutely nothing to do with it. It's just one of two uninteresting movies made in the world this year. And I'm not the only one who thinks it's uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is awful, it's just the worst I've seen. A lot of stuff you can watch in this film for free (or even free). But then the fact that this is bad made the story even better. I didn't get it and I can't really see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i really have no patience for this trashy movie. It is so cheap, i really don't know how much it cost to make this movie. If anyone with any sense of talent would even attempt to see this movie, PLEASE DON'T DO IT! It's just too boring. I've had several friends tell me that I need to see it, but i'm so far done that i don't care. The only thing i had a clue to was the fact that the "jail" was being killed. I think it's a good thing for "Rabbin" and "Rabin" but this movie has absolutely nothing to do with real life and is really just the "spoon" on the mouth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is that if a child is a genius, they can take that experience into a big city and become a big-city cop. However, the cop is a "super cop", and the other two characters are cops on paper, the two have to find their super cop so that they can make money on another. The story is so bad it is laughable. The cops are so incompetent that the whole movie is just about the ineptitude of all their partners. The only part of this movie that I can see is when the three of the cop's in charge of their own car, and they all just get it back together again. They don't even get it together like they do in the TV show, and there's really no way for that situation to happen. Even if you are a person that is really, really big into car-cams, you don't need to spend the rest of your life doing this crap. A lot of people do this stuff anyway, and it's funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the end, I got so disgusted that I couldn't believe it had actually been made. Not only that, but the whole thing just made me shudder.  So, I had to watch it because I couldn`t believe it was actually an actual movie. I watched it because it was so disgusting and just plain bad that I was unable to stand it. The way the movie was filmed in that part was just painful and the horrible images of little girl on the road, little girl getting into cars and going in to restaurants, little boy getting in a restaurant and all the car rides, and all in all, really scary pictures of car rides and car rides I've seen for years.  The only thing I would say I loved was the end. I couldn\'t find my car back. I had no idea where my car was. I was never sure. I tried and tried to locate my car and I never found it. There really was something else there. I thought it would have been someone in my car in my apartment. But, that was it. I did not know how I would have seen my car. And if I could find that car, I might have seen a picture of it, but that would not be my car either. It had gone to someone else at least, and the only thing was not a picture. I never heard anything about that car. It was only made because someone else, I thought, was going to rent it. So, if you think I might be able to rent that movie, you could rent it for free. The thing was actually made of a car. I mean, that car would be my family car. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I think you can tell when a film like this is going to be awful, I guess it's all too predictable and predictable. If you want to be entertained, you'll be in for a lot of torture. The story is not a big surprise to anyone who has followed it. For someone with the slightest bit of intelligence who saw it, it didn't work. For the average viewer, it was impossible to follow. The acting was not very good. You know why a good actor would not do this - it's not a comedy.  You need to watch the first part of the film if you want entertainment. I know there's plenty of people in that situation, but they aren't getting much here.    The story itself was a little bit interesting. For a movie that uses a word which is normally not a word, it's pretty interesting. Unfortunately, the story did not stay as interesting as it needed.  The movie could have been done better. There were some interesting moments, but it didn`t get there, especially with some of the characters.  We have seen this kind of film in several movies, and this movie is no exception. The problem is that this movie doesn`t do anything to create interest. If anything, you don't want to spend your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very weak, but I'd like to say, I've seen it many times. The story is very predictable, the dialogue is weak, and it's just a bunch of old songs. While watching it, I was annoyed to have to wait several hours for everything to go into the movie, and I did most of the scenes in a very slow way. However, there are some good things in it. I liked some parts (the ending and ending of the movie are good) but the rest just seems a bit too "naked". There also seems like they might be making some other scenes more serious, but at the same time, the songs are so lame and unbelievable, that I didn't even find it worth watching. This movie only takes a few minutes and a minute to finish. There are good lines, but it just feels like they were made in the school cafeteria. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen many better movies than this one. The first one was The Housekeeping and the second one was "The Expendables". But I still believe that this film is a terrible film. It has a ridiculous plot, stupid characters, stupid dialogue, stupid acting and a ridiculous lack of real acting. Also, I can't really believe that it is so hard to survive this film. As a big fan of "The X-Files", I must admit that the fact that this movie is about a little girl and a little boy is what we are looking for. You don't get an actor who is a famous for her acting and make a movie about her. You get a one who is famous for making movies and making movies that are about her acting, but you don't make her famous by making her famous for acting. The plot is simply bad, but not funny. It is too bad that this was made. The acting is so bad that it can't be even compared with other movies: the acting was too good, the characters were too bad and the story was bad! The plot did manage to get a little bit more and some of the dialog was interesting (but in this case, I guess the plot is better than the script). But in the end, the plot and the characters are only marginally more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't help feeling that the entire plot was completely illogical. Not only were the characters, the plot, and the characters themselves, completely illogany. The plot does not make any sense. The characters in the movie don't seem to be one-dimensional characters, and their motivations don't make any real sense. I can see the main character as having little or no life. He seems to be nothing more than a drabble of his life. A great deal of the action is pointless, and not even a couple lines. It is very difficult to see how the characters ever found out that they were in trouble or anything like that.  The main cast is also pretty bad. They are just like the people in the first film, but in the latter, you can tell they are so obviously fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After I watched the original movie, I thought that "Molly" was a true horror film, as I always felt it to be. However, when I learned how it wasn't a horror film that I was supposed to enjoy, I couldn't believe it. It doesn't really make sense or even work. I couldn tell that the way it ends was actually supposed to be done, which is what a lot of people don't seem to understand. The plot was so poor I had to read the book and read in the book, and I just can't believe anyone had a clue to the storyline. I just wanted to shut my mouth and see this movie over and over. I only made it twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like one of those movies that I've seen before, "Funny Farm" (even though this is a re-make of it) and "Munch Boy." In that case, both of those shows, I felt no pity for the cast. There was no way they could pull off this movie. The first one was pretty funny and had a pretty good message. But this one is nothing. The story really revolves around the town of Fairville, which is full of stupid people and people who are so stupid that they don't have the ability to be funny. The idea of the town was to create a "social" community with a local group, complete with a church and a bunch of friends, and then populate the town by having a bunch go on a trip to Africa. So far, there's nothing about it. We can't help but be disappointed with the ending. I mean, is there any hope here that this will be more effective than the original "Fool Farm?" The two kids are going to be in trouble with the local people for the first 50 minutes? There's a kid in this movie and he's going to take care of the elderly people and have them forever, and that's not a good thing. Then they turn into a bunch to go off to Africa together to save the world's environment? It's not going to happen. The whole thing just revolves around that stupid town. There's nothing that can be done with that place and nothing in it does anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was poorly written. There was a lot of non-fascinating lines that added no value to the film. There were some nice moments, but they were simply not good enough to warrant the entire film. The plot was weak, the characters were just the same, and most importantly were the cinematography, which wasn't good either.   If this movie was a movie, I would have really enjoyed it. However, the fact that this movie isn't one would make me mad, because it is simply awful. Avoid this one at all costs. If you like a nice movie, you should avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the opening statement of the review:  Ohhhh.. I am so sick of people making this movie. I have read the book and nothing comes close to this movie, the movie was a failure and the writer tried to get the audience to go. Not only that, but the movie just does not work. Not a movie, it is a non-story line. I can only conclude that it will not work if it is made.  The ending, the plot and the ending of the movie are not good. It just is a horrible movie. The plot is nothing, it did not make sense.  I just cannot believe that this movie is not made by the writer or writer, I guess, because it could have been so much better with a good storyline. I guess the writer didn't know that making a movie like this is so hard. You get a movie made like this without a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty good, though a little bit thin. However the lack of real characters is just ridiculous. The fact that some of the kids are older than me makes this all much less amusing.  That said, it is pretty funny. I mean that. There's a lot of humor, but there's just too much to see. The acting is very poor, and the acting in the early episodes was good but very poor. Overall, it's just not a fun way to look at a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. The plot is not interesting, neither are the actors. The most disappointing thing about this movie is the fact that I don't have any idea what happened to the rest of the characters. I don; I had no idea that we went down a couple miles. Even if you want to try and tell us what happened after it all, you can't help us do that because we never see it. This movie really should be on the list of the worst movies ever made. It's like having a bad dream. It can't really have any effect if you go in there and then decide to wake up in a sleep that's more horrible. I was really, really ashamed for myself that I sat there and watched this movie because I'm so scared about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My thoughts on this are, 'I don't have a sense of humor like that'. I'm a big fan of the late "Star Trek", and this film doesn't even make sense in that regard, and you can pretty much guess what happens with the characters. Even with a decent cast, it is a pretty predictable story and not even funny. The only time this film was released was in 1981, so there's a chance there are people watching this film decades ago. The cast was made so incredibly bad that they couldn't make a movie. I've never seen it so bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had this film twice and watched it, and although I knew better films that would have been good, I didn't buy it. The movie is bad. Not funny, but not good. The plot is the worst I've ever seen. No plot. It is weak and the characters aren't very believable. This is probably the worst movie I've seen of 2014. The most disappointing part is that the only redeeming quality is the director. If it is true, it is bad (as I mean the movie).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with the story of a black girl in a big-bucks restaurant. The scene starts to become bizarre and confusing. Then the "story" continues and the movie becomes a "reaction" that has no idea what is going on. A few scenes seem to have had some plot and they appear to be "real" scenes with the characters running around in an office. But it's so poorly developed and there is no way to communicate what is happening at any moment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My guess is that this is a retelling of The Road and a spin off from that. But the main problem is the storyline. It isn't too complicated, but the characters are all confused. In the first, they were at an Italian wedding where the bride was Italian, and in the second, they are all Italian guys. The plot is just okay, but when the main character goes back to Italy, there isn't even a word on his mouth.  My only complaints are the fact that the scene where they're talking about the wedding is a big shot from Italy - and the plot has nothing to do with Italy's culture.  A good way to avoid this movie is to go ahead and buy the DVD, and put it on a DVD tray. You can get it for about a tenth of the price of The Return. It would also be a more interesting movie if the other characters in Italy had a bigger plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about a madman, with a large machine that would destroy all of the human race, and his wife (Kari) was the victim of the madness. That's the premise, with some plot twists, a gun and a body on her neck. Well, I don't know what to expect from the story. What made it better? Well, the main protagonist and his sister (Katerina Haidas) manage to escape by shooting the robot's pilot and then escape in an underground bunker. I was disappointed to see them escape on a dark underground and only then to see him kill another woman who was the killer. The story wasn't too complex but the plot didn't help much. If the story was more intricate, and made less apparent, it could have helped.  I am looking forward to seeing the sequel but I don´t know how I'm going to get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sort of movie that would have been good if it were made for a TV show. Unfortunately, the script is bad. Too, the "plot" is too convoluted and is way too predictable. I mean, it's too bad. The plot, although I'm sure that it had more than the "normal" people involved in this movie, is not as convoluted as the movie has been, because it can't really explain the plot. And it is too predictable to have the characters stay alive. They're just living in their environments, as there's not enough to create the atmosphere. The only good thing I can say about the movie is that the actress who plays the part of the grandfather, is the best and the best actor in the movie. But the movie ends with her dead, and everything else is so obviously out-of-place. I couldn't believe they made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an anti-comedy about an old man who kidnaps an old lady (Sherry) to gain control of her beauty. He then falls for her beauty but she doesn't care for him anyway. The film is so bad, that it seems like it was a nightmare when I was watching it. There are the usual slapstick humor and one or two moments where a character gets a little drunk while being a priest is the funniest part of the film. But there's also a lot of clanking. There's always the annoying "huhuh" when something strange happens and a "hah" when it just isn't happening. There just isn in need of some plot. The problem is, that the plot's good only as the main character and nothing else. There doesn't have any real depth to it. In a way this movie is similar to a really awful movie: a lot more interesting and not scary.  The main character is very pretty, but the film lacks any depth. The story of this movie seems to be based on a fictitious story from a book but I can't see the actual content of the book. The main idea of the movie was an old, worn out priest with a hunk of hair who was really cool but then suddenly falls in love with a sexy woman who doesn't know how she gets along so badly.  Also, the main characters are never portrayed any interesting. In fact, the characters are so stupid, that there is no point to go through.   The director thought that this would be a fun and interesting film but I couldn't really care for it. The ending was too predictable. What the director wanted is an extremely depressing thriller but I don't think that he was successful in that goal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made not because of the talent, but rather because of "I'm an English guy and I don't like English guys, so I put this movie together to avoid them in the film. But the people who put this together don't deserve their full reward.   The plot is very predictable, and the characters are very predictable.  It's really disappointing to see such mediocre film.  A good film: Avoid if you are a fan of a good movie: Avoid like if you're a fan for something else: Avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As an article is said to a lady who said it was funny:  I watched this one as a child. I was very bored, it was too long, but my mother and my sister were all dead-in-the-eyes by this garbage. It wasn't funny. I've seen it twice that I've never laughed at something that involves a bunch of guys trying to get into a relationship with each other. I'm not that bored now, but this was really bad. I didn't even take a minute to look at the plot. I don't even get paid to see it. If you are going to see this movie, please don't. It was like a movie that was made for a kid, but I think you shouldn't be too bothered. This is really awful, I really don't recommend that it be on your Christmas night. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is pretty pointless. It isn't even entertaining to watch. But it's interesting to watch the 'zippy little kid in a white suit' character. The only way to predict this is to watch how this movie is filmed in "Dancing With Dragons". I thought this movie was bad from the beginning, but then I discovered that it was actually good. It was like the old Disney movie of the old-school type, where you get a car that will go out on the road and crash into another car. For whatever reason, the kids would turn off in a big fat, slow car crash instead of turning into a "Tug-The-Dog" car (as if that were a real car). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What an incompetent movie: There is no real plot, no real characters. What did it do with the characters? Why should a film that was made in 2008 (when there were 5 or 6 new sets, and that there is now a plot and direction) use this film as a big step toward making a big blockbuster? How did the producers expect that it would be a big movie? The story is very bad, especially the ending. There is nothing there to rescue the plot.  The only thing that keeps this movie from being a bad film is the fact that it shows the success of the 2010, 'The Girl With The Blender', film. This movie was so terrible, I think you just left the film on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie with some decent actors who should have done better than this....and this movie has so many predictable things that makes it a complete waste of time, you just want to kill yourself. If you don't care, watch this crap! I can't even watch this movie if I'm a person who doesn't care. I would have put the rating lower if they made a better effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. There is no point to this movie. I mean, it's pretty bad, but at least I can say I was able to laugh for 10 minutes. This is just awful, but it does have a bit of humor. But nothing else. The movie is so poorly directed, and so badly filmed, that it's a wonder why they bothered to film this at all. I didn't think I had the time to see this at the store, but I only watched the video on video-museum. The music is awful, there are no "real" songs. The acting is completely terrible, and the acting is at the level of amateurish that I expected from a movie made in the 1980s. There's just no atmosphere, nothing for the viewer to see.  This was a shame. I would have to rate it a 7 or a 8 if it were a decent movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening sequence is about a bunch of teens getting married, and the end is about everyone having to have their parents kill them and then disappear. It's a horrible waste of time and bad direction, so if you have any interest in the idea of a horror film, be pretty quick to avoid this one.  The plot is pretty good, but it doesn't add up to anything, and it's not funny or scary enough to make you feel like watching it. It is just bad. You won't have any time to enjoy it. If you like a horror movie, you'll like this one too, but if you think of it as a horror piece, you won't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I did watch this movie. I knew it was going to be bad but I didn't care. I couldn't care how many people had to see it, and I didn the same for this movie that I saw many times before. However the movie was okay if it wasn't the only way out of a movie: it didn't let the viewer's take the time out of it. And what a disappointing way out. This movie is about the old lady who got some help from a magic girl who was in another town and she didn't really understand a little of the world around her. This is not a good movie for kids. If they want to see this movie it better if they see it on a Sunday on Sunday and they can relax and enjoy a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've read the above I'm sure it's pretty obvious that this movie is the absolute worst. If you haven't seen it you will need a long and hard time to really understand. If a movie is so bad it's actually better to have nothing to watch in your life. The plot is predictable and has been written by a clueless writer. In a nutshell, the story revolves around a couple of guys who love a bunch of people and are drawn into a "love story" with a bunch more people. They don't just act normal, they are just retarded.  I have never been able to read the complete book so I can't make a difference about the writing, but what do I know? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for a few minutes and couldn't even find the characters and I found that I was the only person to get even halfway into it.  This is a very poorly written, horrible movie that does not give the viewer any reason to care and will not be remembered. I gave it 3 stars because the main character is cute, but that's the biggest problem I had after watching it, the only reason I gave this movie a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is no more than the worst movie of my life. The only way that this movie was supposed to be funny was to have a hilarious, ridiculous cast. I laughed at the ridiculous lines, the stupid dialogue, the awful acting, and the sheer dumbness. Even the best actors in the world, such as Robin Anderson and Robert De Niro, don't have this kind of stupidity. Also, not only do they fail to perform but, on the same, are the actors too ridiculous to connect. I watched the first scene of this movie and, although they performed their parts, nothing made me laugh as a joke. If I hadn't heard this before, I'd probably still laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty good in the beginning but by the end of the movie a pretty bad plot. The acting is really horrible and the characters are awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a bunch of guys who just can't find their way into their lives, even though they have seen enough movies to know what they're doing. There's also a bunch with a big ego, who thinks that they're going to win this game. The ending is not great either. The plot is good though. But then there is one thing in this movie that really makes it seem like a stupid movie, even for a few minutes.  A bunch of friends set up a really stupid plan to try and kill an entire family, and then the whole family gets killed. Not only that but one of the people in the family, who is a part of the gang.  I didn't like this movie at all. I think it was a horrible mistake on my part. I have to say that this movie was one of those worst ever movies I've ever seen. If I were in a real gang, it would have been the most important thing I would have seen to see. It is just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate having to rent one of these. Why are there only two movies in this movie, when there is about a thousand of movies for every year?!?!?! Why do I have to watch it?!?! My wife and I both agree that I need to rent it. It's horrible. The only redeeming feature is that it is so cheap, the acting is OK, and the dialog was pretty good. There is nothing else to recommend. It really sucks to watch. Avoid this movie. Avoid, avoid, avoid again, not even if you're low on the funds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping this movie was a satire, and I went to see it just to get some laughs. But sadly it's a little too serious to be a satire (although it is quite funny, the characters are obviously so bad that they have to play some part to save the lives of people that have died in the wrong circumstances). I would recommend to avoid this one, if you want to laugh at a horrible movie (not the least). I think I will stick with the first sequel, because I didn't care to pay so much money for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got out of an earlier screening with this movie and just decided to watch it again, only to find out that my friends had told me already: "Oh, yeah, it's one of those guys who is a sex-seeking lesbian" so I didn't watch it until the 4th time. It turns out I'd have liked it more if I'd been a lesbian and it didn't seem like it had anything to do with the sex-scari/adulant thing that the "scare-artist" had to do in this movie. My friends weren't thrilled with the lack of a plot, but they were generally very satisfied with the fact that the characters all lived in the same town and there was only the two boys who had sex and then we'd get a bunch of "sexual" scenes. While this movie was not very good, it was interesting that the scenes were set in the town where the guys were married to their girlfriends and were all married to the "sex-scaring" guys who were just hanging around the house with the other girls. And it was just really bad. I think the scene at the town's coffee house was supposed to be a sexual scene, but the scene that's just after they had done that, there's no sexual scene whatsoever. It was just like a big double-cross with the lesbian characters in the movie with their husbands and the girls kissing each other didn't have any real plot. Also, the fact the guys could have only one girlfriend really made it seem like I was a "stirred up" scene with just two guys in bed and not one guy.  But it's good that there were actually two men kissing. You can see that if you've ever even seen a lesbian sex scene you're probably going to go with the "gay couple" more than anything else. That scene was probably a bit too long anyway.  I'm not sure if there was ever a sexual performance that made me go giggle. The only way I'm surprised by this movie is that it just sort of blew me off. I thought "The Family Plot" made it worse than the other 2/3 films that I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a disaster. It tries to be funny, but it can't even do that. The characters aren't even good. I was thinking they would be a funny duo, but I really thought the one was the better of the pair. And I thought they were bad for a very long time, but they have really been in the same situation, only now they are getting the better side. They act like a duo of old white guys. But I don't want to see that. They are really boring, and the actors aren't very believable. It seems like they just want to have a fun time and a big party, but nothing is happening except a stupid comedy. You'd get a few laughs, but if you want to sit through the whole movie, you can't figure out what is really happening. At times I just want them to die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just this one, and that's all it is. If the story is more interesting, you'll be amazed that the film made. But you'll find yourself laughing at the crap that they filmed. If you like low budget movies, this isn't a bad one, but if you don't you'll probably be annoyed at having a cast of people doing such a crap job.   It's not so good that you'd go out and rent it without knowing, but I have to confess, the film does have a certain charm. But for some weird, unfathomable reasons (I don't really know why), the production is very bad. It's just not funny. There are some people that can make this movie for me. But I can tell that the only way you can get a copy is to put it in a garbage bag and then put it somewhere where it can't get stolen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best thing about this film was when the 'Dready Doll' was "Truly, Little Wishy Doll!"  I'm sure they got a shot down on that. It was bad enough to be called 'Truly Wishy!' Well, I think it is pretty bad anyway. It has a disappointing ending. There are some wonderful special effects in the 'Tremilly Wishy' world, but none of them are worthy of even a cameo. There is nothing to enjoy. The plot is totally predictable, and the film has too many ridiculous scenes to entertain even the most casual Disney fans. This is one of those films where it's so bad that you can practically watch it and you just want to leave it off. You just can't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First I must confess my thoughts in this movie are not as pure as I'd like. It contains some very disturbing elements. It's too predictable to make any sense, especially. I found this movie, in the "documentary" section, to be a lot worse than I expected it to be. It lacked the feel of authenticity which has been part of the fun of making movies, even. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of the original Ghostbusters. Its a great show and very entertaining if you don't watch it regularly. However, this movie was awful. I would never buy it but not for the fact that I didn't enjoy it. I didn 'it' on its own.  I watched a few parts and finished the movie in spite of having some understanding of how bad it was. However it looked fun at the beginning. However I was glad when the camera zoomed out to show the monsters and their monstrous faces as the ghosts made their first appearance in a dark cave. Then I thought this movie had some interesting plot, but unfortunately it just didn't make me go into it with any enthusiasm.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really, really, was expecting the best of the Disney movies of all time, but I am sad to see this movie. There is a ridiculous number of people who just can't believe that this is "real" entertainment! In the past I have seen many movies that were so much better than this one, and I didn't think that this movie was even that, but it is absolutely the worst, in terms of acting and direction that I have ever seen. I will be honest and tell you that I didn`T see my wife in that movie.   This movie can probably have been a little better than an Oscar award for worst movie ever, but this is not worth a vote of anything. Please do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in a car. It is as bad as anything I've ever seen. Some of the scenes were hilarious, but the rest of the movie is utterly boring and the "plot" is very simplistic.  It just doesn't make any sense. The plot is very vague and just the director doesn't seem to care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about as far as the average of bad movies that a horror movie would be. The acting is bad enough for a horror film, but the effects of the monster were just so hideous. The only good part in this movie is the monster who looks like a human corpse with a skeleton attached to its head. The body of the creature is so obviously designed that you can almost tell that it is coming from the grave. I couldn't believe it when the monster moved up and down with the monster moving across the ground like the "worse dinosaur". The plot was just horrible, the dialog just about as annoying as that of the movie was, and the monsters didn't even seem to be real. I'd like to give this movie a 10 out of 10 but that is too much to ask. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is horrible! The characters are simply bad and the story is bad. The best film was of the "Faster" trilogy. This film was only about two things, the plot, characters, and a few interesting jokes. This movie is simply bad, even worse than that!  The "Zombie" films are great, and this movie isn't either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first film I became aware of the genre of "thongalata" or a "guru" type. (Thongala, for instance, is considered a man who kills many people and is about to destroy the whole world.) I found that the film was just the usual hackneyed hackneyized melodramatic thriller with very little story and very little dialog, but in this case the acting is appalling. The acting is so bad that it is almost impossible to discern the "real" message. This is the worst film I have ever seen. The scenes are extremely repetitive, the plot is ridiculous and the characters are simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was really bad, but i think that it was pretty funny at times. The acting was pretty bad. The writing seemed like I was in a different movie, the music seemed like a half hour. The plot seemed like the director had written it himself, but then the plot had been written by the actors. There was some great dialogue about how the boys would try to survive the plague, but when the real story comes along, you just see it as a typical horror movie.  The biggest reason i decided to avoid it was because I like horror movies. I didn't enjoy them, but they're fun when you can sit on a couch and watch the story play out over a movie's worth of time. They can't even make this movie seem better than the trashy, dumb movie: the acting was bad, the writing was bad and the direction was bad.  In the end, this was the first horror movie i watched in over a decade. I give it two out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so scared of this movie and couldn't care less. I was disappointed and really upset by the lack of effort and the fact that it had not been very well written. There were some very nice little scenes, and the best part of the movie was when they are making their fake phone phone call and calling back. It got me depressed.  This movie is not worth watching. It is so bad that it doesn't really fit in to the story and the story itself just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I just don't care about the real phone calls. It's an extremely low budget movie that tries to set up a big plot. But if you want to read about a movie: see what I do instead of this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess you have a brain like mine that recognizes when a bad-movie is really bad. When a movie like this comes out, you realize that you're an awful film, but this is especially bad.  This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. For some reason, I can't figure out why it is even made this way. I can only say that if you watch it for the story, you'll never care about it. And I'm certain I will never know what it's going to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that is very very disappointing to me. I had some reservations about the "soul" of the movie. However I found it very boring and very pointless. The ending was pointless and it had no redeeming quality. I will never forgive this movie to be one of my worst movies ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that tries to get across the fact that being a serial killer is what makes you so evil, and in this instance, that it doesn't make you evil!  The acting is bad and the plot is really bad!   The movie attempts to explore how things that make people evil are somehow contagious and thus become killers (and the movie is a movie with that) but the execution is pretty poor.  I would have liked to see a movie about how a serial rapist (or, serial killer) is contagious (or "serial killer") and a killer who is contagious is contagious? No. Why would you? The plot has some interesting ideas, though, I would recommend doing one more episode about how things make people that just wanna be serial killers instead of a killer and serial killer (and make them both serial killers and serial killers) but then I'm gonna do it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies ever made. It's really just bad to see how this movie came into the market! The story was weak, the plot was weak! Everything seemed ridiculous!! I can only find two good lines! the "sister" was really cute, it reminded me of "brothers". The movie was a waste of time!! I wish the filmmakers had enough talent to make something that worthwhile!! My advice would be to avoid this movie at all costs! you're not really enjoying it!!!! You're wasting your money on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of movies and this one has it all wrong. I mean, I mean you can get a little bit of everything, even if you are a vegetarian. You can get the movie to be a movie about the lives of a bunch of people, but then they tell you that it's about people. And then they are telling you that you need to see how people react to the badness of the world.  But I thought you could find out more about how people in the world react to these people. I guess I'm not a big fan of documentaries but I thought this movie could be a documentary. But I can't say it could be that. I don't have enough money to waste. I also don't believe this movie's supposed to be an accurate film of the lives we all live. This is the movie that a kid with a Bible and a Bible will make.  I thought it was boring and made no sense. I just think the other people involved in making this movie should take a look at themselves and ask if this was the way they want to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first five scenes are great - when they're at the pool or when they visit the apartment, but this is the biggest plot line that drags the movie down. There are so many clichés to these scenes that there's no wonder they get in. It doesn't make any sense. In fact, I didn't think this was scripted, it was just horrible. The main character is in this film was one of two siblings who ran a restaurant. How did they get hired? For some reason? I'm sure it made it work for some people, but not for me.  The plot is good, but it's just painful to watch this one. There was nothing that made me feel better than watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film stars a nice man in his underwear who steals a huge amount of money from a casino...but the story is not really worth the film itself. It's predictable (almost, anyway) and the story just isn't alluring. There is only a tiny handful of moments that make the movie worthwhile.   It is almost unbearable to watch a film where the story has nothing to do but make the protagonist want to get money and make an effort to help an old man out. The movie tries to be like a classic French classic, but the film can't make the old man want to live again.  There is also no compelling romantic connection to the old guy who stole the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to go into the details about how the film tries to cover the very basic "Facts from a Strange World" story, but unfortunately doesn't quite get that done. There are a few moments that are fairly interesting, but mostly don't hold your interest.  Overall, it's not much better than the TV shows "Vampire Hunter", "The Originals", or any of the other movie lines, and the movie isn't all that bad, and it's a waste of good money if you watch it because you want to watch something, not because you're bored.  The movie is the equivalent of "The Vampire Hunter", with no background other than a mysterious story. There's not really any action. There is not really much of the story to follow.  As with the previous, there's no real story, and we don't really find out who it is. We see a guy named "George" (Randy) and we see a villain named "Casper" (Pablo Polillo), and we find out that she is in an apartment, and that he's missing her.  We find out she's a murderer who lives in a basement, and she's going to try to get into the secret underground city that has a lot of people in it. This is at the opposite end of the movie, at the beginning. While we're doing that, we see that her boyfriend is missing and she gets caught in a horrible gang-squad for some reason.  This movie goes to a lot more interesting things that I didn't expect, but I was expecting to be so much more interesting. I didn to like it as much as I expected.  I didn I like it.  There's a lot about a very dumb villain.  If you have watched the TV series, it would be a good one for your entertainment. But, don't. The way it gets you to know the story of a mysterious mysterious man named "the Riddle" makes this movie a complete disaster. It's weak, dull, and really bad. The acting is bad, especially with a female acting in a bad house.  It's a bad way to show a horror movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is no better than a mediocre, poorly filmed film like the original. The best parts of the original are the best parts; in the case of "Titanus", the original is very good, the sequel is horrible, and the movie is only bad due to its weak script. As I've said, "Titans" is very poorly directed, it's horrible, it looks like they are in the studio of some kind of game. I really don't believe that it has to be in the title of this movie, it should have been put in the proper name of a game. For example, if I'm going to work with "Tiger", I will have to choose a name for the game, and it would have to have a clear story. There are no other elements that could help this movie with it's weak screenplay. The story of a guy who is a super secret agent and who works with the main villain (who is actually a villain) is terrible, the movie starts with an overly dark, clichéd and pointless storyline. The ending is horrible in my opinion. The movie itself is terrible (I don't know what is the point with that). If you are a fan of movies like "The Naked Ray", "The Predator", etc., you'll love this movie. But it's just not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not scary, but very badly directed and badly written. I was afraid to jump in the theater and say "Hey you guys, I'm a real fan of this movie. Why is this film on my radar?   Well, the first thing that popped up was the title of the film, "I'm a Monster: The Walking Dead!" If that were not bad enough, it was bad in all other respects.  This is probably the worst horror film ever made. The idea was that the people that killed people in the town were zombies, but there was nothing that made me think that they would actually be zombies. The zombie-killing scenes were not disturbing.  The ending of the movie just made me really sick.  It is just about boring, and the script is extremely bad. The fact that this is about a zombie running a gang seems to be completely unbelievable.  Overall, this movie was an embarrassment to me. My suggestion: don't waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many reasons to dislike this movie and none of them are good. I mean, the badness is the only reason. Aside from the fact that the story is bad, I think it's just too predictable. It doesn't have any real sense of purpose. I'm sorry to say, but I can see it in the way that it is trying to be in an archery-training movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film, I was sick to think that someone was going to make a sequel to this film and I didn't think I would ever sit that night. I'm not sure if this is the case for the original film but I am guessing there was at least one person who wanted to make it.  And I do not know how you can get a sequel that is so bad that someone would want to make. I can't seem to figure out who had been watching the original. The original director can't even figure out what "new" thing was in the original, even though it's very similar. It's not that the film is bad, but it's not interesting either. The acting is weak.   I like to think of movies that are interesting and I like stories that aren't boring but I'm really sick to see people in a film like this and see how bad that can get. It doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a comedy it just does not match it's name. But it does not make it funny. The comedy has a "feel" of being just wrong. I'm not really sure how this can possibly be. It lacks the basic ingredient to make it interesting. It was hard to stay in the groove of the story and watch. The director, Jay Leno and his girlfriend were simply in a bad mood. I didn't know whether to laugh or not. My only conclusion is that if it was an original story, they should have done better. But if the idea of making a story about the day of a murder, it should have had the best talent in the world. But unfortunately, as an independent project, the script is awful, and the result is bad. This movie does not have anything to recommend to anybody. The actors and the actresses should really have the same talent as their director. If they had any talent, they would at least have been the ones to make this a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a lot of trouble watching this movie. It is full of a bunch of actors who are obviously just a bunch in the studio. It's really disappointing when they are just a group of guys. And this just shows how low the people in this movie are. This movie isn't scary at all, it's just predictable and pathetic. This could have been great if the actors were more talented and the direction was better. But these guys just don't look like fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen nothing, nothing, and nothing of importance, yet I am willing to admit that I am a film maker. The acting is not very good, the plot is totally wooden, and the story is weak. The script is weak, the directing is amateurish, and it is hard to believe that the actors are good. This was a horrible waste of a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie that has been made in the world of action films with this crap acting. I am thinking I can take a guess that this movie was the very worst ever made in Hollywood. It is full of stupid and bad dialogue, but a damn shame to not even make it a complete joke. You know why I should avoid this film, because it is the biggest bitch to the worst movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a real fan of Seagramards but unfortunately this movie is no longer suitable to be watched. The plot line and some action scenes are not sufficient to make this an interesting movie and it looks like they are completely oblivious to all the drama and drama that surrounds the world. A simple summary would be that it is stupid and silly but pointless. This is not even a very good movie for Seagramard fans but unfortunately you will be left disappointed if you watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw "Jabba", I immediately thought that I would never get to see this movie. I couldn't believe that it is as bad as it looks. It just doesn't make any sense and the story is stupid and it is completely over-acted and you need a better plot. If you can see it in a theater, you might be able to make it better, although I suppose there is an interesting scene in the jungle scene. But if you get a chance to see it on a DVD or CD, you will just see another of the lame "B" movies. I don't know if you're familiar with it, and that's for sure, it's not worth seeing. If they were truly interested in "B", they might hire a real filmmaker and make a real movie. But that would be missing the fact that there is a lot of bad movies in this world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am usually quite conservative when it comes to movies with movies like this. I don't like the 'vampire' genre so much. It doesn't make for a good horror film to be something that is essentially a horror movie...  The story was the worst ever in any horror movie. Even with a few good moments thrown in, this movie isn't enough to ruin the rest of the movie. A poor man... a woman who has the ability to kill vampires is a bad vampire... a man who hates vampires... a little boy who hates being alone... a couple of murderers and a little girl with an uncanny resemblance... I don\'t like these actors, they're just boring. What's the point of being in this story? And why do people talk about these vampires? The movie is not that much of a horror film. The plot is weak. The movie features a couple vampires, and the vampire scene is pretty decent. But overall, this is not really worth a second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing here but cheap sex, and a lot of violence.  In case of having sex is a matter of degree, then the sex is an excuse for something else. The acting is a mess. A very predictable story of a woman who lives in a small town, not at all a person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's a piece of crap, but it's entertaining in a way that it shouldn't be. The plot is so bad it makes you laugh, but not if you're the type of person that is bored by every line in it, because you have to feel bored. I really don't think that a person would want to read it, although I would have liked the whole thing. I give this movie an 8, and it is just too weak to be truly horrible. A very bad film, and I think you would do better to read another movie, preferably, to avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of a movie: a bunch of hounds, a few girls, and a few, that's all the rest. A really crappy way to start.   The only redeeming aspect is that the acting is good. The two ladies are actually pretty good, and the rest of the crew is totally lame. It's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was one of the biggest fans of the original series (in fact, one of only ten people on earth who actually enjoyed it). However, after viewing the episode in question, I realized that it doesn't even follow up the initial premise. It's basically a very predictable story of a man who wants to be the 'hero', and he somehow succeeds in getting his girl and forcing her into an incest affair.  The ending was rather predictable and uninsentimental.  Now, while it was cute at first, it just wasn't quite interesting. It was bad, I'm not sure if the 'new' episode is any good. But I'm glad that it's finally released because it did get me excited, and that was ruined by the ending. I know this is just a bad idea. It just isn't interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to wait till they sent the script and some music to me so i could hear how ridiculous and ridiculous it was. It was so bad i had to watch every episode of this show because I wanted to see it for the sake of being an idiot. This is not a comedy, but a little bit like "The X Files", with a dumb plot, stupid characters, and one very ridiculous ending. The only way i'm going to watch this show is to pray to god it won get released. How did it get released?  I'll never watch this movie again. This movie had me fooleded for a few minutes and then I had my life ruined by watching it. I would even have bought the movie in that situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing like a movie: 1 out of 10 (the 3 are the most horrible films i've seen) I couldn't take my eyes away from it. It is the only reason i'm writing this review! It's so bad that I'm even considering getting an airlock copy of it:  If you're a man or a woman who has little taste and skill you're going to see this at your local video store because it's so terrible, you'll waste your time.  This was a poor excuse for a great movie: it lacks any depth and any meaning whatsoever. In fact, it's about as bad as the movie "The Day After Tomorrow". It's boring and a bad case of the overabundance of good cinema that has gotten so much past its peak.   The script wasn't that bad, but it didn't have any depth beyond the superficial. There was a decent bit of humor, but unfortunately, it was very predictable.  I've never even seen a movie that was this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was shocked to find that this movie was even filmed in a small town of Wisconsin. I laughed for a few moments, then laughed for about 3 seconds straight and then laughed until I was dry.  I've seen more than half of the previous series, and this one is easily the worst. The story lines are not even that consistent, and they're not even filmed with actors that make the audience feel the same way. There is a huge disparity of how these people in these towns view the different kinds of life. The idea that one person is a racist stereotype is ridiculous and offensive, but then there's a black girl who comes to town, kills a black guy, and then kills the black girl's boyfriend, while there's another black guy who kills a white woman's wife.  This movie will never be rated by any film enthusiast. If you liked "The Whole Nine" or "The Outsider", you can see it with better quality than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie quite disappointing. It is quite strange that in the beginning of the movie the characters are so much like their original characters from the previous movie. In that case, the two main characters from one of the first 2 movies (Beverly and Hilden) are just like the first ones. What I find most bother is the scene in which we watch two men talking with each other that they have no intention to do anything, like the conversation with the other main characters of the previous movies. It's just a lot of pointless bickering. I can only assume that in some respects the actors who were cast for the other part, did so in order to create the atmosphere and atmosphere of the story and so that they could get the money back for the movie, which was probably why they were cast. But I am unable to believe that anybody had such a plan. As I say, it's a shame that they couldn't capture all the footage of the characters in their first movie. This movie does have a good ending, but sadly I can't say it's that good. I suppose it is all too long and boring, but it has so many clichés that it isn't that great anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In spite of an otherwise excellent cast and a decent camera, I can see nothing of the film to recommend. If you're looking for a "gather," you can do it yourself. But if you want to watch a stupid movie, you might as well make something more, and not even then. This is just a waste of time... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "All Kind Men" is a really bad movie. What is wrong with it? Well, it seems to be a film for young boys and boys who have grown up and need to be taught how to behave in a grown up way. Not only that, but the fact that most of the people involved in it seem to have spent years and time creating their own "film", and if that is a "film" then I am sorry to say that it's not. It's a cheap, un-scripted knock-off of some of the more highly regarded, more entertaining films from today, such as "Crazy Town". The story is basically boring and poorly written.   The acting is good, but most of what you get from it is what would happen if the movie was made with real talent. If a movie was actually made with such low level of talent, then it's no wonder that it isn't great. But it is only to borrow a cheap idea that makes a very bad film. I would watch this movie every other time I'd have in order to see it. If you think I'm wrong, then, it's probably because the person doing the movie has nothing to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's no wonder that some people got this movie: a movie with a bad plot and horrible actors is called 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film when it was released in 1984. I just watched the "documentary" which the "welps" showed. I was expecting something like the documentary would be like. The movie itself just looks like a bunch of guys in the woods taking a bunch in their asses to look at one stupid movie: the guy who tells about a dog and another dog and that dog, in a blind spot, are kissing each other. What a crap film. And when it comes out on DVD this is really awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do not care for this movie. I mean it's not a movie, its a video short. They can't make anything out of this movie, it is only a movie in some sort, like I'm a cinematographer. But this movie is awful and the dialog is horrible. It just doesn't make any sense. When they filmed it, I thought they were all out of their minds. I had to leave the movie at 2 AM and see it as they finished in the afternoon when I left the theater and then saw it on the television in the morning.  I have seen better horror films than this one, but I thought this was one of those films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible from start, it was completely pointless, I have no idea what I saw in it. It was like an awful lot of terrible things and it was all the same. At the beginning I was confused, I think I was a little bit scared. Then it just grew and grew worse and worse, I couldn't even find anything. Then I decided to watch it again because I thought it had some substance, but then it just stopped. The story seemed to have a beginning, the characters seemed to be alive, but it didn't really add anything to the movie, it just became another excuse to waste my time. The plot was so bad, the dialogue wasn't even that good, the acting seemed to not even have happened. I don't know if I even wanted to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just don't believe it's "the best" movie of all the movies I've ever seen.  There's only 4 or 5 more, and if you see another, it would be even worse. This one can't stand the time it's given any credit for. I rented this at a video store, and I've rented hundreds of movies, but I don't think you can buy this. I had a chance to see "The Master of Frankenstein" 2 weeks ago, and it was the best movie ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a stupid movie this is, I'm surprised it didn't go straight to "Citizen Kane."   The premise is correct in what it has to say, but the whole film is so awful it's difficult to care. It's so bad, that it can't even be considered to be "Citizens Kane." How did this movie even come out?  I couldn't make it out of the box, even though I'd have liked to see the characters and the plot if I had seen it. I'm not sure exactly what is the story, and I feel bad for the other actors who played the characters.  There is absolutely no plot of "Custer." Well, let's just try it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best scene is where the woman is having sex with another man (and it is not for her!) and the whole thing is just the two of them and you wonder what happened at the beginning. The only time that scene is present is in the next scene, which starts after the man tries to rape the woman while she's still alive and starts to do something which makes him feel creepy. Even though this scene is far better, this is a really awful film in the most senses of the word, and I don't like it for much of the plot. The scene where the man rapes the woman keeps the viewer wondering why it even exists at the end of the movie is just bad. Just one problem with the film: it is hard to find anything else to do. You never see the woman who was having sex and the man who was kissing her. I can't understand how this is supposed to make it look like rape. The man is actually really hot and there is no way to tell you that he was raping someone. That's just about the ending and no part of the film is that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The whole thing is really bad, and I can't figure why it was so funny when I first saw it, it seemed so fake and so fake when I watched it. The plot was so clichéd, and when the cast got a chance to act, they gave me one second of the screen-space on their faces and nothing more. But I didn't know until the end when I saw it how pathetic it was. It is not funny. It has got to be something you will never want to see again. Don't let this movie pass your eyes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film stars a little bit of John Belushi as the leader of the Japanese army. His character, after seeing the British soldiers in a desert country is taken captive by the other army to become a British officer. This is a pretty ridiculous part of a bad film that has become an institution that makes films that simply come off as pointless, like a horror film but really nothing more. The plot is similar to an early 20th century, not like the later 20th's films, but instead, it's like a collection of people that are forced to live in a tropical jungle because they can't be fixed in any normal, or even have a life. And it keeps going until one day there is only one remaining survivor, an elderly woman who is rescued. In some ways, the film is decent, but I never liked it. The acting is completely lacking in most of the parts. In one of the scenes that was filmed on the actual battlefield, an angry soldier is seen to be completely flustered by a girl who was being kidnapped, and then a few minutes later, another soldier turns around and scatters himself on the ground. This has to do with the story, in which you know nothing about the military and are led to believe that this is the end. When the woman tries to escape, she doesn't know that there's another army of soldiers, she still thinks they can escape and are told that she is going to help one of those soldiers. This film has nothing but a few scenes and a few boring moments where a soldier is told that he is killing another person because they won't give him back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie equivalent to a movie entitled, "Raging Fury." Well, if not the movie... a movie that could only be made under the worst conditions. The main problem with the movie was that it was totally unbelievable to believe it. Why would anyone expect an action movie to be so unbelievable? The plot was so bad that it never got a chance to succeed.  And the actors did absolutely nothing to deserve this award, unless, for some reason, they did something that they obviously wanted. I had nothing to recommend on this movie. I was scared about my own head. I saw it in a few other movies and they all had something to recommend. I'd like to see some of the actors in it, but they don't appear in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were some very good actors in this movie, but this one just was lame, especially the two actors who were supposed to be the star of the movie. The plot was pretty good, but the ending had really been just the worst thing I have ever seen. And the only reason I kept watching it was to get an idea of what the rest of the film could be.  The movie starts off with some good character development, but then all of the characters are treated like disposable pieces. The ending should have been a surprise, but it really just blew it all out. It felt so bad for me that it was almost almost painful to watch. I gave this movie a 1/2, but I don't think they had any intention of giving this movie an honest review. It was more about how bad the movie was than the good things it was. I have to say this film was probably the worst movie of my life. If it were only a movie with a couple of good stars, I would give this movie 5/10. If you are a fan of Robert DeNiro and Kevin Bacon, you'll enjoy it. But this movie just couldn't hold anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went out to see this at the local theater in my hometown and paid $10 to watch it and I didn't like it. The acting was terrible, the story wasn't interesting, the plot seemed to be made up by a drunk ex-mater who thinks he's going to have a sex change, the characters were all terrible and the film seemed like it was about to be a movie of a serial killer that murders a few people every year. It didn't really make sense, and the whole thing was so bad that it just felt like they didn't even want to make anything about it. There is a small scene that really did make sense in the film, but it just happened before it actually got to the story. I just can't find a lot more of my friends to believe that this film is really worth watching because it's so bad, but maybe you can look into it and see it for yourself if you have to. If you have ever seen anything like this, please let it sit on your shelf and get a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible movie this is. I can't believe it was meant to be a comedy, and it's not. I saw it at a friend's house and I thought it was one of those terrible movies with a cast. I tried watching the first 10 minutes, and then after 15 minutes was not getting that much, but I could see how it spiraled out of control in a horrible and unfathomable way. When I did not understand all of the dialogue, I felt my anger to flow into every movie: how much was being said, and how ridiculous was it. When was there a plot? I didn't want to know how all of them worked together to accomplish the "comedy" with its absurdly predictable ending. I just couldn't suspend my disbelief that this was a comedy. I'm embarrassed to say that this is not the first thing to get a DVD release, and if it were even the first, it should have been a DVD in a DVD store. That would be better. It's not even a comedy at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is bad to say that there are people who just love this type of bad movies and then you can name the ones that hate it. The first part is the horrible comedy that was directed by the director of "My Follower" and the second part is that "My God Is A Follower". This movie is simply bad. If you are not watching this movie because of the fact that it is not a movie but you are watching it because you can just enjoy it for the ridiculousness and stupidity. When the movie is released you can buy it at any store and try to make it worse. If your time is over it is really terrible to see people just laugh. If this movie ever gets released I hope it will have better ratings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I mentioned previously, this movie is quite awful. The story is bad. You would expect it to be a film with some interesting things. But it is a film without even that. Why bother? We've seen it before and it still is terrible. Why waste time watching this? The only good part of this movie are the actors.  I would recommend leaving this movie if you want to rent it, because it is not worth your time. The acting is mediocre, although I guess that is pretty much what we have seen in past movies (for instance The Devil Doll) and that was what we would expect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So much time, money, effort and emotional investment went into making this piece of trash. Why it was so difficult to make this film is beyond me, I thought that there was something more important to this film-like piece of garbage that is not supposed to be an interesting film but instead, it is a boring, pretentious piece of crap. If this movie had a plot, it could have actually been one of the more exciting horror films ever made, but it doesn't. There is no more time in this film, except for a brief cameo as one of three characters who were in one of two scenes. The only thing that keeps the film from being boring is the plot and lack of plot development. The actors are OK, but unfortunately there is no real story.  I can't tell you what the hell is going on in this movie. I can guarantee you that most of the actors did some sort of acting and this movie was no exception. The ending is horrible, with absolutely nothing that will make me laugh. I will give you credit for one of those actors who I think was the best, but this movie lacks. It's a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a pile of terrible trash, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't get better. It doesn't, but it does get better every time it comes on the screen. And it seems like a true cliché to say, 'we're going to see him in a '60s prison,' to start with. Well, there's some nice performances and there are some interesting, but they don't quite work. The script is awful, the only real performance is from John Loney. The only movie with decent performances is the 'Tetro' trilogy, and it is generally OK. But, at this point in history, when you get into a sci-fi film, you should expect it to be good, and if you ever expect an '60's jailhouse drama, you don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. They just put it in a ridiculous format. The story is a stupid story about a bunch of guys who try to steal some good stuff, but unfortunately, they have been turned into terrorists. There are no explanation whatsoever. I just wanted to turn off the movie so I could find some sort of reason to put it on the shelf. It does not help anyone. If you have nothing else, just watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a movie that is so lame that I couldn't even tell you what made it so terrible. There were two big scenes of action. We had to watch the two guys fighting, as one side of the story moves toward another. This is bad because that makes it difficult to portray what you have to do when you get into a car. If this movie was a horror film, it would not work out so well as a horror movie.  The biggest problem with this movie is the acting. It's OK, but the acting is so terrible that it's hard to find anything to do with the characters. The scene where one side is getting ready to fight another and the other is ready to get ready to make a car and there is a car waiting to be built. The car is not only not fun but it is not even moving or anything that will happen to make the action happen.  This is the kind of movie I had seen before, but it didn't have anything good enough to make me want to see again. That just made it hard for me to go back to this movie. I was also disappointed that the original ending was not a cliffhanger in the story. This ending was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film to keep in my mind. I don't care for the fact that it's about a giant, lizard-man who has to break the eggs of a dinosaur. It's not about people. They have no connection with humans. It really just revolves around the fact of this creature, which is just stupid. What is it?  There are a few glimpses where the monster is being hunted by the camera crew, for example. But nothing about the creature seems to be terribly different from what we see in the movie (and it's just too long and slow!). There is also a huge leap in terms of technology, such as lasers and radar. The scene with the big lizard is ridiculous and ridiculous. Also, it's not even possible to see the creature in it's natural environment. The camera is about a hundred meters away from the lizard-infested island (the island is about 1,000 meters). The creature has to go up a lot farther to get there. If it was going to see an actual creature, it would actually be a hundred kilometers, but they decide to make the scene look like that, rather than the monster itself.  The story is nothing I expected. It is just an attempt to cover a horrible monster-throng. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just to get your attention, "The Castle" is the kind of movie where a group of nerds go to an island where they're really big, a bunch of big, stupid people who go on a murderous killing spree and are eventually forced to fight each other. This is the only film I have ever seen from the '2000' era.  It's like having a bunch some guys with very basic knowledge of psychology, then having one of them start a "psychological experiment" that goes out of control and kills everyone. It's so bad, that you can barely talk to anyone but the guys who are acting as "consensus" as to what's happening to you.  I was really hoping that it would be interesting to see this film, but it really isn't. For instance, when one of the characters dies in the movie, they're talking to their wife, who's got him's name tattooed on their face, and they're asking her to join a "religious cult" where she'll get her son to become a member.  What I was hoping would happen after this is that the characters would start talking to each other, and she'd be talking back to them. The movie isn't quite as bad as you say it is. But I would have expected something to happen, and I would be glad to see it, even if it wasn't the sort of movie I had hoped for. And what we all know is that it doesn't happen. It does, but I doubt that it'll have an effect. There are many films that have a similar theme to "The Castaway", and "The Circle", and I think that "Castaway" will do something similar. But they don't, and that makes me very disappointed. This film, it's just an extremely boring movie. It wasn't interesting, not funny, and it's an overall bad movie. Even though it does have some interesting elements, it doesn'll never happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think there was much to recommend this movie, but I did find it enjoyable when I watched it. But as the film progressed it quickly became tiresome.  The characters are so shallow, and there was too much of the material to fill in a two hour film, as they were about to do a 2 or 3 hour movie. The plot wasn't particularly dramatic. While I thought the ending was interesting, it was too slow and uninteresting.    The movie was so bad I couldn't see it in any other movie I'd watch, even if it was on a "natural" or even "documentary" channel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it's funny. But what makes this movie even worse is that the cast (especially the actress, Maria Henkawah) seem to be acting as if it is about having sex with her in the most despicable fashion possible.  The movie tries to have a moral crusade about a rape, but it doesn't work because the story itself is so damn ridiculous. If this movie was a movie about rape, it would have at least been interesting. If the movie had a message about how awful sexual abuse was, it wouldn't have been the type of movie that people want to waste time on. It would have made this movie a satire, if you really wanted to make a satirical comment about the horrible nature of rape, because the film isn't that funny. The movie is only about a girl who tries to get a job, but instead of getting hired, she gets sexually harassed (so much time spent wasted) in a horrible manner. It is pretty clear to see that she thinks she is being sexually assaulted, but she's so stupid she doesn't even know how she's being assaulted. I'm sorry to say that the movie doesn't make much better. I think it's more like a torture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to watch a classic, straight-to-noir film, you'll be treated to a few moments of mild comedy when you watch a movie in the late 1950s. If you're not part of the circle that can get the credits quickly, you might miss the humor. It doesn't matter how bad it is, and the storyline remains as pretentious as possible for the whole movie, but the plot does eventually reveal, more or less, that it was a hoax.  The premise is that the film will be successful because the movie is "ancient", and therefore it contains no value. And the movie does not meet its expectations. Even the original, "The House of The Living Dead", was a bit of fun, but it could easily be read as a silly movie. It's an example of how "ancients" are treated as if they were "resealed" from an ancient tomb. The idea is to make a fake movie that is so absurd that it actually makes absolutely no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is terrible. Don't expect to see this sort of film in a movie. This is a horrible film. The film is so bad it's better to waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is absolutely bad but that's all I can say about it. I can't believe how bad this movie was because this movie just did not go out of its way to make any statements or do anything that it did. It was just a very stupid story with one big problem that could not be solved in a day or more. The characters themselves were pretty dull and the plot was too similar to the other two movies which this movie had already done. I thought the acting was awful, the plot seemed to be a bit more complicated than what the others had done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to think that most of the people who saw this movie only knew they didn't like it. This movie is just so terrible I couldn't care much. The acting is awful, and the plot is really just that stupid. The ending just sets us back to the beginning. I just can't believe that this movie was really scripted. I'm so sick that I can't blame this movie for the lack of quality. I really don't know what happened to the script, but it would probably have seemed to be a movie at the end of the film. I mean, what's with all the car jokers that are in the movie?? What's with the story? Who would have had made this movie? How did they do? I'm sure that the writers had a good idea, but why bother to watch it??? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised that this film exists. If it did, I would turn to some other works like "Gugy" or "Zaggy" and see how well that duo worked.  The film itself was nothing more than a dumb story and stupid direction.  A simple man (Darth Guei is his name) decides to be the best man ever so he can finally catch his sister's little sister. When his wife finds out, he has to take the life of his little sister on order, a pretty old lady (a blonde) who has a small tattoo on her neck. The story has nothing to do with the actual events of the film, so I'm not going to give much of the plot, but it is pretty well put to rest your mind, even if you can guess where the daughter's death would occur.  It does have some interesting scenes that involve some of the old ladies. But then you just have to be a dumb one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed when this was released.  It is extremely slow-paced, with nothing interesting at the end of it.  I had high expectations for this movie and I was expecting this movie to be the most thrilling film of the "80s", because of all of the special effects in it. But it is very slow-moving and the story is absolutely pointless.  The most annoying thing is that this movie was so incredibly boring. This movie had some of the most ridiculous parts to believe. For example, the way that the police was chasing the guys who were killed in this movie, had a very weird plot. You really cannot believe that the cops had seen the guy. You just see one guy in a coffin, a corpse, and what happens? It is a corpse?  And what happened after all of these corpses are cleared? They all go to where they died and nobody actually does anything. I couldn't care much more than what happened in this part of the movie and there are no clues about it in this film.  In the end, I don't know why they even bothered to make this movie. I don; I guess that it's been released in a very long time because it was so disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like some of the early classics, but, this was just plain awful.  I did like the first one. But this one was just dreadful. It didn't have the suspense, the twists, the surprises, or anything like it.  It wasn't nearly as disturbing as the original, which was fairly good. But I was also tired with the story and the storyline.   The characters, particularly the three young protagonists, were very stiff and dull. They were little more entertaining than the original.  And the director, Richard Neely, couldn't give us the most interesting parts of the movie. There wasn't a storyline, a plot twist, or an escape from a horrible, depressing world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie was a good one, it would have a happy ending. But, I think it was a bad one. It is bad for many reasons. The ending is weak, the plot is weak.  The plot was weak in the movie. What was this? A movie that would not have worked if its protagonists did not get on the plane. The story could have been so much stronger than the movie was. The characters are just stupid caricatures.  My hope is that this movie will not be repeated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So we've heard that the director wanted to film a musical performance that's supposed to reflect the true nature of the true story of the war. But what he ended up with was a complete mess. The acting isn't even remotely good, which just made me want to pull out my hair and throw myself into the nearest lake. The movie is simply a waste of time and a waste for any other person. The story isn't as good as you want it to be, and you shouldn't get involved in it. The characters are poor. Even the great Victor Hamilton and the lovely Joan Littleburgh don't do much to inspire you. The only reason this movie stands as a solid example is the acting. It's the kind of movie that only happens in situations like this one, and it's a bad sign for the genre that we can't expect too much. I'm hoping the same director who was involved in the movie will soon realize that it's OK for a musical project to be a waste, and maybe even better for musical performances than just being part of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete disappointment in every sense and every way. If a person wants to see a "normal" movie he should get this one to see instead of wasting his time on this one. In fact, it should never have been a movie to begin with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching "Cicusano" for my girlfriend, the film is a joke. It's not a documentary. The idea behind it is that it's an absurd movie with a ridiculous premise and no plot. But it doesn't have a plot. It just plays like an old fashioned cartoon with lots of boring dialogue.  The movie is mainly based on a ridiculous scene which involves throwing a couple on a roof and throwing them in a coffin into a car with a bunch of thugs. There are a couple of interesting parts in the movie, but mainly just boring dialog and an unnecessary sex scenes. Even if you think that the ending is amusing, you can tell that it really sucks. It could be better if the characters and actors had something to say instead of a dumb and boring movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a little bit of romance (though a lot of scenes are pretty awful) and a little humor, but it's no fun to sit around watching some cheesy, over-honed "movie" like this movie. The characters, however, are not actors, so the movie might be interesting if you had the cast for a real actor. If this were a movie about a true romantic relationship, this would probably be pretty good (since I like romance, not too much, but not too far, either). But the movie is so terrible that it's almost painful to watch. Even the most talented actors will fail to deliver something good, but this movie is just a hodge of some lousy stuff, nothing I can recommend with any real seriousness. If you're looking for a good movie, you can choose a different one: "A Dream of Fear", "Ride in one". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie that made me angry was a movie made in the 1980s when I got into this genre. This was the kind of movie that is not allowed to be made any more than in the 20th century. It was about a movie of the movie theatre and the only thing that happened was that the theater didn't open anymore. This movie had no value in the real world. The characters were horrible. The only two that had a chance to do anything in this movie were the ones that would have made it. It is sad to see that people like this movie and it was really bad, I can't believe I have ever put any of these movies in my life. If you want to be entertained, you do not want to watch this movie. There are better movies, like "Buckets" and "Losing the Game", I've seen those movies before. This is probably the worst movie I've ever made. It also sucks to watch something that doesn't make any sense in the slightest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is predictable and so it's not all that bad; most of the humor is pretty good. But this movie is totally bad, which is strange given the film has been such a big hit in Hollywood. It's pretty disappointing to hear some people take this as a "movie", and I didn't want to read any reviews on how bad this movie was, and just like the rest of Hollywood, this movie sucks. I would have enjoyed reading some of the reviews on this movie, but this was mainly bad in the "story" storyline. The plot was pretty predictable and I felt like watching it only to get my hopes back, but I couldn't really believe it was really bad. Even though the movie was very entertaining and funny, I had a feeling when it was over I didn`T even have to finish it. I don't have any real sympathy for this movie and I don`t have any feelings for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the one film that I have never seen. There's a small amount of plot points that are amusing in the beginning but the whole movie just drifts to a disjointed conclusion. It's just one of those movies that are stuck in a groove and never get better.  Even with the movie's many clever scenes, there's only a few twists that keep it from getting to where it is.  The plot is an uninteresting piece of junk. It just looks like a stupid idea to have a dog named "Fog" and a cat named "Chocolate" on the same group of girls. There is some mild plot points - that I guess it would have been funny if the cat and the dog were the same - but there's nothing to help with it.  It's like an old car with an old battery in it - that isn't fun and can't even have a fun story. It looks like the only thing in it is a man whose dog eats garbage and a girl who is having sex with another guy. The girl is supposed to be a nun, right? I hope they didn't get to that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is, in its own words, a piece of garbage, and it is not the least disappointing I've ever seen in a Hollywood film. It's a horrible waste of entertainment, it's a ridiculous piece of material, it lacks direction, and the production is, at worst, horrible. In fact, I think I might prefer that somebody was playing these characters instead of watching this one, because the writing and the direction are so weak that it is painful to watch. You want to see something that is dramatic and exciting that has been created in the past, instead of taking away half of the fun by making a bad but predictable movie about a bunch of idiots. That's not my concern. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really a terrible movie but i guess the director thought it would make the audience enjoy itself.  The movie starts with about 4 minutes of acting and only 3 minutes of scenes.  I believe that the original "Wet Teens" is the better one, and this is simply another bad entry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A man dies in the middle of the night, after stealing the only gold in his life. After he dies, there is some guy with the gun who says he wants to take his gold. The guy dies, leaving his wife to walk around in the rain as a ghost.  There is also another girl who steals some of the gold and tries to kill some of her husband. While this has been done many times throughout the history of the movies, this is the first time I have seen this movie. And worst of all, the guy is really the only person who actually has a plan on killing his wife. It can't have been better if the guy was a man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a little sympathy for the film, I'm a big fan of The Legend of The Naked Spear, I've never been disappointed, but if you're going to see it then you'll have some fun with the story of the war with the Indians. However, I find this film to be pretty awful. The Indians are supposed to be immortal, so, it must be funny but they just can't stick with the traditional story line. It's pretty bad and the only thing that I thought was funny was the Indians stealing Indian women. I'll admit it's not going to break my heart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really bad. The ending is too predictable and the story and direction are bad. It's hard to believe that this is a comedy. At the beginning, it was a really funny premise, but after the whole film was over, the plot is only semi-real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing in the movie is that it doesn't try to kill any of the supporting actors in the cast. Unfortunately, most of the acting is incredibly weak, and it is difficult to remember any of it. It is difficult for me to keep track of the actors from time to time. There were some good moments, but they were so boring and uninteresting that I never felt a positive reaction to most of them.  I think I might watch this movie again if I'm going to rent it for some money, but I'm not sure why. The only two things that I enjoyed about it were its funny scenes and the little bit that occurred at the end, but you can find it to your heart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really don't understand this movie. It's a really bad movie. There was nothing new. The action scenes are boring and it doesn't even come to a place where you can feel suspense. There are no surprises in the film and not many moments that you might expect. It is just a bunch of guys in a car. Why would there be no escape and why would they stay in one place or stay there and make a lot of money?  The movie was just a car robbery. We didn't know anything about the plot, the characters or the escape. The script is just an excuse to put more scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the late 1920's, many people dreamed that a film would help them escape from the horrors of the twentieth century.  This was not a film that had any substance. In fact, it was rather a poorly made film: a collection of images, scenes, a story with no real value. And since we're talking about a film, the title is also a cliché.  But, this film does have a title: "The War" (which isn't a bad title, by the way). The War is an extremely poor film that seems to have nothing to do with any substance and is no fun to watch at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When a group of actors like this find out to play their usual roles, then the movie becomes a complete piece of utter rubbish.  The acting is flat and the plot is completely meaningless. The storyline is bad enough that it is hard to believe that anyone can take it seriously.   The script is poor but luckily there are some good actors in the cast.  If you had the courage to watch it then you should avoid this film. I do not think this is a horror film like Scream! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be blunt and say the movie has no plot. It's a bunch of random sex and murder and a plot is the main plot. The script is bad. I have never seen such a dull movie. The characters are so one sided and you are just left on wondering what was the guy who was supposed to get the girl. The only thing that I like about this movie is the fact that the actor in the movie is a man with a blonde hair and you can't really figure him out.  The movie is obviously made to be a sex-story, but if the writer was a real man, the whole thing would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Pilteria" is the only movie from this list that I have ever seen. The story is obviously intended for children, and it is completely devoid of any kind of message. It isn't funny at all, and the acting is awful.  I give this movie one of the worst titles I've seen since "Mambo." I know how to solve this. What a horrible waste of time. Avoid like these. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a letdown with this movie: There was nothing else like a Disney movie with the exception of Mickey and Minnie. So the acting was so bad, and the story seemed so bad. I won't say that the acting were good but the chemistry wasn't good either, neither the way the story played out. There was absolutely no payoff to the movie whatsoever.  I watched the first and only part of the movie and didn't even enjoy it. It really was just a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have ever heard of made that I will not rent (or even pay) to see. I've seen this movie so many times, and I can't remember why I am in this position. The only reason I have turned this movie off is that I couldn't enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I was pretty excited when I found the video for this movie, and after seeing it for the first time I thought I was gonna like this movie. I can't say it was bad, if it was a decent movie it would be great. Then it just started getting ridiculous. The acting was pretty bad, and the plot was also pretty bad. I just can't believe that this movie was even made, and I have no faith that this will even make it to the big leagues. The ending is just bad. It was just a very weak movie.  If you don't like this or you are offended by this film, then you better stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is like I have seen most of my films but it isn't the best of them. The acting isn't that good either and it is very pointless to see the film. the plot is very bad and the story is not even interesting for a great film like i told you. it is just a collection of bad images, bad dialogue and bad acting to a great one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that has a number of clichés. The premise, though interesting, is nothing like the films made for its own genre. This movie is so bad I won't even call it "Killer." Even worse than "B" (the sequel to "B").  This movie starts at the beginning of the original and continues at the end of the film, although the end results are more interesting than the beginning. The film attempts to develop a plot by turning to the dark side of the brain, but the result is a lack of substance and an uneven plot. The ending is too long, but there is a nice cameo in the credits that adds some flavor. If you want to see a movie in which the director is talking to a very dumb group of people, then this is the best movie. Avoid like this at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had nothing to recommend. It has absolutely nothing interesting. The plot is utterly predictable. It's just boring. I could see the movie more like a John Hughes movie. This movie is not worth the time it takes to actually finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this film would be a great feature film but unfortunately it didn't live long enough. What happened to that?  I have seen many people make their movies and it is almost impossible to get in. The ending is extremely unsatisfense and even the most beloved movies like 'All The Good' or 'Man From Another Land' have an ending that doesn't leave much room for enjoyment and the story lines do not make it up to me. The story of the film itself is a flat and horrible, there is no direction nor any action. The only other reason I would suggest is that the story is so obviously put together that it seems not intended to be an original movie but instead a re-created one. The end is so bad that I'm actually surprised if it was put out by a commercial company. Even when I first saw this film I couldn't believe it had more to do with the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like horror films, but this one isn't very good, although very entertaining at times. The acting is flat, not all there. The idea behind the movie is that it's about a guy whose wife is really a monster, but then it's just not true. There's no real way to stop her killing her husband and taking his life, and she has no interest in killing him or anyone else. I didn't think I'd be a fan of this movie, but I think this is just the kind of bad horror movies that aren't much good at all. I recommend to avoid this one. It's just terrible. If you have a curiosity, then watch it on the same channel with the "Rolley" storyline as it's called. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film "Dancing with The Devil" is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but it fails because it lacks any depth. The premise is that the Devil will go to visit a girl (Lylienia) to bring her back into a happy family and that she'll have to choose a partner, but the plot quickly goes bad after it goes out of control. The story is simply ridiculous. The actress who is the lead is pretty good in the beginning, but then it is simply the girl who is at home in a strange and bizarre environment. The director of the film (the man who filmed it) had a hard time with the whole idea of "Dating With The Devil", because it is ridiculous and just made him look ridiculous.  The cast of characters in the movie are really bad, because they had no real character growth. The woman who is set on the couch in the first scene (the one that leads the plot) is just a stereotypical slut (or a good movie character who is obviously heterosexual). The other two women were the stereotypical "hot" women that the film is supposed too, and the idea of a woman who has a big ass, and who has made this film, is also ridiculous. It also shows a weird relationship between the Devil and the family, which the movie does not even explain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the title and "The Outraged Soul" were not enough to communicate how much this film was. The film was simply bad. Aside from the fact that the film was bad, I had to assume that the title was merely for a "one night in a small town" movie. While I thought "The Soul" would be a good movie to watch, I couldn't believe that the movie was anything else.  The problem is that the only character that I actually wanted to see was The God Eater, the film is very generic and relies on some incredibly bad special effects. I did, at least, like it. However, the movie is completely lacking in story, story, and atmosphere. I really felt that this film would have been better as a series of unrelated movies where we could see the characters interacting with each other and learn more about the lives of the people who are on earth.    This movie is a complete waste of money. This movie also doesn't really deliver much. It's a pretty cheap story, which is expected. The God eater is very good as his boss. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that I have never in my life sat down and watched as it would have been. You can imagine me saying, 'I think I should stay off that road.' I couldn't believe what I had seen when the'stars' were in. It was obviously an effort to try to make a "thrill" movie with an absolutely ridiculous plot. In this case, it just plain plain was wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was horrible. The plot was terrible. The dialog was bad. I watched it twice, and I hated it. I didn't know that any of the actors could have gotten the job for the show. I felt very sick after watching it.  The only good thing that I left in it was the music. Some of the songs sounded a bit better. But at the end of the show, they didn't. The acting could have been done better than that. The show was absolutely terrible.  I don't think it was a big deal. It was a cheap stunt for some of the people involved, but I was so bored by it I felt they had pulled something a bit more important and should have done it. Perhaps they didn`t get the job out of their jobs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had so many flaws that I couldn't find one, but I have seen much worse horror movies. If you are looking for a movie with some good gore, this would be the best choice for you. But unfortunately, it was no good. From beginning to end you feel like you could die.  There is a certain point where you get to feel sorry for yourself. For example, the guy's girlfriend and the director are in the same room... it's difficult not to tell exactly how they died. If I hadn't seen it yet I would probably be killed...  If you were watching the movie, I don't have any personal opinions on it. But, I still wanted to get my money back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just did a movie of a movie: 'The Little Girl' in it! I read this in my copy and i thought it was interesting. But the thing got so bad that i couldn't watch it. It was so boring that i just stopped watching it. I'm a person who enjoys documentaries, and i found that this was the most boring i've seen. There was too many actors that seemed to act like they weren't even actors and had horrible scenes. The girls were forced to act as they did in 'Lisana' and this movie just showed us how stupid we could make people like the people in the movie. There were a bunch of jokes in the film that were absolutely ridiculous. There should have been more actors in the whole movie, especially for the little girl in the end. It just wasn't right to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not a good movie if you've got a pair of twins to watch. Not even that much fun, it's a piece of trash. I'm considering it for the sake of time alone. If I didn't like the movie I wouldn't have remembered it. It's not fun to watch either of them. I would have laughed at this but I was unable to go through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is terrible. What was the point when it is made? The way I felt when I watched this film was that it was a mindless and pointless copy of the classic film of "The Wizard of Oz". Yes, it tries to have some semblance of integrity, but it doesn't. The plot is stupid. What is it? What is that about? For example, a little girl is found in a cave and she is tied up in her own blood, so she is being used to help people as she is in a real prison. The girl is also involved in a secret movie that is being made in a prison in Korea, where she is supposed to be killed by some people. What are these people doing? Why don't they show any reaction to this? Why doesn't they go out and take an airplane with them? If you get to the plane, what happens? This is the first film I have ever seen that I was convinced I would not pay money to see because it would ruin the film for me, and I didn't. This is simply a crap film. I do hope people will learn that it is all too bad to warrant a rental at all. This film does not deserve an Oscar! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen a movie that so totally violates the law of decency. This movie was not the best of the bunch, but it was the worst of the biz, i would have preferred this movie to go to "Star Wars" or something more, with more epic space adventures. This was just a really bad, badly made movie with nothing that made it stand out. I have to admit, I thought that the camera was good and all was good but it didn't make this movie interesting. I won't see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so completely boring, you would have heard it twice. After some time you wonder if you will ever hear it again. Then you realise you will never get the full story of this film. There are no plot twists, nothing happens, you have no sense of an ending, no real meaning (in the sense that there's a meaning), just a lot of bad acting and a very weak story. If this film was made on a budget, it would probably be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sequel to the dumb-ass dumb-and-dangerous trash that was Dumb and Dangerous, and a sequel of Dumb and Deadly was Dumb & Deadly too, and so Dumb and D-busy that I couldn't even finish the series. Even after it was made, the film is still a moronic mess. I don't want to read any more of this, because I didn't really like it anyway. I just couldn't find any of the characters. It is about a guy who, in order to make a dent in an old woman, has to find a mysterious cave full of women and demons and has to destroy some of her body parts. It's ridiculous that this is supposed to be a horror film. For once, at least, this is really scary and not a horror story. In fact, it is so bad that I didn'n't even enjoy watching it. I wish I had known better films. I never got too tired after watching it on Sunday. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Sugger" is actually quite good on the face - it's a bit stupid and silly, but it's also pretty boring. But unfortunately it's too difficult to follow and can't really be sure where the main story line is. If you're looking for something more to watch than a movie: you might want to watch "Swing Song" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film follows a rather predictable plot--you can't help the mind, you can't control it--that is all. Even though this is an effort, it doesn't seem like a very interesting movie. They make a small number of small details that are usually the same for every movie: "The Black and White", "I Dream of Love", etc. If they make the same effort, that seems like a pretty good movie. But this has no end. And even the little characters in it don't make anything interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion is that this film is awful because it does not take into account all the possibilities involved in this genre of film. I have never seen a film with this glaringly obvious theme as a theme. There is not enough film to compare this one to one that focuses on the horrors of life in the world.  But what does this film do that is this sort of bad?  The director and stars clearly had a vision for the movie but that vision does not translate to film.  The story isn't much of a story and the only moments are the scenes which are supposed to represent what the movie is about. In the end the filmmaker just wants to portray something which is not interesting and is therefore not made for a good film. The film is also not very compelling. The acting is badly done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was a collection of dumb, mediocre comedy that couldn't get a good laugh from anywhere. The story line is very, very bad, but the movie is pretty good. But as we've stated above, if you're looking for something that actually has an interesting plot, this film is a poor one. The only thing worth watching is the title. You can see it in The Great Escape, which is a different story, and this one can't be shown in The Greatest Escape. I've seen it in a video store, and it was good, but they pulled this out of their shelves. It doesn't even come close to The Great Flight. The main problem with this film was that it was very, VERY expensive, but it also cost a lot of money. The acting was terrible, and the only saving grace was the soundtrack. It was horrible, really bad, the music was terrible. The special effects were OK, and were probably better, but this film simply was terrible in every respect. I'm surprised I hadn't seen a good movie: it was so bad it had to be in a theater, but you'd never see that. I would have even said this was a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a piece of crap that Mr. Teller did on this film, I mean this was an insult to the fans of classic fantasy movies. It's just a waste of time. When a story has good writing, that's when you watch it. This film just doesn't have one. There is no plot, the characters are simply two guys (in different roles) that are in love with a girl (so stupid, really?). Why this film was even made in the first place is beyond me. The acting is very bad, but the plot has been made so much better in other movies than this. The story of the relationship between two men is too convoluted, and the characters don't even have a story. I wish this film would be released by the British Film Society, it doesn't seem like it was made to be released. When this was made, it should have been released by SCTV, it's their own show, and not just a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is obviously a stupid movie. This is why I'd have expected to receive an invitation from the casting room to "see what they have to offer" after seeing the film and the director.  There are several scenes that don't seem to make much sense. In one scene, a character has been shot in an apartment in a dark room on a dark desk, and then stabbed, in what seems to be a completely unbelievable location. This film would make me question my own intelligence, but I don't remember. I didn't even want to ask the director, either.   There's also a scene in which a man is sitting on his bed as his wife looks at him.  I have never read that in a theater before.  This film is awful. It's a pity that there was a cast in this movie. I'd much rather be entertained by a movie that doesn't make sense. It just doesn't have much to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was absolutely awful. If you like John Lynch, you will love this movie. If not you'll hate it. The plot is unbelievable, the acting is awful, and the story lacks any sort of development, the only redeeming factor being that there's a cameo in the movie. This is not the way to do a movie: just watch "I'm a little like" and let your imagination go. You'll never be happy. You don't even know who's supposed to be playing the character. Oh, well, sorry John Lynch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two minutes are OK, but then the beginning and end is awful, then the movie drifts out like a wet dog.  The film is just not that great, although it's OK as an independent film. A lot of the time the film resembles a movie where people are going through life, a movie that is going through the motions of death. There's no life in the movie, there's nothing but death. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies which has always been made by people who really shouldn't know what they're doing, and thus we're left with a veritable mystery. The only thing I can figure out is that it's an attempt to recreate the famous 'The Castle of Fame', which has seen its star transformed into 'The Fable'. The film, however, appears to be a sequel to something that never had made before. I found this film on 'Thoroughly Fantastic Movie Fables', and I thought it lacked much of the originality of the 'Fables', even though they were two very famous actors. If you're looking for an alternative, watch The Castle of Castle Fame instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this is the second movie I can see that I can not turn into a movie. As I have read the book, this was obviously not the best movie for the genre. The acting was horrible. The plot was stupid and I can't stand for the horrible acting of the other actors. I am sorry to see that some people are too optimistic. I have no confidence that any of the actors in this movie could have acted that convincibly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the same plot over and over again of all the movies in the 1990s that seem to aim for an audience for cheap laughs rather than an actual movie, but fortunately, this has been an exception. I don't think this film was any good. I didn't get it either. I only understood the idea of it, but I didn´t like it. I really didn't like the story of it. It's so bad that you can watch it and laugh at it and not have a clue what the message it is. And when I watched it, my heart was breaking and I wanted to kill myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What? An hour and a half a half or more of one film starring the same actors from the 1990 movie "The Mighty Mighty Mighty" with the same script (see below) and an old lady who falls in love with the young boy she is now in the movie. It's the same old lady that dies and returns back to a new, less creepy, life in a hospital. This is only the second part of the film, and while it may appear to be a romantic comedy (or, rather, a documentary) it really isn't that great. The characters are in their old, dark, lifeless state, the story is poorly drawn, the acting is terrible, and the plot is totally un-thought out. It is impossible to believe that the director thought to take this picture and make a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'll try to describe it, if there is a writer and director and a plot.  There is one thing that is obvious to me--the story is not interesting to the viewers, because it is predictable and boring, and that is what I was hoping to see when I sat down on the plane and watched it.  This movie is about a mother who wants to get rid of her ex-husband in an effort to keep a good reputation. This is the least interesting story I have seen this year. The woman is crazy. She has been with a man for the longest time and can't wait to lose him to her ex.  It doesn't take long for her husband to make love for the mother who gave her son everything she had ever wanted, and she doesn't even try to keep her feelings to her daughter.  So why is this story so terrible? A lot of people (I know there are some people out there in Canada who think this movie is perfect) seem to think that the ex is a real person who kills his wife, but not only does she kill him but also kills his mother and she has to figure out why he killed her mother. It's not like she just kills him. The ex is the killer. The only reason that bothers me is the way the story is written.  The story is weak, and I can't blame the writer and writer, as they should have known better. It is a movie that really shouldn't have made it to the screen. I can see why someone who has the time to make this movie would spend so much time putting in too much time and cost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i don't know why anyone would bother even to watch this movie. It is just a really bad movie. I know what the writers think when they make movies, but that doesn't make me want to watch them. Also, they don't even seem to understand the main problem, even though this movie does get some fairly good laughs. The plot is stupid, the acting is lousy, and the music is bad (though there is some decent songs). Overall, this movie should have been filmed in a professional studio. I am a big fan of horror films and can only hope that they do better. But I guess you can't blame it on the badness of this movie, it was released at the wrong year. I'm hoping they would hire a few talented directors to make a better movie than this movie; sadly, that's not going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this were a horror movie, it would be a nightmare. But it's not. It's really, really awful. I mean, really really really awful, that's what I'm saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was a waste of some money. I thought that the plot would have been interesting, but the casting seemed weak. The ending was really awful. And the story has the feel of a bad Sci-Fi flick - a lot of pointless story elements with no real relevance to the real life. I will admit that it was a good concept at first - but I didn't know if it had any real importance. I think that it's better for Sci-fi flicks like this to focus on character development and an interesting plot. I wouldn't have thought that a movie this weak would have a storyline or a plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So if you want to see a straight man-on-star like David Spitz, this is not the movie for you. Instead, I guess you could say this is about a gay film with a big man. Or you could just see it as a straight guy-on top of a pile of meat with a hot girl on his back. There's no nudity in this movie. That's the only way I can blame this movie for it's failure. The movie is not funny at all, neither hilarious nor interesting. It's just another crappy gay film. Avoiding this one is not all that much fun. But if you like one, then you might enjoy this one. It just seems like Spitz is trying to recreate the movie he made in the 1990's. This movie would benefit a little bit more than it does now. But it's not enough to warrant this film's 10 minutes. But we'll bet that Spitz will make something better than the mediocre sequel to this movie: he will make a comedy film in the same vein as his classic film, "Tugging." Now who would expect that? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching the movie, and after the credits started I couldn't get into the movie to try it. I only watched for the benefit of it for its shock factor. I was not expecting a good movie from it.  This movie was a waste of a shot. I could not believe that it was going to be a feature film. I wanted so bad to see it, but unfortunately I did not really appreciate it. Not that this is a bad place to take a movie, but just to say that it is not a good place to choose as a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very satisfied with the first film, and even thought the original, "Avengers" was fairly good. But this movie is worse than the original. The problem is that, because the original was such a cool concept, it's much worse than a sequel.  I will say the movie was OK but the main problem is the fact that it was so, SO MUCH BULLY! (I actually think the sequel was better) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen it and I really don't think that it was made for anybody to watch. There are just a lot of people in this movie that look like they are very stupid. Just some guys that don't act like they're playing games. There was a short clip of a young girl that looked really interesting but when you watch the scene, she was totally predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a bad, awful movie with a horrible plot, terrible camera movements, a horrible cast (Brianna) and a horrible story. This is a shame, but I found this very disappointing in a very different way. I am very glad to see that some people actually found this worthy - but I suspect that no one else will. This movie will probably be a footnote to people's list of classic movies. It is no excuse for people to waste the time on it and a terrible burden for people with little or no idea of self-presence to be made fun of in this garbage. The only way I can make this film is to turn it into a nightmare. My opinion - 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it is a documentary, the most painful part is the attempt to create a movie about a murder mystery. The only problem that I could imagine in this would be that you just don't know the facts.  It seems like it would have been better for it to start out in one of the two films with the murderer.  The film was not very well directed, especially with the character's behavior as the murderer, and it was very bad that they made the character look as if they had a motive to kill. The rest of the movie was a little better. The mystery of the killer is interesting though, as a guy who murders people, and can't stop being murderers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the comments on this movie: I thought it was pretty funny. But unfortunately, it isn't funny.  Just don't watch this film.  Don't want to watch the first hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film it is impossible to find out that "The Matrix" was not the movie "The Ring". The acting is awful and the story is weak. There is no story, it just some stupid characters, they are not human characters, not even human. There are no interesting characters, except the one that has to be the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I noted earlier, the premise that the movie is about is completely absurd. It isn't even an example of the classic Hollywood movie genre. That being said, if this is a good film, there are much better things to say about it than to say the same thing. That said, this isn't one of the better films I have seen lately. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have seen in years. The plot is weak, the action is horrible, the acting is bad and the plot is dull. The ending is just bad. This film does not deserve your top spot. Don't waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has bad acting, bad dialog, bad direction, bad plot, bad acting...  I'm not even mad about the fact that this movie is about one of the worst films I have ever seen, but I do have to be ashamed of this stupid flick. the plot is awful, the script is bad, it's not even funny, the fact the lead character's in is ridiculous. I'm pretty sure that the only person that could have made a worse movie would have been the one who made this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two issues that make this movie so terrible.  First, it takes no time whatsoever to describe why it is a "modern" film. It's simply a simple, dumb movie that follows the usual formula of cheap action, guns, and stupid dialog, with the rest of the story not even being developed until after the film is released.  Secondly, what is the plot? Why does it take some long time for someone to die and see the body in some office? What is the "plot" of the film?  I couldn't understand it, even though I knew that the story would have to come and the people would die anyway. I don't have a sense of any plot. It just is a lot of stupid stuff. It is so dumb and bad and so unbelievable that you just wonder why there would ever be a movie that "spares" someone from dying.  If this movie was a good one, it certainly would be worthwhile to see.  I don´t blame the writer. It does have its points. It can't be as bad as it is, it is no more than a one-act film. But you also want to know the story before you see it.  But this is the way that you can only hope that a sequel could make this story better. Otherwise you might not like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're looking for a "classic, independent, film: The Adventures of Flemish Adventure", do not look for this movie. It's not like it ever was. It contains nothing but a bunch of clichés. The movie starts out with a plot, a hero named Jack-Chunk, who rescues his older sister who is suffering from a deadly disease, but when the hero arrives, it becomes a disaster. Then, Jack-chunk gets caught up in some very suspicious circumstances. Jack- Chunk and his sister (Sara) must defend a secret plot of a wealthy couple, who wants to use some of their wealth to create a giant forest. Then when they do so, they get caught in an accident and need to find out who is the culprit.  This movie is just the opposite of a good movie: The story is not good, the characters are weak and the story is completely lacking in any kind of context that might be interesting.  Even with the great camera work (which is admittedly not shown much) the movie doesn't come alive. A lot of scenes are not quite impressive and nothing happens. And this is all the reason you might consider skipping this movie altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is OK but it's not the reason why I dropped this movie. Maybe the director, or the writers, have an idea and that is where he can find an interesting idea. But if the writer has no clue, then I guess he must have been mad. And since it's a movie with only a plot, it can't be that mad. In the end it is just an excuse to forget how to think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this movie was written because it was supposed to be the next big fantasy movie and was slated to be in the sequel to the first movie. It was not one. It wasn't even one of the two. This movie was stupid, and one of several dozen films that had bad writing and bad directing. There was nothing to talk about, no story, no message, nothing that was worthwhile. I was disappointed in most of the things I thought I watched. I can only assume that my brain is so slow that I just couldn't keep watching the film. I gave up watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just another excuse to see a bunch of white guys, a bunch-of white guys trying to "be part of the community," and a bunch in a car that is obviously driven by the white guys. They are not very convincing actors, but this is pretty far away from a film that would have to be an experience. It is an un-satisfied film - a simple little comedy movie, a little bit of crime, and the sort of "wacky comedy" that is just ridiculous. What a pity that this film is not able to find some representation in which it can be a real comedy.  This is just an excuse to make yourself feel like a bit of fun. But, if you are not looking for a real film, you will miss much of the value of making a movie: the entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's pretty predictable. You know the story of a mother who loses all money and finds herself going to her brother's house and then losing the man in that house. But then you think it's going to be a horror film and you get in a car with the other actor and you wonder what was going on and who was going to stay after the car.  I felt that the acting was very weak in most of the scenes and the directing was bad (at least for an hour, maybe a week, if not days) throughout. The cinematography wasn't good, either. The actors didn't stand out as they did in the previous scenes, which makes the film seem like a slasher of a "Dancing With Aloha" type thriller.  The only thing that was good in the film was the opening scene. But that scene was obviously cut when you first see it. There was no signifier as to where it belongs to the movie. The ending seemed to be interesting and there was a good finish to it but it seemed like a "sudden death" or a "scary ending" of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just horrible, i mean i was expecting something interesting and nothing that this movie could deliver is either great or funny but this movie just doesnt deliver anything, it is just the same boring boring story as the other two films that are more or less interesting to the audiences of people that watch this one. The plot is only 2 main reasons i will never see this movie again, 1) The originality of it is obviously the least interesting and 2) it was poorly scripted.  The only redeeming feature in this movie is the fact that one of the characters kills the other person so that he has the ability to carry out the revenge.  If you are a serious person and have some taste in your heart for real horror, you might be disappointed by this film and you will most likely not go out of your way to see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, I'm afraid of, was so weak in its plot that it was simply impossible to make the actors even make themselves, or even their characters, feel anything. The acting was bad enough to make you really bored, and the plot was completely useless.  The story, though, did manage to have something to do, especially the character of the mysterious "Godzilla" which, in this case, had a twist which we never see again.  I guess if you are interested in watching a movie from the early 1930's, you could have skipped to the beginning. The rest was not even interesting, and I just can't seem to care too much about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've read the book and have even seen the film, it'll be pretty obvious that this is a really bad movie. The story seems to be a poor one. There was only one person in the whole house who had the personality to go along with the bad acting.  The story is about a big, powerful man (Zoltron, who was basically an obnoxious but immature guy who worked in the military). He kidnaps his daughter, and after having sex with her and then kissing her, we discover that she had been abused by her mother. The abuse is pretty simple, in most instances, with him beating her. After he dies, he comes back, and he steals her money so she can get rich again. She wants to get the money back, but she wants to make sure he doesn't do it again. What happened with the car? A lot of stuff happens in that car, including a huge fight, which only makes sense when it has something to do with him. Also, the guy was killed when he hit the car. You can try to guess why, but you'll probably just get out of the movie with a horrible story. It's pretty basic, but the overall picture can't help with that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to watch a movie with a "high budget" budget, it's called "The Devil Wears Out" so, that's what it is.  Now, it contains an appalling plot, a ridiculous plot, bad dialog, bad acting and bad direction, a terrible plot and bad directing. But, it is a movie that has more action and suspense than any other Hollywood movies: The Devil Wines In a huge gas-can of flame! The Devil drinks "wine" in a jungle and kills the man that was about to kill himself!  The plot has a very simple plot. It's a tale of a man who has to drink to drink with demons! And since it's so important to get rid of the Devil, I thought that would be a very interesting storyline. But it doesn't. I'm afraid you'd miss the best scene of the entire movie: the Devil Wakes In a jungle on a tented jungle full of demons and the demon's "evil" daughter.  The Devil does a very poor job, because the "bad" acting was so bad that the story had only a 30 minutes of screen time before the movie finally becomes ridiculous. There were a few scenes that didn't work so badly but that were still pretty funny. But the "action" had so much of "the Devil" being portrayed in an absurd way and it didn't make me laugh.  As I said, there were some really good moments in "The Devils Wines" but they weren't there. The movie doesn't take its place in the "story" very much. In the end, the movie seems to just drag out as it goes on. I mean, the Devil does eat the "guys" to drink into his belly and then kills his "family" so he can consume their blood! Oh! That's not OK! The plot of "The devils of the forest" was completely unbelievable and had no semblance of a storyline. Even if you didn't see it yourself, you might see it as a totally unbelievable movie, because you just think that it's a movie about demons! But, the acting was bad. The whole movie had no direction or dialog.  This movie was an insult to the "The Brothers Grimm" for not even having some more interesting dialogue! The ending is truly depressing.  It is OK that this movie is in German, but this movie has nothing more disgusting than that! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad and one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is bad because it focuses on how badly a person does that she doesn't succeed in this. It just makes the viewer think that she's a great person who needs to win in the "game" because she's better than everyone else. When you want to say that this is a movie, you need to look at the beginning of this movie: The first part is about a group of girls who are part of the group. After the group is dissolved, the main character is a girl who falls in love with her friends. That is okay because the first part could be quite good. The second part shows the girl is sad and she tries to save the lives of her friends, but the only way she accomplishes this is by committing suicide. At the beginning she has a really great group of friends, the second part contains a scene of the murder of one of her girlfriends (the group is so horrible that no one cares about) but after she is killed, she kills her friends' mother and makes a lot of money with her mother. The third part of this story is a horror-story. We only see a few parts of this part, and they don't really add to anything.  The last thing you need is a lot more time in your life. I only give it 2 stars because it looks interesting. But, I can't believe that it's only about the first hour, as the movie is so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was just reading about this movie, and I felt like I was going to cry. In the movie it just seemed like one of those awful "horror movies" that you have seen before. I thought that it wasn't scary at all and I had to see the movie to decide. I think that in the end I should have skipped it. It was a bit difficult for me to watch this one because I couldn't find the "story" that was going on. I was sure I would never buy it, but if I was allowed to rent it, I would certainly watch it and I would just say "No, this is bad! This movie sucks!". I don't understand the plot. I didn't get the idea that the monsters were going to grow after the monster was attacked by the human and were going away and then would take them into the town, but I think it was just an attempt to shock. My guess is that it was designed to scare people because there would be people that would see them as monsters. I mean you can't act like the monsters and the people would just sit around waiting for an attack. The movie didn't really show us anything that would make me laugh. My god, this movie is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a long list of "films" that are awful or good but this one had me wondering. It's a stupid idea. This movie has one very annoying character. I would have guessed better at that point. But it was so bad I didn't really care. I felt so bad for the guy. I'd like to hear someone saying that I was a great man to me but that guy didn't do that. The actors were horrible in their performances. I could just shake my head and say that they were bad actors. The ending was very disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see the film and thought it was very boring and extremely predictable, with no real plot, which didn't provide any sense of substance and it was completely predictable in the way that it was written. It is nothing to do with a serious plot, nothing like I have ever seen before, and has really nothing to go on.   The film contains a few plot twists, such as that the lead character dies, and the lead protagonist kills the girl he cares about, as well as a scene where the lead dies. There are no real storyline, although they might work in the context of the film, but there is some pretty vague action sequences.  I really didn't understand what the "adventure" really meant. There was nothing more or less interesting than the plot, so it doesn't really come together, and there was no real story. And the acting is pretty poor, particularly the acting of the leads and the supporting characters, with the most annoying of the "friends" and the people they care about getting killed.  You don't get any great depth. It seems to be very simple to act out, and it isn't terribly interesting. I didn't really enjoy it. I don't understand why the lead would have cared about anybody else's fate.  The last thing I should say is that it's not really a film. There's nothing else like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had read the book and enjoyed it, but I found it totally irrelevant. The end of the novel (a few weeks later) was where we'd really have to sit down and see the ending to "Journey." I thought that would be a good place to start. Unfortunately, I had too much time to plan, so I decided to read the first part of the book to see the story in the book. After reading the book, I realized that I was wrong.   The plot was nothing like what you would expect to see from any book. It had a bunch of goofy characters. In the book (which I hadn't even touched on, nor seen), you get to know who the person is and what they care about. Not so here. The characters had no character development whatsoever, in fact, had no life storyline. I can't blame the actors, but they were simply not developed in a way that made sense.  I'd like to see better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, by no means, is a rip off of the film "Darkwing Duck". The plot of it seems to be missing the point and even worse then that. It is like watching a movie that is filmed in a totally different context than that film. The story is just another story that involves a series of teenagers, the story of them, and the two sisters, who live in a neighborhood. The characters do not seem to come alive like they do in the movies. The acting is extremely weak. The "fight" was just a series after the scene in "Dark Duck", it would have worked better if they did something as dramatic as it does with "Dark Wing Duck".   Not to mention that the only two main characters in this movie are Duck and Ducket. There are plenty of other characters in "Duck" so you can see how this story is supposed to be written.   The fact that I gave this movie a rating is not due to any fault of the writers, the production quality of the movie is very poor. For instance, a movie in this type of film would not be rated anything lower than I give it a rating. If you are looking for an old movie in a good way, don't waste any money on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is awful, the direction is bad, the characters are horrible, the scenery is bad...  If you would like a cheap car and a few good movies like this one or any decent Sci-Fi movie would be better...  But this one is horrible and bad and you can't expect anything from this one. The idea of a plot to break through the chaos of the aliens and their supercomputer is simply a bad attempt to accomplish the goal.   There are three scenes that are much better than the rest of the movie, and there are three more scenes that don't. The film has no storyline and no plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Hush" is pretty bad when it comes out in the USA, especially when you consider the many reviews of this film and the reviews from the other countries of the world. For starters, the plot is basically nothing to recommend but the story's predictable and predictable. The acting is bad, mainly by the bad actors who are not even very convincing. The plot is not much better than "The Butterfly" which is one of the best movies from Mexico but it still lacks the kind of "fascination" that is seen in "The Girl in the Yellow Tree" (which is one very good movie about the girl in a tree). The first 2 minutes of "HUSH" seem to be about a guy who murders a woman and then is killed by a woman who kills another person. After the second person (the killer) is killed, there's a moment when a girl appears. Now it seems like the girl is screaming about something that happened at some point in the movie but she looks like she had an eye in the dark and she keeps screaming about it because she's not seeing anything.  There are many other things to consider about "HURCH" but it's not the best. If you are expecting a movie with a plot to change the events, you might think "Hunch" is the best but it really is the worst. If that were the case I would probably give "Humble" 2.5 points but it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is simple and uninteresting, but that's fine for a movie in a comedy, but when it comes across it is a completely useless mess. The characters do not seem like they want to be in the movie... they just want to live in a boring environment with a few good jokes and a few big stars. They are so not funny. This is no laughing good.  The story is quite good, but I just couldn't believe the story. The ending is bad, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie was a film made for "B"s, it would be a wonderful movie. Unfortunately, it turned into a "b" movie, in which we got no chance of winning. The acting was awful, the plot was terrible, the story was not developed.  I was really hoping for a movie based on the "b"-story. Unfortunately this movie is nothing but garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the movie is a sequel, I have to admit that there are some parts of it that are actually good. Unfortunately, the movie does not go that far.  I didn't see enough in it to justify watching it over the weekend. The movie is about a bunch of people who decide to live out their lives in a plastic village in a closed-door community. They make friends in this world and decide how they want to be. One member is a member of a secret society, one of whom is dressed as a doctor and uses a huge motor car as a vehicle of destruction.   A major issue is the way the car is set up. The car is built into a house that is then rented out to the community members. They are not the owners of the house, it is an individual owner. A couple of the characters have access to the car, but their car is used by other car owners. This has a serious problem, as the car owners are all alone as they go about the house as they act out and kill everyone who gets in. The acting is very bad. The plot is weak and the ending is unsatisfied. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad-to-treat, but it wasn't that bad. If this movie is the best the director had the movie in. It isn't.  What really bothered me was that it didn't make much of the points that this movie did. It was so dumb, I thought it would be a comedy with a couple of friends that we could all laugh and love. But instead of that, it had a bunch of jokes about a few kids. No laughs.  Not funny enough. I felt like I was watching two movies on the same two movies, and I couldn't find anything else to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this movie, even though I know it's about 40-something, I can't stand seeing it because it's too horrible to live. Even though I'm very familiar with the movie, I found it really awful. First of all, I think you should be able to find it anywhere, even in the "watched" section on TV. Secondly, I don't like watching a lot of movies in the same movie theatre. They're not like movies for adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for a few hours when it came out in 1992 and was so confused at the beginning that I felt really sick when the movie started. This is why you see a lot of films that aren't really intended for those two reasons.  This movie had a couple of interesting moments that made me care more and a few minutes where the camera looked like the director in a bad-ass scene. I just couldn't figure out if the director had seen The Ring before. Also, I could not believe that the director even had seen this film. I know I am wrong about this movie but I didn't really feel the movie in its entirety. The actors who made this movie weren't there at all, the storyline was too similar to the plot, the characters were too stupid to make a convincing performance, the plot had no clear storyline.  I did like that the ending was pretty funny but the ending seemed like a very long time in the making, too long to be the end.  The cast is OK though. I wish they all got along well with each other and they were all pretty good but the characters lacked an overall feeling.  As to the story, it's one of those movies that I'd like to watch over and over again but nothing I can really say about it. It is OK, I think, but not much better. This isn't an overall good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending is not as bad as the opening sequence and there are better things. I just cannot believe that these two people could deliver so bad dialogue in such a small time frame, without such a plot. The plot is too slow, the acting is terrible, and the story is completely pointless. In what seemed like hours, we are treated to another dull scene. I have the best time in my life to sit through the first scene when the whole thing is happening, but it sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing. It starts with a strange man (I think that I am talking of the man who was the son of a mysterious "witch") who has been looking for a girl. The man has a habit of hitting the girl and making sure she won't escape, so she doesn't - and it doesn't help the man - do anything else.  Then, at the beginning of the movie (after the story of the woman) it turns into a rape scene and then a murder plot involving some of the girl's boyfriend. It's horrible. The girl is tortured in some form or another by the man, who kills her.  At the beginning, the man makes off with the girl, but it's impossible to find out how. It doesn't matter if you watched it before - because, according to my friend (who watched it, on her own computer), it is horrible.   The director (who's name is "BJ") has a pretty girl who is supposed to be a very sexy blonde. That might seem strange, but that's not a bad thing. It would be nice if she was a very attractive person - instead, she's ugly. This is the movie that "The Girl in Bed" was made on. This movie is just a waste of a film - although I don't think it was all that bad. I'm pretty certain it would have been a better movie if the girl was hot and a little more intelligent than her brother. I do not think this is a movie that could attract you or even make you forget about it. If you're a young girl, it's going to be really embarrassing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't get it when I rented the movie on DVD and watched it twice in theaters. And I don't think I got it for cheap either because I was a big fan of the original series. What I do know is that the actors who were supposed to play the two guys are awful, and they are so overworked. I think the only thing I want to see is a movie that has a decent story and has a good cast. It seems to be nothing but a cheap, hackneyed exercise of acting. I can see that the director didn't take this into consideration, and he just threw it in the trash cans. There are a lot of people who like these movies and I think that they will probably find it too funny, if not. I don`t see myself as one who likes movies that are stupid and lame, but I don\'t want to find out that. I'd like to see a comedy with a decent plot and story as a main focus of the story and I don't believe this is one of those. I'll try my luck with other movies and see if it works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so horrible I couldn't believe what I just saw. Even worse than the "Star Trek 2: The Search For Extrachromes" movie. I've seen it only two days before... I knew I couldn`t believe it wasn't just the movie.  If you see this movie, PLEASE don`t rent it, and don`T buy it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only way that this movie is interesting is the 'possible explanation' that a killer is hunting for someone who murdered the son of the 'father's son'. This is simply stupid and stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i mean, i'm not a big fan of i mean like i hate it but, i just don't get why i'm wasting my time watching this crap... i give it 2/3 stars but it's not really much better than the old "B-17" from 1997. It is absolutely nothing that any of the actors or actresses would be good in doing. I mean, the guy is a real piece of garbage. If i had been watching this for a couple of days, i would have felt like i was making a movie for old ladies like me. The whole movie revolves around the death of a young girl who is obsessed with her father, which is really ridiculous to me. She starts off hating her father so that she starts being very manipulative towards him and while she is going on to try to keep him, i could get mad with her. Now i'm wondering if the kid ever tried to find out her father's whereabouts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film when I was young, and it was only an hour-long viewing, but I couldn't really stomach it. It had really low budget for it's time, which really made it look like a really awful movie. It didn't really have much character development beyond the fact that it was based on a few very boring characters, and when it was in the original book, it was pretty horrible. The story was a predictable, predictable story, and the characters were not really believable. I was even more annoyed because the movie gave so many unrealistic reasons for having the characters in a cave, and then showed us a reason for why they were trapped, and that wasn't really convincing.  What I did end up watching was "The Cave of The Legend" instead of "The Legend", and I think it was so bad I was watching the movie that I had a huge headache afterwards.  It was really annoying. I had no idea what the main characters were supposed to be, and I'm sure that they would make more sense. The villain was a man who said that his dead corpse was a cave with a strange presence. Why he was so stupid was unclear. The only other person who was a part of it was also unclear. I have to assume that the people who made this film were very cheap at the beginning. I really think they had to give it some thought before the movie was finished.  I had really expected a movie to be a real story about a secret cave that had been discovered and filled with mysteries. I guess that I was wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing thing i've ever seen in a horror movie. The first scene is so lame that I just watched the whole movie with a pair of eyes... I think the actors in the movie were in their underwear. I'll never pay $2 for this movie ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is very bad if it were to be viewed in a single frame.  If we look at the film's structure alone (which is the only thing worth seeing from this piece of garbage) then there are some beautiful scenes (like the underwater scenes, underwater scenes and so on) but no matter how much you like it. The plot is pretty bad, the acting is horrible and the cinematography is terrible. The story itself is stupid and there is some great special effects but they were used in a bad way. I give this movie 4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a total piece of garbage in every way it could have been. It was predictable, pointless, and pointless. What made the movie great was the way the movie portrayed the people of the South and the relationship between the south and the north. The way the South was portrayed as a racist country while the north was portrayed by the northern nation as a peaceful nation. This is where the movie got the idea that the northeres had to get along with the south. I have a feeling that the film was made on a purely romantic basis. I think it has nothing to do with what is really going on in the South, the south has nothing in common with the rest of the nation, and the South is just as ignorant about the rest the country, as the northere has been. The film tried to find some sort of balance by using the race of the norton and the race for the south to help and communicate the other in the middle. But when you are a movie, it is supposed to make things that actually are not part of the movie's story, not just part of its plot. This movie is just that. I'm looking at you right now, and I would not have done this. I tried to watch the movie with my friends, and it didn't do anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a name like "The Black Panther" - no Black Panther - no man - no "Prow of Blood" - and no Panther - and a whole lot of stupidity.   What do we get from the name of "The Negroes"??? What do you expect? No Black Panther? No Panther? A man who says to Black Panther who is the Panther's "son"? No Panther's son who is a killer? No black man?  The Black Panther in this movie was supposed to be Black Panther's cousin. The brother had a brother and a baby with him. But that brother says he can only have one cousin, and that cousin was "my cousin", and the cousin said he is "my brother's cousin".  This brother and the nephews were supposed to come together and help the Panther help the Black Panther. The Panther's supposed to help them. But the Black Panthers never come to help the people. The Black Panthers are only in the case of one cousin.  This is bad film that is not worth viewing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What an absolutely dreadful movie: so many boring scenes and too many stupid lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie follows the usual formula of taking some old clichéd story and adapting it to the film world. It seems that it was so absurd to believe that a young teenager would do something so crazy. It is just not convincing. I really wanted to keep watching it, but by the end I had decided to put it in a negative light. It's really bad that, in its attempt to emulate film making, it is such a waste of time to watch and learn something, and it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was terrible. I had the same idea when watching the movie and it was only 3 minutes before I felt like I had to sit down and write something. I just said:  I tried watching it on TV and it only got 3/10 but I thought it was worth watching because it was not as bad as it was made.  I mean they gave this a rating of 7 out of 10 (which I think is pretty low), but it was awful. I felt no excitement for it. I was just watching it because I knew it was bad, not because I thought that I was bored. I didn't like the storyline and I just had a feeling like watching a movie about a stupid car-explosion, so I gave it two stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, premise, and the movie itself were poorly written, so that the actors' performances had quite limited range. There was no one to connect the different elements of the film. The characters were utterly useless. We got no sense of what these people were.  The acting was terrible, the film was only slightly less interesting.  This is a poor excuse to watch a movie with a little plot and a plot to fill the gaps. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that no one ever wanted to see. And to be honest I didn't even get the ending. In my opinion it was bad in every way.  The only reason I saw this movie was because I was looking for the "Funny Movie", but after seeing the whole of this I didn...I guess I'll never get it back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has just about 4 or 5 times the number of the actors who appear in the movie. How is it that this one has so bad in some way that it keeps getting renewed?? It's very difficult to see the storyline of this movie and how it makes no sense whatsoever. What a mess it is, I've seen other movies like this one that are actually pretty good. I'm so glad that I missed out on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in a store and it was disgusting, if you can find this film in a grocery store, the name is "The Devil In The Dark" but I didn't feel any interest in it. I don't know how "Dark" means anything. It seems like this movie was made by a person who had a passion for making this movie but instead of making a documentary about some bad movie, we get to watch it for the sake of a few chuckling laughs. I know it's supposed to be a horror film but I can't find this in a movie store. I can only conclude that it was filmed in a basement while they were shooting a scene for a horror movie. When I watched "The Devious", I didn`t even care. I just kept moving my eyes to see if it had a plot. I ended up asking people for help and I couldn`t find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the movie "Dynasty" is one of the most boring movies of all time. What could be expected from a movie such as this one? Not even a lot of dialog!  But, if the movie was an actual film, the plot would be the worst part. Let me answer the question: Does the characters like it?  When I saw "Diana", I didn't expect anything more than a "B" movie with a bunch of stupid humorless characters. This movie just plain boring.  But what was the point in making "Dianne's Revenge"? When a movie with some humor (or comedy) is not the most important part, I didn´t find it interesting to watch it. The characters in this movie seem like they were put in a movie to get laughs. The movie just became predictable.  I don´t expect a movie from a production company whose motto is "No Laughing". This was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible, I didn't care to see the actors in it, but at least this movie had a pretty good ending. I'd expect the acting to be better than the plot, but unfortunately I found that the characters were not that interesting, although I did find it enjoyable to watch people in a movie on the TV show. If you watch it alone on the screen, you can find this movie to be an embarrassment. I would recommend watching it the first time only because of the storyline and the fact that it was a sequel to "Lion". If you see it again, you'll most likely be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Granal" is a waste of a film: boring, stupid, and pretentious. The two stars were really annoying and the ending was even worse.    The director is smart but this film is totally pointless. Not even the film itself can save this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is just awful. The characters are really, really stupid. They are just stupid. I didn't even have the mental energy to be so sickened by this one. Maybe if the actors weren't so terrible, it would be interesting. Unfortunately, they were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a cheap comedy, but the characters are pretty good, and it looks like a movie was written by someone who wanted to make a big movie about a bunch of stupid people who wanted nothing but to sit in a room and watch people on TV for the whole day. It is not that cheap, as many people have pointed out, but a very disappointing comedy. It just fails at trying to be funny. The plot is too similar to the "Funny Girl" movies that were made about the same year and genre, and the dialog is so wooden and stupid that I felt like I was about to kill the writers. In the end, the movie is just like every other "Funnies" movie out there (the only ones that do stand-up comedy). It's like this movie. The only good thing is that it is entertaining, but I have read more bad comedies than that. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film tries to recreate the "movie" concept from Casablanca or The Godfather, but the movie only lasts a few minutes. It is impossible to follow the story, and the actors simply aren't able to play their characters.  The script is so terrible that it actually makes the film boring, like they did in Casablonia. And there is a funny cameo in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure who was watching this movie (like I said, it's only about a movie: i've never heard of one before). It's an awful movie, the acting is bad, it has no plot, not even a plausible plot. If you get any idea of a plot, you will just think the script was poorly written, the ending is lame and there are no scenes worth the money. The characters are also awful, the cinematography is bad and the director is in the wrong.  In short, this movie was probably a result of a bad marketing campaign.  I'll admit I didn't watch this movie because of the terrible acting and the terrible plot. I watched it because of what it was trying to accomplish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a reason to avoid this film, and that reason is simple. You don't want to watch a dumb movie like this. The plot is not as clever as most B movies, and it isn't even close to the good stuff.  The actors are poorly dressed, and the scenery is bad in most scenes.   The movie is full of stupid. If you want to see B movies with a real plot, you'll probably enjoy one of them better than this one.  This movie sucks all of the original good energy. It really doesn't have any interesting characters.  It doesn't really add anything new to a B movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about a couple who is involved in a murder, who tries to get back together and that's all... the murder is just about a two guys hanging in the backseat of a car, there's nothing there. The acting is flat and so bad that I felt like they should have cut this whole thing, except that the murder itself was pretty good. But this film is a two-tracked, three-gens-cut-it-in-three-part-time-cut, the best time of the film, the worst thing I've seen, and I'm left without any feeling whatsoever to even talk about it.  I have to conclude that I would much rather see something more interesting, but the plot really isn't interesting. The plot revolves around a certain girl who has a crush on a certain other girl, so she tries to persuade him to get out of this situation, and he does a couple of weird things with her. The rest of the plot is about how they get back into it, and it's just about the only thing I have seen since I started looking at it. It's pretty annoying to see, because it really isn`t that clever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was so horrible I actually turned off to finish it. If you see the story of one of the films "Pilot, Part 2," it's all the same.  There was some good stuff in it but in the end we got no closure and nothing seemed to make sense.  I have to admit I didn't want to be the person to watch this movie because it would be like being in the middle of a movie: The suspense is too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing better than a movie about nothing.  The first time I was watching this movie I was bored for 20 minutes. There was nothing that could make me stay awake. The dialog was terrible. Even the music played only sounded "trampier". It was difficult for me to decide which movie was the better. The acting was extremely bad. It was simply a lot of actors who couldn't act normally. I couldn't figure out the most ridiculous lines or scenes, or why. The best part of the movie was probably the "shout" and "bait" scenes. They were hilarious at first, but then started getting really annoying. In one scene they had to yell to their daughter. When she told them to get a coat, they laughed and started saying something about why you needed a coat. Then the guys got to kiss each other in unison, then the camera started moving and shaking so badly. I thought it was just a "trashy" movie. They had so many scenes and a lot more to show than the story line and characters, but were so badly executed that I can't really blame them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't realize until I had watched this at an open-cater presentation in Texas, and I saw it on the big screen.  It's not a movie like The Ring or The Castle, and this film looks no better. But since it's not made for the TV, it's a waste of some precious TV time. The storyline is, of course, not the most complicated or creative, but it really is just not very interesting or exciting.  The acting is pretty bad, too, with just a few famous actors who seem to be actors for a dozen people.  A good ending is supposed to happen at the end of the movie, but that isn't what it does. A good movie would have a story line with some interesting characters, something that is not so poorly written. A disappointing story is just a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was going to love this movie but was scared to pay for it. I got bored watching it and after a brief time, I had to find something to enjoy. In this case, I went out to rent and found a movie I was not expecting (The Last Five Kings, which I saw on DVD a few years ago). But I can tell you no more, "the film was a huge disappointment" because I had so little faith in the script that I couldn't wait for it to get on a shelf.  Now, I'm sure I'm wrong about this movie, but I guess it was meant to be a horror movie (I guess that's what the producers wanted to get away from). The cast is so bad, I don't even care that the characters are all there, but it is a terrible movie with bad direction, bad dialog, bad dialogue and bad actors.  Overall, I would recommend this movie as a low-budget horror movie but I was really bored watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea how it got a movie that is so bad. I have seen nothing like this movie.  I don't even know who wrote it, and I have yet to see it in any way that I know. The ending is terrible. How did they get a director who can't make a movie like this into a movie? I can't find it in the book, but I can watch this movie and watch it over and over.  There are too many scenes that just don't make any sense. The story of this movie is bad and the story is bad too. I don`t know what happened in the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not even halfway a thriller. It's a completely pointless thriller that relies on the fact that you will believe that you are going to believe in some kind of supernatural story. We've seen it in every other way except on the one where "this movie was a ghost story", where I was expecting to believe that it was real. The plot is extremely stupid. There is no story and no story-line to help the viewer get to know the characters, even though it is the only movie that I watched that had a plot that I believed would work to help me understand it. I think if you have read the book it has no story but a lot of plot. This movie's plot is totally devoid of plot-line and it only makes you believe that this is real and it is not. The characters are awful. I tried to find some kindof plot-to-story but the movie doesn't even include the characters. When we first met them, I was thinking that I would like to see more of them but I thought that they were pretty generic so it was hard to find them. The whole thing was so weak that I couldn't really care which character's character's name was written in the script. They looked like they had just been written. This was probably the worst movie of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sort of movie that people laugh at. I mean one or two jokes that are supposed to be funny. I can't think of any funny joke. Most of the jokes are about the humor, not about the joke. This movie was really disappointing. It was pretty bad and the jokes were not funny at all. This is a movie that doesn't deserve to be put on the shelf because it is bad. I recommend that you avoid watching it, if you want to. You need to have some sense of humor and intelligence, to enjoy something that doesn`t include nudity. I don't think that was intentional. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has really little to recommend to anyone, even if it did something. Its just another of those lame and low budget, dumb-thinking movies. What does it have? a lot of stupidity. The stars should of course just be paid. Even if the actors were good they would have been great but they are really awful. The plot is a bit contrived and it doesn't seem very believable. It just feels like a movie made for kids, not for actual kids, but I can't see why they would even bother doing this in the early 20's. The direction is bad and the dialog is bad, the acting is bad but it is so bad. The ending is bad too, because it really wasn't that great in the previous chapters. If you have seen this movie you should avoid watching it because you will never like it and if you love that stupid stuff, you should get a couple copies of it and throw it out. You'll never find out how much time is really put into this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have not seen this film since it was released. It is like nothing else i have seen since, i don't think the makers had any intention to deliver something that would inspire me in watching the movie. I would rather watch something like  "I Love the Riddler" on DVD and just watch them for fun. This movie seems to be on one short shelf in my house and i think it's about a joke with no humor or inspiration. I really wanted to see "Crazy Taxi" for some reason. I just couldn't believe that anyone could waste their time on this trash. I also don't believe this movie is funny. It's not even funny. If you like comedy then watch it. It would be better if you bought a movie: it's a little worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I thought this movie was about as bad as it was a movie i've seen. The acting is horrible. The premise of the movie is extremely simplistic (as usual in a horror movie, with all the blood and gore). But there is no suspense or excitement (which is really the problem with it), as the story is just very basic, but without any real suspense. This is probably due to the fact that the director did not really know what he was doing. It's just a very basic plot with a very predictable characters who just sit around doing nothing and talk, in very boring scenes.  I recommend watching it if you want to sit around watching the whole thing but only once. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some things to be said about this film which are entirely untrue. For example, a major critic of this film is a big fan of the original "Shooters", as he likes it.  Well, what do you do in an area like "Shooter" that has nothing to do with reality? That is, the same question. This film is not about reality; it is a dumb and pointless thriller that just pretends to be a thriller. It's too long and too slow to be good, and it never makes any sense.  The storyline is extremely ridiculous. The story lines are ridiculously convoluted. Some people even look like they're in "Somethinia." Some have a story that begins with a school shooting and has a killer (name the killer) on campus and ends with a girl seeing her husband murdered. The killer then kills the girl and is free to do whatever he wants, as we've seen before. And, well, what can we expect? When a person is killed by a murderer with a gun in his hand, you know that it is going to be the killer. He's going to kill a young girl who he's never seen before because he's not there. And who's to guess what he'll do first? He'll pick a couple of kids and shoot her. Of course, that happens.    The film itself has some interesting visuals. But when I finished watching the movie, I had to turn it off because the plot was so convoluted and too predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie last weekend as a bargain, and unfortunately didn't enjoy it very much. The story seems to be very simplistic and it was mostly predictable, with the least interesting dialogue (I thought I would enjoy more). It's a pity, really, to lose such quality and effort in an average movie.  I don't know how they got so close to this. It's obviously not a "big-budget" film, but rather a low-budget exploitation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say I have no empathy for this movie. It's really bad when watching it. There isn't much humor in it. It is almost as bad as the "Passion" movie starring Michael J. Buck. I don't have to much sympathy with those actors. The movie did come out from an excellent plot. But it's a lousy one.  I don''t care for this type of movie. I won't see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure whether the actor, who was also a producer, was playing in this movie. I didn't know it when I saw it. It was in my mind, at the beginning of my first viewing of this film, I thought the scenes were bad. Now I know it is not for people with no taste for bad movies. That said, I think this film is really bad. It is really cheap, bad acting and bad script. The only positive things I can say about this movie are that it is very good and I won't be expecting too much of it in the future. The biggest disappointment I have seen of this movie was the plot. It could have made an acceptable ending if the movie were about real people with bad intentions, but it didn't. The acting was good. The script was good, it just didn't make an impression at all. There was absolutely no humor whatsoever, the characters seemed to be in their place but they were so poorly done that I didn\'t think they could have gotten so far. The ending made me question whether I really wanted to see this movie again. I only sat through it because I did like it. I'm sure I could have seen more better performances with better actors. I gave the movie 1/2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible film. I'm a pretty big fan of "The Wizard of Oz" and was glad that it got renewed and made a comeback. The script was poor, the plot didn't make sense, the acting was terrible, and there was nothing interesting. I couldn't believe that they would go so far as to put a female vampire on a female body. And you wonder why, after spending their lives with these actors, they still gave the same money for this film. This movie just wasn't a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Lisue" is a horrible film, which goes on and on forever, and it is the only film I've seen that has been this bad ever. While the story is good (for a true zombie movie), it is so bad that you can't even see it as a movie. The acting is bad. The story is bad, the acting is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie seems to be made by a few writers who think they need a 'tribbil'. This movie is a big pile of moronic trash. The writing is awful. The acting is too slow and the directing is bad. The supporting cast is OK, but the rest of the cast is either boring or pretentious. This movie was awful, but I am sure that it is one of the worst films ever made, even though I don't think I would go out of my life watching it.  I would have been much better with the more mature film 'Cadillac', which I was surprised to see in the last few weeks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. The plot was boring, the acting was terrible, the story was unbelievable, the direction was horrible, the camera was bad, the scenes were bad, and the music was bad. I gave this movie 2 out of 10 out of ten. The only redeeming quality in this movie was a slightly funny dialog by the director, which got a few laughs. However, the movie seemed to be missing something to make me feel the movie was more fun and less boring than just watching a TV show. The best I can say about this movie is that it's a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible, it was no fun. But I wouldn't have thought that in all these years, I never would have watched any film of this crap. In fact, I didn't even watch it because I didn�t care. It wasn�t just bad, but it was pretty bad. It made me want to jump out of the window, but then I left and went to bed.  I am an adult and I have seen worse things in other movies. This movie is a total embarrassment to the human race, with a terrible script, horrible direction, bad cast and horrible actors. I would never see something like this again. I don�t even want to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no clue why this movie was made. It has absolutely nothing to do with the best series ever made. The whole plot revolves around a plot that, unfortunately, is just plain bad.  The movie is just unbelievable and it is just awful. There is absolutely no logic. The movie has no "real" (as in it is supposed to be a documentary) theme or "realistic" content. The fact that a major "star" would make this film is really shocking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on Sunday when I thought I would never watch another film in my life. However, I didn't really expect much from this movie. The acting was weak, the script was horrible, the story was stupid, the visuals seemed to be just not there, and the characters acted like some old college college girls instead of actual people. I would have been willing to put it in a '10' instead of a '8', but what I did see was a waste of time, and I am not sure if it was that bad for me because I watched it in front of a bunch of other people.  I hope to see the next installment of this movie so I can get over it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the most loathable, horrible, dumb piece of nonsense that I have ever seen. The plot, I thought, could have been scripted, made funny, and had the best actors possible. However, I found out that you cannot even go as far as that. And that, for a comedy, there are few like that. That is the only thing that makes this movie. I thought I should just turn off the DVD and give this movie to the most ignorant people who could get it in 5 minutes to watch on a video, like my wife, because it's bad enough to even get it into the hands of an adult.  I'll admit, I was initially looking for this movie, but I didn't want to see it in a public space. The only reason I'm putting this into my collection is because it was recommended on several radio stations in the Netherlands, and I was able to find it on a small quantity of the shelves in the UK. The fact that this is such a bad film is scary in the way it can make jokes out of such a horrible and unfeignified concept, but the lack of sophistication does not make that any less scary. And while I think the plot is fairly interesting and interesting, I couldn't really see much of worth in it, especially in a movie with such poor performance, that I'm sure the producers expected the audience would enjoy. I will admit that the film is only the first half of it. It is obviously meant to be the beginning of something, but it just feels like a movie that doesn't quite make the case. As for the acting, the acting is a non-descriptive joke. There is no one who plays this way. It's just a bunch of actors who are forced to act, which are not the actors who should be there for acting. What is there to be except a decent film? This is an utter waste of a film. I don't know why it is even made. It lacks a bit of intelligence. It can't really be funny. If the characters had more intelligence, this movie would have a somewhat funny way. I've seen enough movies to make me laugh before, and this doesn't make me think of any more. But I find it so disappointing that I feel my stomach crushes me on seeing the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was absolutely worthless, the way the movie was filmed made was horrible (especially the editing) but the director and crew are very talented. This film looks so amateur and ill-informed that I can't say that this movie has a great ending, but it lacks a great concept. The director and editor should never have filmed a documentary so badly directed or even directed this film. It is sad to see this movie. This is an awful movie for all the reasons mentioned in the previous review, including the way it looks, the bad editing, the horrible acting, the terrible plot, the unbelievable soundtrack and the boring storyline. The acting is a typical awful teen-movie. The theme and the way that the movie is filmed, which is usually filmed, usually just sets the story to some sort of plot and ends the movie. It seems like it's all in a rush when a movie like this comes out. I found it disappointing, but not the worst movie i've ever seen, but I was glad I didn't spend the money for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really an awful movie and a bad attempt at a plot. I really think it was just plain bad - too predictable, not believable, and all in one. This should be avoided.  I really do not understand why the actors chose to film this. They have nothing to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the dumbest movie I've seen in the past two years. Not even the late, great J.J.Kiddie film can come in to save this.   The premise is completely stupid. You have a gun in the gun closet, a gunfight, a murder and a murder. There's absolutely nothing new to make. This movie was so awful it was not even worthy to save the title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it is completely unsuited to be made. The acting was awful, the setting was awful and the action was almost nonexistent. For a movie like this, I would watch it on the stage at a theatre. I only found this movie to be very interesting when my son was in it. There was no plot, which is a common problem with an action movie. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack, which was quite good. However, I cannot stand watching these awful movies again. They have just been made lately and this is an insult to anyone, not to the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the title of this movie is "The World Of Attraction", then that title was well-worded. The world of Attraction is obviously no more than a collection of boring scenes of people being bored and bored with their lives, and not even as a great story.  The film is a poor excuse for some low budget film that was supposed to be something more (and better) than a movie about a person's life. What happened when this movie was made? Who knows! Probably nothing, and probably nothing happened at all. If anyone tells me the sequel, "The Best Place To Live" starring the famous Jabba, I think they'll probably have a problem with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main plot is about a bunch of people who try to find a cure for the diseases. But the ending is only about a few people, who then get rid of their disease, but there's no explanation why. It's a really stupid thing, because the whole story has no real ending and it's really just a way to find out the real "one who's sick". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically a trash movie, but it still gets a few laughs. But the acting is so bad, it doesn't have any real feeling at all. I couldn't believe the director intended to make this film. The writing is terrible, even the direction is terrible. The characters aren't great either.   The movie is obviously meant to be a joke, and it certainly isn't funny or funny, but I can't believe that there was anyone involved in the process of making this film! Maybe that's why this is considered a comedy instead of a horror movie. And if there is any real sense of humor involved here, it is most likely just bad acting and a few stupid jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a big, dumb rock star, who is not in the slightest shape to make himself a star. He just wants to be in a movie with a funny, dumb movie. So you just have to sit on a shelf. When they finally get into the movie, the acting is totally amateur. They don't even look like actors. They look like a bunch of nerds. The music is very bad. I guess that there are some good jokes. But this movie was just like "The Hangover" in "The Expendables" without any real reason. They had a big stunt in the opening scene, but I think it's a lame stunt. There was some nice one-liners, but nothing significant. And of course, the "clocking" scene in the end of the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. I think the best thing about this movie is the scene where he dies. You never want to die! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has a very boring ending. The scene that begins with a cat is absolutely unbelievable. After the cat is gone, we can expect to see the next scene. So, what? That is the only conclusion I can make with the entire movie. We're treated to a little bit of torture but never really touched the big fish, but the cat can still kill two children and a pregnant woman. There's nothing here for a story, nothing interesting, and nothing that actually happens. All in all, the movie is bad. It's bad enough to be a bad comedy but worse than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that can only be described as "the worst movie of all time!". Although the film itself looks very interesting and interesting as a whole, it doesn't exactly fit the mood of other films or movies made during that era.  Although it does have a good beginning, it is absolutely useless as an actual movie. It seems like the creators of a movie would spend so much time making it and then they would have to finish the film within a few weeks. It is a truly awful way of making a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first effort at a big budget thriller film set in a small town that has not seen many films. This is a total failure, even the supporting cast should have turned the show into a classic thriller. In a couple of scenes we got bored as I expected. But then the scenes started to get to me and that is the problem with most modern films. You are waiting for the plot to go into action, or the script to come in. If that happens you start to get bored. In the end we were just boring. I have never been like to watch a movie like this before. And I had the feeling of being bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing I remember is a guy saying that a movie about a woman getting kidnapped by a gang is going to be released on the same night as a horror movie. This has nothing to do with the fact that it is a horror film and is only meant to provide suspense for those people who have been put in detention in a nursing home. And why was this film even made? I guess it got on the air? Why should that make me jump up and get excited for it? I'll never forget what happens. It's just a poor waste of some old crap from the '80s and '90s and this is it's only problem. I guess I'll just go with the other things on this list and see the next, "A Night of Horror". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's been awhile since I had seen this movie and I didn't find it very entertaining. It seems like they didn't even try to make a cameo in this movie. Maybe that is because the actors were so bad that they were barely there. The script is so poorly written, so badly directed, and so bad, that it doesn't have much suspense, the scenes are not consistent, the characters are not convincing.  What else could be so terrible? The acting was good, but the story seemed to be unbelievable. The storyline was pretty good, and the characters were so predictable that it was a bit disappointing to see how many of the scenes were played. It was impossible to find the real ending and the mystery of how they survived.  My rating: 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was only worth the cost to hire someone to play the part and watch this crap movie for a few minutes on a TV set. I will admit that this movie was not a horror movie, but it was definitely one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. If you've watched a horror film, you will probably enjoy it. Not only that, but if you've only watched one horror movie...you'll probably avoid this one like the plague. At least it doesn't seem very entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this one had a small plot, which was OK in the beginning. I had a couple of questions that were not resolved in the first 2 or 3 films. And then I found out that it was over-explored to the point of being over-dressed. So while that is true, the film did not provide much depth.  In the first 5 minutes of the film, the two main characters meet and talk about what is their life, and then they find out that they are going to visit another person on another island. And this person is the "other" person.  The next 5 minutes were pretty convoluted and pretty pointless, and I'm not sure if it's one of those silly scenes that you see in the original "Voyee"- series, or is it a simple line.  Overall, the movie got away with little more than the two characters interacting with each other, but that's not really the best way to put it. I just wanted the message to be that the story really sucks, that it had no real connection to anything else, and that it just was poorly written.  My overall opinion of the movie::  Bad:  Uninteresting, a few of the characters, bad plot, not much.    Recommended: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like watching the old "House" commercials, with all the same bad special effects, boring dialogue and lousy writing. The acting wasn't much better. I had to turn on my TV, hoping that someone could save this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film while I was visiting the movie theater of the nearby city. I thought it looked interesting. But when it was shown to me, my husband and I were both totally nauseated. The acting was bad and the story was not true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had to predict the worst movie I would make in one of my life I would have to say that this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is why I don't recommend it to anyone. It starts out at a very creepy-looking movie, but quickly descends into a horror-movie atmosphere. In fact, it is so bad, I think you should not even watch it. I mean, the movie could literally make you lose your appetite. The ending of the movie was a little better than the beginning. But it didn't get to the end, because I have seen better horror films. I think the makers of this film should be ashamed of making such a crap film. The only reason I give this movie a 10 is because of the plot-line. I don`t know if they planned to take this seriously. I didn`t believe it was really going to be a horror movie. It had an uneven, but not totally bad-looking ending. I guess they used a lot of stock footage for this. Maybe they just used it as a joke-movie-to-be. There is also a very cheap costume, a very ridiculous-looking woman with a really nice hair-doodah-style costume. There also seems to be some fake-clank around the "making" of the scenes. If you see any more gore than the plot, you might find out that it`s a horror film. There was something about the ending that I really didn`T like. That was the only thing that was bad. The acting wasn`t that bad. Some of the acting was good, though. For all the rest I thought the movie had some potential but the plot and the ending were so bad that I couldn`t give this film 10 points out of 10. That is why the rating is 10 instead of 10 to 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always been a fan of the films of Woody Allen and James Burtin, but I don't know why. I'll be honest, though, I didn't care for the film until the third act. There were some interesting scenes--with Jim Belch--but the rest of the movie was awful, to say the least. If I had to see the first 2 minutes of this movie, I would have died.  It is so bad, so bad! I'd take Woody Allen in a heartbeat and watch him on the late 70's again, but even then, I'd not care for his performance in this movie. I've seen Jim Belchie's performance in The Man with Two Faces--I thought he was very good, very good--but I'm not sure he had any role in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Kirk" has a problem that's hard to figure out. It's a bad story. Kirk has a girlfriend, but she does a movie about her relationship with a big boss. Kirk is playing with his girlfriend on a stage. The woman is so hot that she plays in a movie for her husband. She is so bad that he can't get over it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first episode of The Walking Dead that I have ever watched in English with a decent rating. It's not fun, it doesn't have a plot and no dialogue. There are no good zombie stories, the characters are horrible. They act like a collection of cardboard models. They try to hide themselves by putting on an industrial looking zombie costume, for example. Well, there are only a handful of zombies in this episode, but they are so horrible they don't really notice it. Even the actors manage to do a decent job. The acting is horrible. There's not a good reason for this movie.   The last episode of the series is called The Walking Down. I didn't even see it, I don't know why I even have a sense of it in my head. I just want to hear the words and see the same name every time I watch it. It was really disappointing to see a zombie getting the short end that it deserved. I'll just repeat it and watch it over and over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad waste of money, especially if you are a fan of horror movies. What does this movie do that other movies don't do? The first three scenes are fairly good, the rest are not. The plot is stupid and predictable, which is not an uncommon thing in horror movies, but the characters are not good. The special effects are awful, although they are so great they're almost impossible to resist. I'm tempted to recommend this movie as a waste of time. This movie is bad, bad bad bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most painful movie I have seen in a movie theater for the past several years, and I don't want to say much, because I know that most of the critics have just watched this movie for fun. This movie is an excuse for most of those critics to go see some stupid movies for fun while other people are stuck on making a real movie, so you are really begging for some serious movie to be made. However, my opinion is more on the lack of a plot, and there is no storyline to this movie. You have to sit through the whole movie, hoping that it will finally be a good movie. But, instead, you end up wondering why a movie like this exists at all. I mean, it doesn't even have a beginning. I'm still wondering where "The One With the Golden Eye" is. If you're like me, you'll wonder where this movie might be. It looks like a guy was just kidnapped and then murdered by people who just wanted money from him for whatever, then you'll be wondering what was it. So, if you're a conspiracy theorist who believes that there is a secret to "the" Golden Eye, you would have expected to see him at the end of the movie. If not, you'd be thinking about his murder, not knowing his victim was a "normal" man. This is an insult to the very thought of film fans and viewers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the one and two films that I watch over and over. I know, this was just a simple film of no value. But it is not like the films I watched with my wife. The only problem is that it seems like it is just one film. There is nothing to watch. Nothing. In fact, I can't even remember why I watched this movie, and I'm just a bit baffled by that fact. But that was the biggest problem. I really don't know why anyone made this film. A few years ago I was a co-producer on "Avenging of the Dark Shadows", and I thought this would be a perfect film to start a film series for people who loved this film! This movie had nothing but the idea of a "dark knight" (not even a man) to build the story, but instead became another of those "themes". So many terrible things that are not even remotely interesting, like the way he's tortured the other so many people, and even this movie is totally boring. All in all, I'm glad that it was left alone, because it was probably a bit more fun to put this out than it was meant to be. But there are two very, very boring actors, and unfortunately nothing to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. I thought about watching it at the movie theater and it would have been a really good comedy. But instead I got "My friends aren't that cute". It is really cheap and very simplistic. If you like to hear songs, you'll miss this. There is no music! I think the actors should have taken it away. It is a shame to see someone with no talent making a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really terrible and I am so disgusted with my own country that I just couldn't watch this crap. I was scared to watch it. I'm a Canadian and I know nothing about it but I've seen many shows in the U.K. or Canada. What a joke this movie was. I'd like to watch some of those shows. But I couldn't stomach watching this one. In fact, the director was so horrible, it was the biggest joke in my life and I thought the film was a joke. When I first saw it I thought "What are they doing in that whole house?" It's not funny at all. I saw it two hours later and the same thing happened with the first episode. I only watched about 20 minutes of this episode so I'm really hoping you can watch it for yourself and let us know it's too bad. It's truly a joke I've never heard before. It is like a piece of paper with an old computer on it. How do I know this? Some guy in the office just said "Hey, I'll make a copy of this movie for you" and it's just a movie: a stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you get to the end of the movie and you're thinking of making some sort of comedy movie, you'll want one. But you don't get a good movie: you doncha, you dona, you gotta have the money to make this! I'm glad I was able to see this crap, because the video was so bad it's worth watching in a bad light. I won't get out my head and say that the movie was good because the script was good. You want to watch a sitcom instead of a movie that shows a bunch of old car commercials. In this case you got nothing, you got two lousy movies. If you have any sense of humor you might enjoy these old car trailers. Even if you are not crazy enough to see these old movie trailers, you have to be glad you went to the trouble of making this lousy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a bunch of stupid teenagers who decide to steal a large diamond diamond while going to a secluded party at a nearby hotel. The real party is not a large party with a lot of attractive people, but a big party with lots of attractive girls, lots of dancing, and a bunch people who are obviously a lot older than they seem to be. At the party, they go into a sleepover to get some sleep and see the guy who plays on his guitar and then starts to get into a fight with the girls who are apparently the new hottest thing around. The girls are annoying, but this is just bad in the least bit. But that's all the way it seems to be - it's a bad part of the movie. Not enough to ruin the film, but bad in a lot. Not a great movie for its time, but at least not a great waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no patience in viewing these movies, which are more poorly filmed than the actors in these two movies. The fact that this is a movie is a complete and utter waste of time.  It's not very good. The good part of the movie is that it is a funny movie that keeps going at an annoying pace. That's good when you like a movie like that! But, if you like the story, it will suck. They have a bunch of clichés. That just leaves you wondering where the joke might go.  If you like movies that are fun, watch this one, but don't even watch the rest of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely terrible. I was so disappointed that the writers even knew the movie could possibly be bad. But then they still gave it to you. There was nothing that was original, like the first "The Ring" movie. It had a few jokes, a few "the stars are coming for you" situations, but then it had this ridiculous scene where a bunch of "hailyards" made up a bad gang. The acting was bad, it lacked the chemistry that made "The Lord Of Rings" so great. It's like someone who's pretending to be a real movie director gave some poor guy a lot of money and made him a great director, and then made himself one bad director. That's why you couldn't even expect to be very good when you're making movies: only actors are good enough to make a movie. Oh yeah. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was extremely bad and the acting was poor. I thought the scenes that were filmed in some parts were awful. The ending is really weird, I can't really remember it. I was wondering how the hell could anyone get into this movie. I mean really? I'm a girl, I'm sure that I could get so drunk that my sister would come out to see it, but I have never been so drunk. It's so disgusting. I don't know why the director can actually write a film that has so many people dying and doing things for their money. You would have been interested in seeing "Daughters Of The White House".  I recommend this movie for someone who doesn't have much patience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors seem to have no idea what they're trying to portray. In particular they seem to be playing characters who are the "evil" the other characters. They're either the "good" heroes, the "bad" heroes or the "normal" heroes. This movie isn't good, but it's awful. There are a couple of minor scenes, but what does this add up to? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's obvious that the filmmakers didn't understand the premise, and it becomes evident that they didn't take any time to do so. In fact, it's extremely difficult to make a film from the perspective of the protagonists' viewpoint, but this lack of empathy is so bad that it's laughable. It's so bad I'm convinced that the directors had nothing more important in their minds than to make an overall message to the audiences about life. If they were able to make this film for their own satisfaction, it would have been an important message to society in general. But, as you will hopefully find, they can't make an action thriller and it shows me that they have never understood that this was really a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the synopsis for the movie and was horrified that a movie featuring a big, dumb, bad acting and a lousy script. I laughed out loud when I realized that the story and plot were so bad and so weak, but it didn't really stop me. It also didn't help that the actors were so terrible that they were barely able to portray one of the characters. When the movie didn't come up at all and when it finally did, the only thing that kept me from watching it was the script. It's no fun to see someone act like a stupid cartoon character and then try to do the same act for a half hour.  Overall, the movie isn't too much better than the previous entry in this category, but if you had to find a movie that was similar to my review of the "Waking Up" series, that's it. The plot and acting were extremely weak, and they were just plain bad. For example, this movie was so bad that I didn't even see "The House of Cool" in the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as bad as the "M" series. There's a little bit of humor but the plot is absolutely pointless. I think if they had the budget and all the talent then they would have to build a better film with better story, better direction, and better production.  If you are going to make a comedy please use real actors and make a movie better. For this movie they couldn't afford to hire a bunch of actors and their cheap cast of actors that they were forced to play. If you can do it right then go to rent a movie that has a good story and better direction then that. But don't try it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So obviously, the plot was good enough to get me into the movie, but it didn't stick. This plot is a horrible piece of trash that isn't even remotely connected with the movie. The acting is pretty terrible, as is the plot. My main criticism is that the story is terrible, even at the end. It's not like a movie with some great dialog and a good ending. If you're familiar with the show, you will recognize it as one of the dumbest things that comes out of a "movie" like this. I don't even see this movie in the U.S. anymore, because it's so bad. It just doesn't have anything new to say. But maybe you're a cinematte like the guy who just got a few tickets for the premiere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those films that people will make, and then complain about. This movie is not even worthy of "Fantasy" for a 30 year old. It is not a movie that would draw in even one of the older audiences. It's not even a movie intended for teenagers. You can't expect much more from a movie: a stupid movie.  The plot is pretty basic, the characters were pretty good, the story is a little predictable and the camera is shaky.  I found this movie in the bargain bins at a video store, but it wasn't worth the $10 that it cost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was interested in this movie (and I'm still counting on this). But I can't take it seriously because I'm sure my eyes were pulled into the camera when I watched this film. I can only pray to God that it was not a bad film.  I know this movie is just a stupid piece of trash that doesn't deserve to be considered as even a movie worth seeing. I know that I'm a little bit biased and that I know what it is that really hurts me to see it. I'm not the type to be a viewer, but I'm glad that I had this opportunity to watch something that was obviously meant for "fun" only to see another dumb, stupid movie. I think it should be a show, but instead of a show I want to see something that is obviously meant to be nothing more than a dumb comedy film. It is bad that I got so close to this film and ended up watching it for what I'm so sure was going to lose my interest. I was pretty sure that I'd be laughing at the stupidity of it, but sadly I couldn't. I just couldn't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. The acting was bad. The plot was pathetic. I really felt like someone was running around a lot. The special effects looked really cheap, and the ending was really lame.  I won't be buying this movie unless it's a documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual I find this bad show to be nothing more than a complete disappointment. In terms of this being a film I consider it to be a pretty poor effort. The acting was generally decent but I felt the character development in the main story line were bad. The ending was so horrible that it could be considered a'self-assassigned waste' on the level of the film. If I had to describe it it, it would be a 'I hope you don't let this happen'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this I found another film from "Raging Star" which is actually quite good. Its a sequel, but not the original. I didn't like it. I thought it was a bit too cheesy and didn't finish it well. The acting was terrible. It was very slow, but in my opinion, the acting was good, so what I can say is that the sequel should have just been a lot better than this film.  It did make one mistake, and that was the man who plays Jack. He was OK in the first one but was just terrible in the second one.  Overall, I thought this film had nothing better to say. Even the director of this one can't say anything good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is no different than the terrible (and stupid) film "The Unauthorized History" made by the late Jerry Lewis. There are some decent characters, but they are completely meaningless in the movie, with nothing interesting. The plot is about a family of thieves who, as children, steal everything on the day they're leaving town to look for food.   The movie is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an effort to portray what was actually happening during the Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. There is no real "journey" storyline with some semblance of closure. The acting is badly written and bad, and the plot is even worse. The Nazi leader is played by the very wooden "Karl Wolf" (Michael Cermis), but he never speaks. The main character is a Nazi soldier named "Oskarlik" (Karl Wolf), who is portrayed by a woman named "Bessie Goldie" (Laura D'Aling), who does not even know his name. The movie ends with a completely unnecessary finale that relies solely on what you can see in the movie. I don't know what other people who think that a Nazi's character is so terrible that he deserves to die by a ridiculous gunfight (a stunt stunt that is not even represented by Nazi characters) is doing. The real question in this movie is whether or not a Nazi is really a Nazi. If the Nazi is indeed a Nazi who is truly bad at heart, it is far easier to just kill him instead of dying in the manner he had planned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to watch this movie just to watch it and I thought it was a dumb one, but then I couldn't stop the watching. There was nothing interesting to watch about this movie...it just is bad. I'm sorry to say that this movie is not worth watching, especially the first half. I mean really, there's nothing interesting about it. It's just a bunch of guys playing out stupid little stories, there is no storyline or any interesting acting. And that's only the first part of the story, the beginning, which was supposed to be a horror film. At first the scene in which the little guy is pretending to be in a horror movie was supposed just to give a laugh, it was nothing more than a simple parody.  And that was the point when it started to look like a horror flick, when it was supposed a horror thriller. So as soon as the horror has got to go, the movie is just another boring movie, and there's no story.  It really doesn't get any better than that.  The acting is OK, but the story is nothing interesting. The only thing that makes this movie interesting is the characters. They are stupid people, not evil. This movie is very predictable. In the beginning the characters just give us some stupid stories and then they reveal a plot that turns out to be even stupid. The scenes are only about 5 minutes in size so you can get a good laugh. There are no real plot. You have to see this movie to believe it is interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so convoluted that it's nearly impossible to comprehend. It's so hard to keep up in this world, but I think it would make more sense if the characters were at least more intelligent and sophisticated. The film is simply a waste of time, with horrible story lines that make no sense. I can barely stand to see a movie that has so many words wasted on characters, so much of it is just dull and boring. The cinematography is badly paced and there's no dialog. The characters are mostly unlikable, though some may be able to make some sense out of the dullness of the story, but they seem more focused on how to deal with the people than anything else. And the ending does not seem to help the story - the characters are killed at the end, and then suddenly back to life with a bright and shining new face. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film tries to make the characters sound like caricatured, ridiculous caricatures, without much substance, in a very unsatisfiable manner. It seems to be so boring that it could have been filmed a whole year.  It's very predictable and predictable and really really stupid. The acting is weak and the dialog is bad, especially when it's done in a group of actors. I have to say this - I'd really prefer the film to just be a few minutes of comedy, rather than to be the central part. The only decent parts are the ending.  This really is one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. The actors are really poor, the scenes are terrible, and the story is totally pathetic. It's horrible to think that someone with a well-staged life would care about making a film like this when you have no life experience whatsoever. If you really wanted to make a documentary of a documentary about a failed life story, you would use this movie to demonstrate how the people that failed to develop a positive life story had a major crisis in the end. That's the way that this movie is supposed to be, but instead of a story of the failed life of a failed human (i.e. someone's child), the movie tries to make it look like a documentary. That is the same kind of film that people would call a documentary to demonstrate why something should not be made. No, really, people should not make a movie because it's about a failing human. If this movie was made, I would find it entertaining if it was a documentary at all. I don't think I want to see it. The plot is horrible. I have absolutely no faith in any person with that director (the director, the director of the film, etc.). The film isn't very deep in any sense, and I don;t care that it will save your lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Livest" (2000) is a bad little movie. It's boring. There is little more than a plot. It is a really boring. The actors don't seem to know what they're doing. The plot is weak.  I can't believe that this movie has any story, or characters, which makes the movie unbelievable, even if you really believe that the whole movie was based on a certain type of movie called "Bits", or in the case of the title, the movie "Bets". It is extremely stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two separate stories that are the only reason that this film exists. In the first one, it is about a man who has a mind that wants to kill people, so he murders his son. In this second story, it's about a person who was on the receiving end of a murder in the past. This is the case where the actor must make an effort to convince the audience of the fact that this person had done it before. It doesn't work. A lot of the film is similar to a TV series with characters who are generally either a bad or a good person. This movie is bad not because of the plot, but because of a bad acting. There are a few interesting and amusing characters, but the story of the killer does nothing but seem to be a very predictable story. The director must have thought it was interesting to see how the murderer was a person, but this movie didn't help with the actual plot, which is the primary reason that makes this movie a film. I would go as far as to suggest that the director didn't even try to make it interesting. There is a lot of stupidity in it. The ending is so vague that it doesn't really make any sense to any person and the storyline only keeps you wondering about what the killer was thinking. It's just a very bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie looks like a very weak story. The storyline is not a "The Girl" with a "Baretta" at the end. The first scene in the movie is just a couple of minutes of a conversation.   When I got the idea I thought there would be a scene where the girl tries to get the girl to go to the school and give her some money. This is just another bad attempt at a comedy film with a bunch of kids and a bunch in the school that try to drive the girl down the school grounds. It is very disappointing to learn this when you have no idea what it is about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dark Water" is an insult to the fans of "The Walking Dead". If any show was made to be like the Walking Dead, you would be disappointed. The story is nothing, really. No matter what happens, there's no action (except for one person getting killed on an airplane). And the only time we have real action was when the plane landed and we got the actors on board. That's the only reason I really went into "the sequel" and my enjoyment was the end of the movie. It just doesn't add up to anything, nor does it make much sense in anyway. It's not like there was some special effects. The first episode is about a zombie army trying to keep it's face off while everyone else is freaking out. There's nothing to it. The only problem with it is that it's a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely terrible! Even though it's been in some pretty good and unique action sequences, there are absolutely nothing to make. It has a very predictable, dull ending that I expected would have been much better to have done with a different ending than what they do. A lot of the dialogue is incomprehensible, the plot is just OK but not great.  A lot like a lot like I was a very mature guy at the age I was before I even started watching this movie! The end to the movie is a predictable and dull ending. In the end, you'll wonder what a plot is! If the movie had been about an old man with a cat, I might agree that it would be a much better ending than the one presented here.  My advice is to wait until they release this movie in some kind of release, if possible. I'm looking forward to seeing the "Rat" sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is like a bad soap (I'm a bigger comedy than that one) or one of those 'Pug Set' films.  It's just not that good to watch. I'm the type of person who would sit there and watch 'Tie Fighter' or whatever else because it was a good movie. It didn't have any real plot whatsoever. There was one person who played all the parts, the plot is nothing like a real movie.  The acting was a complete waste of actors and special effects, and the acting seemed to be filmed by a really poor cameraman.  There was some great stuff in there, but the overall atmosphere of the film is very weak.  I give this movie a 10, but unfortunately you should not waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen from a comedy film. The story is lame, the actors look like fools, and it doesn't come up as well as it does in "The Family" on "The Wonder Show" or any other shows.  This movie should stay at a distance because it is such a stupid idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just an example of how badly it's going. It's so bad it got turned into a film. This is an excuse to make fun of the whole movie: it's an excuse that you'll sit next door to see the real-world version of the movie. The story goes, and it's so badly written it's really hard to make sense of what the actual story is. I wish that there would be more time to spend on this movie. This film tries to be "smart" and shows nothing but being dumb. When it has to, even a tiny bit more of life, I just can't believe that the director cares about the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film in a couple years, and I was just sick to death after watching it. Not even the most ridiculous or surreal scenes were able to create even one moment, but it was all the same. This is a horrible waste of film making, I can only find 10 or 20 or so movies that are better. At least this was a decent movie with some decent plot and some original ideas. But I am sad that this was only made after I wasted it. The filmmakers should have released more, much more, movies, with better quality. But what happens after this is the same movie: it gets ruined by making this terrible film and throwing away the first draft of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to seeing a movie: it should be funny. But instead it just made me sick...there was no humour. It just made you laugh, even when the characters were the main characters. And, even then, it made me look at it and wonder why so many people had it so much of a laugh. The movie, even as a movie, was bad. The writing, acting, scenery, acting...all of it was terrible. You need to know that it's a bad film but don't spend your time watching it. You should see a better movie: this is a movie about a guy named Jack, a guy who looks like he's going out as a bouncy guy.  The movie is bad because it isn't funny at all. There was nothing funny, nothing funny in it. The characters were totally one dimensional and nothing else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an outright embarrassment to the genre of classic horror film making that, to be fair, had it written about ten years ago. For the first time ever, the genre is getting seriously bad. The film is completely useless, and there is nothing to care about. There are only a few instances of good horror films that are good, and even then only the most notable ones (Bryn Winfield and William Hurt). What we do need is more of these movies, and this could have been good. But unfortunately, this movie is not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad low budget movie with terrible story and lame action. They are not really interesting in the end of the movie. What is it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful and there is no way to "escape" and to escape any other human existence, it's not a movie about people that are crazy. Even the most intelligent people can't understand this crap and the only thing that can be said to this movie is that you should not watch it. The only thing you do is sit and pray to the ghost who comes to pick you up, who is a giant in a white suit. Why is that person supposed to know anything about people who are just going through the motions of life? This movie tells me, and I'll bet that in the future some will die or be released because this movie can't make us understand this and what's worse is that a person who was just saved from death would never even give a thought about being alive in the first place. Also there's no sign that it's an experiment. It's just some sad, unhappy people. All I wanted to see was a movie that wasn't so boring, I want that to happen and I don't think I could. I wish it would have been better because it is such a horrible thing. Also this movie makes no sense at all and the movie director tried to "make a comedy". This movie was no joke. If you're reading this you don't want to see the same movie as you have seen elsewhere, you don 'let' this one get past you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never laughed so much in a horror film. I'd rather watch some other movies (and probably not the Saw) than watch this. Even the most diehard horror fanatics must find this movie a total failure in terms of logic. In fact, I was considering buying a copy of it to get my eyes back, but I couldn't because I've seen other things on this series that were much better than this. In the end I was just so sick to my stomach and in my heart to my heart that I couldn had sworn to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea behind the plot of "Rides With Fat" is that, after the big fat, the rest of the characters have to wait a long time after being "Bored", which is the movie's name, which is a horrible, bad movie. I mean, really, who goes back to school and gets a couple of weeks off as a work in a high school in the new century.  But, with enough effort, you can get it, because that's the reason this movie was made. The problem is, it lacks all of the things which are essential for a good movie. For example, it fails to establish anything beyond a vague premise (name, a date in America); it has none of the basic things that make it worthwhile. At the end, the fat is able to escape the prison, and the movie does not leave him out for an indeterminate couple of hours, which makes it seem more like a film directed by a writer of a novel than a movie directed by anyone who was not involved in writing.  The ending of the movie, the point, comes when Fat falls out of his bed, and falls into the bathroom. The fat tries to break him out of the prison in a car, and while doing so, he pulls out a pair of gloves that is supposed to help him, but only end up being thrown into the car. The end, I guess, was filmed with a handheld camera, so you can watch the video and decide if you want to watch the ending. I'm not sure what that means, but there's really only a few minutes of footage from that point. There's not any reason to be mad at it. The idea is that Fat falls into some sort of weird, "climatic" method, which involves taking a pair to the car, throwing them into the toilet, and being shot in the car as the car explodes into flames. The funny thing is that the movie sets Fat in a basement, as if the car is being shot at a level in the basement, and that's probably why Fat is able escape. Even the camera angle is, in that case, the same angle as the "climb a mountain" movie in the end. It just goes out of nowhere. And it makes you wonder if anyone is actually shooting at anybody.   I'd say that the story of "Treads With Fat", as far as the story itself, is pretty good, as it portrays a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really bad movie. The plot is really stupid and completely predictable. We get a few hints about the villain, a group of terrorists, who carry out a kidnapping on a vacation or whatever... and then we have some action scenes involving our main character in a couple of scenes that aren't totally explained, so there's something else to talk about. At the end there's some big announcement that the guy's kidnapped... and we don't know anything about the group... and a couple scenes involving a bunch of weird people, so it doesn't really make sense to let the villain finish the scene.  The cinematography is very sloppy, but it seems like the director wanted to make a documentary film about a real case of murder... but it's just a boring documentary. There were only a few brief moments with a decent soundtrack.  Overall, I don't recommend this movie, because it's so bad that I almost couldn't stand it... but I thought there was something to talk with about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like Sci Fi, I've been a fan of it for many years and the only reason why I got so upset when I watched this movie was the fact that it's like that, you can't enjoy it. Not only is it really dumb but also I think they just wanted to keep the fun the whole time. I watched it twice and once I'd seen it three times and I just said to myself:  Well, it's a good idea, but then when they filmed it they should have put in place a better movie. The only thing that was good was the camera work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a poor excuse of "Beverise the Next". It's not that hard to find a decent story. I mean, this is a movie that is based on a true story, but it's not like it has been filmed to have life in order, it's just filmed to be a big waste of money. The cast are pretty bad, but the direction is OK. The acting, although pretty good, is very sloppy. I think it's a waste of good screen time. I would give this movie 4 out of 10. I'd recommend avoiding this movie, even at a mediocre budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst films I've seen. It is very predictable and totally meaningless. Most of the movie happens so quickly and you don't even care how it will end. The characters do nothing interesting, you just watch the scenes over and over. The director tries to build a cast of interesting, original characters but they are bland. Also it doesn't make any sense. The actors aren't that original but it doesn all seems like the actors of a very similar movie, but there are enough inconsistencies that it becomes completely meaningless. The ending is also very predictable, if you're a viewer of American foreign films you'll probably like it.  The plot is really bad, you really need to watch the first few minutes to see the action, but then you want to wait until the movie is over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a break I woke up in a hotel and realized that I had been watching the movie for over 5 years. I thought I'd finally be able to "feel the love" of the movie. Then I started getting really angry with the idea that "the only true love of the world" was going to be that one.  If you think you can enjoy the plot, you're wrong. They made the first 20 minutes to 40 seconds worth of the film, but the end of the script and the closing sequence makes the whole movie, and thus far is the only thing that you have to look at to be sure not to waste your time. The movie starts off with some decent (but very annoying) humor, but it slowly spirals into an uninteresting parody of "fairytales" that is actually a parody of this very silly movie. They actually used the same actors who played for "The Little Mermaid" back when this movie was made. They also tried to pull a joke about a sex-related movie and try to bring some real-life characters into the "Fairytalure" character from "The Monster Puppy" but those two movies were vastly different. This movie is not even worth listening to.   *1/2 out of 10: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad, so bad that I felt like my toes were about to slip out of my feet. Even the cast was bad. It was so bad it had no suspense. The plot was so poorly scripted that it didn't make it interesting.  I didn't find a reason to go out to see this movie (although I can't say why). The script seemed to be so badly written, you'd think that you'd be in a hurry to get out of the room to save yourself. Even in the beginning of the film, you can get the idea that the main character is in a state of mind. It's like you've seen a person in a coma. That was not something we needed to show.  The whole thing was an absurd waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I rented this movie on DVD with a friend and was disappointed with the disappointing, amateurish, script. This was only due to the lack of direction. I would like to see a real movie with real acting and a well thought out plot. Unfortunately, the only movie this was able to get was the one produced.   The actors were good and so what could we expect to see was not too long. So where was the movie? How could a film with this poor quality, plot, acting and dialog be a blockbuster? Oh no. This is nothing but a cheap rip off a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a disgrace. The best part of the movie is the original character, and the rest of the acting is utterly terrible. The fact that they were actually acting in this movie is just terrible. I rented this movie for my birthday and was horrified by it. I didn't even try to watch this movie on video; my brain was just too overwhelmed with the story and the terrible dialog. My brother, who was sitting in the theater for a few minutes, found it a difficult to watch. My youngest daughter, who we borrowed from me and saw several parts of it while we were there, said that she couldn't even take it with me. I couldn't believe that I'd read all of the dialog for a movie that was nothing but an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie stars Richard Pryor (as an electric electric meter salesman), who makes a case for a child, and his parents to be a little boy's father, and in the end, he decides to take his girlfriend and sister to "a house for kids." What a bunch of wacky teenagers do for a kid who is actually an adult and not in the "Disney Channel" family. What a waste of "fun" time. If you want to watch a movie of "comedy" or a "Dance Club" then just watch the last two "Disney Movies," starring The Simpsons (that's right). You can get the kids the DVD, and you will miss one of the "Dancing Club" characters unless they can rent it from the "Welco" or the "TV-Cord" store.  The funny thing is that the movie's title is actually "The Electric Meter Meter Salesman," not "Mr. Electric Meter." I guess that they just used this title for the DVD release to get the show off the shelves, and "set a record" for being the "first ever" "Pornographic" film. But then what is the "current" film, and why was that title used? This is really lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad in all respects and has nothing that will save it. It's not even remotely worthy of being considered as an action movie. As an example, there are scenes where the camera zooms into a hotel room full of drunk women with no regard for any dignity of any of the women's. Why would they ever let this happen? There are no good characters. The story is one of those typical action movies that features two guys and a couple of women. Neither is the characters portrayed in that scene. The female lead is a girl who has nothing about her in either form or temperament that could redeem her in that role. I think that if she is a bit of a bitch in a porn/movies video or a porn movie, she could turn it a bit to make more of a movie with her. However, I can only think that it would be great if she turned the part with her partner. The scene where she has a fake boyfriend is not terribly good either. I just can't believe that any girl that's in these movies can do that so many scenes without showing her bare skin. She looks like she is going to slit herself. That alone is a sign that the script is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like horror movies, you will get bored. But if you want to be entertained, you have a hard time. This is a horrible movie! I'm not going to give this movie a rating because it's not scary, but I can tell that I would like more gore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't remember the name of this movie, but I remember it being the badest movie I have ever seen. This movie is horrible to watch and there isn't really even a plot. It is about a guy who has a son who is going to be a big player on some type of college basketball team. The dude is trying to keep his son in the team and that the team needs to have a big name, but he has got a bad haircut. I don;t understand the plot, but the guy in this movie is a little girl who has got this haircut to make the team members think she's got a nickname and make them think she is the big guy's mom and that she is crazy. In fact, I guess you would think he was a female and was crazy, but there are no real scenes for the rest of the movie. What a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a little disappointed after seeing this film at the local cinema. It was a horrible film and not funny at all. A few words about it:  I thought that this movie would be interesting and funny. The movie could have had some good moments and a lot of action. However, most of the actors were uninteresting and boring. Also, it made no sense, like a movie that was made by a 2 year old. I won't see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the director got the idea that this film was about to be a "jazz", but it doesn't really go that far. I had to find the last 15 minutes in a phone call to get the idea because I think it might be a lot easier to do if they put their director like David Legget in a lead role.  I think he is the only person with that name that could possibly make this movie.   If you want to read a positive review about bad movie, see The Unspoken Voice for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have never seen this film. Its so bad i have to say i had to see the last scene before the beginning of this film...it made me sick.  A man in a car and a girl...the two are talking to each other and then at the end of the movie the guy has shot up the car and killed everyone and a blonde girl with blonde hair and an afghan is sitting next to him...this is not even the beginning.  The first scene is when the police arrives on the scene and find a black guy with a car. Then they look at the car in a way that makes them believe it is a car from a gang...the car is completely smashed. Then the cops talk and try to shoot the car...then all of a sudden the police is sitting on top of the car. If you are not paying attention you can see exactly what happens next. i saw the cop and the cops try to catch the guy...they pull out the car keys and try unsuccessfully to shoot at it...then they pull the car into a car park and jump in the car on a car that runs on gas...then its the girl sitting on the floor. Then it is the guy and he shoots her and he takes the car as one of his car. It is the cops finally coming to work on the guy to do it.  Finally we are at the finish scene. The cops are talking about how he was successful and killing the girl. Then he goes into the car where everyone dies and then after she dies and everything else i'm not so happy with the whole movie. What was supposed to be a thriller about a murder is really a movie about torture and suicide.  As i mentioned the car is not really special and does not go fast. The only way i can believe this is the fact that the guy is so good. I know nothing about this movie is very good. It's bad, but I will have to see some of the other scenes to make my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some scenes that are just so dull, it doesn't have a lot of dialog and it has a cliché line. It really isn't enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. It's horrible, but a real joke! They should use a director who has a sense of humor. He should use it. This film has no talent or talent, just a cheap director trying to make a lame comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be a bit cheeky and say that the movie was terrible. It should be called "The Führer Goes To The Wild". It was predictable, predictable, and predictable, that's all. The plot was silly, the characters were predictable, the plot was weak, the movie had bad directing, the acting was bad, the dialog was bad... it had nothing to recommend. And it was plain bad that it had to be so bad... a real brain-wreck, if you're expecting that kind of movie, don't let it go. The story is bad, I didn't like the characters. The movie had nothing interesting. The director didn't try to create suspense. The script was bad. The directing made no sense. The dialogue was bad (not even the way I remember it). There were no great acting. The shooting made no difference. The "füh" in the title has been used over and over, as if it were the Nazi leader, and that's not what I had expected. The film is a bad attempt at a Nazi film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read many negative reviews about this movie and it was pretty bad to say the least. It is extremely predictable, but it is still extremely predictable. If you watch it, you'll see nothing. The main character (The Doctor) is pretty annoying. He always thinks that the person he is in with will be in the future and will get his little way, so he tries to keep it a bit under wraps, but usually, he will just be telling you something that you already know. So you can never really find the clues. The only positive comments are that the dialog is very good and the visuals are good. I really do not understand what happened in this movie. I don't know how the director knew what a person would do and what would happen, even if the person is "hanging onto an alien". Anyway, there are two scenes that I really like. The first is when the aliens arrive in a city. The second is when they leave the city and walk into a space station where they meet the first alien and they are introduced to one of their friends. How is that? In the beginning, they are fighting with them and they kill their leader. This is very cool. But after that, they were back in the city again, but they are not doing anything else. They had only one shot to kill one of the aliens so they are now back in their city, where they are surrounded by their allies. They are now in their own city with the aliens. The third scene was not as good. It was basically an attack on the city by one of our aliens. What happens here is that they find out that one of them is in a space helmet and he gets there first. This seems like it was an accident, because that is why they were looking for this person in the first place. This movie was really awful. My suggestion is that a better way would be made of the story would be to have some time to set it all up. I am very impressed with the idea of doing a movie about aliens but it really doesn't make that much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that I feared would destroy any hope of the future. The movie is just too slow, too predictable, and the plot is a complete rip-off of some modern thriller (which I would have preferred to not watch). It is just a poor excuse for a thriller. As I have said before, the film did much better in an earlier film than it did here. I will admit that I enjoyed the first film more than the sequel, but it is simply disappointing.  The plot is too convoluted to make any sense of depth. The characters are too predictable to make the movie a complete story. The only thing that this movie did was the great and unexpected plot twist in the original. I would recommend this film only for a shallow "comedy" movie, but that was exactly the problem with the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had this one three times. It's so bad that you could be doing something with your eyes shut. It isn't funny at all. I tried watching the entire episode when it aired. It didn't make sense. It was completely over the top. The jokes were pretty dull. In fact, there was no logic behind the show. There was no way to bring the characters together. This show is so bad to watch, I don't know how the hell this show would be successful if it was done. I just hope you'll give this bad movie another chance and stick with it. The episode's ending is the only saving thought, and I guarantee that it won't be in your top 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film begins with a story where a vampire becomes a vampire and a monster tries to kill some of the members of a vampire hunting group that includes several other people. The vampire, on the side of the group, has a little resemblance to Frankenstein, and he was one of the two people who tried to kill the other group. However, when this monster is introduced to the group and his "friend" (who was also killed in the film) attacks the group. He also kills the other guys in the group in a vampire-killing spree, which results in the main villain's demise.  The story is supposed to go from "the old way" and, by the end of the movie, the main protagonist has joined up with the main vampire, a guy named Peter, and tries to use him as a vampire.  In the film's final scenes, the vampire's body is cut open and the corpse is held alight, and this is obviously just one of several instances of blood and gore.  It is not the first time I've seen a movie that contains this, but I can't say why it is so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was incredibly poorly written and directed.  Most of the actors in the movie were terrible. I just felt the acting was pretty bad. The plot was pretty simple. It also seemed to be just some sort of an idea. All in all, it wasn't interesting. All of the lines were pretty much boring and there was some bad dialog. Even the very good actors in it were pretty weak. The movie wasn't a bad one but it was a really bad one.   I give 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie at the local video store on video. The first 10 minutes of the movie were completely terrible. It's just a rip-off of the "Taken 4" movie(though a good movie in itself). The plot is a little bit confusing. It was really unclear what the hell happened to the people. Was it one person? Was it the rest of the country? How did they get into a secret underground laboratory and what did they do with it?  The acting was terrible. The whole movie played like a car accident. I couldn't believe that people could come to this creepy looking laboratory. The director obviously knew how cheap it would be to make a movie out of this crap, and he wasted most of the cast money on the special effects.  I really wanted to see something interesting, but this is not the way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen all of the terrible films made since "A Night of Terror" and this is no exception. This movie contains absolutely no plot, the only plot was in "The House of The Spider", and "The Legend of Kunta" had only 4 minutes of plot. There's absolutely no depth of character and no one that you can relate to.  In fact the plot of "The Legends of Kushalabali" should have been the best.  The characters are utterly bland. Most of them are boring. The story is incomprehensible. It doesn't even make any sense.    You will never find an actor who cares about a good story. A lot of people think that this movie is funny. But they can't be sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really awful. It is no more a movie than a movie was in the 1980s. It has some pretty good comedy, but this movie is just plain bad. I will never look forward to watching this movie again. If you are looking for humor, you will never find it. And I really don't have the nerve to even watch it. This is a waste of your time and an embarrassment for anyone that has any sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I were a big fan of "Lifestooms" and "Dead Like a Dog", I would certainly spend this movie money to make this movie, but unfortunately I cannot.  What I do know is that even if this movie was great, it would have to do more than I'm willing to pay for. The plot is very basic, and it's so basic that it's been completely predictable for months. There's not much more than a dull plot to watch.  The acting is OK in certain parts, but not so great. In the end it is really boring. I just cannot believe they decided to film this in the U.K. That is really the only reason I can't recommend this movie.  In order to get the movie to a little more screen time I had to give it some of my money, but this movie is about $3,000 so I think you can get it in a movie store, or even a video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's no wonder that this film is so terrible, but I do find myself more baffled that people could possibly come up with this film as their own. It just isn't worth watching any more then it's worth taking a look at it, but unfortunately you don't have the intelligence to figure out whether or not to be "born" in the same way that you would be if you're a boy. If you like a kid, you would watch it in your time and only later would you want to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's no denying that this film is completely offensive. But when you're doing a piece for a movie: you want to get it right. The movie itself is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I've had it done only once, and it was about an hour before. This film was weak in every single aspect, except some of the scenes I felt most like they were a cheap stunt that a guy put on. There was the ridiculous scene of a man who had a man-like face hanging from his mouth. There wasn't really anything in this movie that made me laugh. And the main character who had been playing this character all throughout the whole film was not even the "best" as I expected it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not enjoyable.  The premise is about a school-teacher, who kidnaps a kid that he used to date. She is then sent to jail where she is put in a prison cell and where she has to take care of her inmate boyfriend.  What would be the point of that? When you are locked down in a cell and you are forced to keep your day job, you might think that it would make sense.  But it doesn't. Even the cell in the prison is locked and all the doors are locked. A lot of people would have been in that cell at the end of that film. So, there has to be some reason to be more shocked. The film ends up being completely devoid of plot and drama, with almost no action, and the only reason that it got a green light in this movie is the fact that the two actors are so ridiculous that they put it in a movie: "The man who kidnapped the girl is an evil genius who keeps everything about himself a secret, who has stolen the keys and made this movie." (That part is supposed to be scary and scary)  If the acting were good in this film, it would be fine. But it's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many movies that make the plot so predictable, but when it comes to the characters it's really hard to even make some sense of that. For example, one of my favorite movies of the past, "The Castle in The Clouds", is set in a jungle with three people - the three main characters - and is just about as predictable as the characters from "The Wizard" or any other movie. Even the story itself is quite unbelievable, and the plot is never really developed.   The plot does not include any great plot twists - no matter what type of movie I would watch in this category. There are several clues that connect the main characters from the story to the movie (like the location of the mountain they are heading toward) that don't make much sense.  There is also no way for the protagonist to make a real connection with his dead father. He is dead and you would normally know that within the movie the dead father is a dead man. There is no real connection. There's nothing to connect this dead father to anyone else. It is only the character who is the hero and there is nothing to tie him to anyone. There was a great connection with the dead parents - they just die while you are watching this movie - and that was the only place in the movie to be interesting. This movie does not really deserve the respect that this movie receives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to waste my time on this movie, but if I had any motivation, I would make sure my eyes weren't damaged. As a kid, this movie is the worst that i've seen in my life. When it was first released in 2007, i was so sick and sad that i said to myself, i needed to make sure i had the patience to see it because it was bad.  I did some research on this film, and it's about as bad as it gets. It doesn't matter what you think of a horror film, but I can see it's flaws. The only saving factor is that it was filmed so beautifully and made it look like it was a movie, which is extremely unlikely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really bad...  I've seen better than this film...I guess there will be some comments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was absolutely bad - it's not even funny! i'm surprised if there are any real "good" movies in the world, but this one just didn't even make it up to me. i would like to give it 5/10, but if you are a comedy writer, i'll let you be glad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a mess and really bad. It is so bad that it is no good. Even if it had a good script, it would be a good movie. Unfortunately, this movie has nothing in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went and saw this movie at a movie theater in Seattle. In the middle of the movie I kept laughing and asking for help. I was completely bored by the story and didn't want to pay attention.  I only knew to be scared of being in this movie. I wouldn't watch this movie and didn`t intend on watching it for its potential.   The only way I would recommend this movie is to try not to watch it. It doesn`t make any sense to your soul. There is no point at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about an annoying teen girl (who can't even act!) who becomes infatuated after being introduced to a movie by her friends. But, I guess that, as soon as she starts her life as an action girl, she can only play a starring role in the movies. The plot, I can't blame it, has a somewhat funny premise, but, I couldn't figure out how the movie worked.  The acting was bad, the directing was bad - all the dialog was horrible, and the cinematography was completely uninteresting. I never felt for the entire film until I saw the final cut (which I think is not a big surprise), and I was thoroughly disgusted that I wasted my time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no plot, plot or reason, in that it's a piece of trash. The plot, when you have seen it, is not interesting. Even the main villain is an incompetent monster. The supporting characters are not that well acted, as well as they are uninteresting.  I can forgive this movie, but I can't forgive it's stupidity, stupidity and stupidity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i had heard the "star of the films" and thought i could be a director for it. i didn't realize it was only a sequel, because of the lack of originality and it was terrible, it was just too convoluted. i could tell that this was a comedy at the beginning and it didn't make up until the point. it's hard to follow what was happening. i tried reading a book and it wasn't that good. it was probably from the late 1960s. it is absolutely terrible. this film is bad, bad. you can't even make a comedy about an empty car. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem is that this movie was only filmed in one place - a tiny warehouse near the old hospital. There was no filming in the other areas.  The storyline follows several other movies that take place in the old school of St. Michael's Church in the middle of the century.   You get a bunch of misused plot elements that you can guess what would have been interesting and make you think it's a documentary about a real event and just nothing interesting about it.  At the end, you're supposed to see the church opening night and just find that the guy (the "Benedetyl") died soon (?)  It doesn't. There are more scenes that have nothing to do with the old church or even the documentary, but are still shown (like they belong to the same time and location). The end scenes are just "the old church."   I've seen all of the other movies and the only thing I liked about it was the fact that it did something interesting. They put a movie in the movie theater that was completely pointless, but they did it so badly that I'd only be surprised that it made it more interesting.  I don't see any reason to watch this movie. They made it pretentious and stupid. And it wasn't great either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a fan of "Mugged" (a film with great comedic performance by a handful of good actors) but this is an awful attempt at an indie film with a few weak moments that are actually pretty good but fail to make them a bit better. For example, the title is pretty terrible, even by casting a handful in the main. I think they're two great actors that play these parts, but it's pretty bad that there aren't any good supporting characters to use for this movie. At least the lead has an interesting role. Unfortunately, I don't think the producers intended to use any actors in this film. For starters, there is a great performance in his early role that is a lot more appealing than his role in "The Last Drop." I'd think it would be a good idea to include a lot of supporting characters in the film so they can't waste a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would think that some would enjoy this movie, it was just a waste of time, in it's sole intention was to bring back the old 'Mad Men' vibe. If you don't like 'Mad Woman' or 'Mad Man', you shouldn't watch this movie.  In the process, they tried to revive a somewhat interesting show that was no longer alive. Unfortunately, they just ruined that show and created another horrible, dumb movie: the only thing that this movie has done, is become an excuse for 'Mad Women' and 'MadMan'. I'm sorry to say that that is still true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an insult to the human eye, and I didn't care for it. I would have been willing to write it in an angry letter to the DVD distributor and the producers. But I don't know if they would take the time to make this. The dialog is awful, the acting is terrible, the directing is bad, the script is bad and the camera is bad. I'm sure there will be a lot of people who saw this movie and have no sense of humor left in their heart. I can't even make this up to myself, and it's probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'd give this movie an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. What makes it funny is that one of the jokes is about a cannibal (or cannibal) who kills his prey...  And if you're going to watch this movie, be sure you're not a cannibal yourself. This movie just doesn't have any "humor" to it. I've never laughed so much, not even if a cannibal is in the movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find this movie utterly depressing and stupid, although this is perhaps the only reason that I missed this movie (probably because it had so much potential to be an entertaining film!). I can't think of an Oscar-worthy film that doesn't make this rubbish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As with the last one, the plot was obviously not going to work. The problem with this movie was that it was not the least boring or interesting enough to make one sit through it. It's not that it is bad, it's just that the lack of action is not quite as enjoyable as it should be.  If the plot worked, then the movie would be fun to see and not only entertained if not. If it didn't, then you're wasting your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of a film. I'll admit that I did get a little bit of sleep watching it at night, but I would say that it was mainly because of a sleepiness situation with my son. I was watching it for a few minutes before I had to start watching it again. My wife said she was very disturbed by it. I won't give the spoilers, but if I was going to be on the same vacation trip my son would have taken, I wouldn't have even gone into the movie and I would never have even gotten a movie ticket. In some scenes, there are women who are the only females that you see in the movie (one of the women is named Tiffany), and what else would there be? Why did we see the woman who is not even named Tiffany? That's right, she's the only woman we see. I just cannot believe that she could get in that costume and make a movie about a movie that we have seen and yet that was the only movie I saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is complete garbage. The story is an unbelievable waste of time in my opinion. I didn't get that for much. I don't even see a reason to watch this movie. At the least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I've been on a road trip with my wife, I can't remember which movie, or where I watched it first, but if you are a fan of the musical and musical history of this genre, you will see this movie only once. This is the only movie in the world to have a director, writer, and lead actor that can't even produce a decent film, let alone an interesting performance. They tried to make this movie into a movie, but even that failed.  This movie is nothing more than a bunch of actors who pretend to do the job. When a movie is about something that is totally meaningless, i don't really care. And even when the director makes some good moves and there are some interesting scenes, then it's all in the story and not in the characters. It is a shame because this movie doesn't make much sense. The movie tries to do some pretty things but is too much like a movie that's made for kids. Maybe you can see it on a PBS show. In reality, this movie is no more than half a bad excuse for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're going to see this movie you will find it a little difficult. In fact, the movie is so horrible it's almost impossible to talk about it. You won't even think of this movie as a film but a collection of scenes that are so badly filmed and badly choreographed that it is almost impossible not to sit through it and find out who are the actors. Not only does the acting of these actors look terrible but also does the film suffer from being over-rated. The only good thing I can say is that it's the best of the bad movies I've ever seen. But you're not going to find much more quality than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, this is not really an Italian movie, the story is interesting but nothing interesting. The acting is pretty bad. The actors, especially the principal, are just very slow and not interesting. But the script is OK, the dialog, which is poorly written, is OK. The only good thing in this movie is the ending. The end is OK in it's own special way. But nothing else. Even if it weren't the end, the movie would be terrible. You can't predict the ending and I just don't believe the story has any meaning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a local movie store after it made it. A really horrible movie. I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money to rent it but my biggest concern was the title. I didn't get into it because I couldn't find it in a store or anywhere. I don't understand the plot nor what the hell is going on. My suggestion was to turn it into a comedy or a horror movie instead of wasting yourself on this nonsense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely predictable and the fact that it's a movie that doesn't even deserve the title of "I can't believe i watched it". Some may be tempted to say that this is the perfect example of a horrible movie that needs to be put out of the "good" category, but there is nothing about this movie that I would expect from a "good movie".  The first thing that i saw was the "the great musical genius" who was really the best for music, but he didn't deserve such a title. This movie tries to keep you entertained, but you don't get any good laughs. The second thing that you'll see in it was the terrible camera that was placed in the back of the stage and when you would be looking at a different thing. When you would see a scene where the stage is in a dark space and the camera is placed in a completely dark room, the scene would look like something like the Black Eype Alley stage. This isn't the case at all, it just makes it look like crap. The third thing that I saw was The scene that would have been the only reason that I got turned off. It had a female character that resembled a cartoon of a "fant cartoon" which had absolutely nothing to do with the real reality. It is about a man who is tied up with another female who has stolen his wife and has stolen the most important stuff from him. This was not a real story and it was obviously ridiculous, the woman was "attacked" and it wasn't like any real movie or "real" movie, that's all I got.  I would recommend if you avoid watching this movie. If you have nothing else to do, see it because I did. But if you see it, you'll probably hate it. If not, don't even watch this movie and avoid watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My brother has never seen the movie. I find it absolutely ridiculous that this movie is so ridiculously horrible. The scenes of the film are ridiculous and completely absurd. The actors have been so horrible that you wonder if this is actually their first film, or if they are a "comedy" movie. The acting is terrible. The script is extremely weak. The movie looks like a bunch of guys sitting around a pool and going through the whole thing in a few minutes. This has nothing to do with reality. The only redeeming feature is the humor, which is just about a lighthearted, witty humor to a small group of actors. I am sorry to see that this is so cheap, and it is only going to be a cheap and uninteresting, low budget, low-budget film. What a shame. If they wanted to make a fun film, it would be worth it. If you don't like it, you will probably not enjoy it, but the story is interesting enough to make you think it is a movie. This is all the worst I've ever seen. Avoid at least one movie because it is too bad to see a movie: I'm sure you'll like it better later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really hoping that this movie will be canceled due to the incredibly annoying, self-centered, and totally uninteresting storyline, but I thought it was just too shallow and boring to be expected.  I tried watching this movie at the DVD store and was quite impressed by the amateur cinematographer (also directed the piece of "American History"). While the actors were OK, there wasn't much here that made me jump, which is understandable for a film with such a limited budget, it lacked any real depth or substance, especially with respect to the events of the war. However, there was very little in common to the action scenes that were filmed by any movie cinematologist, leaving me wondering if this was really a film.  Also, the movie lacked the same level of excitement. While watching it, I kept checking the same spot in the video to find out if there was any real story behind the war itself. When the war actually started, there were no images of the events that we can see. This film should have been filmed using a camera with a large lens so that we could see the horrors that we actually saw on those battlefields. That was the main reason I stopped watching the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really understand that this movie is about a girl who gets rid of a vampire.  I can't figure out why it was made. The first thing I noticed is the lack of a story. It isn't presented as a vampire movie but it's really not that. I thought that they just showed off a bunch of vampires but they had to cut off the vampire story and put a lot of the vampire-movie stuff in there too. What they had in mind was trying to make a movie for teens but that doesn't work. The way that the vampire guy died is pretty strange. I don`t understand why he was stabbed in his stomach and died in a few minutes. It just seemed like he died for no reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this film all my life, but I think I've seen worse movies.  What a horrible movie, with a bad plot and an awful plot. It seems like every time they can't tell the "who" they are. The actors who do a good job, seem to be completely out of place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to say that i didn't even care for the movie (though i did like it the most) but i was disappointed in the way that it failed. It failed because of its weak plot and the inability to make it any clearer. The only reason i was able to care so much, was that it had a decent cast and in that regard it didn't do a great job. I mean if the movie had been a real movie i'd have laughed at the movie but the film failed. There was nothing to take away from the movie that I didn't already think was an action movie. The script was a complete rip-off of a movie: the characters in the movie, the action scenes were completely unconviable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst of the worst. It is not funny.  This has just been called a comedy at times. It's not funny and it's not enjoyable. If you think it's funny it is actually terrible. If I could get into a movie with this sort of crap I would. However if you watch it on TV there are many things that are funny. The idea is to go into a dark cave in the dark of the night and make everyone mad. It isn't funny. I was interested to see the characters go to a very dark cave and try to get help. The story is stupid, I don't care how you put it in your head and that is why this is the movie I watched. It doesn't matter if you are into comedy, but if you don't then I think you have to go for something more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very predictable and pretty predictable. While I was interested in this movie at the beginning, I quickly decided that I was just looking for something more. I was only vaguely aware of a plot based on the famous movie, "It's Your Money". The film doesn't really have any storyline beyond a couple of men getting a little on the beach and getting a couple. There's little romance and it just sort of drags on.  The only redeeming quality in this film is that it shows the beauty of South Africa. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen. In fact, there's nothing more terrible than the premise. A woman kills her husband, is attacked by a gang of thugs who try to steal her money from the police, she escapes and takes off on a cruise. Once she has arrived at the gang's camp, she has to decide whether or not to be killed. Then she meets her fate and is attacked, because her husband is in his car, by a helicopter. If we're interested in this type of story, it's not much different from other low budget thrillers, like the movies "The Naked Mile", and "I Don't Care About You", or the countless others. Not only do they suck, but their plot and characters are so poorly scripted, that if you're not looking for action, you're going to be left wanting nothing but a bunch of big lines written in a notebook. This is all too bad, but I have to admit that some people were actually enjoying it. If you want to be part of the problem, the plot is not much better than the other films that have it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't see the word "dramedy" in my notes, but it's not as bad as this one. The best parts are the first few minutes. It's bad enough that they didn't take it much more seriously than the last one. But, you need to do something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know that in the movie "Cabin Films" it's called the "movie that has been made". This movie has so much bad acting that I can't think of a single thing that this movie has managed to accomplish. The movie doesn't really even have any storyline. There are no character that seems to care about one of the main characters.  It's pretty embarrassing that some people think that this has a storyline. I would just like to see the real story before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is just stupid. It could only have been good fun if it was interesting. But it is not. I would have bought the movie and turned it off. The plot of this movie is an example of why I should not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well... if I could give this film a score, it would be pretty good. But when I looked at the beginning and the end I really couldn't make it stick. I could not understand the plot, the characters, the camera settings, or the lighting. The story was about some of the other actors and how they acted. It was a pointless, pointless story. This film had no characters. The whole film was just some very cheap acting and the story is just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a stupid premise. "Where is my mother?" is a ridiculous premise for a movie. The mother is a real person (and the father), and not an illusion. The only person in both parts is the "father" (the "mother" being his wife), who is never in the movie either. How does this movie even begin? How can such a plot even happen? It is only possible that there is some "spacy" plot that makes it possible to make the story of the mother's pregnancy, and she is the only person who can supposedly act as "the mother of the dad." What happens? Some guy gets pregnant. The "spancy" plot is there. And then, the story's premise has to come up. I have to say that it didn't make me laugh like it did. What a silly premise. This one is a bad one. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never found any good films, because most films don't do anything to live. This is no exception. The movie is about a school girl who lives a high school in the summer to help a group of people get to the school that has taken up another high school graduate, and then starts to take over the whole school and lives in it, so that she is forced to start getting high school after she has finished school.  The girl is in the school with a bunch of boys. That makes me feel uncomfortable, I feel like the idea of girls making friends is really stupid. The boys do nothing but make jokes and try to intimidate her. The only thing that really stands out in this film is the ridiculous idea that she doesn't have a father to take care of her. This movie doesn't come across well. It's not too bad, it just looks like a highschool kid trying to make friends and ruining it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little more than a story of how a little rich girl, (he, by the name of Charlotte) was going to be a wife of a rich man who had to have her for another fiance.   But it isn't just that. It's just another of Charlotte's countless failed attempts to marry someone who she doesn't love (the reason for my spoiler) and doesn't want to marry (not her fiance, a well educated man with money, but her fiancé).  The scene in which the wife is so obsessed with Charlotte that she sets her sights on her fiancée (the man she's supposed to have) is just a glorified for-the-play-play (if it weren't a movie it's really played) of Charlotte blowing her up. The scene with Charlotte in the kitchen is a piece of garbage, but at least it was a movie that actually made sense. The script is poor, but it does have some charm in it.  The acting is terrible. Some of the dialogue is painfully stupid, especially the first scene with the mother and the mother kissing, as there is no chemistry between them. The two seem to be so close but don't get a lot of real connection between them, making it totally unbelievable.  Some good (or at least not bad) cameos.  But the plot isn't enough to carry the film, and even Charlotte can't have the most beautiful role she plays for. She is, at least, an actress with more talent than the bad-movie-making. Even though she did a fine job, there was no chemistry there.  Overall, a terrible film: Charlotte and her fiancians are so obsessed she's going to set herself up on another wedding. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Adventures of Tom Sultana" is absolutely trashy, and a major embarrassment to the film industry. I'm not going to make a comparison because this film wasn't very good, but the fact that it is so weak and predictable, just makes it seem absurd.  If this is to be one of Sultans' first film, I'll be interested in seeing his best, perhaps even more dangerous, time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a long time fan of "Fantastic Voyage", I thought "Fancy" would be a great movie to be shown. But unfortunately it didn't work. The acting was horrible, the story seemed weak (did they even try to make the time to work?) and the cinematography was poor.   In the end, the movie was too silly to be funny. I was hoping to see "Fancies" brought back to life by a real director (if that is indeed possible). But unfortunately this movie was a big waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a laugh.  What an absolute bummer. This movie was full of it's worst elements. The acting was bad, the music was bad--it wasn't funny, and I couldn't even remember the theme music that they used. I was very disappointed in the movie, and the end is bad. The other songs that I heard, I guess they weren't part of the movie's soundtrack. They were a bunch of songs for little kids who never worked out. I think you can get better music if you put a good music CD in your movie.  The movie was the only movie I gave 2 stars to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the only movie that made me shudder. There's a lot of bad stuff, a couple of bad jokes and a stupid couple of "relations". Don't even watch it, just watch it on the TV. It will suck the life right out of you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't believe it was ever made. I'd like to make it so, but I can't.   What happens when we decide that the "good" thing in a movie is that it's going to get made.  A little overrated (and horribly dated) movie in which a big-buddy cop falls on his own.  In a lot of ways this movie did not even begin to answer to the great director (Stephen Masterson) who could have made such a film.  I would have been fine watching this movie if it were even the slightest bit interesting. There are a few moments where you can't figure out what happened, but the lack of clarity of the story really made this movie unbearable.  Avoid this one at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't help but seeing the 'twins,' 'The Little Rockettes,' & their little girl, 'Little Rockettes' in this film was horrible. It was painful to watch all of their horrible acts, one of the ones I didn't care much about at the beginning. The film doesn't deliver any meaningful character or storyline, or any real feeling. In any kind of 'family' movie, this would be a big fail.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the most awful film I have ever seen. If you want to watch a horror film, see The Evil Twin. Don't. Avoid this one. I don't know how I got into this film: a random college freshman in the 1980s (this year of my life) saw it for class and it got lost on the projector. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it is only in the second-half of the film that I can say this is OK.  The plot is just plain bad. The characters are really flat, you can't tell where the evil twin is coming from, and the scene when the Twin tries to escape from a cellar with the mysterious red lady is only one of many in which you can see the demon. So I don`t know. All of the special effects are lame, and there is no point to watch this movie. The only thing I say is that if you are going to see this movie, you are better off without it. If there was any good parts of the movie, it would have been a really good movie. But it didn`t come across that high of quality. The film is probably made for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the only horror movie I had seen in a couple of years that was completely incoherent and incoherent. And that wasn't the only problem. The plot is extremely weak, with a ridiculous number of absurdly absurd twists and special effects (aside from a really good cameo by Johnny Tatum) and the director seems to have no idea what he is doing.  I can't recommend this movie to anybody, nor do I expect to pay much for it. It's an awful, bad movie that sucks off every one of the actors except for those who are there to work their characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really mad at the producers and the director. They wasted a lot of talent in this film. The fact that this is the best movie ever filmed I can't believe this is a great, interesting, creative film. It's a completely predictable, mindless, piece of garbage. When I watched it I thought my life would be ruined.  The fact is I like this type of film very much, I like it in the beginning but I couldn't figure out how to get into it. If you're a movie-maker don't waste time on wasting the talent, don't get so close to the truth.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a good idea to make a film in honor of a certain milestone of cinema, one that, after all, I'm not even sure that I would have made. I went into the book for the story and I didn't like it. I only laughed a few times and then, in a moment, felt like I was sitting in the library, reading. I have trouble remembering where it was. This movie is really slow, and I really wanted to see the ending.  The script is extremely slow, I couldn't even begin to think the action sequences. What was the point of "making a great film" and why did this not occur? There are some interesting images and a nice soundtrack, but the movie could only just be described in words in the movie's first 2 hours. This is not a movie that I can say I liked.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is interesting, but as a result of the lack of "story" it is predictable, and this causes a huge risk. The characters are predictable, the plot is predictable and they are predictable as they jump around a bad film. You're left wondering why a person would make a movie like this. Not only do they seem to act like a bunch of kids, but they act like they're actors who are going around doing ridiculous things and making ridiculous movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard nothing from this movie. I am a man who can easily distinguish his own sense of decency from that of the director. I don't really like that. I think this movie is bad, but I just don't care about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an utter failure. I didn't think that a movie this was would be so poor. A lot of movies and TV are so much better than this. The characters should be better. This isn't even worth a mention. I won't even touch the director, for shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't even begin to make the impression I'd like to make about this genre.  Not really interesting, not interesting, very repetitive. It's just a little bit strange. If you didn't get bored by the movie, it would be scary.  But I really didn't mind it being scary. I don't have much of a sense of the plot, I don`t care about the characters and their lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't blame this movie for the fact that it's so horrible. It's very, very simple. You see a group of teens who is supposed to be a couple and get to marry a "love" couple... well...  The girl's college roommate is in for her first ever date with the guy, and he doesn't treat her in a decent way. The whole movie revolves around getting laid and making love... but you already know that the love of making love (the whole movie!) has just been made. And the whole movie makes no sense. The movie doesn't end, but you can see it's a pretty bad story. The sex scene is pretty good, but nothing too interesting. But the "love scene" with the girl's boyfriend and the guy is OK, and the girl decides to sleep with him to help keep the guy awake. Well, it's OK for the movie. I guess that's OK. But it really isn't worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to recreate the genre of movies like "The Naked Ray" and "The Waterman" which are both awful and ridiculous. There's only one scene that succeeds with the best performance I have ever seen by Gary King (as Michael Pitt), but the rest of the movie is one of many stupid and ridiculous scenes. If you think the first "The Ray" was good, I guarantee you will find out they are not all that bad anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be one dimensional, one dimensional and so boring. The acting was a poor one. A bad plot is a bad plot, even a poor plot. The supporting characters were horrible and the story is unbelievable. I just wanted to leave the movie after 15 minutes. I was hoping to see the real ending, but I am not doing that because of the acting and the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't get sick. What I do is eat up is the movie of the movie with the names "The Naked Dead" and "Dead Alive". I do not know why anyone was supposed to buy this movie and not see it the way people do now with films with titles like "The Walking Dead" or "Fear Factor". I am not going to buy them because this is a bad, amateur film and I don: How can I do that if I'm so low on health?? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies with a weak story and bad writing and bad acting. I think I am going to be very disappointed with it. It isn't good enough for a real family. I don't think it is for children, it doesn't even have a real message. In fact, I think the entire premise of the movie is totally meaningless. I have a hard time believing that this was really made for an adult. I am surprised that this is actually a decent movie. I won't spend more than $20 on it but I wouldn't even buy it because I think it needs more money to be a movie. Please make something like this a legend because it can't make it up to be something that so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the entire film without seeing a single minute of the plot. I had no idea what they were going to do with the film, or where it was going to go. I felt like I was watching an independent movie set in a really bizarre underground.  I have never encountered anything that I could see as so much garbage like this. The "music" seemed to be made up by people that had never seen music before. It was like you were watching a dumb-wash comedy movie.  The story was terrible.  A couple of characters were supposed to die and were replaced in various different ways. Some of them died and were changed into an evil, greedy woman. When they died, they all seemed to have died in the same way. One of the actors was a corpse that looked like he was dead but died after being resurrected and not in the proper way. Other characters were changed with no explanation. The film had a little bit of comedy that I can't even describe, but they seemed to me to be so much about making the film that I didn't even think they'd have the fun they might normally have done with a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title of this movie seems to be a kind of parody of a classic action movie: the good man kills everyone, and everyone dies. This movie has been so bad that I didn't even watch it, and I'm not sure what's in it. But it really does fit the description, though. It's bad enough that the story lines of the protagonist aren't actually interesting. And, for one thing, the movie is the kind of movie that you've seen many of the days, and not much of any real action, either. There are a few instances of a girl who becomes a victim of a serial killer and gets turned into a zombie, which is pretty funny when it isn't scary, as it doesn't look like a zombie. (The movie was originally about the girl's friend who was sexually abused by her brother, but the friend is just an average girl, as she's very cute, and a lot more popular.) I really wanted to check and see if this movie is similar to something I saw before. It didn't really look like it was. I thought the plot looked like it, but I was just watching things for a couple of minutes, and was never actually sure if the movie was going to be something like that.   My favorite scene was the scene with a little girl getting shot in the face by the gun, so it was funny.  So, it's no good. Even the first few minutes after you turn it off were just boring. In this movie, you just want to die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really a big fan of Sci-Fi. And of course, you have to understand that there are some writers who are so brilliant that they are not allowed to write or even talk about them.  I have a very big heart and am determined to see that people who hate this kind of movie just don't realize that this sort of movie is ridiculous. It is not even an excuse for the badness of the plot, which I had hoped would be funny. The fact that this film isn't really funny is the only reason why I'm so annoyed.  It is so bad, I was thinking of turning it into a horror movie when I was watching it for a few minutes. I was expecting this movie to be a comedy, like The Last Dream or something like The Bedtime Murder. I would have laughed at it, but that wasn't the only mistake I had, so I don't really want to be mad at this movie. I only wish it had the same quality as The BedTime Murder, and perhaps have that kind of rating instead of being put on the shelf and forgotten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first thing I can say about this movie is that it is a lousy movie that contains nothing that should be done.  This movie contains absolutely nothing but empty words that can only come from some dumb, mean-spirited film no matter how much a director has dreamed.  The story of "Zara", a little girl who doesn't like anything, is very simple and dull. There's nothing interesting here, only bad things.  It is a shame because the movie was very good.  However, if you like the ending of the story, you will enjoy it, and if you have even a passing interest in a story, then this movie will probably make you mad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening scene is absolutely ridiculous (I thought the words I typed to "just" the words that I'd say in that sentence are wrong!), the plot is lame (it's not about the real world), the idea behind is absolutely moronic and the supporting cast is bad (especially the two sisters); and finally the ending is horrible and unfuled (I just want to say, if I see more horror movies I would never want to see it again). I would like to say that this movie is an example of the genre, but it is no more.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of unappreciated humor, bad writing and bad acting. It's also full of bad lines.  How do you think the director and stars got paid for this piece of garbage?  It's just about four actors (Pilio Rivera, Ben Stiller, Kelly MacKinnon and Johnny Hight (the best guy in the world, aside from the original cast) who act as a pair of old-fashioned guys who get married in one of the most unappointing parts ever.  I guess if you're interested in movies, it's probably better to be like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major flaw with this film is that it attempts to be the action-adventure film, and fails at this task. While in a movie's premise, a successful person would do anything in life to avoid a murder and murder, this film fails to do so. While the acting is mostly decent, the acting was poorly done and the premise is totally meaningless. The ending of the movie is also completely meaningless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just went into it expecting a laugh, I didn't. The movie is so bad it doesn't even make me laugh. The plot is so terrible it can only be considered a comedy. The acting is awful, the cinematography is horrible, the plot is weak and the story is weak.  If you are a big fan of James Stewart and John Cleese, it's pretty entertaining. But this movie is a rip-off from their own movies, not their respective shows. This was really bad even worse than one of their other comedies. They should have been so much better at making movies than this one. I will never see another comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting isn't good, but the plot is decent. But overall, it is a pretty bad movie.  There are some good scenes and some of good story lines, but this movie just isn't that. A couple of supporting characters didn't do too well in the movie, so you can't say anything about them.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what i am thinking of right now, and what i think of. I have seen nothing but an excuse to make movies. I didn't watch the first two movies. My brain was all straining against me. It just wasn't something I could sit down and watch.  If i did, I would sit and think and pray for my souls, but, hey, at least they didn't make me mad. At least they weren't bad.  The problem is that "wet dreams" can only come true when one is not sober enough. The characters in this film have no brains of their own.  I give this film a rating of 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie from the 1990's that does little more than a very irritating and silly idea. It is also the worst movie ever filmed in America, and it doesn't have an interesting script that makes it worthwhile. I do hope that this has been changed somehow, but not for the reasons discussed above. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What the hell is this? This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is truly a failure. In fact, you get to know as soon as the film is done.   There's something wrong with this one. You don't know if the film-makers plan to do a sequel, and if they do, it needs to be very different, not just a sequel like "Star Wars" and not just some throw-together bimps.  The main reason I can't give this one two points is the story-line and the characters are terrible.  Also, the special effects are terrible; they just aren't enough.  This is so bad, it's not even worth watching; I'm actually disappointed the film had an Oscar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, a lot of people have come out to this movie: people that actually believe that this movie is a movie. I'm thinking they just don't know what they're watching. It's obvious that the movie doesn't understand that this is not a movie, and this is probably the last person that will ever see it in a movie: "You can get my body back".   But it's so boring that it's actually hard to watch. I found myself watching this in the bathroom of a bad coffee shop.  I just sat there watching some of the actors try to make me believe they are actors that actually act. They're not actors, they're just actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a simple idea that you find out your future. When you find it, you end up killing people. The story is not very good, but it has a few good scenes. Unfortunately, the story is bad, and the plot is not good either.  In the ending, you have to know the story line beforehand, so it would be a better ending if you put your name next. The ending is terrible, and it should be a great ending. But in the whole movie, the plot didn't make sense. The biggest mistake I can make is the fact that the guy that kills everyone else, is just in front of his own desk. I cannot believe that he is even alive and could still pull off a killing of some other people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a few minutes, the entire film had become boring. A couple of minutes after a scene had got boring.  A couple more minutes later, I was able to watch it again. It was only that when I stopped watching it, it became boring. The story was a story that I had never heard before, but a story with a bunch of dumb-guy jokes and a bunch more dumb-ass jokes.  What was funny about this story is that it had a lot of stupid jokes that were obviously about "comedy" movies--they're obviously about making dumb movies. What we've learned from this is that stupid comedy is not going to make any money.  I'm hoping I got an accurate review about this:  This movie is bad for a reason that can't explain. If you are a humor-fan and you like a comedy movie, this is probably not for you. If your taste of humor is something you really enjoy, you probably enjoy one of these dumb movies anyway. The people who wrote this movie are clueless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of things are going to happen in this movie, as you can tell.  First of all, it's not even very good. It's not great. The beginning is pretty good, but the direction is too vague, and the actors are not convincing, so it's pretty hard to identify what people are supposed to be.  What makes it the worst I've seen in a film: the dialogue. The first 2 acts are decent, and there are some nice scenes, but they leave them much unsatisfied, and a lot of the time I was thinking they would just be friends in one scene. I can't find this in any of the previous films, and I think it's just as bad, because it has the same annoying plot with two actors and a camera.   It's an odd story with a couple of stars. A lot like I love in "Gantu" where a guy is going to bed with a girl who wants to get married, but instead of going to the hospital, he comes and steals her.  The ending is also not very good, because there are a lot more scenes without any dialogue. I thought it was very interesting when the guy was reunited with his wife, but I think they were trying to bring in a lot different characters, but that doesn't work. I think the film tries to make this up on a regular basis, but just goes on with no dialogue. It is like they were making a regular movie and then, just decide what to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was never thrilled with this movie. I mean I knew it would not be good, but then I was right. I didn't know what I was going to say beforehand, but I sure figured that the plot was supposed to be something interesting and I was wrong. When I watched it I didn`t understand why I was supposed do that. I wanted my life back and to have the next day to see the sequel and what was going wrong. I had been searching for days, but it was very disappointing, so I decided to turn off the DVD for good. I don't mind complaining about a movie that has bad acting and story, but you don`t want to see that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest problem with this movie is that there are two of the two stars - the girl that was the star of 'The Hills', and the girl who was the main star in 'Beautiful Creatures'. When I saw the end of 'Beauties', I couldn't believe that the girl was actually in 'The Hards', because she was supposedly a co-star. However, I had to believe that this girl was in 'Horns', so I looked at the casting for the film and was shocked to find that she wasn't in the film. And the girl had only been in the beginning of the movie - not the whole film.   So, in addition to the other problems, I'd like to add one more thing to this film - the fact that the film didn't really come out as a complete story.  My friend Tim was right. When we filmed 'The Bears' we used a lot of footage from the end to the first part of the film, and that is what was used for most of the scenes. In 'The Husband', we filmed some scenes where the characters were all in one place - except for the main part which is a couple of people sitting in the bathroom. In this case, Tim didn't actually show us any scenes from the first scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie at 2 years old, and it got pretty bad after I was so sick. I was very disappointed with the plot and the story. There was an interesting premise to it, but the acting wasn't good. I just don't care about it. Maybe a movie with a good premise and a good plot would be more enjoyable to watch than this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely horrid. It's full of bad acting (particularly from the actors who portrayed the Nazi and the Nazi). A typical plot is the Nazi killing the "innocent" civilians of the war. These are the guys who will destroy Germany and destroy the world. There are very few people who can even make the Nazi sound like that. The acting is horrible, especially the Nazi in the beginning, and they don't make it easy for the rest of the characters.  What is the value of this movie? The fact that I got through this film by watching it is pretty sad, because I've seen better dramas. Even the film itself wasn't good. A lot of scenes in this movie were not the intended or most interesting. The movie was made out of an attempt to make a comedy that sounded like it was an action movie, but the acting is awful and the plot was poorly written. You don't need to see this movie if you don't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the first film in the late 1980's because of its credibility, but after the first 15 minutes of viewing I was completely confused as to what was happening. The first film had no real storyline and the story was just about what happened in the first 45 minutes. That's not good enough! I'd like to say that I've seen much better films, but I'm not sure I'd trust this film to be even a second best. The director is obviously not a man with the talent to do this film. He has a very weak script and he doesn't seem to understand the characters he's supposed to act. They are obviously trying to bring together a bunch of people who have very different personalities, and it just doesn't go for anything. The scenes just look like one man who likes to drink with a hot liquor and then get into a car with a bunch more hot liquor.  The acting was OK, but that is the only reason that they're allowed to use in the film. A little bit of humor, although it was very obvious that a lot of scenes were just a series of scenes. This is just a slap in the face of what we've been used to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few minutes after we got into the film's strange world of evil, the acting was awful. Even the good actors of the first film would have been a little bit too predictable. The whole thing seemed contrived and stupid. Even in the beginning of the film, we felt like there was a motive for the evil people, a couple of evil twins. The plot seemed weak. Then they came for the heroes in an insane world, which had a small cast of their characters. And so we just felt like they were a bunch of morons. The acting was about as bad as they could possibly make.  This film is about like the bad movies of the late 1920s. You never get really interested. You just get a few glimpses and a few moments that you feel the film isn't going to last, and you just look forward to being bored.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I find the whole plot line is complete garbage... the idea of the "Bears" is ridiculous. The premise is that the people in the forest are infected by the black magic, which is supposed to take away the blood of the old vampire who fell out with the other vampire, which in turn turns into a bloodthirster and kills everyone who is not infected by it. It sounds like it's a vampire movie, but it isn't. It's just one giant stupid premise that isn't worked out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of the talented directors who made the films "The Love of the Movie: A Movie about the love of a movie". What happened to this movie was the lack of any substance.  The movie itself wasn't bad, but the lack in fact caused the film to completely lose any real substance. The fact that they were given a chance to film this film is the reason why I rate this movie at 1 out of 10 (and I do not even know what they put in the "feature"). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this very low budget flick, the plot is basically an attempt to recreate the "Bored Aimes" series from the early 90s. In the early series, the main characters had to learn how to play the part of a spy, and there wasn't any real suspense to take place. This film is nothing like the series, but there are a few things that are worth keeping an eye on. They can't be read all that easily from the film's very predictable dialog, but that might be because it is just like the movie.   The first thing that was obviously missing from the series was the actual acting. This is the second "Borscht" flick I've seen made with real talent. Unfortunately, "Berscht" has no real talent, so the acting is pretty bad. The story's predictable, so we can't really blame the actors.  The second thing that got me really worried was the fact that this is actually an "Borz" movie. The premise is the idea that "Bots" are constantly watching something for some reason that makes the Bots think they're going to make a bomb. They don't need to know anything about this thing, and they obviously have no idea what would be, and when they do have a bomb, it is pretty useless because they just don't care about it. So it is really pointless for us to talk about it as "Bost" (the bomb). They are all the same people who were so ridiculous when they were doing the same thing that makes this movie. If you want to be sure, just watch the film in one sitting and you'll know it isn't even a movie. All the other things are pretty bad, and I've never seen anyone watch a film that was like this.  In general, you can get a sense of how this is made for a very cheap budget. There are a lot of little spots on the sets, such as the little town in the city that they've been filmed. I would have chosen another set instead of using sets for the movie, and it just looked like it was a real movie. I don't think they would have wanted to do anything as well made as the "Citron" movie that they made.  I can see the plot's similarity to other works of "Bitch" that are, unfortunately not very good, so I'm not really looking out for much more detail. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of talent and wasted effort by the director and co-writer. It is a shame to see another movie with such lame plot and lack of production (with this lack alone making the movie a piece of trash!) The movie stars John C. McGregor, with his usual overacting. The story is one of the most annoying, unforthoped, and nonsensical in the world, with no real storyline whatsoever. The movie is obviously nothing more than a pretense of "journey of the world". This film is simply a cheap way to "make an adventure of some sort" as a series of stunts which are filmed as a group of strangers on a desert island in the United States. What they should have done with this is a real journey, one that is more about to get some real life experience (as well as some real fun!). I can't imagine anyone doing something this poor. I just want a real adventure of my own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, I just can't believe that it's about the 'horses' (as in horses). Why is there ever a movie that portrays a real, living animal, and then shows how that animal was killed? You must be kidding me, you must be joking me! That has nothing to do with reality! There is no real life in this movie. No real horse. No life's going to be portrayed like the horse would, unless it's the horse itself. What the hell is that? What the heck is life? No life, I'm sure. My guess is that this movie was so far off the mark, that a group of people got together and made a movie about a real horse killing people. I thought they had come to an early stage in the movie, and thus they didn't even try to make a movie with a real life animal. How many years do you have to go and make one? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I felt the film was so terrible is that it was so bad it made me laugh. I can't recall a single comedy in this film that actually made me smile.    In the end of the film, we were laughing at the fact that it seemed to have just been thrown together to create a movie with a bunch of stars who really aren't there for reasons that you can probably find in the film itself.  How did the director think this was a movie?  I think it may have just happened as an excuse to promote a bad, bad movie. The problem isn't one of the actors in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a letdown: I couldn't even find the 1-star movie that I had gotten from my friends when I brought it home with me. I'm sure I could find it at least in the video a bit more pleasant. The only redeeming merit was the extremely well directed by the fine young filmmakers who would normally work on films of this quality. The director has his head in the ground to deal with an unprofessional film: it's just not worth his time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just had a moment of panic when I was watching this movie. I felt like I'm going to do something stupid. There are no actors who can act in this film, and they are not actors who could act in any kind of genre. I'd rather watch a movie that isn't even a comedy, but this one is a bad, boring mess. It's bad in every other sense, too lowbrowed and too predictable. If I'd ever have a chance to see this movie I wouldn't even want to see it again. It lacks some of the usual things I expect from movies such as this one. It has no plot. The characters are all stereotypes, as is the setting. The story is just a bunch of characters that try to go along with the main characters. They do nothing but try to be interesting and nothing is interesting. The plot is about a couple who move into a house after getting divorced and move into town from somewhere. I wish it didn't come with a cheesy ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those films that are horribly bad! I never could have found the last few minutes I wanted to, and I'm sure I'll never again. It's all too predictable, too predictable in fact. There are times that you're looking for an action movie and find yourself bored and left wondering why.  This film doesn't deliver. It doesn't make any sense. It just doesn't have any story or story lines. And it's really just a bunch of people who just wanted to have some fun.  There is nothing to make this movie interesting, and it just doesn taint the whole family's hopes, hoping to find some laughs. It contains some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen, but the movie isn't fun to watch.  The only good thing about this film is the actors. They manage to bring together something I'm not sure of to this writer's knowledge. But they fail to provide any real entertainment, and everything is just another mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's all too slow, it's too dark, it lacks the dramatic and visual elements, it fails to deliver. What a surprise, I would guess if it was made for the Criterion Channel (or perhaps in the early '90s) because I never heard such a bad series before.  The acting was fairly good, though, in my opinion, it could have been improved. It was very badly written. The plot, I guess, has some depth, though not all of it. The characters were flat, so the director did not help. The cinematography was too light, too blurred, in certain scenes. I wonder if the director didn't have a clue as to the cinematography for a few scenes.  All of these scenes were filmed in front of a window, a window set in the middle of the house. The director didn`t take advantage of the window. I guess it was meant to be filmed with the window shut so it doesn't really have any depth and the story lines were simply drawn into the screen. The only thing I would say is that the scene with the naked woman, for example, was filmed in a room with a window shut. The camera zooms around the room so it has a clear view of the apartment, though that isn`t too big. That is an excuse for the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely not worth it. I can't remember any other movie that has ever come close to this one - this was only a half-hour. I could have done something much more with this story, but I didn't. I felt like I was watching a poorly executed version of "The Wizard of Oz." As I sat with a camera, I realized I was seeing a terrible version of a story. What did Dorothy and the Oz people do when they get back together? Wasn't there a big fight? When they're in the cave and you can see the faces of the animals on the wall? Why did they give the head and tail to the guy that they gave to the monkey? Who was driving their car? What did they know about this situation before they started filming? The only real piece of fun in this movie was the scene where they talked to each other and their reactions - why would they do such a thing? What the heck were they talking about in that room? I was left wondering whether they wanted to film this part of the film! I will never get to sleep again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Mask of Terror" is a poor movie. It isn't even a horror film. I mean, the people who made this are obviously not insane... they have never killed people before. The actors must be totally insane...  Well, the plot is alright but...  It's just not worth watching.  The dialog, the acting and the storyline are bad... they are just not that good.  I am looking for something better: "The Ghost of Christmas." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just like the other trash shows where you have a cast of characters who are incapable of making good decisions on their respective characters. The characters are really annoying. And, the acting is awful. I can't imagine why they made it a lot of money out of the other actors who obviously deserved better roles. Even with a good cast. If that is not the case, I guess I am not going to waste my time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. What really is in it for me? Who would think that a movie from this genre would even get to the bottom of this one? The story is a little bit absurd. The good idea in this movie is that it is about a woman who is a married woman, and she takes some action, which doesn't occur, in some cases to her husband. In some cases, that husband actually helps her out of her misery. The story also makes no sense. The women are not all the way that the women in the movie are. It doesn't make sense. It just doesn't have any logic.   Other than the story, the other side of the film is extremely annoying. It does not even have any good characters. It has very old characters and there is no plot. The funny thing about this film is that the characters are very cute. They don't seem to have any reason for doing anything. It is just a bunch of idiots who try to catch the man they need to catch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a total shocker this film. Even the biggest of the film's producers couldn't find any reason why this film needed to go through the long-winded process of putting a bunch of actors in a story, and then filling out the story with endless dialogue and endless scenes of pointless action. It was bad! Bad, bad, bad! I can't remember the reason why it was put on! This was all over in the beginning of the day, and even the most important part of it was very early. How did you get to see this film?  Oh yeah. Oh yes. I thought it was interesting to have a film that focuses on the people and the environment of the sea and air-breathed by airplanes. What a shame, I'm sure. The characters who were put in this film were probably very good, if not so involved in some ridiculous and pointless activities. A shame.  I think they should have put some actors in the film. It would have been good. It might have been a bit less cheesy. They tried and tried and put a lot of people in the mix, and had a nice shot at the other side of the world. The only thing that got us out of it (at least for me) was the fact that it was so old. It had to be about 20 years old. What happened to "the people" in this movie? The people were not the people who created this film, in fact, they were just people on the other end.  That is why I have this film placed on the list of "bad movies". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was pretty bad. I didn't like it at all. I really didn't want to watch it at the price of $3 to see some pretty funny things. And I really wanted the credits to be removed, which I wish they didn't. It's a sad day when people do that to a movie. But it didn't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the only film of the last 20 years that can't do this so badly. I gave this film a 10, because the acting is decent, but the director, who is one of the worst film directors in the history of the industry, should have been working on another film.   I give this film 1 1/2 because it is not the way I expected it to be. A good story might involve a couple with an abusive ex-partner, but what happens is not believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a completely amateur production of a movie which features some scenes that are so bad that they deserve an Oscar nomination. What are the effects from the "real" scenes that were supposed to have been in the movie? Why can't there be a scene that is so ridiculous? How is it possible for the story to have so many characters and only 1 character that seems to be in it? The "real world" is completely unbelievable in every way.  I'm sure it was supposed to be a parody of the infamous "Dead Men" series, but they didn't use the "Real world" of Dead Men! I thought the scenes from "Dead Man" were so terrible that they couldn't even come off that way anymore. The whole thing just proves that the genre of "Dead men" is silly. The only way that this movie was supposed of being a comedy was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After having spent half of the movie watching the movie, it's time for me to say what was wrong with it.  The first thing that I noticed was that it really didn't take place. The movie, "Cannibal Life" is a movie that never really places. There is some very interesting story but the movie never makes any sense whatsoever. The acting, script and direction were very bad. The story was horrible. It seemed like a movie made in your own basement, and it didn't.  There are some very good scenes and some great acting and special effects but the story just doesn't matter. The next thing that is wrong with the movie is that it completely lacked a storyline. The plot of this movie is pretty basic. It's really a few things, such as a guy with a very annoying wife (who we can't identify) that kidnaps the daughter of an old man, and then meets the daughter's father in an empty building that was used for a movie for a long time (not in this movie). The father is in the middle of a long period of time and wants to help his son to get his life back. The son, as I have noted, has very important family values and the mother was very, very shallow.  Well, after this point, the movie becomes interesting and the acting is a bit better. But the movie doesn't go much further than a basic story. You see something interesting, but there are just a few details you don't care for. I only felt like it had a decent storyline but was just about as dumb as the others.  What's interesting are the scenes that follow the movie and you don�t care for until the movie reaches its climax. This is the only movie that I think that had a good storyline, and that's really all that I wanted. This movie, I don�den have to admit, is bad. It lacks some basic elements and just lacks a plot. It didn't even have any interesting stories.   Overall, "Livest Night" is really only the worst movie I�d seen so far. It is a horrible excuse to try to put your hopes and dreams of what you wanted to do. It could have just been an excuse, something that would have been better to do instead. In conclusion, I can tell you that this movie isn�t made for people that enjoy movies, it just doesn�den just be made for a bunch of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a writer, not a writer. I wrote a positive review about the movie: (The story line is "The first time a guy has ever tried to do something like this..." but I'm not the type of person to write this crap and get away with it.   But I know how to write a positive movie: "The only thing that could possibly redeem this movie is a great script" (I didn't give this script any more than the movie itself) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a very low budget film, this was not the film that I would have wanted to see, and the predictable nature of the story kept me watching this from the beginning.  But I can't blame this film for being one of the most awful movies of the decade. This was too predictable and it failed to keep me interested, and after seeing "The Ring" I just decided to let the time pass. I'm not sure why people like this sort of low budget films - if they are trying to be clever and keep the big surprises intact, then they will make terrible movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am the father of a long list of children. My kids, like all other kids, want to see stories and movies from this movie. However, this one did not meet this standard. A number of the scenes were just silly. It wasn't funny. It was terrible. The only good thing was the way the scenes went down. The story, which is supposed to be about a teenager, ends up on an airplane flying to China, and a lot of shots from the plane appear to be the actual crash of the plane. I have to conclude that this is just a joke. I wish I could say something positive about it, but I don't. The director has to pay people to make the movie. The actors need to act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for something to recommend to recommend: a film about a failed marriage between a married couple. I didn't think I could find any reference to it. After looking for a few days, I decided that I couldn't, in this case, find the movie.  This movie is horrible. They are basically a two-men type of movie. The actors do not seem to know what is going on in their characters; instead they do a ridiculous amount of things and do not act like they are actors.   The acting is not very good either. If you are looking for some really funny, witty movies and a couple of heart-stoppers, you would be better. This film is neither of the things that I expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this on TV and tried to watch the trailer for the movie, but I didn't want to see it. I have just seen it as a movie at the beginning of the show. It had some funny parts, but they were pretty terrible. I don't like the plot line. I just don't want that part. I would love to see more of it, but it's too late now.  It can't make you laugh. And I'm not sure why anybody is making this movie because it's just so ridiculous and dumb. I will watch this show only once. I wonder if this movie is getting lost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a total rip-off of "The Secret to a Movie:  It had about a thousand lines and it was awful. I mean, really awful.  The story of a secret message is so weak that it can't even be made into a movie and I wonder why this show would be put in a movie.  It's almost like you are telling a big bad secret message to a bunch of people and you have to wait for the whole thing to get started. It's so bad that even a movie made by a very well versed group would have a better idea of this story than this movie. The only good thing about this movie is that it has a decent cast, and at least one girl.  I can't really blame the movie for the name. Even the name was pretty good. But the real reason this movie was so terrible is the fact that it had to make it up with enough story.  A lot of it is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was just horrible to watch. I really don't want to waste my time, but I've been watching it for 15 minutes! I won't spend more time watching it because it just seems like another excuse to make movies about bad things. I was never one of the funniest comedies in Hollywood history, but this movie was one of them. Maybe if the plot was more entertaining it might have worked better. I don't know what to do with this movie. The only thing I can conclude is that you will be bored by it and you'll never enjoy it for long. The last person I saw on the screen was really pretty funny. He was really great at playing a bad puncher, so this movie just can't get a better name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad, bad, worse, worst, worse than anything else I've ever seen. There's nothing more horrifying than a car chase. The plot is so badly written and so slow, and it doesn't make a lot of sense. I guess I'm just a person who likes an action movie! The fact that this is about the chase makes it a much better movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. The acting was so bad that it was almost impossible to care what they actually were doing. I was expecting great acting, but it was all a mess. The storyline was so weak and the plot was so unclear that I was looking at a blurry wall of text for everything I wanted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to be cute as possible, but is only the result of a large hole in the narrative, with little regard to any plot development. The first 2 hours goes by with no storyline developed at all, with a focus on the characters, which does not make sense.  The plot eventually comes together, but the whole thing just falls apart.  This is the first film with no plot whatsoever, and even after the plot is complete the movie just falls asleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is nothing but a stupid piece of nonsense. Its story is nonsensical and just is something that no one would want to listen to. But it isn't just that. The plot is just the worst part in this movie. It is predictable.  The good part of this film is that most of the characters will survive, since they are already in the movie.  What a horrible film. I've had the same problems as I did with the "Shark Show", but this movie is much worse. The story is very good, though it has no real characters.  This movie would be better if it had real people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with some great music, but then we see some "music" that is totally unfathomable and unearthly. I have never heard a "music", that wasn't just stupid, like this movie.  I had the opportunity to look at some video clips and see what really went into this movie, and I don't see anything that could be considered interesting. The movie would have been great if it had been done a bit more by the movie makers, but it's far worse than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely awful, but it does have a redeeming feature. A guy is a cop and he is married with a kid, but is suddenly having a sex with the kid. The girl is pregnant and this is just the first case he has ever had. The cop is cheating on her and she is the only child she has ever got.   I guess the main reason this movie was made was that it has this huge sex scene with a naked woman that just can't stay in a room and watch the sex scenes alone.  I'm really sick of this crap, but I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years after a lot of people found out that the world has been wrong and that it doesn't exist. With those same people who, for some reason, have this idea. You can't be a'real' movie: they are all fake. With more annoying plot lines than any movie ever had a director would have expected, and the same boring story. The plot is not interesting, and they just want to be a cheap, 'fake' film, but it has to be something a little bit better. I didn't care enough time to learn more about this story (it's OK to learn a lot about an interesting movie, but the actors here just aren't good enough to make it a movie). I didn�t know what these people were, I only had a vague idea what they looked like, but I did care about the idea of having a 'fake movie', since I didn��t have much more experience with films and had never made one myself.   If you want a real movie: do yourself and go see something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Secret Lover" is nothing more than a shameless, stupid attempt at "romance" with a pretty girl who ends up having sex with a guy and becomes a "lover". The movie was not funny in any way, but it didn't matter, it's only boring. The story wasn't really interesting, so it could be interesting if it was more interesting. But it doesn't really happen, and I don't think it matters. In fact, it doesn\' in the end. The script is so bad that it actually became a bit boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it as a college student and didn't even enjoy it. As much as the storyline sounded like a true movie, there wasn't very much actual suspense for the viewer. The dialog was so weak, and the acting wasn't even good enough to justify the film's title, and I could only make it sound as bad as it was. I gave this film a rating of "1" because I didn't expect a great performance from any of the actors in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just terrible, and it's difficult to say that this movie is even worse than a usual Hollywood movie: I mean, there are some decent scenes in it, and the plot itself is interesting but no matter how interesting, this movie lacks everything. Aside from the plot, there is absolutely nothing interesting. The acting is awful and not even very good. In the ending we can see what we might do with a great director and great direction, but this movie fails to deliver anything. It's just a collection of lame flicks, but it will never be a success. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I thought it was boring and was looking for something more entertaining...but I just couldn't find it. I had to find out why it was called a comedy.  I'm guessing it is going for all the same thing as I was, but I can see the lack of humor and story...I think the premise is silly...or something like a movie for kids...I really couldn't even find the words to describe it. The acting wasn't even good...I just could have been looking for a better film.  The whole story just plain crazy. It's just boring, and I couldn't care for it...there's no plot, there's no direction, it doesn't even make any sense.  But this movie seems to be fun if you're a comedy fan, but for me...it's just plain boring. I couldní� even find any humor, but the writing is too bad, and the actors don't even have a sense of humor...   I just think I might try it if I had a bit of fun...or for a cheap thrill. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a complete mess and doesn't have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. If this was a film about a documentary about the worst movie ever made, I would look at it and say, "Who would have even allowed this?" I think that it does need a better story to do something with this. I have seen more than two of these movies in my life. I think I know what I got out of it. I don't remember why this was even made. The fact that I have nothing but respect for anyone that made this is all too ridiculous. There are a couple of parts where you get some nice things - the documentary crew, the actors, and the special effects... but I've seen some of the most annoying parts of this film. The scenes involving the dead people is extremely weak and there is one part where the characters are in their place at the end of the movie where you can see them in their actual spot, which is like the ending of the entire film. If you are not going to read the movie for a reason other than because you want to see this movie in your theater (like I did), you better go with a good movie: "The People Who Loved Me." It's good for the characters to have those characters in their proper place at that point in the film. But I would much rather watch "The Living Dead" and avoid this film altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a scene in the movie that would have been a good choice if done as a series of short films rather than as one film. There are no real plot, nothing interesting, nothing even memorable. The whole movie is just a series running through some bizarre incidents, which only seem to add a little more color to the film. The plot is pretty dumb and there is nothing more interesting than the stupid scenes in the first film, and those scenes aren't quite as funny.   The movie features a bad script that was very poorly written, by a good writer. There's some nice funny moments that make the movie good, but there's nothing else. The main plot and scenes were so bad that they just had no more humor to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You get a bad name like this one. Why the hell is it trying to make this movie? If I could see the next movie... I would say I would get more money than the money to see this one movie... but the only reason I would ever see it... is because the plot is so bad that it ruins the movie for me... and for you, it ruins your soul... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Tried To Catch" is a horrible movie: a movie that was nothing but an endless collection of lies.  The plot isn't even interesting at all. It's just a bunch of old guys who are trying to catch some huge fish that is on the ocean. I am not sure exactly how, but I'm sure there are some clues.  Oh, you know, I was very intrigued to see "Tagged", and I thought it would be interesting. But "Tagger" was really bad. It was just bad. The ending was terrible and there was a really annoying plot.  Overall, I give this movie a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is basically an effort to entertain children and teenagers through the story of a young couple who gets dumped by a strange man in an effort that he could make them love her. This really has nothing to recommend. The characters are wooden, the plot is horrible, and the story is completely devoid of any intelligence or motivation. The only way you can make a good movie like this is to spend time on its pretentious waste of time.  If you had a heart and intelligence, you would see the film to be a must see, but alas, you won't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an awful film with a very weak plot and a ridiculous acting by Christopher Walken, who should have been put in his own movie instead of this one. If you liked Christopher Walk in The Silence of The Silence, you'll hate this one, because it's very similar, but there is no way you can care about the acting. The dialog is terrible, the acting is terrible and the plot is bad, but they put a lot of money into this film and they can't be very disappointing, because the filmmakers knew what they were making. If they were put into some real world, and they didn't, it would have a really long career. I am sick to watch this crap and I'm even considering watching The Silence in a different way. I can only see that as a reference to the old Italian B-movie. That movie had a lot more than just a "makeover" in Italian B. There is a reason to be able to make the same mistakes, because there was a real Italian movie to make. But it had nothing to do with the movie. I guess that's a bit better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a low budget film with an inscrutable premise (unprepared script, overbearing, depressing, undestified gore, and unnecessary nudity, especially female nudity). This is really awful film. Why bother? Just as an example of "the American Dream", I can't imagine how anyone could possibly believe this movie.  The story is predictable, the performances are bad and the story is meaningless. I can also see no way the director made the actors look like actors, it's just like you would find a porn film with very little background (and just as few characters) but with a lot of actors.  I cannot believe what they were trying to make with this movie, they must have done something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the biggest waste of money in the history of the film industry, and the worst of the worst movies ever made. The premise of the movie seems to be that some of the villains are so evil that they don't care what the audience sees. They've created a "fantasy" story that relies solely on their actions, and then they've used that behavior to manipulate the plot. And yet there are scenes that are completely ridiculous, like the scenes where people are in cages with their feet in the middle of their feet and have their feet on their feet. It's hard to say why this movie is such a bad genre. For example, there are a lot of scenes that have a scene where people have their hands locked in a box and their hands attached to their heads, and are put in a position so that the audience can't see them. There are scenes where the characters have their eyes closed so that you can't look at the person's eyes, so that they can't even see their eyes. Then they put their faces in different positions so you can see their faces. The scenes where you can barely see the face of the person who's doing something are just scenes that just have no effect.  So then there are also scenes with a person in a bath. He's a woman who is wearing a bathing suit and he's just standing there in front of a bath with a bunch of people who are all on top of the world.  If the movie is true that some people who kill the people for the sake of their lives do so because they are so weak, then that might be the premise of this movie. I find it odd that there are people who have no reason to kill people, people who don't have any reason to harm people, and people who just have done something because they were going to die anyway. This movie, along with all the other bad films, is just not scary. It doesn't have anything to do with horror. It just isn't scary.  The movie begins with a villain who is killing people for no reason, but the way he's killing is more like torture than murder. I thought the scenes in this movie were just terrible.  My rating: 1 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not even remotely worth seeing by anyone. It's really bad...it really is bad. It just lacks the energy to make anything interesting...there is no story. You don't even feel like it's going to make any sense...it's not funny, it's not real, it really doesn't have any feeling or purpose. It isn't even funny.  Don't watch this movie. Avoid this one at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director, Kevin Sorcini, is now known for this "movie" of torture. If you can't imagine it, please get a copy of it:  There's nothing to recommend about this piece of trash. Even though it is a movie with the best effects ever made, it's very bad because you can only watch it because it is released on DVD.  The problem is that there isn't a good way to see the "movie". The only way to really know it is that you'll never see it, because you don't want to see it. Even if you knew that was the case, it would be wasted time in a movie: You would be confused, or the director would be tempted to make a lot of money, if you wanted to see that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just this dumb movie...it is horrible...all of it is ridiculous. I guess, if you see this movie: you will laugh for a few seconds...just like everyone else...but you will NEVER laugh. This movie is completely absurd. The actors are pathetic, the plot is completely artificial, the scenes are terrible, the characters are wooden and one is supposed to take away a girl's eye. What is this movie a movie for? For me it is a waste of money and that is the only reason I chose to spend anything and watch it. If this is worth to see, make a copy of it and throw it in the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and plot-lines of the film are awful. It's like the acting was made for a TV series. All the characters in the film were stupid. This is a big no-payer film but should have a plot, plot, or any other creative element. If there is one, please let me know, please tell me if there is a script. No direction, direction, action, directing, story direction, script, etc., are all terrible. The camera footage is horrible. The only positive thing was the great photography. The soundtrack is OK, but it was not nearly enough.   It's a shame that this movie was released, and so I can not fault the producers, and I wish I had some money to send this movie to an independent director who was more talented than the rest of the cast in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an absolutely awful piece of garbage.  It's hard to believe that this was the movie that inspired so many aspiring actors to work in film. This has the potential to be a good documentary, but it really isn't.  The story has absolutely no plot. The story is almost meaningless, and it's all the same. If this movie was made in the 1960, it would be a fine film. But this has nothing to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Good Girl" is a bad, bad movie made by people who don't understand comedy. This is the worst comedy ever made in Britain. It's stupid and ridiculous. The story of a married girl who discovers she has to marry someone who doesn't know her boyfriend. This movie is like an old game show.  The actors are obviously not actors and the plot is completely unpotched, except for the occasional punch lines. If you like comedies, you might enjoy it.  But there are some bad jokes in there that make it worse than the rest of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very disappointed, as I have been one of the most frequent viewers of "Shag the Tongues", and it appears to be about the same thing. It is simply horrible, it's only as we have seen in our movies, and the rest of the story is pretty boring. But, I like it's very good for the kids to use it, because it is like a play. But this is all the same. We get a little bit of extra entertainment in a ridiculous, ridiculous movie. It's bad. If they want to learn something, they should try a real movie instead of a silly one, so they can learn something better and more effective. A lot of kids are looking for real entertainment and, instead, try to recreate that on a computer. But then you get yourself into the hands of a dumb girl, who is a total monster, and you'll end up being "forced" into this stupid movie.  This movie is only a mediocre attempt at making fun, and it isn't good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you haven't heard the story yet, it's one of those movies that really doesn't deserve to be in the hands of anyone who has any idea whatsoever. In the end, one of the characters kills another. At one point, the girl thinks he's going to kill himself and has him shoot him. The cop tells her, it would be suicide if she went to a therapist to get help. The cops tell her to get out of jail on her own, and she does. It turns out she's right. I mean, how are we supposed to believe she's insane? How could anyone have a life sentence that would last for 25 years? The movie itself is so bad, I can't even consider the fact that it was a documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty bad, but not very interesting movie. It's only mildly amusing. Very few of the characters are actually real and the movie is extremely poorly written and there is no suspense whatsoever. I think you can only laugh if you're into a slasher genre.  Bottom Line: it's not interesting. Avoid this movie at all costs. It has nothing worth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this movie, I didn't like it. I saw it for about 30 minutes and I was looking for the real-world connection. I can't find it. What I thought of the movie was its "happiness" or it's "hopelessness," I am afraid of what these people will come to with this idea. I think you'll be disappointed when they make their next masterpiece. I am sure the world has enough people like that in it to run a movie without a script, without a camera, without the music, with no special effects and without a plot. It just doesn't work. This movie is no good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess it was an American-made film, so it's sort of funny. They made it sound like a bunch of kids that had some special talents and would be great with a little bit of magic. Then it became a very ridiculous comedy about magic. It was only in a few minutes that you'd be convinced that you might actually learn to think and pray. But this wasn't even funny when it was made, and it isn't funny anymore when it's actually made, it's just very dull. I've seen it on TV shows, on BBC, in movies, it can be even a nightmare to watch it. It isn't even worth watching.  The funny thing about magic is that if you can find it in a tree, you can get it in your mouth. I'm not sure if you get magic out of the tree, but the magician and the girl are so clueless that they just do it without knowing the whole thing over and over again. And of course they try to learn what they need to know without knowing anything about magic because they're both in love with magic, but without a doubt they just don't know how it works.  That is the best part of the film. The funny part of it is the idea that the main story is about a bunch magical girls who decide what they're going to do, which is just the same as any normal movie: "Oh, I'll call my brother and say, 'hey, let's make you into a magical girl!'  They call her and they get into a sort of'magic circle,' a bunch-of-n-t-t girls who have magic powers. It turns out to be a bunch more magic and I guess that's the best thing for her. But if you ask her and she wants to know what to do with these girls, she goes and grabs some strange objects and kills off a bunch people. I guess she did it so she could see that she couldn't find her magic-whatever-thing she needed to do to save herself and get out of trouble.  I don't think that is all that funny. The fact that there's magic in the movie means I guess there's a magic in there somewhere that they decide what to use. I mean, that is basically a pretty basic example of a ridiculous idea. It has some kind of ridiculous intent to see if it's true. And if they just did it without having magic, you would say that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie is like a bad TV show. The acting is wooden, the story is horrible, the acting is bad, and the plot is bad. The film stars an evil person and his girlfriend. This movie had me crying at the end. What happened to the other three girls at the movie? They went to the beach to meet guys! How is that supposed to make the audience feel comfortable with them?  This is a film that's better suited for a movie club then a movie that's supposed to be a movie for a TV show, or it's better put to a movie to avoid being the target of a Hollywood blockbuster.  The film itself is okay to watch and see when you're bored. If you want to see it on the couch, just watch the first few minutes and it's good. But no, you should not waste your time. I don't believe it's a good movie. It's a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the least interesting in any way.  No dialog, no story, no real character, and a horrible script. The movie just tries to be cute with awful acting and horrible acting.   The first thing is funny. The first time it was funny. In this movie the clowns are so hideous they look like they are made by the same company that produces this movie. Also there is no real story, you just find one clown and try to shoot the person who has it. The clowns in this movie are not funny at all.  The second thing is that the clown who you want is a very boring man named John, that is not even named John but he has a name like John. If you were really interesting and real men who were the funniest in the world would you try to kill them?  No you would not, but there is a real John who has a lot of money. He can beat your best clown.  This is just another cheap thrill kill movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see a fun movie with some good actors, and the scenery is OK, then this is the movie for you. Alas, if you want the most pointless piece of film ever made, you're not going to enjoy this one. In the very least, this movie is a piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in 1993 and thought it was absolutely horrible. There were some nice highlights and even a couple of interesting things, but it didn't quite reach the level of the movie. It got boring.  I was really disappointed in the ending. The acting was very bad and very predictable. I have trouble believing the writers that they have an idea about making this movie. You see a person with the biggest car and the best looking woman, but if you try to find them, they are not there. The ending seemed to be a very old idea of a sequel and I just don't want to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess you probably don't know the name of the "film" that is now available in the Viera, as a movie called, The Dream With Me. It is a bad waste of the film director and talent that goes and buys a bunch of other people's talent and works at the same level as this one, but it doesn't. There are more people involved in this film than the director and actors in it. There is no real plot, not much character development, not even a story. What is the story? Well, I don't even know. And, that's not really my criticism. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't worth watching at all. It's just a lame excuse for a couple of TV stars. They can't act like the characters. There are no memorable performances or plot lines. This is just a one-note, boring movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even get the other actors in the film, I know it isn't an "documentary" but I find myself believing there is nothing special in it and I just wanted to get over the fact that it is about "fugitive animal personalities", it's about the people living in the same space and it seems there is a large, boring cast.  I think it's better to watch the first season of "Big Boss" instead of the sequel, "The Monster", because the first one was good and the sequel was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just a few weeks back, I noticed this movie in one of those horror films that is made for the younger generation (and now also for those who are too young to make such a trip). It is like seeing a movie made for young kids and then watching them get horribly involved in it (in a nonstop cycle of nonstop explosions and gore). If you have the patience, you will end the movie by being utterly bored, so you will not remember it as a horror movie if you are an adult. At least I'm not dead and left in a coma after watching it.  I have a feeling that the older members of my generation think it's an ungodly film: not scary anymore, but it's no fun. For me it just doesn't even make any sense.  The only saving graces are that they're making this movie, and that they will not be able to stomach it at the most gullible of any generation. It's not that the film itself is wrong or even insulting, but if you liked a horror flick, it's got to be a thrillless experience. You can rent it but there's no need to do so, because you will miss it. It just doesn`T make any connection with anything, and it is the same kind of dullness that is so common in youth-targeted flicks (the very old). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is the movie that was the catalyst to my addiction. the story is bad. the characters are horrible, the sets and settings are boring, the special effects is poorly done, and the final result is an unfightened movie with no substance, no storyline, and no good ending. the only redeeming factor is the beautiful photography of the actors. the film was terrible. the actors should not have taken the time to film and bring to the screen an hour of pure garbage. this film had a horrible direction, it was bad and the script wasn't good. it was just plain bad. I give this film a 6 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very old and was made at an incredibly low budget, which made it a waste of money to film. If you're a fan of classic Sci-Fi movies, you will probably enjoy this movie but it sucks even beyond the pretentious pretenses that it is. There are plenty of movies that do this but this was nothing to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing wrong with these actors, except that their lack of a sense of self is such that most of the stories of their characters aren't interesting either. They seem to take things way for granted. I'd heard them talk about it on the radio, in a couple of caravantries on the coast, and I have a hunch that their only purpose is to tell their fans what a lousy movie is.  But it isn't that bad. There are some interesting characters, most of which I'd never have seen before. But this movie isn't even interesting enough to make me care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a big let down for a true story. The actors do an okay job, but not much of them. The idea of a movie called "The Last Man" is nothing more than a stupid idea. The plot is so badly written that it becomes a joke. But if it were good, it would probably be more interesting. But the story is bad, and in order to have the plot interesting it would be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many movies set in a similar plot that would make for some action sequences that would have worked. There is only one situation that seems to have any value in the world of the "Stalker" franchise. This one happens when a man finds out the child that killed his wife. I guess that most of the movies set around this event would have made some sort of sense. But after this, you can almost guarantee that you can never, ever, believe it. This is not the movie for you. I mean, I've seen "Straider" 3 or 4 times and it's been on my top 10 list. This film is one of those movies, only because of the fact that it's so damn horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to see the same actors in this film as I did with "Gather". For whatever reason I'd like to have their dialogue intact. But after the first few minutes of the movie I didn't want the actors to make such a commitment. This movie is full of bad acting, and when it is not bad, it is bad beyond description. The premise is that the film has some sort of supernatural element (a black, shadowy creature that lives in a town that is overrun by a gang of thugs) who can be seen in the town but that it has an army of soldiers and the mayor (a real soldier in the military). The fact that the soldier(s) is being commanded by his superiors and he doesn't see anything about it makes the town look like it is a post-apocalyptic society of a totally corrupt government, complete with corruption, greed and corruption. The film is just a lot like a piece of soap that never bothered me until I got to see it. There were several scenes that are like they're going out to the "clown shop" and running around doing some sort out-of thing in a bad town. The only reason I didn? To be able to watch some of these scenes and see these scenes was because the film wasn't as good as it could be. The "clocks" used to open the gates were just scenes of some of the scenes I actually saw in the theater. I never found any of them particularly interesting or exciting. The acting wasn't particularly bad, but for most of the film you get used to the villain doing horrible things. There was one scene that went directly from a scene and back to where they are having their carriages pulled.  And of course, the movie was not that exciting at all. They just had some scenes to show the towns in which the towns are completely destroyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as I can tell, this movie isn't as dramatic as the other movies, but it's not the most appalling film. The plot was good, but the characters weren't good either. This is just a stupid attempt at a movie that was totally devoid of entertainment. I was expecting a little bit of fun, but even that proved to be a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is weak. Some scenes are good. But the rest are bad. I have nothing to fault in. It is just not good enough to satisfy the pretentious critics who insist on seeing a movie that can't even be interesting. The plot is too vague to make me care and I would have preferred to have seen this movie with a fresh pair of stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so terrible that it wasn't worth mentioning, but I guess the director didn't have time to do the work he needed to do. For example, I'd like to have heard some of the dialog before I was completely involved in it (with the way they were introduced), and it didn't. The acting was OK in most places, but the lack of plot and characters were bad enough to make the film a completely lousy waste. The plot was bad. The premise was interesting (for the rest of the story, which I guess was much too long), but there was too much padding.  The plot finally worked when the final credits were out. But then the writer's in there somewhere, and I wish he had that guy, for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie on the DVD a year or two ago when it was a little bit older (like for a film about a bunch of brothers, and one of the brothers killed each other brother in some strange accident, so I'm surprised no one had a clue about this one when I saw it. This movie is the worst of the worst. It's not funny. You know what it is going to be like, and you know it will make your heart acrimony. It is only in the end when it does, but the ending is awful, too scary and sad for no reason. The only redeeming element is that you might watch this if you want to see this movie for fun, but you really should NOT. Avoid this movie if you have other movies to watch. I'd recommend moving away from this movie immediately, and maybe looking for something more original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really excited when my husband, a big fan of Robert Wagner, would get in on the movie, but alas...  As is the case with most of my husband's movies, the story gets poor as soon as it gets the kids involved.  You would think that if the kids weren't involved, this movie would be fun for them to see, but they are not involved. Even if the parents were involved, it would be very weak.  I felt like the movie would lose it once the kids do something in the story. It was a shame because the script is so inconsistent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the definition of a movie made to fail on a basic logic and storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible plot! The plot is so dull and bad, but the actors, in some weird and inexplicable fashion, do well, making their characters seem totally ill-informed by the movie's content. The script is predictable, the characters are predictable, and it is boring. The story has to be different somehow, and I had to sit through it just to confirm my previous findings. There is no reason whatsoever for this movie to be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the film that had the most obnoxious soundtrack ever made for a movie that made it seem like it was made just for the purpose of a TV show. The movie takes on a totally pointless message and ends up turning into a stupid piece of junk that shows no depth beyond a very poorly written script. The soundtrack is so badly made that you wonder if the actors had been made by the writers. And while this movie is supposed to be about how things work out, it's just about the awful movie that sets up the story to the worst place possible.  The idea of a movie is so bad that it is nearly impossible to watch the movie. This is truly a bad choice for a film that's supposed to go somewhere. If you're going to watch a movie, do you need to be smart enough to be able to figure out that the characters in it are actually actors. I was only half tempted to try and watch it again, but that was because I didn't know what else I needed to know to make that comparison. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So far, the worst piece of video games ever made. I didn't like the first one, nor the sequel, but I didn`t like the third. There was too much mindless violence and was no storyline. I thought I was going to watch the movie when I was in the hospital. The third was a really dumb game and had no plot, and the last one was just an excuse for the first sequel. This is really the reason why the sequel is such a failure. There's nothing to make the movie better, and it's all over predictable, so you just watch the first, and go on to watch something else that would never work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so horrible, it was the equivalent of a nightmare. The story really has to be a bit disturbing to anyone who sees this film. You're only a few minutes into the film to realize that this movie was bad, even worse than the "Mammalike Me" or "Femme Me" movies that I've seen. The characters aren't interesting or believable and are obviously made-up. It's a shame that this is a cheap film. If you've seen it before, you'll love it. But don't spend money on it. If we ever owned a DVD player with a DVD drive, we would seriously consider getting this out of our DVD collection. I'm not going to spend money to buy the film: I've done that already. This movie is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this was going to be a comedy, a decent one at that, then it would have been the best one. If not, I think it was just going to try to make a low budget film in some pretty lame way. The script was pretty bad, but that is to be expected, and the acting was pretty lousy, too. This movie was awful, the direction was awful and the sound was bad. This is not that bad of a film for the first half of the film, but the second half had just about the same trouble. It was just an embarrassment for the rest of the movie. I'll stick with this movie and I won't pay anything, if the movie is ever released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible waste of talent this film was. Even a low budget film would have been better than this film. That isn't the case with every other films out there. This is some sort of amateur piece that has about five minutes of scenery. It doesn't take any real characters. It never gets a real plot and doesn't bother me to watch it over a week. It's just predictable and stupid. It can't find any real plot. And the story is stupid. The most annoying thing about this film is the girl. She is so annoying and pathetic that it's painful to watch her. It feels like she's going to be a prostitute for the whole movie and that is just the same as every other "gimmered" film I have seen. If you want to see a real movie about real romantic escapments, you don't need a film. A real movie would be better than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is some extremely terrible crap, with a horrible script, and the movie is completely over-subscripted and just not good to watch. The plot line was not original and just copied from the "Iceman" script, which is only acceptable in comparison to The Lone Ranger's, with less effort.  The movie seemed to make no more than an excuse for the movie's existence (or at least for its lack of a plot).  There were some very interesting moments in the movie, but the movie wasn't nearly as interesting.   If you had any hopes or expectations from the movie and weren't turned out of, then you would really enjoy "Ice Man 2" instead.  Just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was some fun in this film but it seems to be overrated. There is a lot of humor but the movie was very predictable. The story seemed to be very predictable as it is usually (in this case) and the characters were not believable. Some of the scenes were not made coherent by a creative writer (who knows what's going to happen), they were almost unbelievable. The script was weak and the camera did not help much with the movie. Most of the movie is just predictable but at times it seemed like it was one of two movies about a couple of brothers that could have been turned into a series of short films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to hear more from a movie: "I wish I hadnn't heard of this movie because it was so horrible. I felt like being in that place.   So, I sat through it. I thought for the first time I'd seen a movie that was fun. Maybe this movie would be better with that.  How are we supposed to even make this movie? It's boring! What the hell is it supposed to be? The idea is that it's about people's brains? What's the message here? Oh, how I hope you think about your brains!  This movie was so bad that I was almost ashamed to watch it.  The plot was so convoluted and not interesting that you actually felt bored.  What was the plot? How is it that everyone is "set" and there was no way to solve it, and the director wanted to make that point?  This is really bad, I think it's low budget, but I am surprised they still have this in the movie.  I'm more impressed with the acting of Christopher Walken than I am with the movie itself. I would have to go with something better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll admit that I was quite intrigued and eager to watch this movie as it came out on DVD, just because it looked like a real film - I didn't know anything about it beforehand. It just seemed to be a generic piece of trash, and I didn% like it at the start. It seems so boring and pointless that I decided to see it. I found it rather disappointing, and not even that in that sense, because there was so much potential in this movie. The only saving feature in the movie was the acting (which was bad, but I think that the rest of it could have just been a bit more amusing). Most of the dialog seemed rather vague and made no sense. Most of it seemed like a very convoluted plot. It wasn't even really funny. And if you see the ending, it'll make you laugh more.  If you're looking for a movie to be interesting, try another, like "Where the Brain is Born", by Terry Gilligan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film with a poor plot is not interesting, the acting is horrible, and the supporting actors, even the great actors in the original "Rosenberg", don't seem to make it look interesting. The main focus of the film is the bizarre events surrounding the death of a young boy who was recently killed in an accident. When we find out that he is the child's father, we can't say much more than that he was a child's son. The movie gives the idea of a local murder in the village, but at the same time we have to wonder why they would want to kill another boy. The film is one of the most absurd pieces of nonsense that I've ever seen.   If you like to see old American films, you'll enjoy most of them, but this is beyond the norm. If you don't care for film, you would be better off checking the box for a copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I had to sit through the entire show to give the plot a chance and I saw that it was pretty bad. The acting was poor. The story was horrible and I can't understand how the guy gets to pick such a girl as the director thinks that he can pick her and make a relationship with her. The show seemed to be about a man (this is not an accident) and an old man, but I really can't figure out why it is called "Mr. MacDaddy." The show did a good job with a bad plot, and I don't want to complain about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an awful waste of a movie, but it's still hilarious. In this one, I found myself laughing and then crying. I don't think you would have seen a more painful and awful movie out there.  Also, I couldn't really keep listening to the words of the main characters and their stupid conversations, it was awful.  I would give this one a 10, but unfortunately the story line isn't enough to carry this film, the actors aren't quite as good as they usually are, and the movie itself is horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the trailer for this one, I felt like I was wasting my time. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It made a few points that I thought were stupid, but the film failed to deliver.  My main problem is the ridiculous way that the movie was set. It seemed like it was filmed in a basement. It wasn't. A few actors got away from the whole thing. The special effects were weak.  There's nothing better than fake special effects. Nothing better than a movie set with fake special sets.  I'm pretty sure they are making a lot of money making these things. And the people who actually created the movie aren't in control. And, they're not even making good use of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I can conclude from this film is that it is either the biggest or the worst film ever made.   The "documentary" was clearly written by some very stupid, stupid people who can't really tell us anything that anyone could care about. It's almost impossible to sit through and watch it and see if it's even worth your time.  The best thing about this film - aside from the "harpo" character - was the script. Everything I wrote was just plain stupid.  I'd never thought that I'd be reading another bad movie. It was obvious that every single character in this film was stupid, and even the supporting characters were just plain moronic.  In conclusion, this movie was just bad to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i mean i saw it at the mall and it was horrible! i was a little interested in this type of movie and i thought it was a great idea, but it didn't work. i mean it was bad, I mean i thought the story was great but the plot was stupid and the acting sucked. The ending was awful, all in all it was so bad... i mean like it sucks!  I gave this movie a 10 because I did like it but if i want to see more movies I will give this movie 2 stars out of 10!!! DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was pretty bad, really bad. I felt it had no meaning whatsoever. I'm sure this is the last stupid movie for me and I've seen the ones that came out after The Fast and The Furious. I have to assume that it was the original intention of Mr. MacLowden and Mr. Belzill, but what is that if?? The point for him and Mr MacLrowden were both in their respective positions and both of these two things were awful. Mr. Malueuse is pretty good with his acting. His delivery wasn't that great.  There was one funny scene, but the overall theme of the film was stupid, nothing good and a lot of pointless things. I gave this film a 10 because it was just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing more than a waste of money. The first few minutes of the film (in which you really care about the story) and the ending are too predictable and predictable. We just have to see a single scene every half hour, and that's all it is. I don't know what the director, whoever directed the film is thinking. He looks like a little mad and thinks he's a genius for getting so sloppy. The film is just a disaster.  The best part of this film is the ending. This ending is beautiful. It is just an ugly mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The writing is terrible, the story is awful, the characters are weak, the acting is bad, the direction is bad. It doesn't have a storyline. The story is one-sided. This film does not provide enough depth to make anything worthwhile.  I've never had a bad film, but this one has one of them. If you are going to watch it, do not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very bad. The acting is bad, the story was weak. I really expected some good action from the movie, but instead I felt like I had been punched in the throat. It felt like a real movie I had never seen before. The ending was also terrible. I mean the ending was horrible to me and there is no way to reverse it. I can see that this was a cheap movie for the purpose of promoting the movie that it had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a failed attempt at a romance between the principal and the girl he's just taken, so it's not really a bad way to go. However, it does a dispiritive effect. The man is the type who's always in his underwear. The girl is the sort who's obsessed with her body. The best thing about this film is the lack of plot. There's nothing in the main story or the supporting characters to make a connection with anyone. The ending is completely meaningless. This film should not be viewed in light of its failure to connect with the characters, but I think this film would have been better if the main character didn't find herself in the wrong place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many instances where the writer can't decide the best way to describe it. He has to describe an escape from the island and how the characters find their way out. There are a few instances where he is left out.  The acting is substandard. This movie will probably never be considered a great movie in my opinion, but I will probably watch it just to get a little more money. I didn't have much sympathy for the actors in this movie. There was the typical bad acting and bad chemistry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this was intended to be a film; it's too bad. I didn't find it worthy; the actors were stupid.  This is the only movie I've seen that I have turned against, and that's a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best I've ever seen in a bad flick: a bad comedy with a very bad script and bad acting. It was very predictable, and if the actors didn't have great chemistry, it could have been a laugh-generating movie. However, the actors are so awful that it's hard to see a movie with any hope of making it great. It reminded me of the crap that comes on every hour. Not the acting, but the whole plot. It's not funny like a comedy. The plot itself is very predictable and totally pointless. There are no surprises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like a pile of a bunch of dinky plot lines of a guy who goes to school and then meets another guy who has his own school. The whole movie revolves around the guys trying to keep the guy that he has been stalking from their school (like a cat who keeps his cat from going into the house). The only thing that actually happens is that someone is caught in a car while driving down the road (as was the case with the driver). I thought the whole movie was about a guy getting killed and there would be a movie about him getting killed. What in this world was going? I guess I'll be in a lot of trouble with the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just plain, awful crap. There is nothing witty or funny here, nothing interesting. The lead actress (Wanda Melnick) is so annoying and unlovable that it's plain that she doesn't get the best script for her performances. This film had to make me angry, even at times.  I'd have to say, if you have the patience of a true writer, you wouldn't have to waste a film on this piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was so bad it was funny. Well, I can't blame the guy for trying to make a joke that wasn't funny. Even if it was a joke, it would not be funny. They put this movie down for obvious reasons. The plot was weak enough to make this movie enjoyable, but the direction just made this one terrible movie. I have to admit that I loved it when the man was wearing an Iron Cross that was supposed to be real and looked real. It was only to get bad after I got a few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a total fiasco of a movie. If you want to watch a movie, watch "Tombstone" the way you would see it when the movie is in the theaters.  In this movie it doesn't even give the best names. It's boring and stupid, with terrible special effects, boring actors, bad directing and bad story. In this one, the acting is good but they got paid.  The scenes are pretty good but when you look at the scenes, you don't really see the best parts of the movie. It is just an excuse for a pretentious movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the entire episode was bad - a lot of boring jokes, no real plot, a lot more sex and just some very predictable situations.  I guess I didn't even get through to make the point on the title of the show - but I did watch the whole thing and didn't find anything interesting. Even the actors seemed like they just wasted the time making jokes like this one.    It wasn't that bad to talk about it - the acting was pretty good - the jokes were funny, the direction was OK. But, as far as plot, it just wasn't enough to bring me back to watch. It just had nothing to recommend, and nothing to make me feel like I should have been paying for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first week of the original Star Trek series, the plot was more or less interesting. However, the episode didn't quite match up to its predecessors in this first one. I have come to believe that the movie is weak, because I believe that this movie had a chance to live up to the expectations of the other Star Trek movies. In fact, if the movie had more of a plot, it would probably have been more successful. For example, the series would have had a plot which was more like the plot of the "Space of Destiny" series, and it would certainly have done better than the movie: which is really the only thing that made the original series.  Well, I suppose, there was some point in the movie which was missing. You could just put a better plot into it, and the plot would have been stronger than the one the movie presented in the first two seasons.  When it came to "Return of the Space Rangers", I think the movie became mediocre. In the main story, the characters from "Return Of The Space Rangers" had not been put together in the "Star Trek" movie, and I thought that they would have more powerful roles. The only reason they didn't do that in "Return To Earth", was because they didn`t get together that much. They had a similar story, but it just wasn`a the same. The characters in the show were more interesting and did not seem like the "Return to Earth" characters of the pre-series. Even the "Coya-Lambler" and the "Pilot" characters were not really as interesting or interesting.  There were no new plot, which just caused some plot holes to appear. The plot didn't really add anything to the movie, aside from the little bit that the "Rider" characters could have done to improve the movie.  The movie became really weak on its first day. The story line did not really seem to match what was being made throughout the movie (and I couldn`t figure out what the difference was between the "return of the space ranger" storyline and the one that the first series had. In general, the first movie was about a war, in which the Space Ranger is the protagonist, and "Return The Space Ranger" was about an invasion.  This movie was too dumb. The movie was supposed to be about a person coming out of a spaceship and is getting to find out why he gets to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie I saw from "Dark City" was a very basic thriller with a little mystery. The second movie, "End of the Day" is a lot more like a cartoon or cartoon with no plot, direction, characters, plot development, and dialogue. The plot is only about three cops, two gang members, and a few supporting characters (i.e. one of the main characters). They fight a gang of bikers and a huge robot in a city that has a lot of gang activity. The director of this film is obviously not a fan of horror. There is no character or a plot to support the gang members. There are two supporting characters who are introduced to the story only to confirm the gang's existence, and they are so awful that they're so awful you can't believe they've existed. I don't know how this is supposed to make any sense whatsoever. The movie is only a few minutes long but the rest of it is just a boring, meaningless "tast" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw it it was very disappointing. There was too much gushing of action and not enough in a storyline. I'm sure that this is a show for people who want to get to work on a movie in a short time. But it wasn't. It just wasn't very good. There is one episode with a good ending but I don't see that. The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that the whole cast should have their own movies and not make a movie like this one. It's like a person making a horror movie is just making movies about torture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of film:  This movie is nothing like I've seen in the past few days. It is no real funny. I have nothing to do but to put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a pretty typical trashy genre with no plot or motivation, which unfortunately allows a bunch of teenagers to go to war with each other. I didn't like it at first but I decided to give it another shot after it started becoming popular. And there it is. But as the name says, it's a bunch teens who want to kill each other, which isn't funny at all, but unfortunately is not funny. It's a pretty lame excuse for a movie that is not supposed to be a comedy. The cast is very bad, the acting is horrible, and the plot really doesn't make a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just one question: Why am I paying my rent in order to rent this movie? Why not see the other films that this director has made? For instance, there are other films with better performances. For example, I can think of films like  The Unseen and No No, for example, that contain more action than this one. The other films of this director's style are so bad that they don't even exist. There is no film that should have been made for this piece of garbage, except for one that isn't even interesting.   My guess is that the other pictures in this collection of movies are worse than this little movie. It should be titled, "One More Great Movie: Not Worth It!" Because this movie should have never been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. I have done nothing but watching movies in the last 4 years and this is one of the worst. There's too many bad movies that I could watch in the first 4 years of my life. This movie had nothing to do with this movie. I didn't even care that much. It was boring, and the plot was extremely weak. The acting wasn't even good enough to get me to stay awake for the entire movie. The ending, which I guess was meant to be a spoiler, was pretty awful. I only laughed once at the ending. It didn't really make much sense. The plot was awful and the acting was awful. There really isn't any good parts of the movie, which are the best thing in it. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people are saying that the film is really bad, and that the ending is OK. Well, it's OK for people to have something that they could enjoy - they can have an idea that is unique, not just made by a writer.  But it's not just a simple film. It's not the same as some great movies, and it's far removed from the quality of most films.  It's just boring to watch a film like "The Omen", or the "Thorns" trilogy, or even the "Lord of the Rings" movie.  That is when you are bored with something. This movie can't make up for its bad acting, it lacks the feeling of substance, and the lack of suspense from the beginning makes things worse. It doesn't add anything to the "I'm bored with every kind of movie I have ever seen" movie list.  The plot is not even good enough to justify such a low budget film. There's a decent ending, but it has nothing to recommend. If you want to watch it, go watch some movies that don't have a plot like this one. It'll most likely be something like "Stairway to Life", "The Castle", or something similar to a good movie: "Man In The Blue Hour", "Little Boy" or a similar movie. I don't know. All I know is that you will watch it and see the same thing. The movie is also not as funny as "The Men Who Kill", or "The Wolf", and I doubt that it will do anything to make you laugh more.   This movie was probably made to get money for some money. But then I'd be really surprised if it got that money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know a lot of people who are very talented in the field of acting, but if you are, like me, you can't expect one of them to put the same effort as they did for this one. This film is awful, bad, and terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little bit of the plot goes on, it's a bit ridiculous and it just isn't well written. Some interesting bits, like the possibility of an Earth populated by humanoid or reptile like we know from the movie "Jetsons" or one of those other sci-fi movies, but the characters are too stupid to have any real effect.  There's some nice performances here, but it isn't enough to keep the attention of a viewer.  If you liked the first "Jitsons" movie, you will most likely enjoy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of an effort to produce an action-crime thriller based on a ridiculous twist of a game used by a sad dude named Jack (I'll never see that). The film revolves around Jack's ex-girlfriend (Aidy Ringy) who has been kidnapped by a cult who thinks it's all a game, Jack (who has now become a real sad man) tries to get revenge on the cult which is completely unnecessary to the plot. This is by no means an original twist, but it doesn't work as a thriller anyway. The acting was quite bad, and the action sequences are horribly contrived and the dialog is totally unscripted, the plot completely incoherent. The film tries to be a "hard-boiled" thriller with Jack on a game that kills you at the beginning and keeps you going through the movie, and nothing happens but you get more of the same boring crap.  I would definitely avoid it if you're a serious gamer, like a real psycho, but to all the same, if you see a movie like this, don't waste your money. Avoid at least 10 minutes or so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film begins with an inexplicable murder, with a black woman (Masha Kelly) killing a man (Lester Leibon) in the garage, which she leaves her victim at a murder scene and moves to murder him. A couple who are married by their parents, who are not married, go into the garage to investigate the murder, the man is released. When a couple is killed at the garage garage, the couple are then killed again. The next time I see this movie I saw it just before the film was released. That was it.  I didn't like the plot. It was way too stupid. It is way too predictable and it was way, way too similar to the beginning of the first James Bond film. In the end, it just feels like a movie that was made by people who never bothered to film. What were they doing? To make some sort of murder? To start with a murder mystery? The plot is pretty good, but I don't think it will be a feature in a decent film. I recommend avoiding it. If you can get past that stupid plot, and see some good film, you will appreciate it. But this doesn't really make the case for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a disaster at every level. It wasn't all that bad though because there were some interesting scenes. However the acting was horrible. It would have been a fun watch if the acting had been funny. Instead, you just hated it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the name was "A True Story". The title sounded so much like it was a documentary. There was absolutely no plot, nothing interesting. The plot was not interesting. This movie just seems to be one of those bad movies that are in every movie, one of them just happens to be a "true story". If they really were true stories, I'd have to believe they had to be so bad. But I think most of them are like this, although the actors are good and the film isn't terrible. The script just feels like a piece of trash. It seems like the director was so drunk, that he can't figure out where the characters are supposed to go. They seem to be on a desert island in a desert that only has one street. It just seems like they went in a car, which must not have been that strange. There were no real people there. The characters were too scared to act, and the only thing worth saving from losing the actors was a car. The actors should have been in the desert. I give it four out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a movie connoisseur but I do like movies that are both funny and stupid. Unfortunately this one was just stupid. It seemed like it would've been shot in a small village in New York and it wasn't. It was shot in Chicago. I was also bored, but that doesn't matter. If I hadn't known this was a bad film I might have been prepared to laugh. Unfortunately the plot is completely stupid. You can expect it to be boring and predictable, but to me it wasn`t that funny. I think the actors were too predictable and the script was awful. I felt that if I had some of the actors I might be laughing too. If the film had any substance it wouldn`t even make me laugh. So maybe the audience is a little better than the film did. It just needs a good script to make it funny and stop it from being bad. I recommend watching the original film if you're looking to a good comedy. Otherwise it would probably be boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a long time I'm ready to say that this is one of the most boring and meaningless film ever. Don't waste your time watching this one. I've watched several more than this, but I doubt anyone actually has the courage to be so idiotic as to waste time on this rubbish.  If you have any sense of humor, then, go away. Donators of bad movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first episode is an unentering, lisp-voiced mess.  But the second episode shows a new character that could very well have been the first.  The plot line of the second, "Sparus", is a plotline of a bad girl, which is pretty basic, as many shows of today have it. (The first was "Bashir". The latter was "Pornus". The "Sombus" episode was completely predictable, even with the fact that it had a young daughter.)  The third episode of "Parus", gives the idea of a man's name and not much else.  This is just bad! I won't be the person to judge whether or not you decided to watch the first episode of the series.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A low budget film made by someone who doesn't understand what movie making is about - and who looks like he's never really understood it. You can watch this movie and find out that it's a complete waste of time - you might as well find that it has lost its appeal. I'd suggest to avoid this as much as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen a lot of movies over the years, and I don't have a lot in common with the majority of movies. But this one is a bit off target. In fact, the plot was bad...it was like a movie I'd forgotten. It was like an old fashioned sitcom. There are no real story, nothing made sense. There is just a story that has to have some plot in it. The characters are just horrible characters. That's really the only reason that I chose to watch this film. But the film has no real plot. The story is so bad that you wonder why anyone should have ever put so much money into making it. And I think you just can't buy an honest movie with such poor plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not sure if the writers were drunk. The ending was bad, but this movie was a waste of money. There are some interesting scenes (or at least good ones) and some interesting dialog (but not really good) but the production was bad and the movie looks like one of those films that made fun of its audience and then just turns it on to a boring borefest. The film wasn't the best either but I suppose it could be good if it were made on a high budget. But I don't have confidence in any of the actors and it is difficult to believe it will survive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, my favorite actors and director John Cuculantil (pictured in one of the first movies I saw, and later in a feature in "Swing"), were never too happy in the directing business, but this was a disjointed low-budget film that ended in a sad, but totally predictable finale that left much of the plot hanging on the brink of the screen, and most likely never worked out.  It is very disappointing, because some great actors and a solid story (not that the story is necessarily weak, as was true of many other films made during the time, but I think Cucu is one of many actors who are trying to be funny, but fails on this occasion. Also, the plot was probably too predictable and left too much of it behind. I'd like to see someone in the making of this movie to make a better film than Cucuculants. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always felt that the most important statement in the Bible is to understand what people are capable of doing in the same way. This one can't do that with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters in this movie are very poor, very old and very predictable. They make little sense and there is hardly a chance for character development. The plot is very predictable and I think the dialogs were a bit confusing. There is nothing that will ever happen in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've ever seen in English. The acting is awful, the story is stupid and the ending is unbelievable. The director obviously did not learn from this lousy production. The fact that this film was made as soon as I saw it means it could be a good one, but the film is obviously terrible. If you want to see a really good film, then watch The Magnificent Fifth Sense and then, maybe The Fifth Sense, or something similar. A bad film must be avoided at all costs. A good movie: Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that I can't help but wonder why anyone thinks they're funny. There is no humor or plot, it's just a lot of dumb humor, and it's very boring. But if the funny people in this movie wanted to go somewhere, they could go to South Korea or Japan and be filmed that much more funny. It's just not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply a collection of low, mediocre movies that are just plain bad and not a good movie.  Don't waste your time with this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely ridiculous, not even the actors were good. The plot was lame, the acting was bad, the plot failed to connect. The fact that it did connect at all was a huge mistake. It should have been a thriller, but it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only redeeming factor in this movie was the fact that it made it possible for me to laugh at the characters. This is where I start to think that I'm too old to see this movie. Maybe I would have been so much wiser on the subject if they'd made something more like this. That it was so bad was truly depressing. The ending, with its sad ending, is truly the most disappointing part of this movie, and this is a movie I don't want to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So... who knows, I had read this movie just once, and it was the most disappointing of the crap i have seen. If the movie had been as bad as you claim it could have been, I'd have taken it out. I don't remember where it was, but it must have been the most painful movie I have ever seen. I've never liked this movie, even when it was a pretty good show. The acting is pretty bad, but the storyline was a little better than this. Overall, if you want to see something that you don't see or like, go somewhere that doesn't feature a bad actor. Avoid this one. It is one of the worst things I've ever seen in film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the most disappointing film I've ever seen, ever. The story line is extremely clichéd, and you know what it says about the film. The plot is painfully dull. I couldn't believe that it would get any more. It's so bad that I'm wondering whether I should be watching this movie. Even the stars are playing characters who aren't really in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. If your taste of horror is a mixture of horror, gore, and gore, you will not enjoy it. This movie tries to be clever, but I couldn't really figure out what made me like it. While I enjoyed it, there was only half of the gore and gore.   I watched it in some sort of way to get an idea of how bad it was.  If your friends don't like horror, you might get a kick out of that. But if they do, you're going to be bored the rest of the night. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As someone who's been watching this film for nearly 3 years, I am sure that it has gotten progressively worse. Now the film is full of bad, predictable, and horribly predictable. The story of a man (played by Benjamin Brooks) being robbed by a psychopath and finding his wife (played on by Rachel Brooks) is ridiculous, not even funny in a "real" way. This is not an unusual film. Even when funny the actors were playing it, it just made me very angry. In fact, the film was awful. The film is based on some pretty basic material. Ben Brooks was a tough, annoying, and really cheap actor. I couldn't understand why they had put him in this film. They were trying to create the feeling that he was a villain and had his brain in full of gear. If anything, they should have made the movie the way it actually is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is simple and the script is very weak, even though it contains a very good screenplay. The movie is filled with meaningless scenes and the dialog is just not even remotely interesting. The performances are not very good, unless they are for a couple of the actors that is actually funny, but the movie is pretty poor.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, like this, is so bad it is like watching a dog in a cage. What is the story about the dog? Who was the dog with a brain? A cat with an brain?  The story is about a cat that is not human, but a cat with the brain. The cat is killed by a vampire. There is no blood for the vampire, but just as many blood in the coffin as there is in the body. I think this movie is about the vampire sucking blood from the body of the cat. What if the vampire would just stick with the head like a cat? I have to agree that the vampire must have some brains. The problem with this movie was the fact that the movie was not filmed with high cameras. This movie is a total waste of money and time. I wish it was released on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself isn't worth your time. However, some of the actors do manage to bring their small role in the film to life. Unfortunately the movie does not do anything beyond that point.   Also, you really can't think the main characters in the movie. They are so terrible that it is truly disgusting.  I really can not tell why there was never a good episode. Why bother them? They are really trying to get something right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this one, even the characters have a little resemblance to George Orwell. You know all that would be a spoiler, but I'm willing to admit that even if this is a bad film (as I said previously), the plot is more intriguing than the story. But the fact that the story is so weak, and there are no good scenes that make the movie enjoyable for the viewer is sad to see. Even if this was a comedy, it still isn't. The story is nothing but an over-long series of events that begin at about the halfway point of the movie (which is probably about 20 minutes or even 30 minutes). In my opinion, the ending sucks. You can get it better than this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie I've ever seen. While the acting was OK, I was expecting better from this movie. The story was weak. The plot is weak, the script was weak, and the cast was weak too.  The overall plot was weak as well.  I did not enjoy the first few hours of it, even though I'm a big fan of the original and the first episode of this movie was so good. The last 2 or 3 hours of the movie gave me a chance to say "This is a bad, terrible, terrible movie". I give it one small bit of credit to keep an eye on the sequel, but it did not improve at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you enjoy this movie, you will be bored, but unfortunately there is no payoff to make it enjoyable. The movie is filled with pointless scenes, boring characters, and one plot (but maybe two) that is utterly predictable. I think a better movie would be on the side of a bus; it would be a better way to put up on the bus if someone said the movie is a movie for two people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has one good scene to which I didn't like, but two others to which you can't wait to wait to see, and the other is when he gets his way, all the way. But there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard nothing but what you have seen and nothing more than an insensuous, selfish story of a guy (played by Gary Daukens) whose wife is dying.    The only thing that I can really relate to is the fact that you can't tell what's going on until you just see some thing and you can jump into it. This just isn't a movie with very interesting images and a storyline. There's just some padding and a bunch of stupid jokes. It is impossible to see what a movie is supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't find the time to even watch this movie, but i've read other comments about it on other occasions and can make out the gist of it.  It was obvious to the young actors in the movie that they were just not actors, and they didn't even seem like they were actors. For example, the young actor named Kevin was playing a little boy. There was nothing about him or his son. In the movie it can be inferred that he was a little kid playing the boy. We don't see Kevin's wife, or the mother of the boy, making anything like the boy play for anything, or playing at all. This movie was full of clichés and it was so confusing that it seemed no more interesting than it sounded at the beginning of the movie. The actors seemed to be having more trouble with the dialogue than with the story, and the end was just so bad.  The biggest issue with this movie was the way it was filmed. The camera was so awful that it looked like I was watching at night.   As for the ending, the writer had to figure out a way to get the actors into a scene together and then show the two together at that same scene. It's a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd watch the original film just for the music alone, but if you need to see the movie, you need not be a musical enthusiast. This movie is just another excuse to let people watch "Foster, Jr." for the sake of entertainment. The plot is pretty predictable and the plot lines are pretty dumb, but there is plenty of fun and not terribly serious. But what really sucks is the fact that in order to keep your attention as a viewer, you must follow the story line. It just adds insult to the whole film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts with a very strange plot (which I have never found in any film since I've seen it). The director and a producer decide to make a movie about a girl who is secretly in love with the director's friend. The girl has a boyfriend who also wants to marry her and that her boyfriend kills his girlfriend for whatever reason.  The actress is a very good actress but she is terrible. I think it's funny that the director has used her acting in a film about her boyfriend dying but the acting is terrible and she's so horrible that it doesn't make any sense. I'm sorry but the movie doesn't really make much sense either. I find it absolutely ridiculous that someone can do a movie like this and then expect to get some great actors. They can't have a proper plot and that's the only thing that saves this movie. The ending is horrible, so terrible that I can't even compare it to other films because of how bad it is.  If you have a heart, don't waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first few minutes I can't tell you what this movie is. But what it is, I can say that the first 10 minutes of this movie were pure borkery. There are no more movies in which you can get more entertainment that I would like to see. It is only one in a series, and that is a shame for its creators, producers, and perhaps the audience.  I say it was OK in an era, but it's not good now. We'll have to see if they continue to make movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the same stupid, cheap, fake film that was made by "the last one of its kind," but somehow this film is so ridiculously stupid that it doesn't really stop me. I am sure there are many films that would be better than this, but unfortunately I don't think there are any good enough. This is a film where you decide what you want to be, and what you decide is how much you want it to be. If you were a film maker, this would be a film with you going into a room and picking a random movie: "The Life of James Stewart". If you decide not to watch this film, I don`t know what you'll think about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't have the patience to review every scene in this film but I am certain that this one isn't as bad as many movies about the future. While in the past this film seemed to be about a fictional futuristic futuristic future where people can build their cities in one of two or four huge floating islands, this movie has little substance, the only time is about the person who is in this futuristic island. The plot is very vague, and the characters are extremely wooden, the ending is extremely weak. If you like this type of movie, you would have been so disappointed by the disappointing ending. There are some excellent scenes though. This is just a shame that this movie didn't reach the standard of quality which is more indicative of a film directed at the same level. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is no more than worthless from the beginning to the end of the film. Some of the dialog is better than a few minutes of dialogs in the film, the characters are poor, and the ending is pretty poor.  I think I might give it a 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a very strange beginning. After being attacked by people who are mad that the world could see a film that happens after the first two movies, you realize that the premise is totally wrong. The first three movies were based in a different reality. This one doesn't. The story begins in a very different world. The main characters are also different. They're not even from a different Earth. The plot is the same as the other two movies. Then we're forced to guess which person is more likely to be the murderer because the movie is a very vague, and all the actors were dead characters. The ending doesn't make sense.  There is one way that you can make the killer in a movie. Well, there are some people who don't want to see that kind of movie, like I did, because it's too hard to guess who is responsible. But this movie is such an awful example of that. The killer is a psycho, who is obsessed with killing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a piece of work, really a mess, this flick is, well, only to be a waste of money, to be an embarrassment of the film industry. If this was an hour's play, the best bit of it would have been something different. For example, a short scene in the film would have given us some interesting moments. A good movie would be like those scenes, but this has nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was very confusing for a true historical film. It tried too hard to make the viewer understand the characters. The story is a predictable and predictable and was terrible to see. I didn't even realize until the end that I was watching this film when I was in England. I think that even though the movie had its flaws, there were many others too, i thought that it was impossible to even follow the characters and they would make you laugh so hard.   I didn`T enjoy the movie. The acting was wooden and just OK in most respects, the script was bad, the characters were lame and the ending was extremely predictable. I have seen many other historical dramas and movies that I think are better than this one, but it couldn`T save this one. If you have a chance, go back and see it the next time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very old, awful movie. Some actors had it good. The ending was OK. It got a good one. But after seeing the other movies I couldn't care much more. In this case it's pretty much like that other movie where everyone goes crazy over a couple of teenagers, or the movie "A Love Story", where the story is played out in a couple. So I decided I'd give it a shot. But when you watch this movie it really ain't worth. There is a good ending though, with a nice cameo appearance by a famous (and a not very famous) comedian. But I'll say it is a horrible movie, not really a comedy either, but a bad one. For something that would make even a famous comedian laugh, this movie is a complete waste of money to anyone. It's just bad to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie on TV a few weeks ago, hoping it would help me. I tried to find the video of it, and I couldn't locate it anywhere else. It was so awful, I couldn�t find the name on the Internet. I can only assume it's a real rip-off of some of the old, "Myths Of The Mind". If you had actually wanted to see something like this before your viewing this film, you would have missed this piece of crap. The actors are bad. They are almost the same old, boring and stupid people you'd expect. It's a shame the director wanted to make a movie like this. The only reason you'd rent this movie is so you could get into it for something a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, let's get the facts straight: it's bad, but if it were any good, it would be good.  But this one is really bad. A lot of the things I'd love to see in this movie, like the music, the movie itself, and more importantly, the ending, are left out of it. It is bad even for the best part of the movie, the plot.  The beginning is great. There's a lot to this movie. There are some pretty great moments throughout the movie. The funny thing is that all of the bad scenes, like, the music video in the beginning, are so badly written and directed, and all of them are just the same as the beginning of this movie (also the end). They're not even funny anymore.  I don't know who wrote this movie but it was clearly written with a bad mindset. For instance, one of the songs is "The Goodest Christmas Ever". How much is that supposed to be? I couldn't understand what this movie was supposed to achieve. I think you can get the idea that "good" Jesus came back in life, and was brought back in a bunch of years ago. And that he brought back the good part of that movie only to do what he did in that movie? That's the only thing that matters in this film, and it doesn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really believed this movie was a really good idea. However, it proved to be a lousy movie. Too many times the script was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not normally spend this much time watching an overrated movie but I have seen it several times. The first I remembered was the film: "Misfi" by Tim Carrey who said "I had to die and kill myself" as a child. The film, as I recall, was made so bad that I decided to go out of it on the same day. I did not find this movie worthy of further consideration as a movie. The ending was just "good", i.e. not quite what it needed to be, but unfortunately this was not the right film. My only gripe is that "The Lord Of The Rings" is the better of the two Tolkien films, so that I cannot say the same thing about this one, and "Goblins" is also better of a film than "Lord Of The Ring" in this respect. I've seen nothing else like this "Lord" film! As for "Gorin", I have to confess that it was totally predictable as well. I could imagine no way that this would work. The acting was OK, although not as good as "Miser's Curse", but not as bad as "Lord". I give it a 8 out of 10, but I won't say anything about this. I won one of those awards. I am just disappointed that this film does not take any advantage of its supposed "art". It is simply pretentious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have just read that the plot is supposed to be a plot that would attract most people. And the ending I suppose is "good", because that's really the only thing they wanted to show. The main plot is simply, you know, a little bit of "gosh." And what about the other story?  It's "more of the same," you know. There are the two girls and a guy (who we can see in the early scenes), and the girls are basically identical to one another. And no one is even remotely resembling the guy in this movie.  How many people do this? How many times do you see it? One? One of them does, and one of the others does it all the time. I know that I have seen it more times than I can name. I mean, see the plot with your girlfriend, and then see it with a normal person. So I would take it one of two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm on the side of a really annoying movie that's about a bunch of people that make a lot of stupid comments that keep the movie going. If they made comments that made me like the movie, I'd never have believed they had so many brains. The main character is the guy who's best known by his friends as the dumbest, dumbest-of-all guys on the planet (since he's obviously the best of all friends). They are not funny as they claim, but they do a little bit of good comedy with stupid jokes that just do not go for the big picture. There's one scene where you see him falling on a table and then asking what's going on. It's pretty funny, but the plot is not that good either. There are a lot more funny moments in the movie if you watched the movie at the beginning, but there's not a great way to spend an hour. I didn't find the main story to make my eyes bleed from one scene to the other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just the same as "The Adventures of Fela" and "Lord of the Rings". It's worse than "The Lord of the Ring" because it's not a story. It's just a ridiculous and silly show. When it comes out on DVD, it is no surprise that it does nothing but waste the time. It is a bad story, nothing at all, that tries to develop character depth and story. This makes it sound like a big fat, and makes Fela more annoying than Fela. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are plenty of reasons why this movie is so horrible - it's not good enough for this sort of movie. There is no great film like this that has been created, nor one that I would recommend. I can't even justify seeing the movie, as I have never liked a horror film. It's just bad, bad, horrible, bad. It doesn't make any more sense than an early silent film.  If your expecting a horror flick, then watch "Haunting The Living Dead". If you want a horror movie, then see "The Dead". You'll be bored and disgusted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just a pitiful waste of a film. It could have been made on a series of episodes, but it would have been an epic failure.  The story involved an old girl, a dog and a dog with a bad man, a girl in love with the man and a small, but very annoying dog. The dog is the one who has made it home. The old girl is the dog who has done that wrong, along with a small man whose name is written in the script, who hates cats and believes that people have died from jumping off the tree when jumping off trees. The other two characters are just awful, the story was nothing special, and the ending had no hope.  There was an interesting one scene where she got out the chains for herself and was later attacked by some guys at the farm, but that didn't work for her. The only good things in this film were the few bits about the farm. The ending was the most disappointing part of the movie, although the movie had some fun. If your dog and cat were a real duo, there would have had been more fun and much better moments, such as their love, their friendship, and getting the new owner back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never found this movie so disappointing since its first two episodes I was watching. The first episodes were well made, and it showed the importance of the character, but the second episode failed to take the time that it would have taken to properly deliver the story. This was disappointing.  The final episode is obviously one of the weakest episodes that I have seen. A couple of episodes from the new series are more interesting than this one, and I would have liked to see more episodes. Unfortunately, I can't give this movie a 2/10 because the acting is OK, but I don't blame this one.  If you are looking for a serious movie: don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had many terrible scenes. I didn't see the first episode. I only got to 2 episodes, and a couple of scenes were terrible. I'd like to say it is easier to avoid this movie because I don't care about watching episodes of this movie.  This movie is the worst, and I had really little patience to sit through it. I tried explaining the plot to someone: "Why did you not see this movie?" And they would have laughed at me for saying this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie with the name of "Straywood: The Musical Adventures" and I was expecting this one to be great. But after I watched it I was pretty sure that it was a bad film. It didn't help that I was also expecting the musical adventures and it didn't deliver anything good. Well I am not expecting this film to be bad either so I was a little surprised. The whole thing about Straywood is that it has a musical family and he wants to try one again. This movie failed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess one of the actors was a bit drunk. That was just the case for me, I guess. He was obviously not too old. So, it can't be that. If you're thinking the movie was made about real events, you'd be right. He seems like he's drunk, and probably in an apartment. But not only that, he doesn't do anything, except drink. There was one part that I could find in the movie, but that was probably something that he couldn't say in any other context. But it wasn't that.  The plot was not that interesting, or original. It was pretty basic, but in many respects it just isn't a movie. The actors don't seem like they're going to be in the most interesting role. Maybe they were good actors anyway, but as I see it I would've preferred another story and different characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts in a way that no one else in the movie is expected to survive. But I wouldn't mind watching it alone, and I'd much rather enjoy it without all the pointless, pointless dialog and boring, stereotypical plot lines. Even I'm not really sure why I chose this movie over my "My Best Movie: "The Girl With The Eyes". This film is really bad, and the characters are pretty awful. Most of the time, the characters seem like they're in a movie about a couple and they can't see each other because they don't belong together in the same time period of time as the characters in the "My best movie: " The Girl With the Eyes". And at the end of the film, the girl dies, and she has a message to the others. This was only supposed to be a brief film, and this film isn't really long enough to be meaningful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a couple of friends and family members who saw the movie and I am pretty sure they all hated it. If I was watching a movie about a movie with one actor and the other three characters, it would be a very dull experience. This movie had nothing to do with acting, not even the plot line. I'm not sure what is wrong with this movie, but I thought the actors should have some substance in their characters. Maybe in the movie they had a story, a plot, a theme or a message to a message. I didn't. The characters looked like they were actors in a cartoon movie. They were the same kind of actors who used to act in a regular episode show. Some of the characters were also very poorly dressed. They had to be that kind of characters to make the movie. It looked like most of the actors had some body-skin. I was scared that this movie was going to be in a black and white movie. This is a bad move for a movie to have in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care for the "Hollywood" in the movie, it's just another attempt to "do something like a movie".  I've seen some films, and I've never seen anything as bad as the acting or the storyline.   It's too bad for a movie that's obviously supposed to have some "realistic" element to it.  The acting is bad, the plot is bad (as usual) and the story is bad.  If this movie is even a remotely entertaining movie, I'll pass it by.  This movie is so bad, I didn't even make it myself and I'm not even sure of what director Michael Mann or anyone else has in mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really is an embarrassment. Even the director who directed this was only able to finish this in half an hour.  There was a very interesting thing about this movie though, it was about the true heart of the story (but the movie wasn't so interesting. We don't know why this is, but it certainly was interesting to read but not very interesting to watch). The acting was bad, the plot was lousy, it really was the worst for me to watch. The most irritating thing was the ending. Well, they get it right when it's over, but at times it felt like a bunch of empty film clips.  This might be a good idea for a Christmas present for a family, but I don't recommend it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie a bunch of friends, the biggest group of friends ever, are all dead and their last three weeks of life are going to be spent trying to save the lives of the people they loved. But that's all the way I can explain it. And, sadly, there's no point to any story in this film, no hope whatsoever that this movie will have a redeeming feature, no meaning whatsoever. All in all, you're left with an awful and pointless movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, let's start off with what I have read and what I do not have to say about it. This movie is a disgrace to watch. There's some pretty good action scenes but it's just not all that you want it to be. This is not the movie I would have watched. I have a sense that people with brains that are smarter and more mature than me might find the acting too flimsy and unimpressive to consider. For example, my brother, a mature man, has nothing to do with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on the tube with my wife, and she was so disgusted by the acting that we both decided to turn off the DVD, and then we both stopped watching it.  It was a shame to waste the film because so many scenes were just so awful that they made me sick. I'm sure I'm going to watch it again sometime, but I have nothing to do with it. There are two more of the movie for me to watch and I think I'll just skip it. The plot is pretty good and it's funny but the characters suck. They are like a bunch of kids who are so stupid, but we just don't care. The ending is OK but not great either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really awful, dull, anti-drug TV series based on a stupid "B" movie made out of nothing more than "B". With a ridiculous number of fake "B", this movie just tries to make its main story (a drugstore girl who's got turned into a drugstore addict) stick. It's not as funny or clever as the original B, but, hey, it does contain a little bit of originality. I'm surprised that people found this to be interesting, and that this "B-s" movie was even remotely resembling the original. If you're expecting a lot of original, original, and funny, and then you might be expecting this, but you just don't get it. If there is any humor in the movie, it's a one-trick pony that can't even find a needle to shoot it. The rest of the story is extremely predictable, as the main character goes in a supermarket and gets into a nasty fight with a dangerous drugstore boss. The "B"-s were only a few minutes of action in the first episode, and most of the characters were barely given time to finish. At one point when a "B"'s" is attacked by the drugstore store boss and he blows up a car, we see his body hanging from the ceiling of the store. The body is then thrown off the roof, and we have a few more minutes of a few scenes involving the "B"! Director Chris Alberi actually makes a cameo in this part of the movie and then tries to get that girl into a prison that she was in. Well, that wasn't his first choice as the director, so, she probably got his name as director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very poor. As usual, the movie had good direction, a very good script, and an interesting plot. Unfortunately the only flaw was that there was too little detail in the film. If you have a sense of humor you might enjoy, but this movie does nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing I have ever seen. In fact, I've just never seen anything like it. The plot is obviously just a pile of nothing, but the dialog is lousy enough to be a real waste of time. I can't see any reason why this was made at all, because it is so predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I like a good film when it comes out. But this film does not meet the quality that it holds. The only saving grace for the film was the soundtrack, which was OK. But the other half of the film, I don't want to see anymore. I'd have to say that the music was lame. The characters were flat and predictable, even though they seemed to have the same characters.  I am used to seeing movies with music, but this has been a bad one. In the end, the film is just bad, and not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll have to confess that this movie is simply a rip-off of my best friend and her husband's "I'm Grownful" and it is a truly awful attempt at a romantic comedy. There was a moment in the middle of the film where I was supposed to realize that Grownous and Grownable is two very different things and the only way I can tell it is that this guy's a hunchy, so if you're the type to be like that, then you can just put in another film about a hunkie. For those of you who like to watch a story of the rise and fall of a romantic relationship between a hulkey and his girlfriend, don't even get mad and see this one. This is not meant to be a comedy. If you like to see something like this, you're going to get a little more of the action than half of the movie.  I also found this movie to be utterly insatiable. The plot was predictable and the dialogue is just horrible. A lot of the "fun" parts were just plain awful, such as the annoying "possess" scene where the kid discovers Grownious is a complete hackney.   Growny is actually an extremely stupid character and the fact that she actually believes she is right to be married and making babies that she obviously should not be doing is one of his dumbest pricks in the movie, but for a comedy movie like this you just should not waste your time watching it and just move on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the last three minutes of this film I couldn't believe I even survived this film. I couldn`t believe what was happening... "I'll be good at my day!" I thought to myself "I must be crazy!" As I watched, my mind was racing with all the sounds of shock and horror. When it came down I realized it was supposed to be a horror film (I thought) "the horror of a real house". The story is an old man (who is in love with a young girl), a house on wheels that is set on fire, a zombie that takes over his daughter, a bunch of friends that are dead after all, a little girl who is on the brink of suicide, a priest who is taking care of patients...and there is an unspoken girl who's husband (I don't think he's a priest, just a house builder), who is going to cure her...   Okay, I can't say why I enjoyed the first half of this movie, I liked it quite a bit. It seemed to move, but it did not do any more. Then all the "climbing up on my nerves" was just too much for me. I tried to put some other stuff in the background and I couldn´t resist it. This film is simply a nightmare for me, and I can´t blame that, the people that made it! There was something else going on here, that is perhaps the fact that horror films just are all the same thing! They´ve got nothing new and special! There are some people who can watch horror movies for a bit of fun... but there is nothing to recommend.  I'd never really been looking forward to this type of movie. This is only a mediocre attempt at some silly genre or "theory" film, and the only reason that I chose to watch it was because I wanted to see it, but I was looking for something different. The acting wasn't good, the dialogs were bad, the graphics looked like they had been thrown together at home, and there weren't any surprises.  If this is the only "vap of shock" I have seen (or maybe the last film of the year), then it is probably the worst horror film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a complete waste of the hype that the "B" cast was created to get. In this film the cast is truly pathetic and not even close to the level of the "F" casting from a regular TV show. The acting is dreadful, but what did the writers expect a movie? They seemed to expect some sort of plot and a real plot, instead they gave you an action-adventure with the worst acting and the worst plot. There are some very good scenes, but they are only the result of a few hours of movie making and editing.  If you get it, it's just a waste of time, and I am sorry that this is the movie that you are most likely to watch. If you want to know what's in a movie, just watch something like "The Expendables", and that will be all that it is. If not, just go ahead and waste your time on "B", and try something like this, but don't watch "B". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading a movie that was made in France I decided to see it again for the third time. It was terrible. Not only is it bad to admit I'd have seen the very same movie, but the plot is pretty horrible, too, and the acting was horrible. I've already seen it in England and Australia, but this one is the worst.  I've seen the original (2007) and I'll never forgive it.   I guess that the guy who directed this is a pretty good director. It's just an ordinary Italian-French movie with a couple of annoying parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie and found that this movie was really bad in that it has no meaning and nothing to add to the storyline that is already established. What is the point of this movie? Its a movie that has no real point. A movie about a real person that goes to visit with a person who has no purpose for a movie like this is not interesting. The acting was a complete waste of time. If you like these movies I am sure they would have made something more interesting in the process. They don't do a good job, this is just an excuse for a cheap movie. I am really looking forward to watch something better that might be about a man and a man who are supposed to help each other get their lives back. Why does the person need to visit the person who is dead? The movie has nothing in common with the real life and only a couple of quotes from the real world. If they are going to write a real life book like this then it should include the real events and a lot of the people who have lived the life. I didn't care for it but I can forgive it for a few moments of stupidity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know that the movie is called "Lazy Sunday" and that it is just an excuse for cheap knock-offs of classic, i.e. "Loose, Crawling". "Lose", as the name is, has some good dialogs, but is basically a stupid story with an excuse as to where it's going. And the supporting cast is pretty good, though it's basically no good at acting. For example, Jack Thigpen as the little boy, Jack was really good, and that's about the best that comes out. But "Losing Sunday" really doesn't really go far on. There's nothing interesting here. This is pretty bad, but it seems that every show in the 1990s is a remake of "Loosen", and that doesn't make much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so dumb that you just think it's going to be really stupid, and they're not going to stop the idea, so you get into it, even if you're convinced that it's true, you still can't believe it. For example, there are two individuals with a large collection of paintings and they must decide whether or not to paint them to be a mural. A couple of people decide on the side of the street, and then the cop figure gets angry with one of the paintings and decides to throw them into the garbage pile. For an idea that can't even make you laugh, this is the result of some seriously misguided plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the kind of dumb movie that no one will ever find. The only reason that it ever gets a release from Disney is the fact that it is an animated film which can be compared to a cartoon that has come out in the past couple of years. If you are lucky enough you can see a movie that follows the life story of a boy who discovers that he has to babysit for the parents (if you are not an old boy like me you would never do anything so stupid). I do not know that it has been produced as a complete failure in this regard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years ago I was doing some research for a short project called, "A Man's World" in which a man was trapped in a laboratory. This film would have been funny as the man was actually a man and had his wife on a date with him. However, it got too ridiculous with the characters in the film. The characters in this film seem to make more sense on a big budget then on a tiny budget. The story has some good ideas but the acting was too wooden and not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was not good. The plot was totally ill-defined. It seemed like an excuse to make another movie with an interesting plot, but what was really special was the dumb, self-centered, boring script, that was obviously intended to fill the story with some of the characters in the real world.  The cast, which are all acting amorphous, were very disappointing. The scene which was supposed to showcase the love of the husband and the daughter, had none of the expected chemistry. The girl's father's family seemed to be very ignorant of what the real story was. The father is obviously in on a pedestre, as we've seen in many other movies, to be making the case that there's nothing wrong in this world, and they should take a position that you should be loved for everything. The only good thing in the movie was the ridiculous character who was playing with the little girl on the boat. I was really impressed by the effort of the acting, but the actors should be forced to do something more believable. The real world wasn't that interesting. The characters were too shallow and had no personality except for the plot, so there's no real point to make in making a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Naked Loafer" is a lame, low budget horror film. The camera is terribly awful, there are no scenes of actual scenes, the film is over long and relies on some really lame stunts and some really bad jokes. The acting is OK, but the acting is bad, the dialog is bad and the performances are not great either. In fact, it was bad enough to waste the money. "The Loafer", if I've seen it, is so bad it's not worth the money to see, unless you have some small budget and some very good taste in your heart and you have fun in your mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I am a big fan of the movie and I love to see movies with unique moments, so I can definitely say that I didn't like this movie. It is simply a pretentious and pointless movie.  I am sure that there are some excellent actors, but I really didn't care for the movie itself. The characters were just plain stereotypes of the people of the village. For example, the "good guy" (the "good cop") is all kinds of stereotypes (all of them are bad). This was probably not intended to be a movie for this type of audience, but it does appear like it was designed for a "wanners" movie. When I did see it, I was so disappointed that the characters in the movie didn't act any believable. For this reason I chose not to go and see the movie in the theater (because it wasn't worth seeing). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched "I Am A Mermaid" I thought it would be a film with some sort of plot, but the "I am A Mermaid: The Mermaid Story" had no plot, no storyline, nothing. I thought the story would come into it's own, I thought that this would be an interesting movie. But they just made me feel like I was just talking to some kids. The script was so weak, the dialog was so slow, I almost felt like I couldn't hear anything. It was just an over-the-counterpace movie with a very predictable plot, just a dull but predictable story. This movie was just pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first of the two versions of "Jama Joyride" starring the late J.M.Koyeyer in the title role and Johnny Guse (Bobby) in the lead role as a sadistic cop. But the second version is much better. Not only is the original "JAMA Joyride", but it's so weak that it seems more out of the closet for its own lack of development, its lack of real story, and its lack even the original's fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just a few days after the release of this, the film is being released on DVD. The director of this film (Michael B. Foster) had written a negative "review" about it on his website, which was a hilarious waste of his time. It was completely out of order. I don't want to see it, but I do want to make some notes about it. If you have to read it, try to understand the story, just watch a few minutes of the film and find yourself totally bored. If we don't get enough inspiration from this movie, we might as well see it on another movie: "The Walking Dead" instead. At least the movie is a fun movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie to see if I was in love with my wife, and I don't really understand why it was on TV. I know that the movie had its intended message of "the sex scene is a really hot scene" and I'm not sure how to feel. There were some very good scenes, but the story seems to be a very weak one and does not really come together. Some of the scenes are a lot better than the story, but they are about no where as good as the movie. The characters are really bad, and the story is pretty bad. In fact, I'm surprised that it was even made out of the material because it does not come together for such an ordinary story. I really didn't like it at all. I'm really bored with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is so bad i'm scared i won't watch it anymore. i want to see some of my friends and watch some of the TV shows because i like to watch that type of movie. i thought this movie was funny. it is so so bad it just made me mad. I wanted to get rid of the part where i couldn't wait to see what was happening and watch a different movie. it's really annoying i cant figure out what happens during this movie. there is a man who shoots people at a mall in the city that i think is a psycho killer. there are two guys who were killed by the guy but their victims are not dead anymore. I guess there is some plot for a movie that includes a killer but instead of the killer killing them there is the killer himself. i don't see any real character. there was a girl with a black hair who seemed like she was a little girl but she was killed in the same way. i could see more gore. there isn't any real plot. I want to go on the bus and tell my friends that i'm afraid i won never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the book when I was 18 and was disappointed to find that the characters were made so easily recognizable that this movie was doomed to fail. And when I got the DVD, I decided to keep watching. Even so, when it was good. I felt the book was a bit better than the movie in fact. However, it still became a waste of time to watch. I just couldn't stand it when they used a lot of blackface in the book. I also felt their use of the "wetted" blackface was offensive.  Now, I've watched this movie again, and the director said there were no racial background or gender bias in the movie, and in fact I didn't. You can read it to know everything about a movie, but I felt like the book had too many racial stereotypes. I think this movie has been purposely written to be offensive, but it just can't hold. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of "Bolos" and other junk crap! It really doesn't surprise me, not that much, that it is very predictable and predictable...I think the only thing to be truly surprised is that this film was able to stay interesting to me...until I got to the end, and this is the worst movie I've seen. If the writer is in fact the genius of the genre, then I would be very surprised that he wrote this film. The plot is predictable...it isn't surprising that it's predictable. But as an actor, the movie isn't interesting or original...there is only a few things that make this movie interesting. There is a "feel" to some parts of the story, the "feel", but there is no real "climatic" part...only the "claust" part, which was done by an extremely uninteresting director who failed to realize the essence of the film. I mean, I have seen a number of mediocre films (that were probably made) in my time, and "BOLOS" was no exception. So what? And you think the film is interesting? You just can't expect a plot with a "Bollos" plot like this! This movie doesn't even have any value in itself. The "clamor" aspect is very weak, although that was pretty much the only part that was interesting. The actors should be ashamed of this fiasco. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I discovered I had a video on my iMac and I decided to watch it. It was very disappointing but it wasn't the fun, scary, or scary movie I thought it was. I didn't even like it.  The story line was terrible. The director wanted a story line but he gave it a pretty standard story line with a girl going into a room where she sees the guy. When she sees him, she is frightened, she falls asleep, and she falls down to sleep again. When the guy's girlfriend arrives there, she asks him about it, and he says no, but then she decides to join his band, and they take her into their van and a few years later, their van falls down an underground, and hits some scaffots in the middle of the underground. When they are driving away from a scene, a car suddenly disappears and hits their van, and then it turns into a plane and they run, and we see the pilot's body lying on the ground. The end is pretty horrible, but you can't really blame it. I guess the writer/director thought they could get away with a boring plot line, and it is, but it really can't. I think a lot of people just think that he wanted a fun way to talk about this movie. Well, that's probably because it's not a big budget movie, but that's not true. If you're going to make a movie for children, you better have a bunch of great kids in it, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good ideas in this movie, but it is very bad. It doesn't matter how much good has been created, this movie just sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd really like a movie with more people in it that doesn't exist. However, when I look at the characters in this movie I am thinking about them being in their early 30's. The acting is so horrible that you can't make sense of any of the characters, the dialog is just unbelievable, and the ending of the movie is so stupid that you just want to turn it off as fast as you can. I guess you have to keep watching until the ending is worth watching.  I did not even find a lot of action in this short, so you need to give this movie a 6 or 7 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I noticed was that a couple of actors in the movie seemed to be actors in another movie and had the same character roles as in "The Hangover". I thought that was odd. I am not sure why.  The other thing I saw was the lack of a believable female. This movie had a bunch of female characters that seemed to come from a bunch which just came from a slum. There was no real female characters. There were female prostitutes that we could see in the scene. They looked a lot like real prostitutes. But not like a prostitute who would look like real females. There weren't any real prostitutes in the film. I thought the only real female in the show was an old woman. There wasn't enough to make the movie seem real. It didn't even make the scenes look real. I don't know how she could have fit in that scene in that situation. I guess there was a sex scene in the room with the old woman in a hotel room with another man. I think she was a mother who was going there for a sex thing that would make her into some sort of mother figure. I just can't believe she was the real mother in the hotel room. The only time there was ever even a scene with her in the hallway, I had to wait until the actors entered the room, even just to make sure I didn't get a glimpse of her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is an absolutely terrible movie, with little plot, no one interesting characters, and no dialog. The plot does not provide any clues whatsoever, and the action is very predictable. The story is a complete waste of time, and although the movie itself has a "story" and an "story to tell", neither of these things exists. The characters are dull, and their dialogue is just not very engaging. There are no good moments in the movie. The movie can be watched as a horror flick, but it doesn't work like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started with a little bit of humor and then grew completely out of its own. However, when the plot is in place, you get a complete re-indoction of the movie, and it just looks like a two-headed dinosaur cartoon in a cave. The beginning isn't that bad though, it has decent story and some decent acting. The problem is that the movie tries to go on in the typical Hollywood style, making things like the "Star Wars" thing, the "Matrix" thing and the "Pistinians" thing... There aren't really any of the two. It's not about acting, but the acting is bad enough to make you look at yourself and wonder why anyone has a life. I just can't see this movie, that's all. It starts out with a fun idea, but then you wonder why it keeps getting away from me. There are so many clichés you have to watch if you want to watch the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. I really think that it's the biggest example of incompetence of an Oscar-winning writer, and I think that in a worst year of her career, she can do better. It's just not funny or funny enough. In a world where everyone has the right to make movies, this is pretty disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a certain "theoretical" reason that the "happily married" film in question was made by the director. This is most likely the cause of the slow plot running, as each character is suddenly drawn out of his or her "real-world" life, which only lasts for approximately 50 minutes.  The rest of the film is a completely uninteresting collection of scenes that involve a lot of people being killed, including numerous gruesome body scenes.  I just couldn't care for them, or anything I saw in the film. It just made no sense. And if anything I say could have been better, it had been done a long time ago. This was the first film that I have ever seen this kind of film with any notable (or even notable) lines. It was obviously written by someone who was so unimaginainingly ignorant about human life that he missed the fact that there was no such thing as a "hippie" lifestyle. I have watched this film many times, and even watched it on television (once), but even that was no excuse for this film.  In a nutshell, the film can't find the "real" person to whom one might "hop" to identify. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film about 10 years ago and was disappointed at all the plot of this film. It made absolutely no sense. When we first heard about the original Star Wars, I thought there would be something more interesting, and the fact that we could actually see a Star Wars film in some form or form was only one that was missing. I really didn't like the movie, and it was the worst Star Wars movie ever made. The plot was so bad that I had to find it on television. It's not that scary. This movie could have been a simple, straightforward story where the main character didn't change so drastically. The movie was so terrible, I couldn't even make the characters into a story that made sense. They were just dumb. I was left feeling disgusted that a few people seemed to be having fun and laughing. I think that was the point of the movie. It had absolutely nothing. I can't afford to rent this movie and I can only blame the filmmakers for making it. I just cannot believe that this was made out of something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad. It does not make any sense to me at all. The plot is totally made up and totally absurd. The only thing that made this movie interesting was the fact that it was a "no-name" movie made about the movie of "Backfire". If it wasn't for the fact the movie was made, it wouldn't have been funny at all! The movie was obviously the worst piece of movies ever produced. What was it that made "Backguard" funny? I think there were two movies made in America in the 1990s that were better than "BackGuard". My personal opinion is that there is no difference between them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this made this movie. What kind of joke is there? The biggest problem with this movie is that it pretends to be about a movie. It is a movie about a dumb movie with nothing that has any bearing to the real story. How can it not have some connection to real life? What the heck does it have to with real life, its setting, or its characters? If it doesn't have any relevance to the story, the acting, or the plot of the movie, its story, then there is no value whatsoever. Why should I believe that it is a documentary? Why should my believe that this is about a documentary when they were actually trying to make a documentary that would be about the real life of the real people involved in this movie? It would be a very difficult to get someone to make this film, as the people involved (and the producers) are very wealthy. You don't get people to do this crap in movies and movies. I think that you can get this film to show anywhere, anywhere, but a documentary is not supposed to be either a documentary nor a documentary, nor should it be one of the usual films that are out there. If it was not a documentary with a realistic ending, then it was a movie that tried to make the audience look stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of my time on this... Well... yes I think the movie I rented to be more accurately "Lets Watch" is about the good times it was. Unfortunately, it was just a bunch of dumb, childish teenage boys who got their high school, i.e. their parents bought it to make fun of them. The end result is just a waste. What a fun film would have been!  Well, they still have the "story" storyline and the girl's story, but they couldn't even stick with the actual plot, let alone give us the story.  The movie has some funny moments in it, but nothing that I would even call "fun" is worth watching. The acting is awful, so if you didn't like it, then stick it in the bin.  I wish the producers had some more money to put something better out.  If you liked it, I would recommend to not rent this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen an actor like Ben Kingson, the only one i knew. It's just like the rest of the movie i've seen. The first act is completely horrible, the second is not that great. The third is decent if you're into James Franco or if you like the other stars of this movie. It is not funny. It doesn't have any special qualities. There's no chemistry, no acting, no action, no story. It isn't even funny. The only reason why i can put this movie on a 100% grade is that I'm not really good at reading movies. I saw this film twice in one day.  There is no hope for this movie in today's cinema. The time will come when a great actor will join this movie and help us with the same. And we just want to rent a movie that isn't crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really sick of this movie and even more of it! It is a bad place to make a film of this type. The whole thing is like a low budget B horror movie, only it comes out as a big slasher horror movie.  It is no surprise to find a film with as much plot as this one.  I have no idea how, exactly, it is supposed to go. Why? Why did they give a complete plot that is so obviously meant to be a horror film, and then only give it a partial story?  If they had any idea of making this film, I would have said this would have been a horror movie of some type or form. I don't believe that it is either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the plot is so bad, I will never see it again. The plot, the acting and the special effects are about as bad as most of the movies I have ever seen. The ending of this film can only be expected to disappoint you as the other films did. The film is probably the worst piece of film history I have seen since. I am really disappointed in seeing this movie so often. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really stupid in the way that it pretends to be. It's too predictable and the movie starts slow with a story that is about the child that has just seen the "the evil clown" and is now reunited with an orphan mother. I just sat there watching it and couldn't believe that the parents are so ridiculous. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why such a movie could ever happen. Why will the parents decide to try to get their son back. How will they get their kid back? And why will they decide to kill her? The main story of the movie is based on the story of one young boy and his grandfather, and the main characters are actually a pair of parents. They are both having sex, and they are both killing their son's friends. What's really supposed to happen is that the boys are separated and killed by the parents. What really happens is that they decide that the boy is now in his "evil" body and they decide on going to get him back. This is the type of movie that I just walked out of. There are two main reasons why I gave this movie an 8 out of 10. 1) Because the movie makes some reasonable points.  I guess it would have been nice if they could have gotten in better positions to get some actors involved. There would have a little more drama, and perhaps a little suspense. 1a) It was so bad and so horrible, I was bored.  2) There were better things to have done with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it's worth of a punch to the face. I mean, if it's not a spoiler, it is so badly executed that the scene where they find out that the man in the movie is really alive is pretty scary to watch. It's like they thought he was going to be a corpse and they just laughed and laughed.  I didn't know this, but I watched it thinking it was a fun movie, but sadly, I didn the first time I watched and I still didn't even think it was interesting. If I'd see it for that reason, I would probably recommend watching only one episode of the movie if you have to.    I recommend taking a look at a bunch of other crap for it, like "Presto and Alyssa's Wild Road". This movie just isn't even a good movie, it's just terrible! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie with an unnecessary plot and lame ending. An attempt to fill up the "A Few Days" movie with a little action. The good stuff in the "The Two Kinds of Heart" movie are the story of a pair of women and their son, with one mother for them. The fact that it has a lot of love and relationship between the mother and son is only bad. The only good thing is that a movie with love and relationships between people does not have the kind of baggage that a "A few Days" could have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had some of the most embarrassing scenes ever written for a movie: the girl who kills her sister is in the back of a box, holding onto the edge of her hand and her brother, while the guy tries to shoot the girl that was hanging off a rope in the dark cell. And when the girl is dead and the guy's girlfriend decides to take that money and then takes a few hours to get back to work, she doesn't stop her murderer husband from killing her sister! I mean, just ask yourself: What would you do to kill a woman in a prison that has been built for years and years and has all kinds of security features for the security guards?!  Well, to be fair, the guy does shoot the woman in the cell and he gets away with it. But what happened when the guy was sitting next to his wife?! If I thought I could put the two together, I would. Because the man (with the blonde wig and the camera man) still does not stop her husband. So if you wanted to see him put out his head or blow himself off, I guess you wouldn't see this part of the film. I don't know how he got into the box at all. Also, there was the scene where the guy had to keep a watch on his brother and he saw his wife kill him. And, if you want to see that scene, you might not see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most horrible movie ever made, I mean bad, no, worse than bad. Just the most stupid movie ever. A really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete waste of pretense, nothing new, nothing significant, and no value whatsoever. The acting is poor, the story is bad, the whole production is bad... the story was terrible, the script is poor. The only thing that saved this film was the fact that I had a great time with it. The reason I'd see this film over the next 2 years is that I'd never heard anything that so awful could happen in that era. I thought it was a cheap, pathetic film to be made. I never heard anyone else have such a bad film made before. The fact that it got such bad reviews is pathetic and embarrassing. I'm ashamed that this movie is still around in the hands of "critics" and I don't think there will ever be such a show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a piece of junk, if you want to call it that, that's probably the best word, but unfortunately it's not that. Let's face it, the majority of people reading this on the Internet will see it as a comedy. I've seen this movie, and it was bad, it was predictable, it made no sense whatsoever, and most likely it's the worst film ever made, if so, and I think you'll never have anything better than having a bunch of dumb people making a movie about a bunch more boring material and putting it into your head. If you are interested you can watch it in one of the late nights and leave it in the morning. You'd better wait, because it could go into the trash bins. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love movies, so when I saw this I really didn't like it. It was just weak, it wasn't interesting. Maybe the movie is a sequel to "Bjellybacks", as it was in the original, but I think it just doesn't fit. I won't see it again, and I'm glad it didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just another low-budget, amateur acting from the BBC.  This is no different than the awful American movies that are set in modern-day San Diego, Los Angeles, or other places in Southern California.  As usual, it has a ridiculous plot. For example, a guy who comes to town as a serial killer, which is a totally pointless and silly story. He has a wife, a wife's father, a very pretty husband, a little brother, and a little sister-in-law who are very young. He also has a girlfriend who comes from another country. And to top it off, the guy's wife is in the hotel room with him and his wife's parents, who apparently know about his wife and family's existence. This only has a slightly redeeming story line.  The only reason I chose to watch this was because the movie had so many horrible things, including the fact that the actor playing the husband was wearing a bra for nearly a week. This is the first part of the movie that I was expecting to find even the slightest bit of nudity. This isn't the first of many films that have the characters put in underwear like this, and not at all.  And then there's another bad part, the fact they put the girl's husband in underwear. Why? Why did they do that? They couldn't make him wear panties for her. I guess they put it in in to save the actor from the drying up of his genitals. When I watched it I was embarrassed by the fact I saw this. I was so disgusted and disgusted that the filmmakers didn't bother to set the film in a decent place. They obviously didn't care. They just threw in more and more padding, and they didn't put anything else in there to save anything. It was just another point of ineptness. I hope it didn't matter, as they did get an Oscar for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most predictable and predictable film I have seen in a movie ever, but unfortunately, it was so boring. If you can guess the reason for this film, please check your copy of this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As is the case with many movies, this was a completely pointless attempt at a romantic comedy. The acting was awful and the film wasn't funny. It had no plot, the only thing that helped was the fact that it had a nice soundtrack. The two lead actors were bad and the whole movie lacked any substance. It was just the usual slapstick, but if you liked them, you'd love it more than the film's weak, but not much more. It didn't even deserve to be dubbed, it deserved to be laughed at by a few, but I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really bad. It really should have been better than The Secret Life of Harry. It was terrible, but there is nothing that this movie did not suck. I have always been fascinated with these kinds of movies, but I'm just finding it too painful to watch them. This film had absolutely nothing to recommend, no real substance, no reason. There is no plot, no value, nothing. It's just a sad waste of time. I thought I had gotten to experience a little more in this movie than I got to the beginning, but nothing new and nothing meaningful. I recommend passing this movie to friends who are looking for a little bit more of fun, and only then, pass it on to someone who has a sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and the movie are bad, and the characters are bad.  The movie tries to be funny, but it fails. I think it's the fault of the writer, the director, and his co-director that he doesn't understand the genre they are writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    How dare they put this 'novelier' film into the top 10 worst films ever made. You can see how it was made, but do you really know what made it up? I think this is the worst film ever produced. I am talking about the acting and direction; the story; the characters; the sound effects; the music; the camera; the storyline.  The film is lame, not a good film (although I did watch it twice with a friend). It's OK for some weird movie set-up by a director, but not if the movie is made about a really sick movie about an interesting plot but with a disappointing story.  I'd give this movie a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's bad to say that this movie is just awful! I mean, when I watch this movie, I had to scream and scream, you really should not watch this thing. In my opinion, this movie was a total waste of time. I thought the acting was OK, the storyline seemed interesting, and the idea of an alien invasion was good. But then I found out that the alien's DNA isn't actually human, which really blew my mind. I had very little expectations for the movie. It wasn't scary, but at least it had something to say. But if you find the movie a disappointing, I'm not sure if it's the badest movie of all time. But I will try to give it a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd give this movie 3 out of 10, but I couldn't give it 2. The acting is bad, the story is terrible, and the story line was weak. A couple who have been in a couple's relationship throughout life (including the brother) make some sort of mad play out, and a third person kills another. It doesn't come close to the first "Funny" movie "The Deadly Kiss", I can tell you. This movie was a total waste of time, and that includes a few hours of pointless entertainment. If you're looking for something new and different, try watching "The Naked Ray", not "Funnier". The only movie that made the grade in this film was "The Unfortunate Kiss". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is, a very shallow film with no coherent story, no believable story, and only one character that we care about, and we are completely disgusted by the fact that it does not even care about the other characters.  It's a very sad film, but it gets better when the viewer has to think for itself.    There is a movie: a mad man with a gun that has a purpose.  You cannot decide whether it is his or not.  This movie was horrible.  But it would have been far better if there were more serious films in the same genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was really hoping for something to happen with the new movie. The movie had some great actors (like the director, Matt Damon), but this film lacked that same quality. For starters, they were all too predictable.  And I was forced to watch the entire film with nothing but some of the worst acting ever I've ever seen. The fact that there is no plot or story is just sad.  I'd prefer if this movie was a good movie, but I'm not the biggest fan of "The Hangover" or any of its sequels. But if you like a movie that was made without a storyline, this was no different. That is all the reason I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing part of this film is the lack of depth. The plot was way better than the one in "Life of Lenora", but that was never really the case here. Not even for the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is awful, it's bad, it lacks any real value, it can't bring any value. The plot is an average one - if not bad, like all the movies out there - but then there is something in it. The acting, though it's OK, was bad even worse than that. The premise was stupid and the acting made no sense. The director wanted to make an interesting movie - like some sort of a sequel to a movie: The ending was interesting. However, the ending failed to deliver. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is horrible, but at least it's an entertaining way to look at something stupid. Most people in the movie would have never considered watching this, but it's really not like you'd expect. The movie is boring, it's poorly made, it doesn't have a clear message to anything (as with other films of this style) and it doesn�t add much to the story of the movie. It's like a sitcom, which doesn�you know. The plot is about a man who wants to pick up a girlfriend and he gets drunk in a hotel.  The movie isn't quite so bad, but the plot is so lacking, you don�you might as well be watching something that's about a date with a drunk man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the complete and utter waste of the director and actors that would normally have to perform this movie.  What I do know is that it was probably made by a writer who isn't very good at writing or writing scenes. The first thing I noticed was the weird writing. The most ridiculous moment of the movie is a guy with a machine gun in the forest when the main character tries to shoot people. When a guy in a car gives up his car and then dies is pretty dumb and pointless but it's not that bad. The movie is pretty bad.  If you liked The Grudge, you will love this one. But if you didn't like The Grudging, you won never see anything about this movie unless you're looking for a movie with some substance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So this is probably the last film I will ever see. This is only a few minutes of an unspectacularly awful movie that contains some mild laughs, but it's really bad. I give it 4.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to enjoy this movie because I was one of those older, talented actresses that would be in a position to take over such a film. I didn't have to look in anyway. I had to look for a plot hook. I couldn't see what they were, or what they had to do. I was disappointed that it didn't make any sense.  I didn's see any good way this movie is about, but it really is nothing like what I expected it to be. I can only assume they weren't even the right people for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a bunch of friends that decide to rent some of an old cabin in rural Pennsylvania. It's got really confusing with how they get into the big house and how they exit the cabin.  The actors in this movie all give terrible performances but not that much better than the original. A really bad movie. Very poor direction. A lot of dialog that is incomprehensible. It is a real waste of time to watch. I give this movie a 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I was writing, "The Secret Men" is the equivalent to a bunch of guys doing a sitcom called "Trial Of Murder", where everyone dies in every episode, then they go to hell for some reason or another.  The cast of actors and actors were terrible. There wasn't even a real story. They were just little characters who needed to get their stories across to the audience and then to get people to laugh.  But then they put into it, it's like a "Darth Of Dragon Island" or a movie of "Kitty & Bob" (the sequel to "Dawn of the Red Dragon).  It doesn't make any sense. I found it a bit difficult to believe that it had such a storyline. I actually didn't think there was much more to have in this film, but it wasn't bad either. I have nothing to do with it and I thought the ending was unnecessary.  I'm going to have to stop watching this movie. This is just one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It doesn`t seem like anyone could make more mistakes than me. The only thing that got a decent ending was the actors who played the lead, so they deserved it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely no story.  The only story in the movie comes from the actor (that is not "mysterious") and the two young boys (who should have been more talented than the actors). I've seen it twice. The first time was a little disappointing. The second time was the opposite. I couldn't believe that it was a film.   The acting was terrible. One of the three or four times that I watched it was terrible! The youngest actor was a horrible cliché and he played a boy who can cook only one meal. It was just a bad film. I give it two out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't think of a movie in which I am disappointed with the characters. They seem to be nothing more than a bunch of guys on a plane.  I am also disappointed in the plot, not the characters, but the acting. I have a feeling, like most of the comments here, that the acting is more of a distraction than a movie. The movie is basically nothing like a real movie. While the movie has some good scenes, this is a movie that needs nothing but a bunch to try to make its impression.  The good ones I found were the opening scenes in the movie, and the scene where the cop on the plane is talking to the guy. This was pretty good, but after the movie I couldn't quite find anything I wanted to say about it. I was looking for a real film about the real world, so I watched it with just my eyes. The rest of the movie was dull and uninteresting, and that's not even an accident. I think the whole thing needs to be pulled from and pulled into a bag of plastic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this is a horrible film. But this has one redeeming feature that i noticed. This is the first film i've watched in my lifetime that i don't know the name of, but i know that this movie is one of the worst films i've ever seen. It's just bad. And if you're not a big fan of "The Secret Years" and have no idea why, then this is probably the worst movie i've seen in my whole life. The plot is horrible, the acting is bad, the story sucks. What an idiot could have thought this film was anything good? The actors in this film weren't even trying to be funny or believable, and they weren't believable. The camera looks like a piece of paper that has gone past 50 years of magic! Oh, and let's face it, it's a lot easier to make this movie in the modern era. There isn't much that makes this movie great. I thought this was the best in a while, but this movie sucked so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A documentary of some kind like 'The Making of 'Netscope', featuring the bizarre and ridiculous behavior of its actors, who are of no use to any sensible or human beings, as they have no discernment, which is only occasionally directed by Mr. Pussy. The rest of the movie is completely meaningless, and thus can't be released anywhere else, in any type of mainstream media. I can't really blame this 'document' for its utter failure to deliver anything that isn't garbage, but the rest of this film is actually very interesting (albeit only because the filmmakers decided to include some of the bizarre performances), but by this point, any documentary film with such little value would have made better use of the fact that it contains such nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are so bad that you almost wonder if there was an intelligent, well developed, plot. If there was any plot whatsoever it should have been "Bored of" me and a friend. The story has no plot. I mean, it's a bunch of teens trying to sell something that's so stupid that they actually do and it isn't just the fact that it sucks but it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The best part about this movie was the scene with the naked girl and the naked guy in the pool. The guy actually had a good story but his body was horrible in every way. I didn't think that would be a good scene but the fact is that in every scene it is just a bunch more annoying than anything else. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The only positive thing I can say is that some of the scenes were so good that I felt like I was watching scenes for about 40 minutes instead of an hour. The rest of it was terrible. The script is pretty good, I just wish the guy wasn't forced to dress like a girl. I have to agree with the other reviewers that this movie isn't "the Worst Movie Of All Time", but it definitely was the worst I've ever seen but not by very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a certain plot in the film that I find to be completely silly, but it is interesting to hear that some of the actors are having trouble breathing.  It is worth noting that the film is set in the "South Bronx", although not so many people know that this is the same place. There is also a large plot with the "brothers" (if it is in the South Bronx, then this is a real brother). I don't think this would be very hard to write, if it had an interesting story.  If I could put any more of the things into a film, I would say that I would like to see this film with someone who knows the story and who isn't completely ignorant. If I am going to be making movies like this and not the standard fare, I will be glad to make them. This is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this film was the dumbest film I have ever seen, at least from one of my decades of films. It had nothing to recommend but perhaps the dumbiest film I've ever seen. In some respects, it was one of the worst films I have seen, not because I didn't like it. But the film was incredibly predictable. I did not understand the plot at all, just what I wanted to happen.  I watched it in a hotel in front of the hotel for a couple of days. I didn`t understand why this movie would happen. I knew that it would not bring any good movie. The movie was just an excuse for cheap thrill thrill seeking people. This movie was so bad, that I was really bored after watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am looking forward to this movie but what I am hoping for is just a little bit of fun (with a good story). Unfortunately this movie is far from being fun. It just really sucks. I have seen it on a lot of movies (including The O.C.) but I don't think anything I could find in this movie to make me care so much about it is going to bother me. There is some good footage in the movie (such as the scene where a guy takes a girl into a basement to kill her) but the story is pretty dull. The only funny bit is that the guy's girlfriend is a "mad scientist". This is obviously false. I guess that people will make jokes about it because it has a very disturbing storyline (for those that haven't heard this movie) but that's not something I'm interested in.   This movie was made for fun-zoning and not for plot. If you really wanted to see some of the best scenes I have ever filmed I would consider this movie an insult to my credit. It's not very amusing. There are some very interesting scenes but, as with every horror movie, you can't predict the outcome of the story. The acting is bad, the dialog is bad (as you expect), and the story's predictable. All in all, I can't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't find much to say. I know that it's a terrible movie, but I have read some very good reviews about it. So I decided to put my own little thoughts in. First of all I thought it was awful for the director, the actors, and the storyline. I think that it doesn't have to make the same effort because the movie is good at all times. But the plot is so bad that I don't know what to believe anymore. This movie seems to be trying to catch up with every other movie, without realizing it's not. I find it hard to believe that this was a simple "You got a car" story, and "You're a famous person" instead of making it like "You should have a lot of money" like it's so many other movies. The movie tries to imitate and recreate many movies, but not succeeds. There is no plot or reason to it, and nothing is explained why it happens. In fact I have seen nothing that made me think that this movie was great. The characters are terrible and the dialog is bad, which just makes them worse. The only good thing about it is that it has good music. Unfortunately it is a movie with bad actors. Also not a good way to sell the movie because it has nothing to recommend. I recommend a movie of a better movie: "The Good Movie: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so terrible to watch that it actually kills me. I really didn't like it. The acting was awful, the story wasn't convincing, the plot was flat, and the plot just proved to be weak. I have been a huge fan of Steve Irwin, and I was surprised to see that this movie was the weakest one he had made in many decades, but I understand that he had done work in some of the biggest movies of all time.  I've seen this movie before, and it didn't hold a significant impact over the years. It's probably not that bad, but it doesn't go anywhere near the level of some of his works. In the end, it becomes a joke, and that was the least impressive. I think it got lost because it was just so bad it didn´t work. I do NOT know what happened to Steve Irwin in the movie, but his co-stars can make it look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My girlfriend and I have no patience for these disgusting dramas and this one is particularly painful for me. I am looking forward to see a movie that is as entertaining as this one. I didn't even care for it and I could have kept my lips shut. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I have both watched this movie with my kids and our babysitters. The story was a poor attempt at a family drama but the story was not very successful. My wife looked at the movie and said that she could not believe what she saw.  Our babysitters, who we were, also found this movie extremely disappointing and very poor. It was just horrible. I'm sure you can find it on the web or on video on the internet but I don't know. This movie was just painful to watch.  My son was really disturbed by the fact that they put all their family in the film, and put the whole of the family in a very remote place, and then put the entire town in the middle of the movie.  If you could see this movie in a movie theater somewhere it would make you sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a lifelong lover of horror, I had the intention of making a horror flick like this one. I even thought it would be a really good film. It didn't quite turn out that way. The story was lame, the acting was bad, and the acting (and the script) is utterly bad.  But this one is the only one I saw that was even a decent comedy. If you had to see this movie, you might as well stick a crucifix to your eyeball and say, "I wish you had a punch and a stick and a lot of blood!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have a heart like me you can see my comments. I thought it was a lame plot. It was very predictable and just seemed like "this one will be great". I had the feeling that there was no connection with the characters and just the "wacky" "jokes" they were always doing in the film. I didn't get it and I can't see why. I also think that the ending was too much of a jump at the end. I don't remember why people would suddenly be jumping down the stairway, but then they should have put the stairs in the way of the movie to make the ending even more believable.  The cinematography was poorly done, most of the dialog was done at the beginning of the film, the camera work was bad, the editing wasn't even done well enough to make some semblance of action. There is a huge, horrible plot that just kept getting better throughout. There was one scene in the movie that was good and one that was bad. The acting wasn't great, but the music was good. In fact the song and the scene were pretty good, but you never see some action. In all of the ending I just wanted to throw the movie out on the floor.  Overall I think it was an okay film but I didn' well like it. But I won't see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When "Planet of the Spindos" was first released, I was expecting it to be the same as the usual American action-adventure, so I quickly decided to give it the benefit of a watch. It didn't quite live up to my expectations.  The premise is simple - the planet, being destroyed, is about to be destroyed by a bad, ruthless space-monster (as I remember).  But the plot is far too convoluted to make it worthwhile.  I found out the "Planet" was supposed to be attacked by a big bad robot. It was a bad idea because it was supposed for a bunch of astronauts to rescue the planet. That robot doesn't quite fit the role of the villain. What are the astronauts doing? Well, none of the astronauts have to make an interplanetary landing, do they? It doesn't matter.  When the robot goes out to pick up a bunch more of humans, what are we going to do? Oh, they will destroy the Earth. They won't go in the way they had planned, they won't be in space and, instead of a planet of human-like aliens who could help, they'll destroy it, and everyone on Earth will die.  In spite of all, the film wasn't terrible, in the same manner as the previous one, and it didn't have quite a plot to its credit. There was an attempt to build the film into the standard sci-fi genre with a lot of action. It is far from it. I give this movie three out of ten, as the movie had a decent plot and a decent, even remotely, entertaining plot. But I don't see a lot in it, besides the plot.  A couple of strange effects that don't fit into the script, like the giant floating thing, which made me feel the film was made in a totally different space. That is the only thing the movie got right. The plot is bad.   And what a weird plot. The robot in the film is trying to build a bomb that will destroy all of the people on Earth. I guess that might have been the "secret plot" that the movie is based on, but it didn on to an enjoyable degree.  There was no good reason for an alien to turn into a robotic creature, I suppose. And all of that was senseless, which I didn't really think made the film a good one.  It is not a bad film at
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has some of the worst plot I've ever seen. It seems as if it is a film for the loonest people in the world to make. The only good thing in this movie was the final scene. Unfortunately, the movie didn't make this stand out. There was an embarrassing ending. It didn't really happen, I felt they were out of the backwoods.  My rating: -1 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible film: i cant believe it was supposed to be a true adventure film like the earlier one. i could not believe that they would use "the" and "the man" together for this film. They should have chosen to use the phrase "the Man". The man is not a real character, but there is no substance to him aside from the fact that he has a special relationship with his wife. he is a complete moron. He seems to think he's an animal, but is she a human? What was it that made the actors agree to play this character? What happened to the actors in the film was their first line, "You better believe he's a human". He had the same dialogue with everyone. We all knew at the start that they did not have a true relationship with each other. And i think it was OK for them to say that "You are human", because they just agreed to act that way, but they should have made a documentary about the true meaning of the line. In conclusion: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie set in the future where all of the members of the community are killed by the black plague. It's a sad plot, but unfortunately the actors are terrible. They are very obviously actors who must know more than they care about this crap. The script is a little bit better, and the actors have some good lines, but sadly the only thing that makes this movie even a bit better is the lack of any real plot. I thought the last movie I saw was really good, and this just ain't. I also think you would better watch it if you're looking for more action. It does not include any nudity, and it's just not as entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard anything better. A couple of hours is the minimum. I'll be honest with you when you say the movie has so much to be expected. There was one scene that worked, but the rest of the movie was just terrible. I'm not saying "good" in that sense because I don't know what to say. There are some good scenes in it, but overall it is just bad. This is the type of movie that you might miss. I'd like to see this movie when it is available. It's pretty plain that it isn't even in the store in the UK. The characters are so horrible, that it's almost impossible to believe that they are real people. They are all actors with nothing else to do. I find it very hard to watch anything that doesn't have this in common. If I had the opportunity, I would just sit on my bed and watch a documentary. I have no idea what a documentary is supposed to be about. I am pretty sure I'd have never even seen anything remotely like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think they should have had a second script, it would have given it a little more life.  I watched the first one a couple of years ago, I have seen a lot of it in my time. In it I saw nothing else, so I can't say how much I saw. It was awful. It had a stupid plot, the characters were completely unlikeable and un-understood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Candy" is a film that has lost its essence over the years. It is one of the most boring movies I have seen in years. The fact that this film is set in Jamaica is ridiculous. It's like the movie "The Castle", in that it's set in one location, the same as "The Castle". This movie is nothing but shallow, nothing but fake excitement. The only thing that this movie has is a ridiculous script. What did they make this up? When I watched it in Jamaica, I thought it was one of these cheesy movies set in the Jamaica area and then put in Jamaica. And they made it even worse in Jamaica because the cast and acting is awful. I think that this is just a cheap story of a kid who has been abducted in Jamaica and somehow ends up in Jamaica to find a girl. I thought that this was about an older girl named Molly Golder (aka Candy Golder) who falls off and meets a local family of guys. One of the guys kidnashes her and kidnaps her on a local bus and that is her brother's girlfriend who's a little bit deranged. The two men steal her and then, do something to her. Then, she gets off her bus and, she doesn't know where she is. Why? Why? They put her on the bus? I don't know how they put her out there. There is some sort of script to this movie, but it seems like they just made it up, and made it so that they made themselves into this movie. It only made up some interesting plot, but this movie doesn't really have a plot. The plot is lame. I just watched it for the sake of a few laughs.  The biggest problem is the director (Brett Wilson). He wants to get out of the country, get out there, and make money. He tried to get this movie made in Jamaica (where, coincidentally, I'm from), but the film is not a true Jamaican film. It makes you laugh, but the way he did it is extremely weak. If the plot were good, then the movie would be good. The acting is OK, but there was only 2 or 3 actors. This movie really is just not that good. If there was a good plot, it would at least be good, and there was none. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a sad day it is. If you are expecting a movie of a movie: you will be disappointed. In this movie, they can't act. There's only one person in this movie that has a line in his mouth.   This movie really shows only one of two characters. For the rest of the movie, it tries to make some jokes. But, the main character, the "King" is the only person you see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Hackers" is absolutely horrible, I mean it's really horrible, it's a really horrible film to watch. It's really hard to watch and it doesn't really feel like a movie at all, but I guess it has the charm of being a movie. I didn't even see the movie until I heard about it on the radio. I think that the production is awful, it was horrible! I was afraid it would be a total waste of my time and energy. I was really angry about the film and I just threw it in the trash bin. It really wasn't even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife decided to rent it and I saw it on the movie channel and, in a very brief time, I had to see it on it...and I sat through most of it. I just said, 'wait a minute, there are people who are really, really, REALLY, going to be stupid about this crap.' In my opinion, it wasn't funny at all...and then it just ended up being bad to watch.  I decided to put it on hold...until they got to the end of the movie to see if they would actually finish it.   So I'm afraid to admit that there are a lot of people who actually found this movie funny. I think that you may as well know how much more funny it was when it was first released...  I think you're just looking for the oddest thing and not the funniest thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just can't understand this movie. It is extremely stupid, very boring, not entertaining at all. It was very predictable. Also, when people talked with people, the characters seemed like they were very bored. Also... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a movie this is really is. It's so bad that I can't figure out how it even passes my comprehension. It doesn't really help me to feel much sympathy for the people involved, even the characters. What a plot is even about. What I actually want to see is someone who can help the people who are suffering, and then a couple more scenes that include people in a position of interest, like a good Samaritan. That just feels like it's an excuse to use as many people as possible to try and do it all to people who have nothing left to their lives, all in a short time frame. The ending, however, is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best part of this film was just the ending. The plot was very simple, it could have been made more intelligent. The film was boring. I guess this movie was based on a story of a guy who stole money and has to escape jail. A lot of people think these movies should be based on the story of the guy who steals the money. For example, they put these guys in prison and show how they're sentenced to death. I don't know if they had any clue as to the characters in this movie. I didn't have any clue. The actors didn't seem very interesting. They seem to be a bunch of people who just want to be famous. They were like teenagers from a local high school. The guy in this film didn't act like any of them. They just seem like the average teenager who don't have much money and are just doing this childish thing for attention. What's the story? The story is about a guy that has money but has been caught by a very nasty man who has a penchant for killing people. I'm sorry, I think that's just how it was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a bunch of people that live in a cave and have nothing but money. What a shame that they do not even care about their own families. It's too bad because this really is a shame because it is an oversexed, uninteresting, bad movie. The acting is OK, but it really is too dumb to make me laugh. The end is predictable, the story is too predictable, and the ending is pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was full of ridiculous characters and bizarre twists. Not the kind one expects. But to be one of the "ugliest movies in the world" (i.e. one with bad acting, bad special effects, bad directing, bad story and bad direction) is a joke.  The first time I watched this, I was amazed that this movie was a documentary. While I did think, "it was interesting", I was left wondering if "it had some plot" (not exactly, but "plot").  The dialog is unbelievable, the only funny thing was that there was a lot of swearing in the movie. Not enough to be funny.  As I watched, there was some weird dialog and odd acting. Not too much of a surprise.  Also, the scene where the guys were being pulled in by the robot's head made me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got into this movie hoping that it was something that would spice up my life for the next two days but I quickly realized that it really wasn't. The acting, even the acting, was so bad that it could have been better written and directed. The only good thing I saw in the movie was the fact that it had a plot. The problem with this film was that it lacked one. The characters were so pathetic that you can barely feel good for them or even care. I'd give this film a 10 but I'm sure that would be a huge mistake. I have a feeling that people who are not accustomed to seeing a story with many characters will just read that it's a pretty simple movie. If you are one of the kind who likes movies like The Girl with the Devil, then you can see it. But if you are like me, then your just watching that one. There is nothing to make you care for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was interesting but was extremely pointless to watch. While the characters had some good dialogue, it just felt like a bad-mole movie that would have made more of a point to make. I've seen better movies, especially comedies, than this one. Some of the humor was so bad it made it painful to sit through. The ending was so poorly written that it was almost a bad attempt at writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I love seeing these cute kids in a movie, and they are adorable, and I thought this was interesting, so I thought it was cute enough, but it is not. I can't understand the point of this movie. We get all the kids and they decide to be pirates and then everyone goes to a castle. How does this work? I just don't understand why this movie got pulled from the shelves and then released, as it is an incest movie. There is no real story and just a bunch of pirates in a cave. In the cave there are dead monsters that you can beat up with and they don't even want to admit that they're dead. They talk a lot, and then you just sit in silence and watch the monsters talk to each other, like it was made only for the sake of the action. I don't think that this movie had any real meaning. This is just bad. I think that people should avoid this movie and don't see any more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen in a theater: I have seen several movie scenes which are much better than this one. This movie is so, very poor. The plot is obviously one of the worst things you'll see in Hollywood. The story is completely pointless. I can't even begin to remember the characters.  I guess that this movie is for kids and kids who would like to play a game. It is extremely juvenile, and I am ashamed of my parents sitting around watching it.  If you have seen any movies: if you want to see a movie that was as bad as the title, ask your mom to rent it, and if she doesn't rent it you just go home and watch something else. You'll probably regret it if you ever try to rent one of these movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. I think that if the characters had more depth, I would enjoy this movie more. If you want to watch a show that is not filled with drama, then this was the wrong show for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In an effort to revive this film the director and writer, the first and last part of this film, have decided to leave the story into the original, not the end. So now you must wait for the rest of the story to be completed. You must wait until the end to finish. There are many bizarre things that are just completely ridiculous, I found myself looking at the characters instead of watching the story and wondering if they have to go through it just as much as I do. I can't comment on the story, but I just think this film would be better without it. In the previous installment of this story (I'd like to see more), the ending of this movie was also pretty terrible. I understand that the film, in a world filled with so many films, has the chance to redeem itself, but this film just doesn't seem that redeeming itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good parts in this film, but the parts that have the worst effect is the characters. It's hard to see any character that is not completely moron, even the girl who is obviously the closest to the main character.  The only part that may have kept the audience in suspense throughout the entire film is the finale, and if it were it would make the movie a winner, it would be bad. The scene is just silly and unbelievable. The story is very simple and there is nothing that justifies it.   If the viewer is curious to know who the girl is, I would recommend checking the book for "The Secret History of Ulysses Verdely." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this film only a few times and so I can't really comment on the script. I guess it's supposed to be a comedy with a lot of humor. It's too bad I've seen it only two other films. I was expecting better. I've already done more research and I'll get the first time. The director was so dumb, I couldn't believe that it's a film. It was boring and predictable. I'd like to see this movie in a few hours and see how it doesn't seem like the others.  The director said it was a funny movie with some funny people. But I'll say the story isn't funny. It just isn't interesting. And the acting is terrible. I didn't like it much. I think the plot is a bit interesting. But the acting just wasn't interesting and the movie didn't get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film features a cast who can barely make it look good. I'd have to believe these actors, who have barely even been around the theater in real life, would be able to make a convincing performance. The plot is horrible, the camera is bad, the cinematography is bad...  There is nothing that makes this film worthwhile to even watch over this lousy movie. It's an insult to the entire movie industry, and I'm sure that they just won't have the resources to make another one, even if the filmmakers decide to work on this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you ever enjoy the early 90s action sequences, you will not get the full story of this horrible movie. This is just an example of why this movie was never made.  This is probably the worst film I've ever seen from a recent film:  The acting is terrible, the plot is completely pointless and the only good thing about it is that it does contain a pretty great story about a female hero. But that girl is not even very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of terrible writing, bad acting, and bad story-line, and a bad script. The movie had a bunch of very dumb jokes, and then it was just a bunch more stupid jokes.  If you are hoping to be entertained by a good movie, you will be disappointed.  The good part of this movie was the dialogue. When the two people in the movie were talking, the characters were in a state of denial.  Then the movie ended.  A simple question that has a predictable answer and I didn't like it. Why did they do that?  I will admit that I laughed as I watched this movie.  However, I don't recommend that you watch it to avoid disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you haven't guessed, the movie is basically a little bit of a "Swan Lake" or a "Rising Sun" type movie. Nothing happens and there is no good explanation. I would be surprised to find that there are ANY good movies in that world. Some of the action scenes are better than anything in the original "Swing of the Dragon". I have been looking for a movie that is "just" like the original one and was disappointed with it.  The story is a "solved" type one with very few scenes and very few characters. The only thing that it has that keeps it alive is the bad supporting cast. When the original show was first shown, it had so many interesting characters that it was easy to keep you watching it all the way. It did not go into a typical genre. However, "Swings of the Dragons" just became one of those weird cults with a bad story and bad supporting casts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on a DVD in my car while waiting for parking at my local mall. In fact, there was a scene with an actor that was clearly not from a documentary and I saw the subtitles. That made me nervous. I felt that if I ever made this film for myself, I would never be able to go back to the theater. The storyline is extremely contrived, the action is weak, and the characters are so far removed from the story and the story itself that I cannot even tell. I am not a fan of "The Last Air Flight" nor am I a film enthusiast, but this was definitely the worst piece of film I have ever seen. The characters were obviously written out to a certain point, but there are so many stupid clichés it is not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the film equivalent to a film: 'The Walking Dead.' Nowhere in the movies has ever managed to put me in such shock-horror-sensory-scratches. The 'The Dead' does it, but even that is not a success. This is also not a successful movie. The writing is just horrible. I have no faith for the people who actually put this script into their scripts! The acting is just terrible. It can't make me believe that anybody would put up a movie called 'The Living Dead' which is no more than a pile of junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie seems to be nothing but mindless entertainment. It's a cheap idea, nothing original. It doesn't have much plot to it. But, in terms of "genre" this movie was nowhere near as bad as "D-LIFE" (which was really a great film). I just can't believe that this is the way to go in a post-apocalyptic horror genre like the early 20's. I mean, there are some really good (if bad) things. The vampire attacks were very close to the real reality. This wasn't so close to reality as the "D" Locker or the "House Vampire" movies, and this movie had nothing to do with real "D"-Locker(or, in the case of "Curse Witch"), nor even with the real "Avenged" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie seems like it will be a pretty predictable thing to say and it is predictable in its dumb-bitter. This movie is so bad it is hilarious. If I was in the theater when this movie was released and if I'd have any idea that it would ever be funny. I'm sad that it is released on TV and there is nothing I can say to you, other than "it just got better".  The director, John H. Yantis, is obviously the biggest fool in the world and the other two stars, the two daughters are clueless, but unfortunately she tries her best to keep them from falling in to this bad movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting and script are very poor, but the story is good if not the horrible direction by the way of the production. The story of the first movie (The Naked Eye) is a very good one. However, this movie is totally meaningless (for lack of a better term) and bad from the very beginning. Some parts are decent, and the film is good (the main storyline is still good) but the rest is completely lacking. Some important scenes are missing (such as the beginning of the film with Benicio, Elvira, and Elvida, which we had a few minutes before), and there is absolutely no closure for the characters. The acting is not even remotely good. I don't even think that most actors can come so badly off, especially such as the characters of the main protagonist. The rest of the movie is nothing special or memorable. We just can't hold it up. But at least, don't pay anything to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When watching this movie, you get to feel like an evil monster. It's not fun to watch; it's not funny. But the story is pretty good; if it is funny.   The acting was really terrible. When I watched this movie I was annoyed that the actors seemed to be in love with their "heroes". They had really no interest in them and they acted like they had been a victim. The only real pleasure in watching this film was the fact that it was impossible to tell who the actors are and it made me really sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, with its predictable-ness, is pretty good if you're not looking for action, and the plot has a decent premise. But, the lack of a script makes the film unbearable.  If you're going to be a viewer of this movie, I'd recommend that you do not see it.  The ending is simply not interesting or funny.   If this movie is a real movie, then, you'll enjoy the beginning, but the ending is horrible, and its just unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the film is about a woman who falls into a relationship with a serial killer. She kills a man and kills another. The killer also kills another and kills more people. The story does not have any real ending, unless one wants a plot like this to keep you reading. For example, the killer is killed by another man. This is all I can say. I didn't get it. I was very annoyed by this bad movie. Not even the story has a ending. The movie tries to be funny, but it just fails. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible and extremely anti-intellectual...and that's exactly what a movie with this title is supposed to be. I thought the movie was an attempt to get a bunch of stupid teenage boys back to school to save money. The plot is bad, it doesn't have any logic and it has little-to-nothing to do with it whatsoever...it's just some stupid jokes. If you're like me, you would not like it to be a movie at all. And if you were a teenager who was curious and curious and actually wanted to see a movie, this movie is not the way to go. The acting is bad. It's extremely predictable and predictable. It takes place in a dark warehouse (that would not make any sense). It's hard to say if it's a normal movie and then it's for a guy to come in for a night and watch it...you don't want that sort of stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing in this film is the ending. Unfortunately, this film has no ending. The whole film is about an old woman who is now in charge of the city, and after being shot by some thugs (who killed a woman), she tries to bring in her lover (who she wants to kill) by convincing him to help her, but he has never even bothered to speak to her. As the film progresses, it turns into a pretty horrible soap opera with a bunch of annoying characters and no direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A new movie based on a famous British stage and a classic Shakespeare's play. As a result, I don't like it very much. But unfortunately it doesn't deserve to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie for entertainment purposes only. This movie is a piece of trash that was very ill-written. The story lines were pretty dull.  I couldn't care so much of this movie. If you're looking for a good movie: don't rent this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only positive review I had from it was this one:  It was obviously written by people who don't understand the human world.  In fact, I believe that they didn't have a clue on how to read the plot. The way the story played out was pretty stupid, but it worked only to illustrate how dumb people are in a vacuum of their minds. And as for the story itself, the actors were horrible, in no way good, although the supporting actors were good. But what really was in the story, that was the most disappointing aspect. If only the people who made this movie could read, or any of the movie's dialogue properly.  Overall, this movie is one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. If you want to see it, and you want the good stuff, you better wait for the "The Bourne Retrés". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a very disturbing film. The director tries to tell a story by simply using a couple of stupid characters, but it is really badly done. At the beginning I thought this was a great film but then all of the characters are incredibly dumb. At a bad table in a hotel, there is only one man in the story and we don't know how the other two had done something they hadn't. I guess it was one guy that killed his entire family. Even though there are no proof it was the man in question, I thought it looked like his character was one of those stupid people who used to steal houses and kill people. That was the only way the story had gotten started. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the absolute b-movie and it is just like a B-movie, but it is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to hear a more accurate description of the 'horror' of this film. A good analogy might be a film where you get into a house and see what happens in the house. That's the sort of film you would have to sit down to and watch. But this movie is so bad, you have to wait an hour to see it.  I have seen better films with much better characters than this.  So, I'm just going to say this one as an example of the types of film that are not that good: the kind that are so bad that you never even finish watching the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that has absolutely nothing to recommend in any way, shape or form (except perhaps as a simple lesson on the importance of keeping your dog on a leash), it's like having a car that is stuck in a garage, and if your dog drives down to the garage and decides to shoot a bunch of random people while you're driving down the road, it's a horrible thing. And I think to all of those who are trying to get into a movie on this type of stupid "sport," this movie is only one of several pieces of a failed effort to re-do a failed movie. At least I think this was meant to be a comedy; unfortunately, it seems to be nothing more than a comedy that has nothing but its name attached to it. I was very disappointed with the film, not in the sense that it has the depth of plot or character development, but in the fact that it's completely unsuited to actually make me laugh. And if you're going to watch it, you need to see it on TV or even on video, because it looks like a piece of garbage. My own opinion on this film is that it is just not funny. I think it's the same with every movie: either you're really bored and you're bored and then you're just bored. This film is hopelessly boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You know how many movies are made about a young girl who comes home in the middle of the night and finds herself in a strange place where nothing but sex, drugs and rock is to be found. When the girl finds a strange man who can't make it work, she realizes she has been abducted by the stranger. The first time you see this is in the opening scene. Then later in the film you find out the girl is missing. You can guess how it ends. The girl is now found hanging out in front of a car belonging to another mystery man.  The only thing that saves this film is the music. The movie tries to establish a story to the situation by placing the guy with the car at a roadblock, but only shows him as a carpenter who can build a car. He comes back, but then he vanishes the car. And then you are left wondering what was really happening. The only plot lines are about the guy going back to the scene to help in the case of the missing girl. And it's just a bunch of stuff. Not really. The sex scenes are pretty good, although the sex scenes were only really good for a brief moment. A couple of jokes are good, but they aren't anything special. The end of the film, which was only ten minutes or so, seems more interesting by having the guy be a car mechanic and having the girl find her. And that isn't a big deal either. This is a pretty bad film, but it was interesting enough to be forgotten. This was mainly because of the plot, and not the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie stars a lot of bad actors, a bad story, and bad writing. This movie was no where I expected to see something that is so bad.   I'll just add this point because I have seen "The Devil Wears Red" and it's very interesting and well made.  The story of a good, simple, fun cartoon character is a plot that is completely unbelievable. This is the same kind of thing, but it's a poor movie to do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Strayer's Curse" has absolutely nothing in common with the usual "B" films I saw when I was a college student. The story is about a vicious little girl who murders the "Streyer" on the beach. After a brief flashback, we learn that the girl is back with her family in a new life. The protagonist is a big girl who wants to stay in a high school as a babysitter for a child. But her family is so insuccessed that she can't do it. At the end of the film, the girl (who we think is her daughter, as the producers had told us she's older than she is) decides to use her mother's old sister as a surrogate, and she doesn't have the slightest clue how the murder happened, until she is killed in a car by another killer.  I was looking for this movie to be one of the most horrible film's of the early 1980's, and even with the great special effects, the movie could not have been so bad. The film is simply horrible. Even the ending of the second act was dull and empty, and the film itself is just plain bad.  In fact, it is the worst example of film history of film making I have seen, and I have yet to find one of that many movies that could beat Strayer' Curse.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is just bad. It has the worst dialog I've seen in a movie, with so many bad scenes. I guess they tried to make this movie better, but unfortunately I can't say more. The acting is awful. If this movie were good I would give it to this movie because the directing is very good. The film is about a teenage girl in an apartment building and she is looking for a younger man to rent. A strange character named "Fuzzy" (Barry Bowden) is the landlord's roommate and she wants to rent with him. However the landlord has a secret friend who wants to be the landlord. This girl is a young, rich girl who doesn't have much money and is being pressured by her father to rent and she tries to rent to her boyfriend.  The ending really sucks, there are too many clichés.  There is no real ending to this horrible movie. Maybe I should give this movie 2 stars because the acting is good but the plot is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just another dumb horror film that doesn't deserve the time it spends. Its almost laughable to me. The plot is about a little girl, named Annie, that becomes the only person to keep the whole town of the town, and the town mayor. The only thing we learn about here is that, as it is, she's so evil that she could kill everyone if she gets into a car or something like that and everyone else will die in a similar fashion. In fact, she kills people, but she doesn't realize why she does it, and she's not punished, although the fact that she keeps doing it is amusing. She has a tattoo on her chest that looks like the words 'I love Satan', but it isn't a tattoo, because it was tattooed at the beginning of the film, so who knows what it means. She kills people by hanging around their necks, throwing sharp daglets into them, then throwing in the bottle and throwing in acid. The best thing I could say about this film is that it starts with a lot of blood. The fact that there are people and things, is totally stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the title says, this movie is awful. I didn't see it until I saw it on i.8. There are only 4 movies that would warrant this title. Most movies aren't bad but this movie, in particular the "Hemmonon On" part.  I'm going to keep this for the sake of the film's name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there was ever such a movie for you, this would be a movie: "Manno wants an escape?" No one would know about it....   This movie doesn't even pretend to be a comedy movie.  The acting is painfully wooden, the plot is a complete waste of it, and the story is simply no better than the "I Love San Jose".  For example, the "Mavera" (a female named "Mavio" by the producers of the movie) is actually portrayed by a male named "Avenger" who is married to a female named Maria, who is really a homosexual (I assume the actors were married); the "Maria" is also named "Maro" by a female who is actually a lesbian; and the "Marito" is named "Brianna" by one of the producers, as she is really just a lesbian.  As for the story, the characters don't even make any sense, except the "Avein' a Lady" who we can see and see in the background (the "Manna", who can be seen in the foreground of the theater, and has a very dark skin, and hair, which the "Nereida" (the wife of "Movan" as the "hail-hail") is supposed to marry with)  The story is obviously a bad one, but I couldn't help but watch this movie without knowing anything about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just goes on for about 3 hours. There are many scenes that just have no meaning. When the actors are playing their characters, you can tell that they have not even started to prep their act, and the plot is just about as incomprehensible as the plot of a normal film. The only good thing that this movie had was the story. However, it is extremely bad in general. The plot is unbelievable. The characters are either so badly acted by the cast, or poorly drawn. The fact that this film was nominated for an award tells me that if this movie were to be nominated, someone should have done a better review for this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the most stupid movie ever filmed. They have very good actors, they even come with some nice visuals and music, but the movie is just a stupid attempt to be an action thriller movie and tries to be more like a porno movie. The scenes that are supposed to be filmed on a submarine are badly edited and just made up a pretense of something. There is absolutely nothing, nothing, that even remotely qualifies for action, except for some sort of action shots. There are even scenes which are not in a submarine. The acting is terrible, but what else? I have to admit, the movie does have some decent material. But this is really the only movie that has been truly disappointing ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a horrible waste of some good ideas, but it doesn't really go far. This movie only gives you four seconds to feel like the audience might like the movie. In general, I think it was very bad, but I thought the story, as usual, was very interesting. But the direction, even the framing, was terrible. You can't really expect the camera to be a camera, and the camera is almost completely locked up. I didn't really like that. Maybe the script was good. But when you get to see it, you really think you're going to hate it, and you really don't care what happens to the characters. I've seen that movie before, and I just didn't care it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this one, the actors have no chemistry whatsoever, and when we see the characters in the movie, they have no real chemistry. The acting is completely lacking, the story is completely incomprehensible. The scenes are shot in a very limited way, with not enough dialog. The characters are wooden, the only character we get is the old man who comes back to rescue the girl who is missing her. The only interesting thing in this movie is the "young couple" on the car, and they are completely in love with each other, which is not even believable. It also seems that they are in a rush to make this movie, because it reminds us of another movie "Kali". When they finally have the girl, there is not much excitement for them, and the ending comes at a depressing end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a suspicion that all of the actors who are in the film should be very involved in making some of the film in order to make a better film. As it is, they don't seem to have done so. It seems as if the plot wasn't made up for the characters in the movie (like the characters are about to get "cut, but only that way).  I won't give this movie a 2 out of 10 because I'd like to see better films. This is a cheap, weak, mediocre film. I hope you will see a better piece of film and if you don't see one, you can blame it on the rest of the movie. It's just that they're too busy doing everything they're supposed to be doing, and they don her out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen nothing like this movie to this point, not even on the most obscure channels. It's just a disgusting, empty waste of the precious time and effort that would normally take someone to build a movie with some real talent. A few minutes of thought and effort could have made this movie better. The production is poor, it's just not good enough. No matter what it is, I'm sure there are many more films of this sort that are just garbage. That may be the only reason why I was so amazed to see that this movie made it. If you are stupid enough, you'll pass it off as stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had the chance to read this, I would say I liked it but it wasn't very funny.  As a result, I decided to stay away from the movie. I was very disappointed at the way the characters acted and behaved in it. This was especially disappointing since this film seemed so naive. It was just a waste of money to have seen it.  I was interested to see how Michael Bay directed this film, and I was disappointed that it was only half an hour. The special effects are terrible. I have never seen a movie with horrible special effects. The plot and visuals were pretty good, though, with a simple disclaimer.  If you liked "The Running Man", I can't recommend this film to you but, if you didn't like it, you won't like this one either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many things wrong with this film, but I guess it's good that the film was so badly filmed. But I think this is one of the worst ever films that I've seen. And that's not to say that it's not very good. But the fact that this is a bad film in no way justifies it. You can't be a great writer or a great director if you make a bad comedy film: It's no different from acting mistakes. It just doesn't happen. The film was awful. The direction was awful, the script was terrible, the shots were terrible, and the special effects were terrible. The fact that it took a lot of talent and effort to make a film like this, I can't say that they had a very good plan. The story is very vague. It's just bad in general. If you want to watch this for entertainment it is too long and the acting is too weak, which can't explain why it was filmed in such horrible conditions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this is the worst movie that I've ever seen. It's just the kind that made you feel like they really have made something. It made you dislike every movie that had the word "movie" in it. Just to think you'd like this show more in a movie: "Movies". I guess if you had been made into a show that was so horrible that it made you love movies: they would be like that.  This movie had nothing to do with any story.  There's nothing interesting in the plot, nothing interesting. It just doesn't have any semblance of meaning. And it just doesn`t have much to do.  The plot was just so bad that I didn't feel I should watch it. I've never watched a movie that has such bad plot either. I'll probably never be watching one again.  It does make you laugh. But it makes you grim. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to say that I have seen this movie once before. As a teenager, it was one of the worst movies ever made, and I never enjoyed it after the first time. I thought I was stupid as a teenager because I sat through the whole movie and thought it wasn't interesting. In this movie, it's about a bunch of teens who want to break out with a girl who has made a pact with them.  There are some characters involved in the movie that you know are completely unbelievable (such as the girl who was with her sister at a different time in the film). It just doesn't have any heart or purpose to the plot whatsoever. The plot isn't even remotely interesting or anything that will interest you. You don't even learn anything.   But if you're going to see this movie and make the effort, don't see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So what if the story of the movie was good? Not sure why, but it sure didn't help. Even the most predictable plot (not so simple as it might be) got lost and the movie ended up getting ridiculous. There was something that came to the plot that didn't quite make sense. The characters looked so ridiculous it wasn't quite right. And there wasn't really anything more satisfying than the fact that people were suffering in their own lives and having their minds hurt. There wasn't enough to make the story worth going into. The end was even worse. Not only that, but the plot was so badly written it was hardly worth watching.  I can't blame people for skipping this horrible movie, but I can say I did. I wish they were making the sequel the way I originally knew they would. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So I won't say this one is bad because it's better than any one of the movie "Pietroffel" but it is bad for me. This is not a movie for kids, it's a movie that people watch with their children and just watch them like teenagers - stupid at times - while you're enjoying watching this stuff with your children and you end up thinking that the movie is too dumb to have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know. I just find it hard to find the original one. There are some comments from other reviewers about this movie. It's like watching some sort of porn for kids. I'm sorry I didn't pick the "right" movie. I didn 'The Secret Lover" for this one. I think I made that choice. The movie was probably supposed to be a comedy, but if this was supposed to an adventure, it's not that great. I also couldn't figure out the characters who would be portrayed by these people. The director wanted to show how people could help each other, but they were never shown. The dialog wasn't very creative, the characters were pretty shallow, and the scenes didn't even go very deep.    For those who are looking for something funny, or for something to look at, this might be a decent film. Unfortunately, it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is one redeeming trait of the "Pistrokorin" that has failed to impress me. The first installment of the series is as predictable as the genre. This second installment, though, is the opposite of "Pristrok". Instead of creating a new character who just got started, the producers instead creates a weak, yet irritating character who has no reason whatsoever to exist.  If you want to avoid watching "Pikorin", I suggest the sequel to the original and then watch the second installment of "Nerebel". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad, just bad, I mean really bad. The only thing that kept me watching it was the wonderful cameo by the wonderful Jonny Gochis. I am sorry to say that his cameo was bad in a bad way, but I didn't even bother to watch his cameo, and it was all I could do without watching the whole film.  If you liked Jonny, you'd like it to be a bit better. If you didn't like Jonny. You would prefer if the movie had a lot more dialog and a more interesting story. If it had an even story. Maybe you would enjoy a bit more. It does not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise was interesting but it failed to connect with the story. It felt like a cheap movie. We get bored after twenty minutes of watching the premise and we are left feeling sick. This is the reason that I gave this movie 3 stars. The premise couldn't have been more convoluted than a few minutes of video from the movie. The first hour was boring and we finally got to see a scene. I would never get bored. I am really disappointed that a movie from this movie is "good" or a movie "good". The only good thing in this movie was an Oscar nomination. I just can't believe that this movie could be anything more than a big, dumb trash movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was an attempt to create a plot that would fit well with the other characters in the film. Unfortunately it doesn't do so. That is why I was so annoyed with it. I am one of those people who get so mad at people who make a movie that they will go to see it if they want to. And if they do, I will never watch the movie. If you are like me, I'd never see this movie if you wanted to see something as interesting as it actually happens. The fact that it lacks a plot makes this one a bad one. This is also about as low as a movie can be, but sadly even worse than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a film made by Charles Hallett and his partner, I thought it was a good idea. However, it didn't work. It's just the worst film ever made. A big, stupid comedy that shows that there is no real life, that people just want to take money from other people's money. That is the main problem. The plot does not have a storyline that connects with the real world, which it tries to imitate, and is mainly concerned with how the film makes itself look at the real. A lot of scenes, like the fight scene with the car being stuck, are extremely fake and stupid, and nothing really happens. A couple of scenes in the movie, including a guy getting shot by a sniper (actually a sniper), are not even supposed to make any sense to anybody else. If you see this movie, it makes no sense whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a horrible film. I know when a movie is "stup, stup, and stup", I'm not going to laugh anymore.  The film seemed to go on forever and ended in an endless loop. I was expecting a film that would be hilarious at some point and that it would be a fun one to see. But the whole idea of a film like this is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest disappointment I've ever seen. The plot is bad, the characters are awful, the cinematography is amateurish and the story is so stupid that it's not even funny. Even when I like some of the humour in the film, it's just awful. I don't even know what to do with this "super hero" crap. It's so bad that I had to stop watching it and I was disappointed that this movie got a 10 in a bad category. I was a little surprised to hear that it actually got an 8 out of 10 at one of the other sites. That's crazy! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I've ever seen that I have never gotten to watch. What is it that we see and how did they film it? The first time I watched this movie was an hour-and-half an hour after I got the DVDs. It's very difficult to watch the movie. It can be that annoying but it's really hard to watch it. I mean, the dialog is so awful, I don't care how I end up watching the movie anymore. It doesn't even make sense, like how many people you could die in one day. The film's title is "The Evil Clown" not "Tennis the Clown". The movie is so bad I couldn't care less what I watch. This movie's title gives away what it's about. A funny joke is no joke in itself. It was very predictable, so there is no reason for it to continue and I will never understand what you're going to do in it. The only good thing is the musical performance, but the whole movie is very poorly written, stupid, boring and dumb. What a waste of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The People" is an atrocious waste of a film with no redeemable qualities or any merit. In fact, the characters are all the same boring and unimaginative as they were in "The Hangover" which I believe has been a much better film. The story is about some college students who try to get into the mind of one of the victims of the Columbine massacre and the movie itself seems to have been pulled from the very same soap opera the writer had previously written. The plot is predictable and revolves around the idea of a serial killer. The film is a horrible mix of the "Dead End Ideas" and "Bad Movie 2" that just don't come close to the two other films in which the writer of "Bad movie 2" had directed. "The people" is a bad attempt at a movie with all of the same flaws, and unfortunately is the only movie I have ever heard that deserves to be remembered for its lack of merit. I don't have much sympathy for this film. However, if you are looking for a better movie, you can rent "Bad film 1" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those bad movies that has absolutely no redeeming qualities. If your standard was that it must have been made with the intention of killing your child or something, that was probably true. But this was obviously made with an effort to create a pseudo-mature version of a high-grade film. The premise is that the film shows that a good guy kills you because he was a big time gangster and you need to know this is false. The film is bad because it portrays the real world (and the real villain) as being a very simple-minded and petty mobster, where the "heroes" are people that actually don't have very much in them. And since there is no real "hero", it's a case of being blind to the reality. In the first scene, the mobster looks at a woman's breasts and says, "So that's what I thought it was." It's a bad idea that to be that kind of man would not be a man, but an idiot. He then says, 'And you just happen to have a nice face'. What? It's all over. He's right, you should have to go out and see a different movie with a totally different theme. The ending was totally stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it was my only hope, I would say I have suffered through more movies with bad acting and a poor script than with this.  There are many reasons that this film is poor, but let's face it, there are many good actors.  One of the actors I don't understand. The scene where "the man in the room" was introduced to a group of people is really funny, but then it suddenly becomes silly and annoying when the guy asks "Who was at the dance with him?" The man's supposed to have gone into the bathroom and come back to the man's apartment when he was at his house.  For example, how did the woman go to the dance at the end of the movie and what was she wearing? I don of course know what happened to the woman and why she got up that dance, but I can't tell what happened, and I still can't find the guy to help her out.  This movie is the worst I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest disappointment of a movie. The script was awful. I was looking forward to seeing the series coming out, but I am not a fan of this genre. I have seen this show only once, and that was one of the least successful episodes I have ever seen. I mean I saw The Rock with Robert Downey Jr. that was much better. The main character seems to be a child who has died or is in the hospital suffering from a car accident, and the movie starts to move into that territory, but then you find yourself left on the bus to another train and you realize that it's not really going to end that well. I've always enjoyed seeing Michael J. Lipglass and John Michael Bennett, but this movie just leaves you feeling like they made another stupid movie, with a bunch of kids that are in a car going on some crazy plot. When you find that car, you can probably go on to a movie that does a better job on the plot, but it just doesn't have a plot. I really wonder what's going to happen. How long do we have to wait? I know that I saw "The Rock" with Robert and his friends last year, and it actually seems to have gotten much better, and this movie does a pretty good job with that. But I think you don't have to care if Michael J Lipglass is still in the movie. If he is, you might like that one instead. This is just a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. Its just like a 'Star Trek' episode. A 'Star Wars' film, but worse than one of the other three Star Trek movies that are out there, or the movies of that series, I think. I am absolutely certain that this is the beginning of the end, and I'm not sure what the last one is. I don't care about any other movie with a title like that one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's OK to say that the film is just plain bad - but it sure was the last film to have any real momentum. This one is a case of absolute stupidity - the fact that this film was the best film of the decade with some minor victories. There are no real highlights, except the one that occurred during the last 30 minutes of the movie. The acting was bad, but there were parts that made me gasp - and the storyline seemed to have some merit to some extent. But this was an awful way to look into the film, and it just doesn't have any value whatsoever. It was almost like watching a poorly filmed "My Wish", and nothing worth. It's sad that it came out as such a bad film - but I think that's OK because it's an OK movie in the summer. It just isn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so weak it has to be the worst film I've ever seen. The story lines are so unbelievable I can't believe it had a script. The acting is so bad that the director is so un-mindful that the audience doesn't realize she's trying to make an extremely weak film. The camera is so poorly composed, the dialog is so poor and the music is just OK so bad it made me jump a couple times. If you see this film, you should avoid watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went out on a bad day to watch this and the first thing I saw was what I would expect to see on the back of a DVD. I found it disgusting. I'm not the kind of person who would willingly watch anything that wasn't from a movie I can actually watch. I can't see how I'd like this movie. I am not gonna be paying for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is based on a few famous quotes from Dr. Tylov. The main character was a former Israeli soldier. This was made in a pretense to justify a movie about a fictional movie: i.e. the movie was supposed to be a historical documentary on the Jewish Holocaust. However, the fact that it was not historical is irrelevant. The fact that Tylakov is the only one who is mentioned in the movie speaks for itself. On the contrary, most other historical quotations are ignored or buried. The movie was obviously made to be an insult to the real Jewish people. It had no serious connection with Jewish history, especially to the Palestinians.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest problem with this movie is that it lacks any significant plot whatsoever whatsoever and is just a bunch of guys hanging around in the woods, looking at pictures of pictures, thinking of pictures of other pictures and talking about them, all of which are absolutely pointless. I was looking at the pictures on the boards and saw what was happening. One guy was talking about a picture, the next one talked about a movie, then another one started talking about himself, and then another person had a couple of pictures about his life and ended up talking about it with other people. A couple of people showed a couple with a couple more people than the guy in the group. Then you get the "A" picture, a couple people showing the "I" picture and then finally you get a couple pictures showing a couple different pictures, all about the same pictures, and I have to say, the funny thing about it is that in one of the pictures, one of them was wearing the same kind of dress and another one was wearing a red suit, while another guy was wearing that same red suit. And to make the whole thing seem like a horror movie, one guy was holding a camera in his hand while another person took pictures with a camera and a couple other guys was holding an actual picture of himself, a movie with another guy in it.  I cannot understand what is supposed to happen. Some of the guys are hanging around the woods looking at old pictures, looking for a picture of the actual movie and a bunch more pictures and all of them are wearing the exact same costume and having the same attitude, you know what you're doing is going to be a bit silly.  But you get there. If you are bored or have a serious interest in photography or cinema arts and you like people, this is a totally useless movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen the original versions of this movie as it is now, but I do remember it being awful, in a manner of speaking, in the first few days.  After the initial shock of the whole thing, I wondered why it wasn't the first time.  In the original, the ending, a little bit better than I remember it, was really, REALLY awful, but somehow, in retrospect, it was still OK. The acting wasn't as bad as it sounded at the time, and it didn't do any better for the characters.  The end had to have a great ending, because the original was one of the most disappointing endings. The reason I didn't care so much for the ending was that it wasn`t a finale for the movie itself, but rather, it served as the opening of the movie with just what happened during the movie.  This movie was only around the beginning of its production, and I thought it had to be closer to the original. It had no closure. It didn`t make any sense, and even if it was a true ending, it didn`T make any real sense, as it did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What makes the film so bad is that it is about the time that the people were forced to find out that they were in fact robots, as they have their own lives that they didn't want to live in.  I can't help but feel that they put this whole thing in a completely absurd way to help their ratings, and there isn't a lot of truth in this case. They even admit that these robots, like the robots that they made, are robots that are being hunted for their meat and not doing their job. That isn't exactly what I had in mind, and it just seems like they tried to make it into a movie to entertain something, and instead it just makes a terrible mess of the film. They really should be more responsible for these movies.  If you liked the first one, I definitely recommend watching it over again, and if you don't then you shouldn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Book Of Life" is a horrible piece of trash that does not even deserve to be made into a movie! The story is utterly devoid of any original value whatsoever. The cast of characters is extremely poor. The filmmakers were so unentertained in their craft that they were really an exercise in watching these two guys try to pretend they had written their characters as a result of being forced to improvise the story. The plot of "The BOOK OF LIFE" is about a guy named Matthew who falls in love with a girl and falls in a coma after being robbed of her money by a gangster (who has previously been in prison for crimes against the State) and who has become addicted to heroin (and has also lost his money). While we are looking at the story, we begin to see his hallucinations, hallucinations, and insanity. He is then forced into spending a lot of money to get his girlfriend back. Once she is returned, he starts to get involved in the gang-gang-drug mafia. He then tries to get into with some criminals by being involved in a drug smuggling case, but is caught in a car by them. He tries to evade his pursuers by giving them false information, but ends up getting caught. He starts talking to some other criminals, but all of his friends keep dying because he is caught, and he is eventually sent to prison for murder. After he is released, he runs into another car, and a pair of cops try to find him but don't help him. Once he is back in a jail, he tries to escape again by giving his family to help him get out, but he gets caught in the car and is told to stay there. We are left with an ominous feeling that the movie could have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is only a few minutes longer than the previous entries, and is far worse than the "Journey To The Moon", with better direction, better acting and a better storyline. The best thing about this is that it looks like the movie that everyone other looks at when choosing a movie: "The Cabin", "Trucks", "Shaft", "Laneman". If you're lucky enough to be chosen by Disney and this movie is released, you can easily just watch the first one and not wait for it to come out. Even I'd like to see the story but, if you want a movie that you can just get, you don't.  The plot is awful, it's bad enough that there's so little screen time and so little dialogue.  In one of his movie's more scenes, I think he should have made the camera work in an art gallery instead of the scene where the girl is holding the hand of the guy.  Overall, "Sick Squevens", with a similar story, would be a more good movie with less acting and better writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible, this was probably the only movie I have ever seen. I never understood why this movie was so bad. And I never really liked it after seeing it. I thought it was just a lot of cheap looking junk and a bad plot, but I actually liked a lot more of the story, and I really didn't care what was going on in this movie. And all I wanted was a movie that wasn't quite like the movie I thought I was going to see. So I can't really blame the production for this movie, unless my heart suddenly stopped working when I saw it. But I would like to make it up for the fun of watching garbage like this. But in the end I can only really sympathize with the actors. I'm not sure why they acted so badly, I don't know how they acted as if they're talented, but it's just sad that it's so hard to act. This is all too bad for this reason, the actors that I loved so much should stay away from the movies and make other movies instead of playing. Maybe they will try a comedy, like a show like A Love Story for a movie: "Where's the kids?" I really hope that they will see something like that and try it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, for the sake of a second, deserves a title:  I watched it in an hour and forty minutes. It was painfully slow, and, as usual, it seemed pretentious. I never even knew that I had actually been watching it. It seems like you don't know how to act. It's no real plot. The characters were just supposed to act like normal people. But they seemed to like the same kind of character that you might see in a slasher movie: the killer is the same person that you just met, but also was very annoying. The only reason to watch this movie was just because I was curious to learn more about it. I'm glad that someone cared to create it, but it's not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only can I say, I can't believe that this was made. There is nothing interesting. Just boring, predictable and not amusing. If you are a serious film fan, this is not worth your time, and I'm afraid that it's so bad that I won't see it again.   I have to admit that I was very intrigued to see director Michael Condon. The film seems like a typical European-themed film and I thought it would be amusing to see him in one of his many films. But then you get a little taste and realize that this has nothing that you really care about and can't afford.  I tried looking for it on the net but I couldn't find it anywhere on my list.  The acting in this film is awful and it is a total rip-off of a very poor movie. The characters are very little in that direction and they are not believable. For that matter, what are the other two people who gave this film such credibility? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really bad movie. It is a typical action-adventure movie with a weak story, lousy acting and ridiculous CG scenes. The plot is very good but poor performances make the movie seem empty. A bad film is usually like the movie The Matrix or Die Miser (see The Matrix and its sequels) but with a little more effort. But, I have to admit that the sequel to this movie is actually better. The Matrix movies are better because it has more special effects. I like that. The movie is not interesting but it is too long. I can't make this up. The film tries to make this movie a little bit better by having a very dark color scheme for the characters and a very strong, but weak main character. And this movie tries to bring the characters into a dark world but doesn't succeed. The only good part is the very good lighting effects. Unfortunately this movie was not great either. The ending is predictable and it is not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie only to see if it was going to be a good one. This is the only movie that I had seen in the previous 15 years that I think should never be shown to anybody. I had my expectations. It doesn't, even though it tries to take place in the late 1960s-early 1970s, like its namesake, "The Twilight Zone" does. It just seems to be completely devoid of any real value to the viewing. In fact, I think it's a rip-off of "The Three Little Foys". If that show was in production at the time, it would've been another brilliant and funny movie, instead of being just plain old dumb. The plot is pretty bad and I wonder how any one could even think that "Star Trek" would have been much more popular than the movie of the same name, which has its own plot. The movie seems to drag on. It's so bad, I can only hope that it's just a bad joke, and nothing that it deserves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen other films and movies that are actually better than this piece of trash and this is the only one. The ending was very confusing and the story was very poor and the ending was predictable and so we didn't enjoy watching the rest. I found the story very boring. It is very similar to "The Mask", where we see some of the villains (in this case, one person) in a mask to kill some of his victims but the only way we saw was that it was one person.  This is just a bad waste of talent and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The scene in which the actors were shown are not quite original. Even the most gifted actors would not have thought to do so and most of the scenes involving the stars were badly written. The movie is bad. The ending is too predictable. The only good part is the ending. The other parts are very good and even the bad parts have some good scenes. I really think that the producers just used this as a cheap movie. The idea that everyone is going to like it is just absurd. I would not even pay $10 for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big question in this film is how much is lost. It's not clear. What's obvious is that the script writers never intended to reveal the truth. They were more than clever. The premise has got to be the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It should be called "Pipidiyakas."    The film doesn't even have a decent title. They couldn't find the name of a movie in the book. What was it?   My take on it is that it should never be seen. The acting is bad. The directing isn't good. The only good part is the direction. It looks like they used a camera that was made in the Soviet era, not from a video camera.  The plot is weak. The ending, at least good in some parts, is interesting, but not the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely useless in terms of plot and it was really badly done by the casting. The acting was flat and a lot of it seemed to be written by an idiot. I won't repeat the plot, but rather a whole lot of terrible stuff. I didn't care for the ending at all, even the most disappointing of the cast members. Also, I didn`t understand the premise. I have never seen the big deal with God because it didn`T make any sense. The whole plot was a waste of time. I give it 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are really terrible. They are not bad but not great. The story is pretty good but the film is awful. It can only be described as a waste of time in a cinema. The characters are really bad and the film only moves when scenes are played. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad I decided to pass it off as a comedy and try to take it seriously. I felt more like I was in a cave and I even felt that the story was too hard and the characters were poorly drawn and the plot wasn't too good either. I also couldn't find any movie to compare. The movie was a total waste of time and I felt that it wasn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Devil's Grims" is the sequel to the "DU-16" from "The Menace" movie with the title "D&D". This movie, although the title and "Mandraay" is used, is actually just a repeat from the "Mandaay" movie that is actually made to look like a movie. They put a different name on the film but they call it, "DUR", which is really ridiculous. At the beginning, it has a lot of ridiculous humor that doesn't come from a serious movie.  There is nothing new and nothing funny. It's very predictable. Also, the plot isn't very creative. In fact, it doesn't have much in the way of entertainment and it has nothing new. It doesn't even make much sense. Also the story is just the usual villain. And the fact that they can do the thing they do in "The Mask" in such a short time, and then shoot some scenes for "The Master Hunter" is just horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that is the least interesting movie I have seen in quite some time.  There are only 1, 2, and 4 (the four sequels) and I have never seen anything like this.  As a writer, it is not like you would expect to find a memorable plot. The script is just dull and meaningless. The scenes are boring, the characters are not convincing. The acting is just flat. I do not know what to do with this boring plot.  This movie does not provide the sort of "comedy" experience that most people get in a comedy series. But then it is amusing for the most boring movie that I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a waste of wasted effort. While being a bit of fun, it failed utterly. This is an attempt to make a decent film about a ridiculous crime. If the filmmaker had any idea about making a film that would be interesting, he might use it instead of watching it.  The ending is disappointing. There are too many scenes and not enough characters, most of which are just filler. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible waste of even the slightest of the talent on this film. No matter what you're thinking about in this movie, it's not going to make you smile.  This was the only film I've ever seen where there is no connection to any character or idea whatsoever. When is that even possible in a movie where there are no connection?  It was so bad that I was even tempted to call it my "favorite movie" and not put it on top of my lists.  Please make this movie not an exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's painful to see this movie in the UK when it is trying to pretend to be a documentary. While the plot is simple and the acting is OK, it is so poor that it is really hard to forgive it. It isn't hard to understand why this movie was made. It's just a pile of bad lines, nothing new and nothing good. The biggest culprit is the script. The main plotline is probably the best line and only a couple of line. But the rest of the script is completely irrelevant to the movie (and the movie ends up not knowing anything about the character of the main protagonist or heroine). The movie is really just a collection of scenes that are only about the main character and nothing else.  If you want a movie that is about human interactions, it would be a better one. But this is an awful way to make one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is the worst of the film in the entire run of the movie. Aside from a very weak, extremely weak performance by the leads, this film is about as bad as anything I've seen in a movie. Some actors are so bad, and others are so good, that they shouldn't be allowed to act on anything. I'm not saying that they are bad, because the actors are OK and the overall message is good, but if they're allowed to play, they should be the same as "Daggers", or even "Muriel", because the acting would be much better. This is a film that, by the way, is so bad that you'd never even find it in a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie at a store for rent, it had no plot, no direction, no acting, no plot-plot-plot, and no plot (the movie is about a small family that is attacked by the local police). The story is very simple, with a few "residents" dying by their neighbors, a few women, a guy, a little girl, a bunch of guys that, as expected, are killed by a killer... This movie is so terrible, it has no point, only the lack of suspense makes it even worse. The first 2 minutes are boring. The last 5 minutes are incredibly stupid. Even the plot, which is an obvious joke, manages to make up for the rest of it.  This is not a horror movie, but it is no horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a film called "The Housewives of Arkansas". I can't believe this is a real movie. Its nothing like a real "housewives" film and I think the producers might be a little bit drunk. There's too many stupid lines, such as the "Lugged" comment which just ruins the whole movie. This film has absolutely no suspense. There are no story line. The only thing that works is the acting, which has been severely overdressed and badly edited. I give this film a 10, it is too predictable to make me laugh. The film would have been much better if it had a plot. This is a completely terrible, stupid, over-acted film. The story is probably based on something I had read in a real book, I won't know how. If the filmmakers wanted to portray a real family of women who are just on the side of society, they would do a movie about them as one would think, rather than having just a bunch of stupid, useless women with nothing except an annoying couple who believe everything in themselves. I cannot believe that this is real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is basically a story about a man (name Jim) and a woman (name Tara) who have a complicated and convoluted relationship with each other. As Jim, we just don't know her. Tara is a beautiful woman, but has the tendency to disappear from her life. He's convinced she's missing (not all the time) and wants to get a "forever friend". We never see her again and she only gets a handful of dates and a few dates that do not really go anywhere. So what happens after Tara leaves? We never find out and just watch as the two start off on a date that doesn't last long. The ending is even worse than the rest of the movie, because it just starts with a car crash and Jim takes off to the desert to meet someone who has a horse named "Elie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has such low intelligence to waste your time watching it and such a dreadful ending I'm afraid it will never get past the box office. If you want a movie that can save you life please watch this one, or any of the other dumb movies made by the same producer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is basically an attempt to make films that are both predictable and dumb. There was a fine line to make in this film and it didn't, in the end. I didn't like the fact that most of the film is taken from the book and the actors are just as dumb as the characters in the book, so the film just leaves it in a completely disappointing way. The problem is that it has been written about many times, so you can make a guess about the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not really sure which part is the worst: "The Dead" is awful, unless you're a zombie fan. The fact that a zombie made up to date in the original book is now a cult film and we can't believe that this will ever be a successful one. The acting is painfully bad in a way that makes the zombie look like he's just walking through a mall and then walking through some other scenes. The original writer, Mark Douglas Hamilton, apparently tried to get his idea back on the screen. But he can't tell a negative story about a zombie zombie. I've seen many zombie films in the past, but this is the most depressing one I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no plot. What a plot is it.  The plot is to save the town, but everyone is dead in the end of the film.  This is a cheap movie that is just trying to make money. A lot of money was spent on this movie, but I don't think this movie was worth it. For the sake of money, you can find this in a store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so weak it's funny, but it just doesn't go for me. The most annoying thing about this movie is the annoying fact that they just couldn't find a decent girl. I mean I don't know if there is a good girl out there, but I will be the person that decides whether or not to be a movie girl. The movie is pretty boring and only uses some jokes, but you'll never have fun watching it. The fact that it doesn't involve much is annoying too. It's just a couple of scenes and a few scenes, and most of them are just one-liners. Maybe a movie that will appeal to women, and those guys might be in a better place with the script than the others. It should have been a real movie, with more interesting and interesting people and less annoying crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife (also) was a huge fan of the show and really liked the idea of her to have an animated show set in the kitchen (as an example of the bad things i saw in this movie). But when i got the script for this, i couldn't find the words to write about the horrible show. The movie I am watching is called "Lazy Neighbors", and there is no way to find it on DVD. I am very grateful to me that the writer, a young one with a very naive and totally ignorant mindset, was the person who thought he had a show that would help with the idea. How did he think that people would care about this show? A lot of people don't seem to. And the story line is that some people really can't handle this show. That was supposed to be one of the most important aspects of the movie (like a family sitcom), but when it comes to showing these shows, they're not even remotely entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a complete rip-off of the original Terminator franchise, only worse IMMEDIALLY worse IMMERSATELY worse than the original. It looks like a copy of another mediocre movie but worse to me personally. In a nutshell, this movie is terrible, not a very good copy.  The story is mostly a simple one-two, which gives me the impression that they had made Terminator 2 without even real-world knowledge. The story itself is predictable and the action is pretty poor. And the plot really sucks. The characters are dumb and the movie is pretty slow.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a bunch of people taking a bunch about a very poorly written movie that isn't that good, but it has enough charm and some interesting things to make the boring part enjoyable. But the premise is so bad it doesn't even make any sense, unless you're looking for a little inspiration.  Just watch the episode of "The Wizard" when you get the chance, the plot is pretty good, and the characters are reasonably interesting, but don't let too much of the movie sink you down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not sure what the writer meant to write this book, but it's like watching one of the worst American films I have ever seen. It's like seeing some of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, but this one was bad at best. This isn't a matter of what you know, or what you think, of this movie, but of what it looks like. There are people who think that this is the most important film of the late 20th century. I suppose, since it's so bad, it's probably one of those rare films that people like to see. What are they doing? I'd be really curious if they thought this was anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film made a lot of mistakes. It felt like a rip-off of a documentary which was made in the early 1970s. It's obvious that these films are not very sophisticated.  As a documentary this isn't all that bad. But it's so bad, it hurts to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I went to a movie theater that was at a movie convention in New York City and saw the film about a young girl in the movie, and it had some good parts, but I just couldn't believe that it's the worst movie I've ever seen. If there were even a few minutes to get her alone, that's the movie would get a few good points. She had the only person who could have given her an interesting role in this movie. I don't remember what happened, but some way, I believe that she had a boyfriend who was more than an obnoxious guy. Her boyfriend made her so jealous that she was convinced she'd be killed, but she just couldn`t give me enough money to make her kill myself. It wasn`t really that bad, but in the worst example of the film, there are lots of plot holes and there is only one person who can make the girl want to be killed. The story is totally predictable, with nothing that could have been even been in the story. I gave the movie a 8, but that was too much, even for a movie with a cast. I'd really been looking forward to the movie but unfortunately, I just can't say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major flaw of this movie is that it tries to come off as a film about murder and murder (but then you see what it is). For a plot, it fails to deliver.  For example, the "real" part of the movie tries to explain why people would kill a person and then try to justify it. This is a totally naive attempt, but the plot is so weak that it doesn't work.  There is nothing to help this plot beyond some sort of supernatural element that is supposed to solve the mystery.  So far from being a true mystery, the characters act like the typical low-budget movies about murder (the "Cidery" example), and this film is so bad it doesn`t have enough plot to make up for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see this movie: i'm a big fan of Michael Raffin and his movies in the past, but this one is the worst i've seen in a while. He just takes one idea and it ends up in a mess.  The acting is also terrible. The story is basically about a person named, "The Wizard" and a girl named "The Witch" and they become "the real people". In a way, this is a very funny idea in the sense that people make things to imitate. But this is not funny, it is just sad. This was really bad. My other complaints: the music is too loud, the dialog is too slow and the dialogue is bad. If you are going to see a movie: go away and leave immediately. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a girl who discovers a couple of serial serial killers and goes to investigate them. The movie isn't too complicated, but it's very, very, slow. While this is definitely a bad film, it has the annoying "B" label on it. For whatever reason, it's simply boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was bad, the storyline was ridiculous and the cinematography sucked, the sound quality was poor and the editing was terrible. This is a terrible movie and I am surprised to learn how many people loved this movie.  The title was a joke because it was stupid and no story. A simple plot is hard to write, especially when it's directed by a director who has nothing else to do but make meaningless films, and this is one of the biggest stupid movies i have ever seen. It's like a movie made by the director of something like an absurd story and this movie does not even resemble the message it intends to communicate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a reason why the original series of "Kano" was such a b-movie - there is some connection with the actual events of the "Kojis!" film. But what happens is that they turn into a horror flick, where everything seems to be happening to every person, and that just leaves the whole thing completely meaningless. The storyline is about a girl (played by Jiroio Melo) being kidnapped by the CIA (played in the original film by the excellent actor Richard Belrooney), and it's just not terribly interesting - the film seems to rely on some simple assumption that everyone must have been in the right to save the world. And they're not the least interesting of the several things they depict. A plot that is so shallow that it doesn't work, isn't even really believable, and the story about a young girl losing her virginity to a man who is supposed to be in charge of a CIA training camp is pretty unbelievable. They just can't be funny.  But then there are other parts of the film that just make no sense whatsoever, like the fact that all of the characters in the film have either disappeared or have died (not even a simple case, just a sad accident or murder) with the result being some vague closure to a mystery. And there's no way to keep the mystery up.   In the original "Kotobachi", there was a lot more to it. I'm really curious to know how this has changed, since there are many films that do a lot better than Kano. I know that because it is one of the oldest Japanese films I've ever seen (and of course, that's because it's an old genre) I can assure you that it didn't get much better, and I'm sure that's why. The original one had a good plot, even if they changed the whole premise (or even removed it all together) because the main character (Jiro Mori) was a nice, charismatic female who was obviously in charge and had something to do with it. It had an interesting twist on the murder, and it had a lot of action - the way it looked like it had been done by Mori and her friend to her. But this wasn't the only reason why I don't think this is a good film. You can see it's pretty close to the end there are some major plot twists that just can be explained away, but the movie isn't very good either -
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got turned off the first time I watched this movie. Not because I don't remember this movie being a classic! It is not, I think, anything like, but it is just a piece of trash from the early 1960s. Some guy in a mask is having sex and then he dies.  What really happened in this film is that you can't tell what is happening because the person who dies is so obviously fake.  I just kept watching this movie and it didn't help me at all. It is just too much like a cheap knock off of The Magnificent Escape, or The Naked Mile, or Whatever was Coming Up. The actor playing the part of "Johnny" is supposed to be a real person, but that he was just a fake. He is the only way it makes any sense.  The plot is OK but the ending was extremely bad. I didn't understand it, because I have seen a lot of people watching this film and I think it doesn't have to be 100% realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so awful that it becomes hilarious and the story drags on for 50 minutes, without a reason. It's very basic, but it's so bad that you can't watch the entire movie. I didn't even take it seriously. It was just an excuse to try to find something else to do. It wasn't worth watching this movie. But, for some reason, I wanted it to end. I still wanted to find a movie to watch, but I can't say why. If you're a cynic, this movie is not worth wasting your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was pretty horrible...The only redeeming good thing that this movie had in the end was that it was interesting and entertaining, but the whole thing was just an ugly piece of trash. The plot was a bit more interesting than the movie it made, but really only because it was a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a dreadful film directed by the least talented director in Hollywood history. The characters are bland and the scenes are pretty boring. The movie was boring. I don't know whether the director knew what he was going to do with this movie. It is difficult to believe that this film would be considered a comedy when the movie was not even an amusing. I would highly recommend watching the "Man" movies with Michael C. Scott to see how far the makers of the original films have come in today. This movie was very poorly directed. It was not a comedy at all, and the story lacked a sense of humor. In fact, it's a lot like the first one and it's not funny. The film didn't help with its premise or cast either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had read the book and had some doubts at the book, and though the book was a really good idea, it wasn't quite so good. The movie's logic is just stupid. Its an idea that people believe are true so, you'd have to believe it's true. I mean, they'd have had to believe that the people in the book were really in a remote, isolated area - in order to make it plausible that people would try to leave the country to the United States (so the movie was in a similar location and no one knew who had killed them.) Now, after the fact that the murders had been conducted by agents in the US and that the killer would be a US citizen, what does the killer do if he doesn't have to leave at the first point (which would be pretty easy). The killer would go back to the US as a refugee, so if he killed the US citizens who had been living in the remote areas who had the best chance to escape the US's violence. And his first target would be the people who had helped to escape and had been so good at escaping the US violence, but if he had to kill the US population he would have to do a lot more. The killings must have been done in order for the US to have avoided getting to the bottom of the case of US-KIDIT. If there were people in that area who had had help from the US, who had done a good job, he would surely have killed many people. But if he kills those people in his home, it's his fault, since he couldn't leave anything behind.  Now, it was true that the victims had been safely sheltered from US violence all the time, so I guess that they might have had some kind of security to keep their lives alive. And there wouldn't have been any place in his house for him to do that. Well, it turns out that the US government's security is really good. Why would he risk his life to leave that house? I don't know. He seems to be the type of person who would take advantage of the US Government to get away from the violence that his country had done itself a decade ago and would have done just the same thing. So if you had to do the same trick he might have ended up in a bad situation.  If you're a guy who gets a job as a police officer, you might think that you're the kind of person that would see
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the comments on this movie and saw this movie just as bad as I've seen many of those movies. I mean, I've read hundreds of movies and had almost zero exposure to this movie, so it really is just plain bad and dumb. The story is okay though, but it was very slow and I didn't understand any of it. I think it's just a cheap attempt to promote the movie to audiences, I don't want that. The only good thing is that it is set in a college dorm, so that's pretty good. But, it's really disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was stupid and the dialog was terrible. This movie is the kind that's used on bad movies and is no better than the 'Boom' movies such as 'Leverriding' and 'Tombstone' or 'Lakesville', but unfortunately even these two had some pretty good performances.  However the movie was just terrible. Most actors of the early 20th century were better actors and it's easy to get some actors, especially those from the '50s and '80s. There's just too much crap in it, which is bad enough that a poor plot was wasted in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film I had to stay awake until I could see the "good" movie of John Lennon (and my beloved "Beat It Like A Rockstar" documentary), but I knew better to stay in the theater.  There are only a few scenes and scenes from the previous film with Lennon where it doesn't even begin to make me uncomfortable as a "fan of Lennon." Even Lennon's scene is pretty bad when it's done in that way. They just give you a bunch of scenes with Lennon, but they give you no time to get involved. The best scene is one where Lennon's car is parked in a garage. You can see it, but you just don't get involved with it.  I'm not one of those actors who falls in love with John Lennon for anything, and he only did his one scene with Lennon. He just doesn't like them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was totally pointless, even when I was in a movie theater. The characters in this movie were flat and boring, nothing more than the average, stereotypical characters of a few old comedies.  The plot was just there to make some points. Some were interesting and some were pretty funny, but the plot was completely lacking in substance.  I don't think there was any good reason to make this movie. It's just really annoying that they put a lot of people in the film. They seem like the only thing that is worse than these horrible characters. There was a lot more material in the movie, but it just was too slow. It didn't seem like it had any purpose and I couldn't even laugh once. I think they made this movie in a few hours, but they had a lot to lose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would be a bit more curious about the film.  Its a very poorly made, amateur attempt to fill up the space on a small budget. I'm sorry to say that some of the scenes were not filmed. It was a waste of money, the casting was terrible and the camera was horrible!  I give this film a '2' because it had some very interesting ideas but was horrible when it came into the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw it on DVD in Germany and it was a disappointment to me. It was too bad to see this movie at home. And it wasn't like any of those "usual" Hollywood thriller films with suspense and a good plot. It's a big waste of time and money to me that I had to watch it. The only thing that made this movie worth seeing was the camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so horribly bad that it doesn't have any real redeeming value, it's a joke. It's not funny and the characters are stupidly written but what we get from them is the story and the plot which is completely unbelievable. I really was expecting something more interesting. I didn't even have the time to find out! I didn: "You are a great man who would have loved something more. This is so bad I don't want to waste even the time I've wasted". This is really disappointing, but if you have seen one of the better films of the 1990s, it was a very good film. It doesn't get past the most basic scenes. But it doesnn't have anything to do with the rest of the movie, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you had a clue as to where the film was coming from or what it was about, you would have been surprised to learn that it was a movie made for a movie shop and for Hollywood, in that same vein. Not only did the director and director, David Boorman, insist on making it look like an independent film, as they say, but, in all actual reality, the only "independent" feature in the film is the scene where they're looking for a new girlfriend at the same hotel. There are no new characters or scenes that make up the film. Even though the film seems to be trying to make the audience feel that they're in the movie and see scenes that will take place in the real world, the camera-cam movements are too slow and jerky to make us believe anything. I'm not sure what's causing these movements, but I can't find the director's description in the DVD cover to be very credible, as it was for any other DVD (as mentioned). It's probably the most confusing thing I've ever encountered. They're trying to create a movie that will not let you see it. It just seems like they want to keep you at a dead end before they get to the end and you get to know who's gonna be "the girl" with a new husband and you'll say, "oh, they're gonna kill the kid and that'll be the new husband", but, at the end, there's nothing new and anything is going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've ever seen. I've done a few more movies, but this is the biggest waste of time. This film was made to appear so badly by some poor actors. But it got better and better after I made some friends in the theatre and sent my wife on the set.   The other stars don't even seem like they're in their role, but they're so bad that you can almost guarantee they don't make another movie. But the acting is OK, especially with the actors who have absolutely nothing. One reason that this film made me laugh is because it can't figure out that the audience is laughing at someone who was obviously wasted.  The story is very, very bad. They obviously know nothing about the story and even the acting. The only thing that has ever been remotely good about this film was the actors. I can only assume that the director had to do something else than to put out a crappy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a big waste of "film" material. If you are really interested in watching a film from the first few minutes, I would suggest finding something else. This is a lousy piece of material that no one should even consider watching. It is just plain bad, and unfortunately has no redeeming features. If it were a horror film, you might find it scary enough to keep your interest, but it isn't. I'd suggest checking out some of the others titles on the DVD, since I'm so bored by it. It's not worth even a second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film, you're left for dead at the end of the film. The only good thing about this film is that it's just plain bad... but that it is awful, so bad that you have to just sit there and wait for it to pass the eyeballs.  What I DID see in this film... it's not worth watching or reading. It's just bad.  I just can't blame this film for having a ridiculous plot. If a movie had a plot, it'd be good. It would be a good story. But this one didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of issues with the film. One is that there is no conclusive proof that it was a real event. Some people think the whole thing was a hoax.  This is a very slow paced film with a predictable plot and an awful plot. This is not the type of movie you expect and certainly not a good one.  Also it contains a plot that simply couldn't be found anywhere and we can't find the main plot in any of the book books. Also a lot can't be verified by the book. It's like they were trying to prove a certain point but then they just decided to try to make up something that is not true.  We do have to be careful, as the movie's plot revolves around a real events, the details of which are the only way we can be sure that it happened. It isn't going to be 100% accurate as the events were detailed and only made more believable.  I think that the reason why this film was developed was because this was a plausible theory. It was certainly a believable theory and that is what happened. However, unfortunately, the theory was only so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film is nothing short of the terrible acting of the entire movie, which is why I only just recently started watching it, not because I was sick to death. Not one of the more creative things I saw in this movie, not even the acting of some of the greatest actors ever, the filmmakers obviously have nothing of their own. Perhaps the reason that I am not interested in a horror film is because the characters in this film are so bad that you are sick and tired of them and are forced to make other movies and think of yourself as a writer. In fact, I can't stand to watch such terrible acting and yet, every time the director is brought into the room to act, I get so angry with the other actors that I wonder why he can still act. At times, it just seemed like the actors had a choice between playing someone who would act in an insane manner, and someone who wouldn't act like that at all. This was painfully painful to watch. As I said, the acting is very bad. I mean, if you are really interested in horror movies, you would probably choose a horror movie over this one, but if you don't, you're better off watching one of two films: a documentary or a movie for "fun" or something similar, but not one that's been made for fun. The film is terrible, it is so poorly scripted and over directed that you can hardly call it a movie that is actually funny. Some of the characters are completely ridiculous. I do not believe anyone on this planet is a "great" actor, but this is the only movie I have ever seen where the acting went from terrible to OK. I don't blame the filmmakers for choosing to make this movie because it has so many horror classics that are not in this one but they make no excuse to be in a film that doesn't even show "real" horror or gore. They're only trying to imitate horror genre, and it's not good enough that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Last Night" is an awful movie, in no way resembling the "Prestige" movies made by the legendary French filmmaker, "Max" Dufuau. I've never seen it, and I don't care for any of the actors. They don't do any bit that is expected. There are some very strange and disturbing scenes involving a small group of people, including one very creepy little girl. I felt the film was overlong, and was disappointed that it was actually shown at a movie theater. It would have been better to show it at a French movie museum instead of showing it at the Chabot in Paris. It does give a funny feel to the movie, but I think the overall plot is weak. But the camera work was very good, with the only scene that was good in the whole movie. The story is bad in terms of pacing, and the way the story is structured. It doesn't come together nicely. It looks like nothing but a bunch of scenes in one shot with a few scenes after. A lot of scenes are left out of the movie. That's because the story doesn't go anywhere. There was no dialogue, characters, or anything else. The camera work is very disappointing. The film is not good enough to recommend at all. It can't even save the story. That is the only reason why I gave it a 7 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea is that a woman goes to meet another guy and finds herself pregnant. This is, in a nutshell, a really stupid attempt at a comedy, which isn't going for much. The actor is very good, and this was a disappointing film for me, but I'm a man who cannot believe it. There are plenty of movies that try to make a comedy about the mother who is so much of a freak that she can ruin her baby. The premise is that the son is a greedy, lying, cheating, connisterish woman who thinks he's a genius, but instead of making a joke, it just takes him over. It's just plain bad. There was an effort at a bit of humor that worked out OK, but the movie didn't work out. I cannot believe I will go on a real movie: an inept, unqualified, incompetent comedian who has nothing but talent to do anything worthwhile. It doesn't matter. The only saving grace in this movie was the actress who was obviously the best in the film. I don't even see it and don't remember what the guy said. I thought the story was good and she did make the most of her character and I thought she had done well. Unfortunately, she did not get an all out effort to make the point. I was more than annoyed by the other characters. The movie had two too many wasted moments and the story wasn't interesting enough to justify the wasted time. There is not much that can make you think this is a comedy. I'm glad to see that the movie was made so as to reflect the fact that it was a comedy and not a pretentious piece of trash, but this just wasn't the case. If it's just a comedy then you might be willing to overlook the fact the writer did it badly, but if it's supposed to be a comedy it has to be, with a lot more effort. The other funny things you'll be glad to miss. The man who won the love of a married woman is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't have a good ending - the story is completely meaningless and is full of self-destination - you know, the plot, you know it's going to be bad - but it does have a decent ending - as far as I can see, the movie doesn`T have a solid ending - if it did the story would have been good - but there are many stupid moments that make this movie even worse and it's not like I've seen the last 20.  If you can forgive me this badness I will tell you to buy the movie: forget it, and you will miss every minute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never watched a movie that I found so offensive. Not even for the characters. Why is this? What is the point? For someone who has never worked in a movie studio, it is apparent that the movie doesn't know what it does. The characters are completely oblivious to the plight of other characters. The acting is laughable and even worse. The premise was stupid. The script is terrible and the ending seemed to be an afterthought. I don't know why there was to be a plot, and the movie didn't provide any hint about where the characters will go. And if it had a plot and a character to end up in, then it would be the movie's funniest and most action-filled movie ever. But the movie isn't that. It is completely one-sided. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think this movie is a bit of a "classic" film by Disney. This isn't very good but what is really disappointing is that Disney was actually trying to make a great film. I didn't like the plot to begin with, the "evil genius" was predictable and the characters seemed to be really stupid. I was very disappointed that this movie was so much better than the original Disney movie. The acting was very poor. The supporting actors were weak but the movie wasn't much better. The overall plot seemed to fall apart. It's an idea that the villain will turn the heroes into slaves and thus "destroy" the heroes so that the "good" movie would be a "reversed" movie. I have the same problem with this movie as the "Good" Movie of 2008's "Honey the Wind" or "Frozen in London". I think the idea of the movie has some merit. It would have been better if Disney did something to this in the original form. It isn't even in the same form as "The Little Princess" or the original Little Princess movies. But unfortunately this movie failed in its own way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those terrible films that I am afraid to see. It is about a woman whose father, with a bad heart, kills her mother and steals her three daughters.  The plot seems to be a clever way of going into the details, but the story lacks much substance. There's no depth beyond the basic plot, the characters don't get enough screen time, and the acting is so bad that it's hard to believe that someone can act as so terrible. The film is like a bad attempt at a vampire drama.   The film was filmed using a small handheld camera. It's a bad sign that the film was going to be anything like what I thought it was. It was just a bunch of guys in a car trying to get a small camera onto the camera to make something like a movie, when it became a film made about a dead woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In terms of its structure, this movie could have been a comedy with some twists. But the movie turned into a farce - a far, far, totally pointless piece of crap. The story revolves around a group of guys who steal some valuable car and get it back again. There's some kind of villainy story going on, but no one is really believable. There are some scenes where the bad guys were obviously drunk and doing drugs, and the only time we felt like the movie was when a group on the street was smoking in their front room. And in the end there was an unbelievable twist ending that is basically just a big gusso! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed at the title of this movie, but then I had to watch it and then I saw it over 10 times to make it a true horror movie. The acting is terrible. The camera is terrible, but the acting is good enough, and the plot is predictable but horrible.  The characters are stupid and ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been on the side of the fence all my life. This movie is horrible, with the premise and story lines that make me believe that the entire plot was a lie. I'm not kidding: even with its "fantastical" title, the movie fails to meet even the basic requirements to a story like the book. While I understand that the book had a slightly different ending, the plot still works. The story is so muddled and one of the characters, I'm sure, isn't dead. The other two characters were, I believe, very good in the book and I would have wanted to continue with the story to a happier ending, but this film isn't even that.  I can't believe that this movie was even written. They just wrote it without a writer's guide. There is absolutely no point or explanation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was no good. It just wasn't interesting. It didn't have much of a plot or any dramatic elements. The acting was pretty terrible. It had some moments that were good. I think it's just a bad waste of money and bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was like watching a movie of a dog, and you can tell how it got wrong.  I think this is the first movie I've seen from a Disney movie that was terrible. This movie was so bad that it didn't make any sense. I had a headache as I laughed at the fact that this movie was about a man and his dog.  The plot was so dumb that you can see it coming and going and nothing happens and no answers.   If you are a fan of Disney movies, you will hate this movie.  Do not waste your time on this movie unless you need to make your own movie about a guy who wants to build a wall to stop people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very pissed off that this movie was created. It's just not my style. I can't see any reason why it should be released as a film. It is simply an embarrassment. It doesn't even show the most embarrassing situations that we do. That is a lot more pointless than what we usually see in movies, so if you really wanted to see something that you should see on HBO, you'd watch it on HBO's channel. The movie just shows the humiliation of people from all corners of the earth. It can't get worse than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film I had on last night wasn't quite as bad as I had hoped it would be, but it did not really come together. The two leads were so bad they had to act in the same manner. It was so bad, in fact, that I felt like I was watching something in the theater that was out of the ordinary and that made it seem so bad. There was no storyline to it. It felt as if it was made during a slumber party of some sort, and not a horror film. The acting wasn't that good, too, and the ending didn't bring closure to the story of the movie.  I was disappointed after watching this film. If I had seen it at all, I would've seen more like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on TV a couple of years ago, and had a pretty good idea that the movie would be great if not only did not take so long to watch. But I had the same idea when I rented it: if it had a slightly interesting story, and made a small fuss of some funny lines, it would have been interesting. But, sadly, that was not the case.  I would have to wait until this movie was ready, before I was able to say that. The story had a fairly predictable one-liner ("This is a little red-headed little town.  The town is one of the biggest towns in the country, and is fairly safe with a couple hundred people, none of whom have ever had a boyfriend. However, two girls are forced to become pregnant, and go back to school. There is only one girl who comes to help with the family, and she is a blonde.  With no one around for her parents to decide what to do with her mother, she begins to fight with them.  And the movie gradually turns into a sad, incest-ish slasher-like horror-fest. The only way I can say that the film is to be expected is that it's a slasher and very low budget, and that it has a few odd-flicks.  But, if it has anything that will appeal to a genre audience, it fails on that. In fact, it is one about as low budget as you can get.  What really bothered me was the way the plot wound up. You know the story when it comes out. I watched it on TV and it sounded familiar, but I had no idea until I saw the next three weeks of watching. The acting was terrible. And the story line was dull.  To be honest, I was very embarrassed watching the movie. And I still don't understand why this was even made. And at times, I felt it didn't matter at all.  If the film does get made, I will have to rent it to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had an unfortunate ending in which the characters had no protection and were helpless to defend themselves against the army. This makes the overall conclusion a bad one. The movie was so bad it could've been a comedy. If you are expecting a comedy and didn't get that, you are missing the rest.  If the ending was the best parts of the movie (for some reason) it is also the worst and most confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just went out to see it. I went straight through the entire movie expecting a movie of some substance and was disappointed beyond comprehension. The first half of the film is about how to get rid of a girl named Lisa and the other lady in the movie is one of Lisa's friends, and it's so bad! I just wanted to get back to work and to get away from this horrible crap...  This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I rented this DVD from the rental store, and I was disappointed. The story line is unbelievable, the camera is terrible, and the plot is completely stupid. It's simply embarrassing. I won't see this movie ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's like watching the first season of "The X Files", and you would just pick the biggest fat bastard ever.  I rented this one just because it looked like a great movie. The first season was pretty funny, but this movie isn't funny. It just goes on and on without ever making a joke about a movie: it's a typical crap movie. It keeps repeating scenes over and over again.  Please don't rent this one if you want to see a movie with a story about a little kid, and enjoy it while you're there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to say that this movie was only one episode. This movie was obviously not meant to be a true film. I am not even really sure why they gave this movie an idea as to how great this would be, except for the fact that the ending seemed to be pretty good. What are you telling? The beginning, like a one-sided film?  But let's get a little bit serious about it: There was an important lesson learned in this movie: don't waste your time looking for a real movie: it will never happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first season of FELDER, I decided to see it again just to confirm my suspicions. Although I was initially concerned with the idea of this story of an older girl falling on her knees to a mysterious man, I was rather impressed with the rest of it. Not only did the story a poor ending, but also a mediocre acting. This was probably not the best film for this series, although it had a good start with the director and the cast, so far as they are concerned. The beginning was really bad in that it tried to make things look strange and not that great acting, and the rest was pretty much bad.  However, the ending did succeed in showing a little bit of the mystery of the world and the life of the girl. It got a little better, but that was all the same. The film didn't help much, and I wouldn't recommend seeing the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was an appalling attempt to portray the death of the American soldier in a manner that had not been done before. For starters, the movie featured a huge, bald, bald man, who would look like a caricature of Jesus, and even that guy was a tiny bit of caricature. He was pretty funny and pretty cool. But his plot was really weak. And it was pretty bad. The biggest problem in the movie is that all of the actors seem to have been made of flesh or some sort of wimp who was really nothing but an over-weight and over-toned guy who didn't know what he was going to do. Some of the characters even looked like caricatures of themselves, and the rest didn't even seem to be from anywhere near the real world. There are no redeeming qualities in this movie. It is a disappointing attempt at a film for the purpose of a movie that it is not very good. Don't waste your money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good way of making a big fat, dumb movie for me in the summer of 1976. This movie is a waste of time with absolutely no story, plot or direction whatsoever. It's not even entertaining at all, so much as I can to see any good or witty words. At the end of the movie I just wanted to shut my eyes to everything and wait to see my next movie: "Where did I get the idea of this movie?". I had the chance to rent this movie and watch it myself at my local video store and was disappointed in its lack of creativity. I really thought it had some originality, but it just does not deliver the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even have to say anything about this movie. It doesn't go on in a pleasant manner, no matter how much one dislikes it, but it's not an enjoyable viewing. For example, if I was viewing in the local theater, there are too many clichés that don't help much with the story. It's not a big surprise that there are no more than 3 main characters. In the first, they are mostly not as good as they were in the first TV series. And since there is no more then this is pretty annoying. There are some interesting moments. There is a lot of nice dialogue, but the characters don't get to make much time, nor are there many scenes that don; they just follow the plot. It just leaves me wondering what went wrong with this. In fact, it isn't even an action film with plot. This is a bad way to watch movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think that the only reason this movie was made was to show how awful it is, and I couldn't help that. As a viewer I wouldn't have chosen that show to be that movie. It was just a shoddy excuse to get money off so they can make more movies, as it has already done. When I say that, it has done so much worse than that. I think it's better to get it on HBO, and have all the friends in your network come to see it. What a waste of time. I was also forced to watch this to see if it was worth my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just because people have to make a film like this to "honor" it, this film is pretty bad and is the worst I have ever seen. It has so little imagination, so little passion, and so little fun. It's just a very weak film with a few good moments. I don't believe there is any real reason for this, it's just an excuse to make movies that nobody can afford to make. This is just bad movie writing and very bad directing. It doesn't make any sense, like a "noir" movie with no plot, and it looks like the movie was filmed at the studios in a very low-budget way. I just gave this a 1.3 because it's a decent film, but not really something worthy of recognition. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a film, this just doesn't work. In the beginning, it was interesting and it looked like it might be good. But when it is in a boring story it is just plain terrible. Why would anyone spend so much money on a movie that has no substance? And then I realized that all these people were wasting their time watching it. It is nothing new. That is not funny. That's not funny... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always hated that kind of movie. The plot seems to be a bunch of old ladies trying to defend a guy. Who would have thought there would have been a plot? The acting is horrible, I am not sure what it is. And then there is the scene in which a guy just looks around and sees a beautiful woman. This scene was simply disgusting. The ending is bad, even by a very low budget movie like this. It makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of those movies that I get so disappointed with. If you're expecting an action-packed "gangster" flick, you'll be disappointed.  The plot, acting, and direction are so awful that it's hard to find out why anyone is even remotely involved in the plot. It's unclear if the actor is as clueless as he is inept as he appears to be. The film is completely incomprehensible. Even the original teaser for the movie is worth watching, but this movie seems to be more about an "expert" who is not a criminal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My feelings are about the film. It was a film that felt like I was going into some sort of cult. It got ridiculous when I read the lines off of the credits, the plot's been pretty convoluted. They made a bad impression. The movie reminded me of movies like 'The Monster Caves' which were made after the discovery of the fact that magic powers, but the same type of misinformed films I know from. The story of 'The Devil Stags' had the same ending of the 'Dark Knight's Dark Side'. The plot of the movie is similar to 'A Nightmare On Ice'. The movie's only problem is that it has some good points. I did like the special effects and the visuals. Unfortunately, it didn't manage to bring something to life to it. The film is very predictable and doesn't develop. The acting is a joke. There is no special talent or any good director, and they don't seem to have come out of their program. There are a few good supporting actors, and the movie only managed to capture some of the spirit. But I'd suggest watching it again so you can learn to understand the movie. But not the 'Devil and the Devil'. I wish it weren't so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just bad and stupid, so bad it is, that's the only way I can make it to watch. I don't have any faith for this movie, but I was amused to see so much blood splatter for a movie about a murder. It's a pity that the plot is completely unrelated to the story. The killer is just a guy and a bunch of girls. The plot is obviously based on some sort of fantasy. The two main characters are women, and you can expect him to kill some women. But I was unable to figure out where this was based on anything else. At one point, the killer is so much hot he goes off to rape the woman and rape the girl (who he also rapes). At the end of the film, the girl is really sad when she kills him. It doesn't really add up to anything else about this movie.  I wish I could get more movies like this with my imagination and intelligence. I wonder if I could just ask someone for an alternate ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a half-awful comedy with a very predictable plot. I couldn't really predict it, but I got it wrong. The script had too many clichés and the directing was bad, especially the directing. The movie is overrated so bad I had nightmares after I watched it. I have been watching a movie for about 2 hours and it was so bad that I wanted to throw it into the trash bin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was bad in the end, it was too low, and too slow, for me. It was about a couple, a guy and a girl who were very stupid, but neither. I thought it wasn't worth the time for a film, but then I have to admit, I don't like it anyway. I have seen it on several occasions and even though I said what was in the movie, I can't remember why it was so bad. I wish it would have been at least a couple more minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm scared that I'm going to watch this movie. It's like watching a really bad movie, except in a couple of very rare instances. The movie begins to be a horror film with a few moments of funny moments but the acting is bad. The scenes are just awful and the story just horrible. I don't see any plot plot elements which are consistent with any logic and the characters which are well developed and don't fit with the characters in any other movie.  I can't say that I like this movie but it's just one of the many lame, dumb movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked John Carpenter as a young, well-off movie director, but this one, unfortunately, does not match the previous films. It is very disappointing. The characters are very poor and the plot is badly written. Very predictable and the ending is terrible. Not one of the better horror films of the time but very bad, unfortunately. Avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to watch this movie on a DVD in order to determine the exact nature of a true horror-film and I couldn't believe the acting and dialogs were any more disturbing than the terribleness of the "documentation" it portrays. The plot is just like all other horrors - that you have to watch over and over as they drag you down to their guts. The acting is OK, but it really just is awful. The dialog is just awful. I can only assume the director knew what he was going to do and he just showed us a small sample of it that was not necessary. I thought it would have been better if he used another name and made a movie that had similar quality to his previous one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply awful, but I'm willing to admit that it gets worse every day.  The script is good, but the ending is completely meaningless. Even for a fictional character, it is almost incomprehensible.  But, at least, the actors are good. The bad writing is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing wrong with a story of a little girl's mother trying to find the missing girls, but having to sit through the entire film is painful. She wants so badly to find them but this just doesn't work. The fact that there was a story that included the daughter of the girl in search is the only thing that makes this film worthwhile. The movie's story is only about a woman and her mother who are both having problems trying to figure out what happened to the girls and then find out if she will stay with her mother or not. The only reason to believe this movie is worth watching is because it makes you believe that the rest of the film would be about. Then there is a brief scene that is about to be cut and so would be a much better story with that final scene. I really believe that making a fictional story about a real person would be easier. In real life there would be no need to make a fictional person, or real person that would have more importance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be a very disappointing movie, and a few times I did like it. However, there was too much in it to be entirely bad.  In fact, the first few minutes of it seemed like an original idea. I was disappointed that there weren't more to say. I have to admit, I felt the same way, but I didn't want to see this movie in a theater with a group of friends, just the two of us, if you're not going to do a movie with a bunch of friends who want to take it home with her and watch the whole thing. It's not going on for a few weeks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I was really hoping this would be a fun movie. If it were, it was horrible. Not the worst, not even the worst i've seen in a movie. It was boring, but not the funny i expected. This is the worst movie I've seen for quite some time. It's a really bad thing to watch for anybody. If you're a fan of Sci-Fi you might enjoy it. But if you don't know what Sci-Foo is. Well, you're better off having Sci-Fu or Star Wars instead of this movie. This movie was the only thing that made me laugh the whole time. The plot and camera movement were so bad that i couldn't stand it. The ending sucked. The story was so bad it had me wondering whether it was actually ending or was a scene. The worst part of this video was the fact that the characters looked like they were actors in a Playmate movie. I gave it a 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very dumb, but if you want to make an action movie you can turn it into a comedy one with some funny jokes. Unfortunately, nobody has ever done that, so it doesn't matter how much I like a dumb movie. I was just looking at a bad attempt at comedy.  In fact, this movie was much better than the movie was originally. However, if you're interested in a movie where you want a comic movie, you shouldn't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was not an interesting one. i mean, if you like movies of this kind then you would like this one to watch, but i guess you would prefer something a little bit more original.  i mean the "story" i mean not the "plot" i guess. you probably would want a little more "plot", but the lack of plot is just plain terrible. you get the girl with a new girlfriend and then, she wants to see the man at the hotel that was a cop in the old days and then you are supposed to meet the new guy's girlfriend, but you are not allowed to bring her to the hotel with you to meet her.  the film shows some scenes, but it is just like the other "sister" movies i mentioned before. it shows no one. all the characters are the same people that all wear the same clothes. i guess, if a girl is a little weird, you can do that at home and all you have to do is wear clothes and then do what? you just sit around in the garage and stare at the naked people, making yourself unhappy. you just feel sad that you are there.  so, let's not go to the movie at home. at home, you get a little, so you can tell the difference when you watch it, if your are in a situation like the one described by "story", and you probably have a sense of humor and you don't care for it.  if you are stupid you will enjoy it a little. if you have a brain, you will be a lot of angry.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a movie that just couldn't make me pay attention or care.  My reaction was just too one-sided. Even if I was supposed to like it, I still couldn't care what they were trying to make.  The story line didn't reach its peak. It seemed like a really bad movie. It didn't matter who the girl was on for, but the girl's name was the only person who seemed to have any real interest.  They just wanted the big, heart-throbbing red-haired sex scene, but when we had to guess who the girls were on the side of the bus, they didn't just make it.  And I have to admit, I don't have the greatest sympathy for these people. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie was a complete waste of potential. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't understand the reason why this made the grade it's got on. The first three minutes of the film were great and the last 10 minutes was just bad, nothing more than "so bad that I can never go back to this film."  I have always found funny movies to be entertaining, but this doesn't really deliver.  The plot seemed to be one step closer to a "real" comedy with some plot, jokes, and some interesting scenes. Unfortunately it seems to be missing all of the other elements of the plot. The movie was filled with a lot of nonsense and the story line seemed to make no sense.  A lot of this movie seemed to fall apart at the end.  I do have to say, this was the biggest dumb movie I've ever seen. It got to be a very annoying watching as I tried to finish the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to laugh so hard at the scenes involving the people from the movie: you really need a real "The Walking Dead" movie that was made and not an edited film.  The film seems very similar to the movie that made the TV show "The Dead", but that is the only similarity. A lot of bad actors and a very poor ending leaves a lot of people to question what really happened in the first episode. I couldn't believe that the film could be made, and that it could even be released without any plot plot.  There is one scene that I really liked. It was when Mr. Morgan was attacked by zombies from the camp that his wife showed up to help him. That scene got pretty good in the third episode of the series, but then, in the second episode of it, that scene was totally replaced.   The final episode had a good ending. But not for too long, there was so many scenes that made me nauseous. Some of them were about 2 or 3 minutes long, and I have a feeling that some of those scenes were done. I guess, it didn't try to completely break your brain either because they couldn't tell us the story or the events that occurred in the town. If we are able to guess the story of the zombie virus attack in the hospital, we just have to guess where they were in the camp.  Some of the actors were good and there was a pretty good scene. But, in most of the episodes, they were just not very believable. The story seemed almost silly.  I've watched every episode of "The Living Dead", and was not satisfied. The actors and characters were pretty good, but most of them just weren't believable. They are just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this show once on TV when I was 15, and I watched it the same night in college. After the movie, I was bored. I watched the entire show the same time, but the story, the plot, the cast, the acting, the special effects were really bad. I didn't even get so close to the character. There were too many bad lines, too many unrealistic situations, and even the acting was bad. It was not even worth watching. It had no feeling, and it was no good! The ending was not good either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie features a bunch of guys who have no idea what it is going to happen, which is a really strange thing, I mean, I have seen the actors of this movie in a number of different movies, but if you are going to put some kind of movie about a really bizarre car, don't go out and rent it, donnae! You are not going to have a fun ride and if you want to be funny, you don't make it yourself.   I would like to know more about the movie and it would have been a great movie, but this movie is a huge waste of my time. I am a huge fan of it, but unfortunately, when it was announced, I couldn't get into the whole business because I didn't see it until I saw it on a DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The fact that there are very few actual horror films in America today makes this film a horror film, it is, at the least, bad. It is bad, and has nothing to do with horror, and very bad, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a complete fiasco of a plot, a predictable plot, an overly convoluted storyline, a complete lack of depth and the constant repetition of one single word. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was absolutely bad... It isn't interesting or funny... It is a horrible excuse for a sequel of the first series.  The plot was the same as the first one, but it wasn't original. The action sequences were weak (the fights were weak, the explosions were weak). The story did not make a lot of sense. The characters were weak and the plot was weak, because the story itself was only half a movie. The acting was very poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only positive thing I could do was to compare this film with the first "My Dream of a Beauty" movie: a good movie but not exactly what I was expecting.  What I got was that this film was a typical 'Drama' film in which the 'Bachelorette' figure(s) is the only person with which there is to be love, and in which she is forced to do a 'Dance with her boyfriend(s).  The next thing I did was to look for a DVD copy of "My Dreams of Beauty", and I discovered that when I rented the film, it had been made in India as a film with a very, very, ugly female-character(probably a girl named Rania). I had to turn off my computer and rent the movie to see that.  The film is a mess. It is a horrible waste of precious film, but I won't even get into the details of the movie so I will avoid it.  It is, of course, not about the film itself, but about the movie(s), which unfortunately has gotten to be the most awful film of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just couldn't even comprehend how the movie was going to end. The acting was pretty poor, there was too much padding, and the idea of being in a coma seemed ridiculous. I didn't understand why the people involved in the movie were trying to take advantage of the fact that the entire movie was a fictional plot.  Overall, it's a horrible waste of time for anyone to watch. I'm glad I saw this movie, but I was so embarrassed by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well it's not really funny to me. But it does not have a good script at all. It doesn't even make any sense! I would like to see the original one with a new storyline. But that would be too much money in the movie! Why is the person at the beginning of the movie called the 'Man?' And why is he named 'Welcomer'? The original Man didn't know who he was. And the sequel was different! The man knew that he was the man! Why couldn't he say anything? When we reach the beginning, he knew that there would be 'A Secret' on the beach. But the man was never seen again.    Now I want to say that this movie was inspired by a movie: "Man" starring: Robert Altman. But I didn't see it. This movie had too much trouble to be a true movie. Even though I think it was a good idea, it didn't really work. The story has the excuse that it was filmed in a studio (it's just a studio). The dialog is the worst. The plot is lame. The characters were even worse. There is no good humor. The movie is just lame. I won't even give this movie an 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know where to turn this episode in. It is really bad. Maybe it is the first episode of this new season, but not sure. This is the kind of episode that I only watch during the second half of the season. This episode is one of the worst episodes I have ever seen. The idea of this show is completely stupid. What did they have to do to get a new episode? If it is possible to show all the episodes without making a new one, I wonder why? What a movie with so much crap is supposed to be? I thought it was funny, but I've got bad taste and all the other characters have bad taste too. This movie is a total waste of time, but we're not going to take it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie was completely stupid, stupid, pointless, boring, and boring. It had no real plot and nothing to recommend. It made no sense. The movie's story just followed an idiot that killed a cop, who then tried to stop him, who killed another, then a cop who stopped him and then a person named "Bitch" who kills another cop who kills the murderer. The end of the movie had no story and no real characters. Even the murder scene didn't add up to anything, it just looked like a scene of a murder that happened on a beach. When I first saw it, I wondered why there wasn't a real person on the beach. I was glad that it was finally over, but I don't think the rest of it was good. The only good thing about it was that it showed the movie was a failed attempt at making a horror movie and a dumb attempt at it. If you've read a good horror movie, you'll be glad to see the first one and avoid the sequel. I'm just saying you don't need to see this movie. Avoid it at all. I'd give it a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not big fan of this movie. I thought I could relate to this characters but I couldn't. It's just bad, no matter what I thought of the film. It didn't even have a plot. In fact, I think the whole film is boring and ridiculous. The ending was completely pointless. And this is my personal opinion on how bad this movie is. It just isn't very interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an absolutely lousy film that isn't even the least bit original. It has all of the worst elements of every horrible film of ever made, even the ones that don't suck. I can't even begin to think that it had a single plot. There are no characters, no acting, and it is so devoid of atmosphere that you feel like you're going to jump right into a movie about a fictional murder in a hospital, and then you're only waiting for another boring one. The scene in the hospital was probably the most absurd moment of the entire film. It was just a pile of dead people. It even had a very small scene that showed the doctor as being the doctor, but it had nothing to do with the character's mind. This film is really bad to watch and we all just wished it didn't get this far into the movie, because that would ruin the rest of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing better than a movie with nothing new about it but a few scenes that are not there and some that are. Some of the actors in the film (Laurie S. Elleussand Richard Farin and Michael C. Scott) are pretty good and I guess they should have put some people together. But the other people in the movie are really bad. The movie is so lame that it actually tries to make a joke about it instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Livest Night" is the type of movie that just shows the lack of any sense of intelligence that this movie had. The acting is horrible, the movie is just too lowbrowed and it just keeps repeating the same basic plot line over and over again. If you are a fan of "LIVEST NIGHT" and want to get some money, you might consider going out and buying it yourself. But if you are not, then this movie just doesn't deserve your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of time, and how horrible it was, this movie was. What a horrible plot, which really should have been kept off, in this case a story has been ripped out from the movie itself. The only saving feature in this movie is the "comedy" (no spoilers) scene where it is played out. Why is that funny? No joke. It is just like every other movie of the late 20th century, even if the film had a story about it.   It is not just the "plot" of this movie, it is a bad plot. The fact that the movie is about a murder is irrelevant to the movie (at least the "villains" are well done) and there are many other things that need to be considered. It's not a big deal if the movie had a "story" that was developed, but the plot, for lack of a proper plot, makes this movie one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And yes, this film is also not funny. In fact it has lost all its comedy. The acting is bad, the acting and story, the director, the script, etc. all are terrible. I really can't give this movie 4 stars. I would probably give this bad movie 1/2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two episodes of "The Monster" (2006) were decent, but the episodes "Warm" (2010) and "Tales Of Fear" (2012) were really awful. They were almost comical as the Monster characters. They seemed to be having fun but never went on to anything, which was bad considering the storyline was supposed to be a horror movie. The last episode was basically a plot based on a movie of "Rollo, The Big Boy" (2007) which has nothing to do with this movie. This movie actually stars a "Monster" (Lance Barksy in the end) who apparently has a girlfriend who was killed in the previous episode (which is why the villain has such a reputation). If you watch this episode, you will watch another episode of the series about a movie that supposedly has a killer on it (if that's the case), but then you'll go out on a murder spree and kill everyone. The first time you see the Monster, it will have a different look than the first two, but it's not going to look anything like that. The Monster is just a big man who kills people without regard to his own morals, while the characters are completely random. The only two "characters" are either one of the people on the boat (the "The Wound") or one of an actor who kills everyone and gets caught up in the whole thing. There is also another actor who gets caught in the mass of dead bodies and has a monster that appears to have the same qualities as the first one (and we know that is the case).  The movie is filled with "themes" and strange scenes which are supposed to scare us away from the show. We do get some of the most ridiculous things that are totally unnecessary, like for example the fact that a monster has an electric ball-shaped head, and it's impossible to describe the movie as being scary. This is not the only way the film has been stupid. There are other odd elements (like a "harpie" floating around in a cave in the woods) that are pointless and pointless, such as a huge black blob in the first episode of "Wright r.s"). The ending of "Tides Of Darkness" (which was pretty much the only scene that occurred in the movie) was just terrible. The idea that "the monster" used to get into the cab of a giant boat and then make her drown in a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In what's been called, "The Last Great American Batwing," a bunch of "Star Trek" fans have become a fan of the show. But when the series finally lands on the air, the fans aren't going for it, and we just as much as a movie writer could have predicted, nothing happens. This show features an unbalanced plot with none of the familiar trappings (in fact, even one of the "Star Wars" actors is a big fan of it), not one single interesting character(that's the only thing missing), and no real reason whatsoever.  What a really ridiculous plot, and what a terrible direction. This is the kind of show that we can only hope to find on HBO or NBC. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got a bit suspicious at first, but the only way out was to watch it in a bad mood and wonder if it was really as bad as it looked. For example, it's pretty obvious that the director doesn't really know what he is doing or where he is going. I'm not quite sure what was the point of a scene where it appears that a guy is having a sexual encounter with his wife (it's clear she was, if she was the one who "had intercourse with him"), but that was really stupid. I don't remember what was being discussed when that scene was shown, and it doesn't make much sense to me. This movie seemed to be as much of an excuse to rent than a film. My main issue with the film was the fact that it made all of the dialogue sound really annoying and boring. It seems as if it had been filmed in a desert. The guy and woman talk about what they would like to do when they were in India and that's only really supposed to be the first time the couple was in the jungle or the mountains, but I'll grant that. I really don't think it would have been a disaster to put the guy and wife in the middle of that desert, but just a bit strange and creepy. It was just not that interesting to me and it didn't have much of a storyline. The only good thing I did was the soundtrack. But that would have made the movie much more interesting. The acting was decent. I think the only thing that was interesting in the film were the little bits of humor that I saw in it, most of which came from the very awkward story. I thought the most important part of the movie was the "real life" nature of the story, not only the story itself. It's a shame that the movie failed to deliver to anyone. The storyline could have had the same or better story with a lot more focus, but it didn`t. At least a few of the actors didn't act as badly as I do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical, lazy plot doesn't have much substance to it - the characters are wooden and so many people are just the only characters that feel like real people - but it does have some good ideas. Unfortunately, this is a movie that doesn't really get much done. It lacks a sense of life, is badly filmed and the characters just seem really fake. I'm sure the producers thought the scene with the dog and his car was funny when I filmed it, but when you think you're looking at funny things, it's not. I think it's just OK for kids, but I would turn it off as a kid. The best thing in this movie is the ending - I was very sad that they stopped so quickly, but it's OK for adults. That's the least interesting part of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, if this was the film that was in the mind of "I'm a Gay Parc" director, it was pretty bad. I mean, the way I say it makes it seem like it was filmed in "Imit The Lion" or something, but it's just a bunch of guys. I was very curious to see a lesbian couple and a homosexual couple in the film, and I didn't want to see "I am a Gay Man". As much as I liked it, it wasn't that gay. It was just that it was terrible, really bad, and at the end of the movie, we got to the point where the gay man decided to be "normal". There was nothing in there, nothing that made me happy. It wasn't even funny. I guess that the guys who were supposed to have a heterosexual female partner, in this case was "normal", so they might have gotten as much as $100,000 in the cast of the film. That's the biggest reason I don't think it gets anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie features a female protagonist who gets drunk and goes to the house of a sleash-bag boss who hires a hit-man to break his back. It is so bad that you wonder whether she is really capable of stopping him.   After the third time I watched it, I had to pause it and try to think of something more.  The plot and the pacing of the film had been pretty good in previous movies, but I couldn't relate to it. I had the thought of this movie in mind as I saw it, and I thought it would be a good one to see again, but this film has absolutely nothing to recommend.  I just found out that it was made in a Canadian movie: one that is apparently so low budget that it doesn't even have a budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have seen that I think I have ever seen. It is like watching a bunch of people on a TV and thinking they are actors. The acting was terrible. This movie is so bad I couldn't even finish it. The plot is absolutely ridiculous. The story is the standard fare and the characters are very dumb. They do nothing new to the standard, and they even give us false motivation for our characters.  The acting is not enough to make up for the poor acting, but I thought the plot was good. It was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not much I say. The movie is pretty old by now. It's not all that bad that it was, but it's not good enough to make me watch this again. You can watch it on any television set (with my wife sitting in the back of the theater); it is only marginally better than a dull movie with a big name like, "Pipley's Life". It doesn't even have a plot.   The movie just goes on and on with a dull plot, then drags some plot along to keep you glued on.  At the beginning of the movie, they find a dead corpse in a house. I felt like they were a bit too gruesome, but I couldn't find where they came from. There are some really good actors (including the "Buck" who plays the dead body; he doesn't have the role of the "good boy" that he usually played in a horror movie; he was in the house with the other dead corpse, and they make a pretty good performance.  If it wasn't so bad, then the movie would have been great. But I don't know whether there is a lot more to the movie than that it contains. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the previous review I said that the film is not interesting, that it lacks some dramatic elements, that there's not much depth to the story or characters, and that it is not too much on top. But when I saw the finished film, I was very disappointed. It was too much like a movie about the movie business than it was supposed to be. I knew nothing about the characters, their motivations, or their motivations to do anything. I had no idea what to do with the characters. I was no clue what to expect, what to see, or what to talk to. The story, the first half of the movie, was completely predictable. I thought it was going to be a typical thriller. But it didn't. The acting was amateur, the story was too slow and the film felt more like a piece of biz than a documentary.  This movie doesn't seem to have an ending. I've seen a movie with a movie-making director. I can't believe it was just plain old stuff. The best place for an interesting film is a boring one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an absolute waste of time. They get better than this piece of crap and just want to "jump ahead" the other guys! This is really just a cheap excuse to waste time and money on it. Why? Why would they do a film like this? Where would we get a script from this guy?? The only thing that would be a better alternative is to hire a talented director and turn it into a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't believe that it was an original. Even if the writer was good at the end of his career, this is a bad film. The only reason that it made any sense at all was that it just looked like a very old movie. I am surprised at the number of movies and special effects that are made for a film that doesn't come together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a film that would be a classic film from Tarantino's career, but, without much to add to it, it's not that.  A film like this is simply horrible. A bad film is simply a film with no substance. They should put their money back into making movies with substance, rather than producing crap movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot does not do much of the right things. Its a lot like a really bad horror film but no horror films are so bad I cannot believe it exists. The film begins with a creepy creature (a man with big teeth and one eye) who kidnaps a woman (Karen Connolly) and begins to torment her, who also goes along the path of what would be an OK horror film. I think the film was written on a really low budget with a terrible director. He only had to do the minimum in directing and that did not get the attention he needed. The acting is bad and the direction of lighting is horrible. The story is not even interesting as it is only a repeat.  The fact that the film has a female lead, that it does not fit well with the male lead is disappointing. The only time I watched the film I can recall was during an important event in the film's storyline, when the monster (that was obviously a male) threatened a woman. The male lead did not know she was a monster or even cared to her. The woman's actions and reactions were not even that great. I'm sure it was filmed to take away some of the feeling of being a female. A film that is designed by a person with nothing but a camera lens. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the only movie I can remember that I had the nerve to see in my lifetime. It just has a weak script and a poor supporting cast. A story about a man who has a girlfriend (I assume it is "her"), who lives in a big city and fights with all the thugs that want him to kill everyone who has wronged him.  But the plot does not come together well. There are two reasons. First, it is bad in every aspect of it.  Second, the acting.  The story itself is a waste. The ending is just bad. Even worse than the other chapters in the book.  Also, the plot was completely missing. The characters were in such a hurry to get there.  I will admit that this is a bad excuse for a movie, but it has to be the last movie to be called "the best".  If you see it, you'll laugh at how pathetic it is. If you don't see this movie, you will probably wonder why you would even consider it as a "movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen "Flam Boy" (2001) over a dozen times, and I've never seen one like this one. In general, I dislike this type of "film", and I just can't believe that a film like this is supposed to be a film for kids or teenagers. A film like "Flim Boy" doesn't seem to know how much it is supposed be an actual film; it looks like a bunch of teenagers going out, and a couple of people filming, and then filming a bunch for a few minutes, and suddenly it becomes a movie for adult audiences. This isn't a movie to make for kids, it's a movie made for adults who don't know what to do in the "fun" or "cool" ways. I can't even imagine what "fun". There is no rhyme, in which the actors will be put up for. It's not cute; it's horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters were not realistic, the plot didn't even come together, the acting wasn't convincing enough, the story is terrible, and the fact that it did finally bring to my consciousness that a "super hero" would actually be a villain does not make it true! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part of this movie was bad. In the second part of the movie, I saw only a few minutes of action, and the story is almost flat. The first half was boring.  The movie starts at the beginning of the story. The characters are the characters that try to bring the story to life, but the story just plain gets boring. If the story was original and meaningful, there would be much more of it.  You really need to see some dramatic and thrilling things, like some of the characters of the first part. If you can see those scenes again, I would like to see more than half of the second episode.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this film because I liked the "The Bourne Retribution" and was eager to see The Bourne Family. But unfortunately, it doesn't make that case. It looks like some amateur filmmakers trying to recreate the atmosphere of the movie with just a few of their friends, just one movie director, and one cameraman. I guess the "original" should be a film with a similar setup, but it isn't. The movie just looks like an old film, not much like the film that would've had a DVD release. It was terrible, and the characters were totally predictable and boring. I couldn't believe that the "Humbly" had such a poor performance.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion is that this movie is the worst of all the American movies that I've seen. It's no mystery why I was watching this movie and the only reason I'd watch it was because it was free. I don't believe in this movie that there's ever really got to be a plot, and I was expecting something like a really good thriller that was actually there. But I was so disappointed after seeing it that I was left with no more than just my mind and a bunch of empty pills.  I think the plot of this movie should be in the same place as the real movie: a small village in the woods of Africa. I have a feeling that there was no intention. If this movie wasn't a "journey of the west" movie like other American movies it would probably have been a great movie, but it was really not one. And I think it's not worth watching. It might be a fun way to get away from the culture for a little while if you are bored or something, but unfortunately, the acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and the movie is just so bad that the audience is bored by the horrible characters that we are forced to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I don't care for the first time, if I am making a documentary, I like my friends to do it. I thought that it had a great acting story, but the acting is very poor. The characters are very unbalanced and don't seem like actors in any way. If they could only appear in the original films, the acting would have been perfect. I didn't care what they were doing to each other. When I watched the series, I thought they were acting a lot, but for all the reasons the people who created the show had left the whole situation totally unknown. I am sure they had their choice, but this episode left something off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When this movie was released, it had quite a predictable plot. A short scene (the first of many) involving a car that was driven into the road and the people that were driving it, a couple of women, that were killed by a drunk driver, and a drunk couple that was killed by their own drunk driver. The rest of the movie is about a family that buys a car at a garage and then proceeds to lose the car, and eventually a bunch of drunk women as well. And not too long after, a bunch, or one, of dead bodies are discovered and killed by the car...  This is the plot that I'm used to seeing most of the time when I see "The Big Sleep" on the big screen. The thing I didn't see in "The big Sleep" is quite so disturbing. The fact that this is an attempt to make the idea of "The Sleep" not a horror-movie is also disappointing. The main villain is some guy that dies and then tries to bury his body. This seems to be a typical horror-film plot. This is not only just a bad horror-comparator, but it's just not scary. The film is just flat-out unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You know what I mean when I have not seen a good movie: movies that are a waste of my time and money and that I have nothing more to see. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with any story, storyline, or acting, and does everything wrong. Its just awful. Some of the actors are even worse than the rest of the acting. Some actors and actresses don't have any more talent than they can manage, so why do I say this movie is a waste? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film from "The Rock Enablist", and I cannot believe that it was ever intended for an audience, which would have made it an easy movie to understand. I have seen some movies that have made the best in this genre, and this one is no exception. The plot is totally stupid, a few characters don't even have a story. The actors in the movie only talk to each other in a manner which is not even remotely believable. I mean that I just got done a ticket to a movie that just cost half my pay, and I was more than the audience could ever pay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You really feel the need to say that the "New Testament" is stupid as usual. There are many reasons for this, most of them involve the fact that it is an unbelievable waste of precious time and money, so what would you expect from it? In the past I've seen many things, but this is the only thing that I can think of. I didn't know about this until I saw the show, but now I am deeply disappointed, and that is all the more reason I have for this movie.   I don't think this movie was any good; if anyone reads this piece, let me state it with absolute certainty. I don\'t even care enough to find out what is in the movie, and what a writer had to do in it. I've never had a good look at the movie. I want to go into it and see it over again, but instead, I'll say that I don�ll never see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not about an interesting plot. It is about a lot of unappealing characters, mostly female college students, who make a lot off-beat, over-spoke, unvarnished entertainment.  There are a few good jokes in the movie, but the majority of them are just mindless droning-outrageous nonsense.  The film is completely devoid of all interesting things. There are no music, no actors. The movie is a typical B-M-M movie, with little substance to speak of. I was just looking for something to put in a film that was entertaining.   If you wanted to check out a comedy, watch a movie that had more substance to its body. I thought, "the same thing, the same thing", only in different ways. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad I decided to watch it for just fun. I just didn't expect anything to be remotely interesting. The director of this film obviously was an idiot who clearly had no idea what they were trying to pull. If you were to find something in the movie that was not entirely wrong, you might do a bit more homework on it... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie at 2 or 3 am and i had the first three minutes left after I had given my 2 minutes of a decent film with a decent plot. After that i thought i'd be a bit of a hypocrite. I just couldn't wait for the ending, then i thought better of it to try and wait a bit longer.  It's absolutely pointless and i couldn't find any reason to see it. It just isn't good for that.   The only saving grace is that the opening sequence is absolutely brilliant, it's well written, it sets itself up perfectly, but I'm afraid that when it ended i couldn to follow it and my expectations would be set too high and the film would be ruined. It wasn't a huge problem, but i would rate it a 1 or 2 if it hadn't been that way, but if you had to see something that has absolutely nothing to do with real life or with a plot you would find it boring. In reality it was just a waste of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you find a decent movie: the first one is a very good one but the first few minutes of the film are simply horrible, and the second one is even worse. This is probably one of the most painful horror movie ever directed. The idea of a zombie movie is pretty basic, but it's really bad when it comes to reality. You have to ask yourself why people go out and waste their money on this movie in the first place. If you have seen it on your local video store, it's pretty obvious that zombie and zombie movie scenes are not that good, especially not really shocking and not even good-looking. So, if you want to see a Zombie movie with a lot of Zombie scenes, like the recent "Halloween" remake, that's it. The first Zombie movie had really good zombie scenes and the original one had some good ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was okay, the story had some action, and there was enough to keep the drama going, but it got very bad - I felt like the characters were two-dimensional and uninteresting and the plot was poorly developed. In fact, the movie got worse when it landed on a DVD with a few extra minutes in it. The acting was pretty good, although the characters felt like they weren't believable, which is bad for any plot that relies on a non-human character for action. I didn't really care for the storyline, although it could have been a much better movie.  Overall, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just recently saw this movie and thought it was a piece of crap. The plot is about a killer who wants revenge on the lives of people who killed him. When the killer was in town for a couple of weeks, I felt that he just wanted to have some fun before committing his murder. They got a little in a while but they couldn't quite keep going. After about two hours of watching this movie, I think I just punched myself in the face. I felt so sorry for the rest of the characters. The acting was horrible, the script was awful, the production was awful and the last few minutes were just awful. If you're ever in the mood for some low budget horror movies, this one is not for you. Please leave it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad. For the sake of time I saw it on DVD. The plot was very predictable. However, I was quite surprised when i watched it because there was an apparent connection between the main character's car and another vehicle. After a short amount of time (around half an hour), i didn't really understand why the car was involved in the plot. The film is not quite good, but I had to put it as a low rating because it could be interesting if it were a little bit more polished. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing a lot of horrible films and having my friend, and his wife find this film to be extremely embarrassing to see. You would expect to see a movie that made the greatest joke it's ever made. Instead, we see a typical dumb sitcom about a young couple with a lot more money than they used to. The only thing I can say is, if this was a movie I would say I wouldn't even see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely horrible, it's a complete waste of some decent actors and really nothing else. We're left with a weak story, a horrible story with a little bit of hope, a movie with a few good lines, and a decent plot. But unfortunately, the horrible storyline is so bad, that it doesn't go away even after the movie has gone off on to its next adventure.  There's some good comments from some people who didn't give it the same harsh review that I gave it, and they're right. It's an interesting story, but the bad part of it is the boring story. The people who have actually written this for a movie, should give it more time. This is nothing like a movie they had done before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Sibling" follows the standard "brothers are in a relationship" plot, but it doesn't work. For the most part, it just makes fun of two brothers who have only recently been given in a pregnancy, in a situation involving a mysterious woman. Then it comes out that the boys are all the same kids as before, although some new twists are added. In the end, there's a fight between the two brothers. After that, the two of them make a pact to stay together forever. Oh, and there's also some other things that go into the story, but no one understands anything except the premise. And the ending was bad. In one scene where the boys were playing football, one of the boys fell into a pile of rocks, another of the boy was running away from the fight, and another was screaming for help while another one was getting killed. This is about as good as the "Family" movies, but I can only give this 4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has an annoying premise and a disappointing story, it is so bad it is hard to figure out why anyone would watch it.  I saw it at a local movie theater and then I got really bored. The actors should know what their characters are like. It is not hard to come up with characters that are in the movie. The movie was not well directed, not even the characters looked like they had the script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the lowest possible score I have ever seen in the world. I have been watching it with my eyes closed, not even knowing the names of the people that appear in the film. I'm just trying to find the last words I remembered. This film seems to try to be funny, but that humor is absent. This movie could have been a great satire, if only there were more actors involved. It's just horrible. This is also a terrible example of a failed film directed by someone who wants to make a joke that he can't find. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Man With Two Faces" is a horrible waste of time. The acting and the direction are both horrible. I mean, how can you say it was horrible??. The fact that most of the acting was done by the cast is unbelievable. The script itself was awful. Some of the parts are too dumb to act well, while others are OK.  It is a shame that so many stars turned in the film because it was a money-making film. Maybe there is a reason that this movie was made, but I doubt it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only laugh at the lack of "action" in this movie. I'm not sure why this was in it's entirety. I think it is about a bunch of hippies who want to be a "super-dancer" (a person who uses a really ridiculous "clog" and a really fake haircut), but the characters are so bad that the movie is just OK. I also think they filmed a really old man, or perhaps they used a very old man. Anyway, "Super-dancers" are a joke. If they were doing something with them, they would have a laugh. It's bad that they used an old man in a ridiculous clothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film as a kid and it was very boring but it didn't take long for me to get bored. The only thing I got was that this film is pretty boring to watch. It isn't funny and it doesn't really show a lot. I don't understand the plot, it doesn;t even show that it is supposed to be a comedy. When was this film made?  It is not a movie made for kids, it has nothing but a very bad budget and a horrible cast.  I'd like to see more than the title of this movie to see the other films made in the same style. You don't even know who the director is, and most people think this movie is bad even though they liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've never seen this sort of movie or not watched it then you might just want to try one of the more notorious films for people in search of entertainment. But this one was one of my least favorite movies ever. I felt like I'd been sucked into it. In a nutshell, it has nothing to recommend. At best it can be made to an effective movie, but it was only an hour and half, and was simply a waste of money. Avoidable parts. Avoidability is the main reason. Even though it looked like a fun and charming movie, I'm sorry to say I got bored halfway through. I'm ashamed to say it made me bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just terrible, but I don't blame the director, John S. Jones. Even a couple of people in the movie can't escape his inability to film a decent movie. The plot is bad, the camera is bad and the characters are badly developed, but the film is OK. If you can't get some real acting, you can at least enjoy the suspense of seeing someone finally dead. I wouldn't recommend this movie unless someone like Michael Keaton (or Michael Raffy) or a writer with a good movie-making mindset would see it for himself. You would have to see a good thriller to see this movie, which would be like a John R. Williams thriller instead of S. J. Jones with just some stupid and lame acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, so bad that I could not care for it to be filmed. I give it 2. 3. 2. 2! 1.1! 2.2! 4.4! 4, 5, 5!!! 4!!1!!10.11!!1!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really stupid. Don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for its entertainment value, but I was expecting much better. I had trouble keeping ahold of any plot, especially the acting. But the plot is pretty good, and the plot would have been interesting if it wasn't so bad. But it isn't. The acting is bad. There are some great actors who played, but this movie is too bad to see. The plot is really poor, but it is fun for a couple of days, but then you want to wait a while to see how things get along. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen some people say "You should see this movie: A good director with good visuals, but horrible directing and bad story line.  I don't think you can really blame the writer and director for what they decide to do with the movie. I know what the writer did in this movie. But what was it? Why the director doesn't get better is a problem.  What was the point of making this movie? Some people see it as a horror movie but that is just not the point. The movie itself is pretty boring.  This movie does not deserve to be shown so highly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening scene where the two actors are sitting around talking about how they should act in a movie are pretty funny and very badly acted and at first I thought they were just talking about stuff they already knew. At the end they are talking about the idea that the guy was a "psychologist" and how he should make a movie about it. Then they decide to try to make it to seem that there was nothing new about it and it was a bunch of words written on paper and the actors are shouting at each other.  Then they are finally saying a movie of these "hypocrites" and I just think it was bad. The acting isn't very good and the scenes are poorly arranged and there is no dialog that made sense and it is really bad.  A few people are better than this and this is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a horrible piece of trash. What did the other characters in it have to do? And what do you really think when your girlfriend is so selfish and greedy? How can you live with a guy like that in a relationship? What's it like for two friends to break into a private relationship with each other? For the sake of the fun of it, you'd rather watch one of these movies at a local video store (it's so bad) instead of one where we learn how they are made. I give it a 1, and I'm pretty ashamed to have seen this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only the name, but the film. How can it be? It's obviously a film with too much sex and too much nudity... It is so bad I almost couldn't watch it because I was looking at the poster.  This film had me believing that if there is some sort of secret to it... it can only be a bad, awful film. I didn't believe it until I had seen it. I was in shock when this was released. I mean, I really didn't think this film was good because of the sex. The director had his hands in front of the camera and had no idea what to do with his camera. I wanted to be able to see it for myself to see how bad it really was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is terrible. Why they made this is beyond my comprehension.  The first thing I can remember as a kid is being in a store with my mother (an older woman), and our car in the garage, and then on the day we drove from city to town to a cemetery and then I would have my grandmother in the car with me. I would never have done that. The car would never make it a story. I don't remember it either. I think it would be better to not talk about it. The funny part was how I kept telling my mom that we were driving to those other areas where we were going to meet each other. It was like they were trying to get us out of the car. I thought the director was making us feel like they had taken us to a bunch of places like that and they would keep driving to them again.  I wish I'd have seen the rest of the film, but I don`t have any idea what happened to me while watching it. We did get some shots of my mom. One time we were at a movie theater where she was telling us that she had done that in the movie theater and they did a lot of acting. I loved that she acted it for us and had a lot more talent. Then I thought that she put us in our car. That just made us look stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm having trouble sleeping through the "Lumber" theme, but I will admit that it does come along as an amusing story. But, I am afraid that it can get really confusing.  The first time you see it, the girl is dressed in a dress and is being chased by a group of people. It's just that they don't care about her. When she finally gets into the car, you wonder, "Who is she?" How does she find out that she's not really the girl? Why would she run around the corner of a field for anyone who knew she was the girl and was actually a girl?  When you're given the choice, you're simply supposed to shoot the girl to death. And if you decide not to, the woman's dead and you go to a different city, and she's going back to her normal life. It just seems so obvious that the film is designed to help her in her normal and then to hurt her. I'm sorry I don't think it's any good for the story but it's better to just let her live in her own town with her family. The scene with the car and people and the family are pretty basic and, I suppose, fairly predictable. However, as it's the last thing you see the girl's family is all too dark and you wonder why she doesn't try to follow her father's instructions.  My favorite scene is the one where the car is attacked, and it turns out to be a monster. Oh, the car does look very good in that first few seconds. But the rest of the movie is just a waste, at best I'm sure you could pull out and make a positive review about it, and the dialog is pretty good. But it's too long, so I'm just not really paying much attention. The supporting cast is good, too, but not good enough.   But the film isn't all that great. As for my personal opinion, it's not good for this type of movie. Even so, if you like it, you have to be really careful with it. But not great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a fan of a great movie series, i thought i might check out the 2nd film to watch it since i had it earlier and it's not a big problem if you like the show, but this is just a complete waste of time and wasted of effort. A good idea for a "Lug" show but nothing else. The film does not allow you to really see the story line, so you can't really learn anything from it. I only made it two and three times in one week, and even then it was hard to remember what was happening in the film and the characters were not interesting enough to keep watching. The only thing i thought that helped was the actors. Even after a week of watching this film, i still couldn't believe they were in the same situation, and the only thing in my opinion that really helped was that it had an interesting score. It's a pretty bad way to film a story and keep you busy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If a good director would make this movie (I think he probably could) I would have been a big fan. The problem is that this movie lacks a good story. The ending is too predictable, the movie has too little personality to make me care about what happens next. I'm sure my opinion is harsh, but I don't believe in these two words. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have always been looking forward to a film that combines a few of the original "Pugging" films with a few original twists. But none of them do it. The latest example of "Packing" in this current crop of films is "Punchbox", in which the filmmakers were so sloppy in making their film that I think they should be banned.  In this movie there are too many silly things that go wrong. They have been trying to make the movie as realistic as possible, but the result is the opposite. For example, the original punchbox film had some good actors, but then they all become ridiculous caricators. I have not seen many films with that sort of stupidity. I don't have to name the actors in "PUNCHBOX", because they are famous, but they are at least famous.  "Puff" is not realistic.  I only tried to make this movie because of its originality, but I was disappointed that it was not accurate to its roots.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was obviously meant to be a romantic film, but this stupid film proves to be totally shallow. There is too much screen time given to non-main-play (such as the characters and the director) and too much in the way of dialog. For the sake of entertainment, we should expect some more interesting characters to be put on the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've heard this film was just made a few weeks ago, and it was made out like a second film about a 'lost' movie. I couldn't believe it. I read the credits about the movie and realized that it doesn't really come out like the film I watched. The story seems to be based on a series of stories and one story just happens to not make any sense whatsoever and goes off to a bad, bizarre ending. I also thought the "B" played by the character that played in "C" is like a puppet-like character, and I can't blame that guy. The guy is too obviously an actor that can't act, and there was no plot whatsoever. The acting isn't really that good either, but unfortunately doesn't go that far behind the mediocre "B", I am hoping the rest of the cast would get better at acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a really big fan of these kinds of films when I was younger, and after seeing this film a few years ago I knew nothing more about them. They are nothing I normally would watch, and that's part of the problem. The acting is simply bad, and the script is absolutely terrible. There are some very clever performances, but the characters simply cannot find anything in their lives that this really matters. As you'll learn, in the film this is very brief and it only contains a few scenes that are pretty amusing. This film is a huge waste of time and I have no sympathy for this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In what's now known as a 'classic' horror film that makes this a really bad film:  If you are into horror films, don't get this one! A story about a serial killer (named 'The Stragilas') is just a stupid, pointless tragedy of some sort. The film doesn't come alive like it should (or should not). The story has no believable characters, which is exactly what the film lacks in all of it's parts. This movie is bad, but I am not sure what this all means. The gore is bad (or even worse) and there's really no point for this film to even be made (unless you consider gore). There is no reason whatsoever for this movie to even exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate it. Even the scene with Peter and Maggie is just an uninspired waste. They act like they are actors and they are, if nothing else, horrible actors. And they can only act in a ridiculous number of boring scenes, where we are told about what happened in the past, and we are bored by them. They just won't have any more big scenes. This movie was bad, so bad that it should never be mentioned. This is not the first movie I've watched that comes out after I've seen the "I Spy" trilogy, and there are plenty of other movies that need more people to catch these movies, like the "Iceman 2". This movie is not even an OK one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was bad in a number of ways. I found the dialog dialog funny, but I also hated the plot. I also thought the actors were just stupid. The plot was too simplistic, so it had little to do with the actors. I was disappointed with the ending. In fact, the ending is so bad I actually was tempted to leave the movie on the DVD, with all the characters and the plot gone. I do not believe there will ever be a film like this again. I think the writer of the film should give credit where he stands. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a comedy. It's very dark and very boring. A lot of foul language, very few jokes, some pretty good scenes and a decent cast. But there are a lot of cheap plot tricks which don't seem to help the movie. The plot is so weak, you can hardly tell where the next shot will be.  The film is completely unrealistic in its own way. There are some pretty funny scenes, but the movie is too convoluted to make it believable.   I recommend going through the entire film with a very dry and boring face transplant. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So i was hoping that this would be one of my great, classic films of all time. Sadly, even after watching it I just couldn't take it seriously. To the extent that this movie was not a bad comedy, I'd like to see it again if I could. It is just plain awful. It could have been a lot better than the "You're a genius" joke in "Where the Frogs Go" or any other movie: the idea of having sex and having sex with friends is far more serious and important than the slapstick comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a ripoff of "Sudden Kiss" with the original cast and crew, but it did so much less with a weak script and an awful plot. The acting was terrible throughout the movie. This was really one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If you liked the original, you'll like it more.   There's one more reason I can't see this movie: this is the movie that taught me to watch The Wonder of Growing Flowers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it would be more accurate to call a movie of John Lynch's "Zombie High" and not "Zombieland" - which is the word "Zombies" most commonly used - as being a movie set in "the 1980s", and not a movie from John Lynch himself.  While the story is good - a story of a zombie slaying and a woman who comes to a "special" place in a hospital - I don't think it matters. If I had even the slightest bit of interest in a movie with a story like that, I would at least expect a very interesting film.  John Lynch, as such, couldn't even begin to come up with a plot that would be good. The story was horrible. I thought that the zombie girl, who kills in a basement and is saved by a cop, was a great idea, but she seems to be a moron. What happened was what was supposed to happen and the cop said that they should get her out, but that's not a good thing to say. The cop didn't try to escape and got murdered.  The zombie girl ended up getting killed in a shootout with the police and then that was pretty bad. I don´t want to put her in a body bag and put her back on the ground. In an film where the audience is forced to sit through a scene that is totally unbelievable - I couldn't believe that she was even killed.   If you watch the first scene, you'll see a story for a zombie-killing. I believe that, if you are willing to look at it closely, you can get a better view of it. But you can't see it as you would have expected. What matters more about "Zampire High" is the plot. The whole film revolves around how it got a zombie going down a mountain and the zombie ending. Unfortunately, you really don't get to feel anything about it.  "Z Vampire High" isn't worth it. It doesn't have a storyline - nothing happens, nothing interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After an hour and a half of a break, I pulled the cord for "A Night of Madness." I was excited to see the series and was hoping it would be a well-received series. Unfortunately, "A Dark Night" just does not deliver on it's promise.  A Night of the Wolves is the second most infamous movie ever made. It's so bad I can't quite fathom how this show has managed to make it. The worst thing in this movie is its cast, who aren't actors worth a second. Most of the movie is either so lame, so bad they have been replaced or replaced by "Pistalo" or "Cawold," as well as being replaced. When I originally saw the episode, it came on a night that I was in a hotel room on the set with a bunch of the actors and their characters. It was painful to see those characters for the first time and they weren't even in that hotel room. I had to turn the camera to the monitor, and I was disappointed and embarrassed for my time. Some people say this is a great way to advertise a movie, but I don't think that is what these people do. They put up this pretentious, fake-gorgon style movie that pretends to be a "true" horror movie. What does that even mean? Who would you expect to see in a movie? It's not that simple. The acting is horrible and the ending is terrible. The movie is so bad, I don�t even think there is a horror movie that would ever be this bad. I do have a couple of other movies that I would like to view, but this is the only one. If you were really interested in the genre of horror, you wouldn�t be interested in watching "A night of the Lions." The plot is the least important aspect of this movie. It does have a few interesting ideas, but it's terrible when it comes down to showing the characters in their unnatural and disgusting situations. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was really stupid and one of the worst I've ever seen in my life. I am a really simple person, and to me this film does nothing for me. If you are expecting a film about the true story of a guy being crazy and insane, then you will not enjoy it. If it was just about a stupid, goofy dude, that would make me laugh. If this was about an insane, insane guy, then that would have been a laugh right along with an overblown hair. It is a shame that there is no real plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of Sci-Fi and I have to admit that this movie has been an embarrassment in my opinion. It's just one episode of a series that is only meant to entertain the viewers, not a movie I would care to see. It has absolutely nothing but a pretentious story, no characters that matter at all, and no characters from anywhere. The movie is just a few minutes of one thing, a girl (I think it's a female, but not sure because the video was not given to her) who is going to a big party and getting ready to get drunk. This girl is in an apartment for a few days and a lot of guys (like the guys in the beginning of the movie) arrive and she meets all of them, but she doesn't seem to care about her friends. She gets the beer and drinks some, but then they all leave and she has a really annoying guy (like a guy named Nick) waiting to get with her. He is a big asshole, and then she goes on the bus to some weird hotel in an abandoned hotel and does crazy stuff. When she arrives at the party, there are some guys who show up and try to get her, and she is pretty embarrassed. At the hotel, she does this strange dance and does all the sexy stuff, but this whole thing just seems like a really stupid attempt at an excuse to put more sex in it. The girl finally leaves the party and goes back to that one hotel room, but at that very moment, Nick (Nick) comes back and starts kissing the girl. I guess she had an idea that the people in the party might not be drunk because there was some kind of weird person behind her, but that was probably the only time that she remembered seeing a bunch of drunk guys around. Then all the guys started getting involved, and after she's finished dancing and drunk, Nick pulls her down to some strange place. He keeps saying weird things to her and stuff, and there's this really annoying thing where he keeps saying the same word for a while. Then there's the movie's ending, which is a really ridiculous and embarrassing ending. I can't believe that she got up to the big party on a Saturday, and all the alcohol had to be dumped. I really felt like watching the movie for about 10 minutes, and the only thing that made me want to watch it was that it was just another horrible movie (or sex movie). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Warmers' Town" is an awful and predictable movie about a town in the early 1900s where the local inhabitants and people are all scared to kill a family of people that has been "hunted" by the army. The main villain is the evil preacher from the town who wants to lure the town people into a trap. But the town is so much empty, nothing remains, and there are no "casset" characters for the viewer to root for.  The film tries to be funny but doesn't really work. The town is portrayed as a small town with lots of people, and it doesn't help the story because of that. The actors are terrible and poorly conceived. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was horrible, but I do have sympathy for the actors. I thought it could have been so much better if they brought a real acting teacher into the story and let the audience see him in an act. Then I would have enjoyed the movie more if the actors and the audience got to know the character and knew why it was bad. I think the plot didn't come together, but it did for the ending. In my opinion, the end was not great. The plot does have a certain charm to them, but in reality it is not very good. I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a piece of cardboard. I mean, that's all I have to say. I won't give this movie a 2 because it's an OK movie with some amusing moments and the fact that the ending will be out later is disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a couple of people who decide on a relationship to a person that is not their father. That is a terrible idea to have on a sitcom. To summarize, the premise is that someone is the father of the main characters, and the main character is the daughter of the person with a girlfriend who is not the father. This is extremely bad, but there is no conclusion which would make this funny. The funny joke in this movie is that the main actor is the grandfather of the two protagonists. The grandson is the son. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has some great acting and some good special effects, but then you have to go through it with nothing but the story, characters, and very badly written. I am a fan of the original, and would like to see the same movie without the crap. I didn't even see the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains no storyline, much like the other recent Disney film: "The Mighty Mighty Mighty Man" which I would never see. The best part of this movie was when it got out that this movie is based on a cartoon character. It is no more. This movie lacks any kind of storyline, plot, direction, or even storyline development.  In other words, the movie is about how boring and pointless it is. It seems that this is the only film that has ever been made that has to follow this ridiculous plot and the ridiculous plot of the Mighty Mighty man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find the whole movie, although a "Hollywood" film, only half so. The only interesting parts are the initial encounters (for example, an early scene involving a man in a movie shop) and the ending. The acting and the story line are completely lacking, even the ending is not complete. It is about as bad as anything from "The Brothers" or the movie itself, and the characters seem so bad-tremaine as if they were made on a computer. The plot is very poor, with little plot and no depth. Not even the dialogues or the performances are developed. The characters are basically actors (as usual for genre), and the plot is pretty simple and only concerned with a couple of lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is pretty bad. Not worth seeing, but not as I thought it was. But, I did appreciate it for the novelty of having a man, a man and a woman with a big, scary car, and a really, big, horrible car, driving into the road. It was a fun idea, but it seems like they just forgot to put the car's name and made him the main protagonist.  My one thing is that it wasn't a movie, more a music video, like a car jingle. It just seems like this movie was a movie that was put out in a few weeks and it got out at the store after people saw it, and it didn't get the same message, because they didn't see it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is bad, it is boring, and bad. The characters are horrible, the characters are poorly developed and the characters don't do anything interesting. There was an interesting and scary woman who was one of the great villains in the book and she turned out to be a very stupid person who just wants revenge. This film didn't bring anything new to the film. It is bad in every way and I couldn't figure out the story because it does nothing new. The story is the same as usual bad books and the story and the plot is bad. Don't watch it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the late 70s, it's no secret that the 'Buckman' was considered a pretty weak performance, even if its an Oscar nominee. But the Buckman itself was more interesting than it was at the time. Even in 1976, it was not exactly the typical film of a 'Buckle' detective. The scene where Bucky enters the backseat and sees his brother's girlfriend dead made that more difficult. But then there's one scene in which the two of them are locked in a car, in which they are connected with the killer, making their first scene together. Well, it seems to have been that scene's second victim in the car at some point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was predictable, even worse than any of the other previous movies. It never managed to be anything remotely interesting.  Just like the other recent TV series, "The Omen", it failed to capture any of it's parts, and when I had my hopes in its conclusion, I failed to realize how much it had to do with its premise. It's overwhelming in a way that it could have been kept a similar level of quality, but the characters weren't as engaging as they were supposed to be, although it did manage to keep a solid 2.5 out of 10.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some really good films that are excellent but this film is awful. The first few minutes of this film were pretty funny and I enjoyed it. But then, the "story" is just plain old trash! I mean, it's really only three minutes. There was some nice stuff that was interesting to watch and the story had some interesting moments but there is absolutely no plot. What it all adds up is just stupid-the movie tries to be a big picture, while it doesn't. So if you are a huge fan of these types of movies, you might want to give this one some thought. But if you like these types, you'll probably be bored with the rest of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going out of my mind about this movie but I just don't have the energy to say anything about it. I've read the review on this movie and can tell you that it's about as bad as I can get. And if you've seen "The Us" it's pretty darn obvious why. It's not even funny as all of the things that make this movie laughable. This movie really isn't that funny, really.   Even the most annoying parts are pretty good, like when a giant dinosaur lands on a mountain on the beach in South America. But most of the movie is about some guy that dies for some reason. I'm thinking that was probably the most ridiculous and most stupid scene in the movie (he's a millionaire!?) And this is supposed to be a movie about a real person, who lives in the South Pacific? You know who this person is. He's not one of the many people that's in this movie. He has no idea about movies, the only person that's set to talk in this film is "the guy", who we're supposed to hear talking about and who we've never heard of. He just talks about everything for no apparent reason. Also, I'm not sure if the scene where the guy tries to get into a hot tub with a girl in it is actually meant to be funny, I think it's not. I did go to the movies in between the "The Expendables" and "The Fast and Furious" and I didn't find any of the people in this one to be remotely funny.  And to be honest, there's nothing like that happens in the "Fast and Furious: The Challenge of The Titan". All of the stuff that you see in this part is just boring, stupid stuff, and not even that funny. If you've ever seen a movie that is this bad, you know exactly how the writer got it into the movie.  Bottom Line: I don't recommend this movie: it's bad for any kind of person, especially me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the idea of an interesting, interesting movie, but unfortunately, when the first one is finished, I lose some interest in it.   As it stands today, this movie is very weak in terms of acting. If you really wanted a film that was going to be a "classic" one, then you wouldn't be disappointed.  I found this movie to be very poorly acted in some parts. While the lead actors are excellent, they don't seem to make their characters stand out.  If you were a little bit interested in watching this movie and are looking for something new, maybe a little more action would be added to it. I don't think there will ever be a movie like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film seems to be aimed at kids who have learned that it's a stupid TV show, but when it's not quite dumb it just gets on. It's not original enough to make me recommend it. The plot is very predictable and the characters don't seem like characters at all. The "show" of course is boring and pointless. It will be difficult to get to grips with the characters. It also seems like there was no reason to even watch this film. The best thing to say about it is that it isn't scary. It just seems like it is supposed to be a bunch of young people who have had some stupid "parenting classes" and are scared of having their friends killed, but the whole thing comes down to having their lives ruined for the sake of a TV show. I wish I had to put my two cents into this pile of trash, but don't let me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was pretty good, but the characters were horribly wooden, and the plot was utterly stupid. It felt like watching a film of "D&D" where a group of heroes is suddenly attacked and surrounded by zombies in a house full of zombie corpses. When they're later forced to dig out the dead corpses, they're not allowed to escape. The result is that there's a lot of gore. When we finally see the zombie is attacked by a large zombie horde of zombie soldiers, the zombie soldier is just a zombie that is holding one zombie corpse, and not an army of zombies. This is ridiculous. This film isn't bad, but it just doesn't have much in common with the rest of D&D. The best movie I've ever seen is the "Curse of Doom", and this has just been completely subpar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As is the rest of the world, "TREATS 2.0" is just another bad movie that includes nothing but some lame, old b-movie dialogue and some bad movies are generally good at getting the best American audiences to see them, and this is no exception. For the sake of money, you can get into a movie: 'THE BIG BOP ON THE BACK' starring the famous 'DEREck' 'Elley' (more like 'Tick' or 'Elke') is about a half-nail of a little, hot-blooded, blonde teen (aka 'Tickle') and it is stupid, and it's just bad, it's not really interesting. Some may call the original 'TREAT' a classic film, but they can't agree. When I first heard about the movie, I thought it was interesting, but then I didn't understand the meaning behind it. It is really like a bad copy of "Elleya" (or 'Elleeza') and I think the original is better at avoiding things that are boring and confusing. In case the makers knew what they were doing, I'm sure 'TICK' is about 7% of the time they were in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I'm a human being... and you've probably don't know me well enough to tell me what I do... I'm a girl with a penchant for having sex... and having lots of sex. And, unfortunately, I got caught in this whole mess. And I didn't even think I was a slut, I just wanted to see myself naked on the couch, and there's nothing I can say that would make this more upsetting than what I was about to have in a relationship with you.  So...  How did it come to be?  I don't really understand it... my feelings for you don't come from the right place. Maybe I was being persistent and then I decided to see you naked... you're obviously attractive, and a lot of men know that, and they're not all too concerned about the risk of the sex. Even if you're not a slut... I don 'feel' too bad to be in love with you and you don 'know' it's too risky to do anything, and yet you chose to be involved with me.  The only reason I wanted to be with you is that I wanted me to do something. But then the thing gets done and I donít want to see me naked and do anything to you. And the more I tried to keep you in your life, I was only interested in having sex with you so that you could see me. I was stupid, I didnít care what you thought, and you couldn't wait for me to see what happened to you after you gave me everything. When I finally decided to do everything to you... I realized that you were really stupid.  Anyway, I really didníte want to be there but I was having a much easier sex life and a long time to go there and do everything that would normally happen at a university.  Then I started to think that the only thing I could say to you would probably upset you in a college situation was that you wouldníve done anything to me...  Then you doníve should have been able to do what I asked of you. I'm not that person.  I can't remember what happened before I started seeing you... but at the beginning of the night you could tell me to a very scary man, and I didnīt really know if it was your father or a relative who were a part of the study group. It probably wasnī.  Now, I'm obviously not that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for about 3 minutes and I didn't like it. There was very little to recommend for it. The story was boring, and the way the story is about a girl who falls for a boy is the most stupid one I have seen in a movie. I was wondering whether the actor or the director gave this plot a specific direction. The fact that the girl's boyfriend is a teacher and not a student is a huge waste of time. The idea of a real teacher is so bad, that I was actually tempted to tell him to leave the movie on the DVD and save the story. I didn% like the ending. The boy's girlfriend is never shown at the end of the movie. The ending is so slow, you feel like they are going to catch something, and then it just ends. So, what happened? The fact is, I had fun watching it but was only wanting to see something better. Why didn't I wait for the other ending. I can't tell if it was due to my feelings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, the movie was really boring and extremely predictable (see The Girl in a Mask) and it also lacked a decent plot. The storyline was predictable and a completely predictable ending was only to make matters worse. This movie was horrible, in an over-the-top way. Not sure how I can turn this from 1 to 1 into something better. I am surprised that this movie was even given as a rating. This is a movie I would never rent. Even so-what were they expecting? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people in this movie make me scream and laugh at the title of this movie.  What is that? The title (or its title) says that it is a comedy, but is really just a horror movie. The only way that this movie could possibly redeem itself is that it had a really cheap budget. As someone who works in an office environment, you just can't make it look like a horror film. Even if this was a budget movie, it is bad and poorly made. If a movie could be a horror but cost $60,000, it would be perfect. If you were to see a movie that has that title, a horror that costs $40,000 or a horror title that has more than 1,000 dollars for an actor, you would probably just spend $40 and watch it only as a horror.  If you decide to rent this movie, avoid it. Avoid it at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointing movie. The acting wasn't as good as it was expected, but the plot did not make much sense. The whole thing was just about the "twinning" of the movie. I think it was so weak that I would have to really see if something had ever been filmed in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an awful waste of some of the good stuff in the previous "Laws" series. The big story was the "Kangaroo" of its title. While this was very true, there were far too many annoying situations in this one, and the way it tried to keep things secret was just bad. The premise was the old, but amusing little cartoon. There was little more interesting than the idea that this guy, who has a magic gun, can turn into a black gorilla (and turns to a little monkey)! But I felt sorry for the actor and the idea of the "black gorilla" in this movie. The fact that the other characters became white and had black hair made this movie a little worse, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the second of what amounts of stupidity I have seen in a movie. The first one was, "Lise Ailes", directed by James DeSidio, who had the misfortune of winning the Oscar for his failure. The second one was "In Another Way". I saw "In One Way". It was very bad, but I think the story is quite good. I mean, that the story does manage to be true, even if some parts are completely ridiculous. However, there's nothing about it that makes me want to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just awful... If you are a horror movie fan like myself, you would find this one a chore on the worst day of a movie... It's a pity because it is SO bad it is really hard to see. There was a lot of sex scenes and some nudity which were totally ridiculous and should never have happened but it happened and it was probably caused by the original movie director. The only thing that made this movie was a stupid premise which we can't believe in because it was in fact a horror film. This is probably the worst film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first two hours of the film, I was entertained at a good chunk of the movie. But when the film came up again with a sequel, I couldn't care. They had to be real good and the plot should stay. But this is just not the way to write a sequel.   Now the first film had a good idea, with a funny premise, it was something to watch with a few friends. The second film didn't. Not a great plot but a decent cast and a funny cast but the overall story was pretty stupid. I'll never have another film with this type of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had no redeeming value for me. The plot had very few surprises. The acting was flat, the characters were flat, and the acting was bad. There were no surprises. I am sure there was a reason why this film is so bad. I mean, if it were good, it would be a movie: a film like this would be. In fact, it didn't deserve to be. If you've got to see this, make sure you don't rent it. The ending is really terrible. If your kid is in it, and if you don you like, you'll hate it. I'm very disappointed I had to pay my $250 to rent it and the movie doesn't even deserve to have your attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that people have tried to claim to be the best that ever filmed, EVER, BUT EVER: THAT CURBED THE ONE ANIME MOVIE EVER, with the WORST ONE FOR A WOMAN IN COLOR!!!  It's a pile of garbage! The whole movie is full of stupid scenes, the acting is so bad, and the story is really bad (as always)!!! Just think it's about a girl named Maya, and that it is about a romance between her and a guy (or guys) who comes to meet Maya, who then is killed in the movie. If you want to keep track of your favorite movie: you should probably watch this one: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are three reasons this film is not good: 1 - the fact that it is not a documentary. 2 - the production quality and sound, 3 - the lack of a storyline. I can't believe this is a documentary, even for a documentary it's a piece of trash. In the past I thought of a documentary that was a documentary only for about 20 minutes. This is a horrible documentary that shows nothing except for a few scenes of a man walking down a road. I think they would have been better had a documentary show the fact of man killing his neighbor.    You could say it was a short film but I think you should take more than two hours and sit in a room and watch the DVD over and over. If it were for a movie, I'd give it a 10 out of 10 but it was so bad, I couldn't even say anything about it because it made so many mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just went through my local video library and watched this film...and was absolutely disgusted. I mean, if there is something to be expected from a movie this poor to even be filmed...what... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most lo-maged film in the history of cinema. I mean, it is pretty bad, really. It's very confusing, it doesn't make any sense and it doesn`t make any connection to any character whatsoever. All the acting is bad. It really seems like they just made some kind of movies on a laptop, in order to get a shot. At the end of the film, all the actors (like the female lead and her assistant) were forced to make a scene that wasn`t in the original "I Spy it!". I guess it was a cheap movie, made on some computer or DVD-screen. All this is really annoying. The actors and the girl really don`t get any story to go with the rest. When they do finally make it to the end, you just get a "good movie" and they suddenly disappear and the credits are still there. This is bad stuff! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know how to find this movie, it was only a small box or a DVD, I rented it at my local video store, because that was the first I had seen it. I was very surprised to learn that the DVD is just one of the many DVD movies that Hollywood puts out nowadays. I can't imagine what kind of movie this is... I have never even seen a movie that this poor, low-budget movie could be. This is a bad waste of money to rent, not even worth the money. I could not even fathom the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So far, I am wondering why they put this movie in a top 5. I've never seen it in my life. What is it? Well, I'll tell you. This movie is just terrible to watch, and so terrible to finish. The acting is terrible, and the plot is horrible, the only thing that keeps this movie from being a classic film is the music. This is an attempt to keep it alive, but you really can't tell how that will be accomplished. It could have been better than the first film if they just dropped the entire acting to a lower end. The story is not even interesting. The dialog is terrible. I just can't take it that this movie is supposed to be funny. It is about a small group of people who do nothing but kill their friends and then have a bunch of dumb teens to do with them. In one scene there are some zombies running around screaming. Then the hero has a gun that shoots those zombies, but then all of them run around, and I don't see why.  The acting isn't nearly as bad as the other two movies I've seen this year. The performances were better. This was a bad film, but the movie would be better if they made some more time to work it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Pursuit of God" is a typical "B" movie that you'll find in the trash rack.  A brief plot, a couple of vampires, some vampire hunter, a girl who becomes involved with a mysterious scientist and (spoiler!) he keeps killing his enemies.  Then, in a weird twist, it's suddenly turned out to be a Vampire with a girlfriend who has some psychic ability, thus taking over a whole lot of town! A lot of plot lines go awry, some aren't resolved, some are not resolved...  But overall, it is a bad film that is nothing but a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Just awful. I really think the reason the movie went so low was to make the storyline look more realistic. Not at all. I'm just glad that the other actors survived this fiasco and the entire story was left behind... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Last Son" is the absolute worst film: a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of John Giardana's "Pipulvus" movies. This one seems to be an even worse copy of his book. The plot is almost entirely based on the movie "Strayer" that was made 30 years ago. They used the whole "PIPulvius" premise of the book, but not in the way that it should have been used.   This movie is no exception, though, it does try to be a film about the events of John and Annisa Giarda's relationship, with Annisa appearing to be very involved in this film. The only thing that I thought this movie was a good was the special effects of the movie. But this isn't a movie that has special effects. It does not look like a real film. This movie was just some sort of a film to be shown on TV and made to look like it. In fact, it doesn't look like anything! The film itself does not even look like something, I mean I don't even see this in the US anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the first 2 episodes of this movie without reading the rest. The episode that was closest to my mind was the episode where all of the women (Bereziah and the black girl) get dressed in ridiculous outfits, one episode had a naked woman in a wet wet tanned body wearing a nice shirt while the others put her in a bikini. I was hoping to see this movie in a better movie, but it is so bad I have to put it on hold until I can find another movie that isn't just garbage. I'm not sure why this movie got so much attention because this movie is so much like other movies that would have been released at a time where the movie would have even been released. The director (Mr. Ben-Wei is the director of this) tries so hard to make it sound like this, but he simply can't make it look good. The only good thing about this movie was that it was made in a movie studio. I will admit that I was disappointed because I knew nothing about this. But the movie isn't a movie that anyone would really want to watch and I have never heard of anyone saying "oh good, you can't tell how I've seen this movie!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just plain bad. We can't even put this beyond the fact that this has been out in the air for weeks. The plot is stupid as much as it is stupidly absurd. The idea of "the badest movie ever made" is absolutely false. The acting is awful, the direction is bad, and the production is bad. There are not many surprises here, although some are extremely interesting. This is bad to the Biz and a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The name of this movie is "Jinxed", but I just can't think of anything that's better. The whole movie is very predictable. The two leads are in one line and then we see another line in another. When one of the leads dies, the story moves forward to the next guy, and then you can pretty much guess what will happen next. A couple of "newbies" are supposed to try to save the two guys so they can get a job. Then it ends up with a bad guy blowing up his girlfriend, and killing off both of them.  If I'm a fan of the game, I will not waste my money.  But if you think you'll like this movie, you're wrong. You'll want to rent it for free. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best movie of 1993, not only the worst one of the 1993 summer's new wave of films, is "Fantastic Creatures", a little bit of slapstick satire. Unfortunately, the premise of this film (the real story of the great creature, the real "monster" being one of his three or four children) is so dumb that you can see it's just about as dumb as possible for a major Hollywood film about a major film:  This movie is about two of the worst creatures ever filmed, and they are so dumb as to not know where to go next. The movie also has a ridiculous plot, involving a "good" mother, a "bad" father, and a "big" monster (the "monstrous" creature) and is full of the same cliché "trash" scenes that are featured in every movie, and only half-watched, and then only because this movie has a decent storyline (since the movie is so bad). If you're not the kind of person who would appreciate "Fantic Creatures", I highly recommend making the first thing you watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of a film. If you've already seen this, you'll think you've wasted your time. I am sure someone was supposed to pay for it. And you will never be able to find it, since they have taken off this site's funding in order to promote this horrible piece of trash. (I am a film fan, so my comments are strictly not about the movie).  If you're going to see this, then I really hope you will see it at some point. Do not let your time pass to make up for wasted money. If someone wants to spend money, then they should go to Hollywood to see "A Dirty Billion Dollar" and see if that's a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am baffled. The story was so bad that I had to go to a small group of friends and watch all of the movie so they could understand it. But the acting in this movie just really sucks. It's just not interesting, which is just what I expect.  I don't remember when they are filming this movie because I lost a few hours of my time watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this is really the case. It is so shallow and uninteresting that you can almost see it as a movie made in a studio like that of a Hollywood blockbuster.  I don't really like the plot. But, after a few hours, you find yourself having the opposite. It's not a movie to be made, because it isn't a movie about the "big" movie, like The Searchers. It was made by a bunch of people in a lab, who are probably not familiar with movies like this.  There are no realistic characters, and the camera is not great either. I don`t really remember why I had my interest in this movie. Maybe it was a few days, when someone could find an interesting person on the Internet and see that it was about a movie: it has been done, and it doesn`t have to be done again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad news for those who knew the movie would be hilarious, but anyone who didn't look into it would find it hilarious. Unfortunately, it was horrible. I was expecting to like the movie but I didn't. I didn pretty much like it but it just wasn't funny. I don't see this movie as an indie film, a major disappointment for me. It had the bizarre idea of a boy's girlfriend who's best friend is her mother, while her best friend's father is the man she hopes to marry.   Also, I thought it would be funny if the girl got married to the man. I thought the joke would work with the two characters in the movie, and it didn't! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film that depicts some women as stupid, and we find it pretty hard to believe that it could have such a bad plot, or like a storyline that isn't completely made, this one is full of the worst jokes. It is painfully obvious that the women involved are trying to find out about what happens to the people in the film when the family in question is left alone and their father returns home. As if that's not a spoiler then I'm right, it is.  It is pretty much the opposite. There are many scenes that have a female character in the lead that are simply unnecessary and just plain mean-spirited, and the only moment that even seems interesting is when the female is talking to a guy about what happened to their husband. The film then spends a lot of time trying to make a relationship seem so miserable and so painful that the viewer can empathize with the character's pain and make her cry. There is no ending. This is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can tell you that there is absolutely no connection whatsoever between the "good" part of this movie and the "bad" part. I think that it can't help with the fact that the "better part" is also the "worst" part, as the viewer is subjected to the worst elements that are in the "evil" part's film, such as the rape, torture, violence, and torture (in the end, to be specific, it is the killing of a pregnant woman, the destruction of a couple's house, the torture of a girl's father, the death of a child, and the torture and execution of the boy). What really should be the main theme of this film? Well, the fact is that the torture is not even that big a deal compared to the horror scenes that were in the previous part (or in the movie itself), so I'll just add a few more details about the torture scenes, and let the viewer know.  If I'm going to do an hour-long documentary like this, I'll have the two actors and the crew and some of the people involved directly come to my home and watch this film for myself.  The film itself may be interesting, but I would rather not waste any more time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a few more interesting discussions than this one - but this movie is an embarrassing attempt at some sort of satire that just doesn't work. At the end of the film, they finally "kill" the person, who "cripples" the protagonist. The other characters have no apparent identity in the film - in fact, they're almost indistinguishable from the bad movie - and I think it should have been a little easier. At least one of them does make a contribution to the story - another one is the "resurrected" person - and they aren't there at all. They're merely one of two people who "resure" the story. They can't identify the rest. In a funny but not terribly disturbing way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just plain bad, but the movie itself does not provide much worth discussing. It's a bad idea with a bad plot, a bad story (since the "lumberjack" is too creepy, to give it its due), a bad dialog (since everything goes weird and scary, but only a few bits are good), a pretty bad plot (the dialog is not quite creepy, but it does a bit), and the only good thing about this movie is that it has so much in it that it doesn't have to hide. The plot is pretty good--that it has a plot, and it has some good jokes, and this movie lacks some of the most important things that movies in which people try to do (like the humor, the drama, and the characters). However, it isn't nearly as good as a good movie would have been. The acting is very poor. A few scenes were interesting but most of the rest were awful. I am surprised to learn that this movie has gotten so far. But then I'm surprised to realize that it is so bad that it's so good to have so bad a bad video. In the end, I think the movie is bad for the whole family. This is not worth seeing, and if you've already seen it, you can pretty much skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the comments on this article, I did not think it was even a good movie. This movie is bad, but not even worth watching. But it does have some of the good elements to be an interesting movie. But what makes that an interesting part is the fact that it's not that movie is interesting. I mean the idea of making a game. The fact that the game is so bad that even a fan of it has no idea how it is made and why it is a game? The idea of a movie is the idea that it can entertain someone, but it can't actually entertain anyone. That's why I can't believe this movie is an actual movie, but if I'm doing something, I'm interested. The idea that a movie can be good but has a horrible storyline is simply that the movie is horrible. For example, "The House On Fire" is actually pretty good. The plot is quite good. But the movie just isn't interesting. If you are looking for something that can entertain you, you'll enjoy a movie, and a movie isn't bad because it's interesting enough. For this movie, that isn't the case. There are some interesting scenes, but that's not what is the movie's problem. It just isn had nothing of interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is just like the infamous The Adventures of Indiana Jones movies from the 1990s. There is no plot, it's only a ridiculous overproduced video game, and a few gags (like a cartoon with a little girl as a heroine). And it's not really a comedy. A real problem in this film is that the story is basically about a princess, princess (in most of the cases), and her "bachelors" so that she can escape her father's death, and she falls in love with him. Then, of course, the princess dies and she has to find out that she's in love again, but not as she is portrayed in the original film. The plot is about a romantic relationship between two (almost identical) characters (in some cases exactly the same) that includes a lot of rape and rape by a princess with a bodyguard. And this movie, along with many other films based on this idea, is a complete waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad that you wonder why you have ever seen it. It is extremely low budget, stupidly paced, extremely cheesy, and not even remotely funny. If you want to see a movie with a plot, make it yourself. If not, at least watch "The Incredible Years" and "Superheroes 2". Those are actually much better than this film. This movie, by all means, is bad, but not worth seeing. I cannot wait to see another sequel of this movie, and I will be sorry to say that it will not survive. If it is not killed, it will at least be removed from the shelves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are many reasons that this movie was a waste of film time and money. First, the fact that it was made this many years after the events of "Spirant" and that this film is based on the mythology of the vampire. It's just not interesting enough for a real film to be made. Second, the acting is awful. It can't act like any other vampire vampire movie with even a little dialog. Third, the plot is not too well written to match the original, which I have read over a hundred times, and the movie lacks the realism of the original movie.  Last, this movie contains two sets of characters - the first is a married vampire with her husband and a young vampire that has taken him hostage. The second is a mother with her own vampire, and she is the "victim" in a vampire murder plot.   Finally, my rating is 1-10 due to the fact it lacks a plot. That said, this was worth watching if for something else. If anything, this is not the only vampire film that is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was terrible, I thought of a worse version of "Indiana Jones" starring in an ape-like person. Even though I like Jones, i think that it got a bad name, with the idea that it's an ape man. They put "The Last Cracker" in the middle and the "Crony", "The Fatsy" and the other animals appear in the beginning, but they're all boring. I am just having fun with these scenes. But this is a very disappointing episode. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After I made a small visit, my wife, a regular attender of the convention, began making me and her even more curious as to what I would do next. We decided that a "Cabaret" would be our next visit and what we thought to be a horror film. When we arrived, we discovered that it was one of those old, wooden, plastic-shorts. It was, however, a very disturbing and very bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I noticed when watching this movie was how totally lame it looked. After seeing the first 20 minutes, it became unbearable. They were so over-stuffed with boring, meaningless scenes that they should have known better. If only the directors knew what they were doing. If they had a clue on how they could make movies, they would have been great. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The first 20 scenes were either so boring that they made a mockery of the plot, or they were so poorly made that they completely ruined the film, and it was hard to find who was responsible for the failure.  This is easily the least exciting movie I have ever seen. The second thing I note was the plot. There was no way for me to be more shocked when they put a camera there and then put it in the wrong direction. It could have been a "spaghetti" movie and just as good as the first one. They just left things out in the middle.  The third thing I noted was the character. It was too much like a comic book, instead of the comedy of the first movie. They had no idea what they should be doing in the first place, and were just left at the beginning of things, with no storyline, and with no real plot. A little more time, perhaps more real story, and they would be able to make a real movie, but that would have the potential to be better than the first.   Oh well, that's just my opinion. The only thing I can say is that this is the worst movie that I have seen that I've ever seen, and that's a pretty high score. The good thing was the good things that came from it. I was not mad at the direction they chose, because I enjoyed it and loved it. But this was just too much, and I would not have thought there would be so much wasted work. I hope I will never see another one of these awful movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are really interested in this type of genre, and even one like "I Love You", then you would surely pay money for it. As the title suggests, it isn't. It isn't a movie, it is a very painful one-on-one piece of s--that's-what-they-do. In what sense does this film give us a plot? The premise is that there is a secret of some sort (like a curse, but really not the way to go), and then we'll have to pay money to get it. I'm sure I can do that with a few hours in the making of a film, but this is bad on every level. The acting is terrible, the script is terrible. The only redeeming qualities are the music. The camera is absolutely terrible. It looks like they made it with a camera mounted in a basement, the lighting is unbelievable, and the cinematography is pretty good, as well as the lighting.   Oh, I don't know how they managed to make this, but I'm surprised it didn't seem as bad as it appears to me. I mean, I know there are lots of people who have made movies that look like this. But this isn't one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a very disappointing waste of time, though not really terribly bad. However, despite being so bad, it still had an interesting end. Unfortunately, that only lasted a few minutes.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "God" (Sister) can't find a job so he becomes a bouncer at a small town fair. He is successful because he keeps away from the big boys who are in charge of the town, and this is so bad, that the "God"-sober must keep an eye on the "good" boys, the "Prazzzzles" who are responsible for everything, and the rest of the "people who have died, in a case of "God"" a truly cruel and pointless script.  The movie is about a family that needs a car to escape from the cold country of Germany that has already ruined them. This is the end, but not at all.  This movie will probably get a low ratings in my book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just horrible. A really stupid movie with no plot. And when it is a movie, it doesn't really matter. The story is obviously written for a very low budget (I think that the movie had to be somewhere around 50 pages). But it seems to have been written for the TV "show" instead of for the movie itself. Some of the actors have a fairly good script, but I think that doesn't make this movie.  The characters are in really ridiculous situations and you get to know that they're a total piece of crap characters.  And worst of all it seems that it was a cheap movie to make. The director (not the director) is really just some guys that decided to try to make a movie that doesn`t actually have any storyline. The only real thing is that it has to be real for people that are familiar with the genre (such as the audience for it). It really does a poor job. It seems that everyone in the movie is a complete idiot. The ending is awful. It just doesn`n they have a storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had a few days go by since my local film theatre is now closed, so i decided to go with an adventure as a young boy. I was expecting to get to see it, but unfortunately was disappointed. I thought the film was going to be fun, but the story seemed totally lacking in a story and the acting didn't quite fit the movie. I won't give this movie a rating because it didn't even make sense to me. The only saving grace is that i found it entertaining in the wrong way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is some interesting footage from the late 1950's, which is worth watching, if not for the fact that it was the "worst movie of all time". But this is just not a movie: it's just some old lady and her husband talking to her, and she wants to help him find his "old friend". The acting is bad and the characters are just terrible, all in the same old lady. I gave it a 10 because it had some interesting performances, and the plot did somewhat make it more entertaining. But I'm not expecting too much from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie on a DVD and was really disappointed by it. A documentary about a "war" is ridiculous and pointless.  I'm really hoping to see this movie again in its proper context, which isn't the documentary "War on Iraq." The first few minutes were boring and it seemed like a stereotypical, American soldier went out there and had it all in a few minutes. The story line seemed unbelievable and the camera is not set up in a perfect shooting position. There was nothing like the real war. If it's in a similar form, it'd be better.  The acting was mediocre and the story had some semblance, but I had a hard time feeling they were trying to portray the war as realistic.   Overall, I'd recommend renting the DVD to the "war on Iraq" DVD as another film. There's a better place for this to be, than "War On Israel." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of things I really enjoy about "American Horror", particularly the ability to see a horror film. However, I couldn't get past "American Psycho" in this film. The movie seemed like it was going to be a bit slow but really, really slow. In the middle the acting was a bit too slow so it was pretty annoying. The only thing I wanted to say was that if you really like movies like "American Psychonauts" you will enjoy this one too. For example, you can get that "Pete" character back when he's in prison and he is finally released from prison (with the "Cargo Transportation" part). But I don't think that would be much of a good movie, because it just doesn't get the "feel" right. It didn't get there as much as it seems, but it was very disappointing to me.  I wouldn't recommend watching this film in any way. It's a waste of an entertainment. The acting was pretty good but the pacing was horrible. And the story was just about plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie I saw at the local theater was a "movie", that consisted entirely of a bunch of clips and I was bored to death. The plot was weak and was really slow-paced. It was obviously supposed to be about a killer that was "discovered" by the police (or by an amateur sleuth). The killer was obviously a psychopath and there was no real plot. There was a ridiculous amount of gore in the movie, including body parts, genital parts, blood, intestines, etc. The acting was extremely amateur, the music was totally terrible and the plot was extremely stupid and the story just went nowhere. This movie was bad for the most part. The only good parts were the acting and the soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A truly awful movie. Avoid this if you are one sick family or something like this and are not looking for a good movie. I can't wait to see it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I just saw it and couldn't understand what it is. I laughed to make the comments as a "noob" for some "horror" genre movie.  I watched it for a few minutes and watched only a handful of the gruesome scenes to make sure that it was actually a horror movie, and even then I knew that it wasn't horror. But the biggest problem was the fact that the movie wasn't suspenseful, nor interesting. If it had to be suspenseful I would have just laughed for more than 5 minutes. Also I didn't understand the concept. I didn;t understand how to be a horror film. And I didn't understand what the scene "wanted" to be. I understand the word "movie" is used for a horror flick. Why was this not made? Because it is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I have been watching this film since the first time it was shown, and I have read some of the comments on it. It was absolutely the worst comedy ever made, but in a weird way it could have been an OK one. Basically, it became over-designed, pointless, not funny, and worse than the first film "Bitch" in every way except that it was bad, and it was a totally predictable ending.  I'd be willing to say that I was completely disgusted by the ending of this movie, but there are so many things that are just beyond the scope of a movie like this. This movie doesn't have a story, it doesn't allow for laughter, and isn't even funny, as the acting was so bad it was just plain bad, but this doesn't seem to have an end, although I understand that "a movie doesn'' have a finish and it can sometimes happen. I don't want to be disappointed, and if you've got the time to watch it, you may as well do something better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a very poor movie to be made by any industry that cannot afford the resources it needs to put a good story. But it's very obvious that they're unable to put it out. They don't have the money to create this film. Even though it's pretty obvious, the whole thing is just a waste of money. What is the point of having such a film when you don't actually have the resources to build it?  I really did enjoy it once, but was very disappointed at the ending. I don't understand what is even the point in having it made. It is a waste to pay your actors and set your production. The end is so bad that it is more than a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not even remotely original in a way that I would recommend it to someone looking for something that's good. This movie, however, tries to be so bad that you can imagine it's in a small space. You can see it's very hard to see. It's so poorly written that it's just not funny. Even if you're lucky enough to be a part of the "good" audience, you might just be left in a flat in the middle.  What I was looking for was an enjoyable horror film, but there's too much going wrong to make me see it. Not only does it need a talented actress to do something that it lacks, but it has to do that in order to stay interesting. Not sure what was going with the scene and the ending.  The title is not exactly what's going with all the "stressed out" action. It just looks like a couple of guys in a car, talking about how that "movie" had been "stacked" with a few friends. How I know that. You've got to know the guys in the car. And if you can't, you just assume you don't know them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The scene in the episode of the series is like a scene from a Disney movie. The plot is the same as every other movie of the century, but you can only watch the scene and laugh.  I was really disappointed when I watched it. I expected it to be like a documentary, or something like "A Town Under Siege". It isn't. And I didn't understand what they were saying. The scene is only about 10 minutes long. I can't find the ending. There isn't much there, but there are lots of scenes which make you sick. It doesn't make sense. I don't understand why people can act like that for this long. It was like watching a soap or an Italian film. There was nothing interesting about it.  The plot isn't as interesting, but I could care less about it than it sounds. The acting is horrible, and the ending is awful. I give this film two out of 10. I have no confidence in any of the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you liked the first series of the "Planet" series, you'll like this one too. Alas, it's nothing like it was. And it just isn't worth watching. The acting is dull, the plot is shallow, the story is no more than pretentious "explainment" (and a big pretendy 'Bits' gag in the closing credits), and the fact that the production is so far below standard really makes that point plain. For example, the movie begins with the "star" of the original series (Dr. Ramage) walking a dog to the edge of the canyon where he sees that there are some huge bouldom. Oh, wait, that's just in the beginning of a mountain, as in the "Bits" movie. He then meets the man who brought the brawns down there. How are we supposed to assume that this happens during a trip across the desert? I would assume that he's driving his vehicle across the sand and on land, but not. The scenes with the 'Bots' appear to be filmed at a few minutes away from the actual scenes they're filming? It's weird to hear "constant" narration, and they still pretend that they're going to be part of a natural area... OK, that would explain how they filmed it. I think it would have been more interesting to go along with the actual footage instead of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is completely one-sided and one-minded. The first thing I can think of is a lack of feeling and spirit in the film. As someone who loves this movie, I have to ask: who can I get into? Who's in the room when I am sitting there? (And I can say that because there are some really talented people in the cast.) The acting is bad. There was nothing else to help the movie.  This is about a school principal who comes in a moment to try and fix everything and everything but everyone else stays on the floor. A real cliché. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like they want to try this on kids because there is something that appeals to them. The idea of it is that it's about having fun and having sex. I would watch this if I was on a sex education channel. The problem is that there are no lessons whatsoever. I don't have any special interest in a sex-free world and I really don't care one bit about a movie where there are a bunch of sex-perverted people who are trying to kill children.   The plot was probably made for adult audiences. The fact that it is a documentary is no help. It could have been done in one scene in a school classroom if someone showed it to a child (like a child's teacher). The whole movie seems like a child porno on TV. In reality, they are all fucked in a very sick and twisted way. It's not only the people that were abused, but in this case there was no real-world consequence. The people who showed it on TV are either naive or ignorant about the world. They don't seem to have made anything about this movie, which is probably because they aren't smart enough. It was so bad I felt I had to watch it twice and I have been watching it since. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really just cannot believe that people like this movie and are entitled to it. I cannot believe anyone is actually doing this, especially those on the internet. If I am going to watch it, I would probably turn off. I'm sure that it does have a few moments of entertainment, but there is no substance. I do not believe that this movie is worth watching for entertainment. This is just plain bad acting. It is just bad. I expect that people could say that this is some kind of interesting movie. It isn't. At all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just a collection of non-story material. There are no actors in it so you can only wonder what they are trying to accomplish. For example, one of the supporting characters is an evil robot, named "Slimer" and who is able to destroy all of the human race with no explanation whatsoever. There is no plot, no dialogue, no real storyline. The only "plot" of this movie is that one of its characters (Slimor) gets mad, and killed, by a computer virus that spreads like the plague. The "evil robot" never dies, and it does not even stop at the end, and when it dies it's not even killed itself. I have to admit, I was very impressed with the film because it was quite a clever idea, but it didn't work. That's the only reason this movie was so bad. It's just bad, bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was completely awful, but I think it would have been far better to do the same with a much better film with better characters and a great plot. In fact, I think that movie was the worst and worst of the movie, but it was an enjoyable one. But I still couldn't figure out why they were shooting this movie. A lot of stuff seemed to be staged or edited out. This was a horrible mistake, and they should have a better script to work with the actual plot. But in the end it just wasn't fun. And after seeing it, I'm really tired and didn't really enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just found out that in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy the original movies have been dubbed as "The Wizarding World" and then there is the "Wizards" movie which is obviously not a "Lord Of The Rings" movie. It was not that this movie was bad but I did not like it, it was just that it was not really good. I do not have any opinion of the movie other than that it doesn't make any sense. For example, they can't even portray Lord of the Ring and now they are getting more money out of "The Hobbit" film so they can make a good sequel and then release "The War". The "Lord" movies are supposed to be a magical tale of the end of war so they had to make it more magical than that. They got away with that because of the popularity of "Lord". I do feel sorry for this one because it is one of those movies that it should never be. I'll just warn you that if you enjoy it, you will not enjoy "LordOf The Ring" 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a poor movie with a poor plot and a poor dialog. It's pretty much a comedy with some weird jokes. What does that even mean? I don't know. It just sounds pretty ridiculous. The jokes are terrible, especially the stupid ones. I just didn't even know that this was an indie film. It was too annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess it was a bad show in that it was just really dumb, it has to come together like a bunch of actors in some movies, but this movie just seems like a collection of guys that just sort of mumbled out what they were going to do. The plot is so stupid and poorly developed that it's impossible to predict why. The acting was pretty good and the plot was pretty fun, but I'm guessing that it would have been better if the actors were a lot more involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not kidding about the fact that this is only the 2nd most bad movie of this decade.  The biggest problem is the lack of plot. I mean, what plot does this one have? The only thing that this one has is a small handful of people (which I like) which we don't know about. The main plot is about a little girl who, in addition to having a sister, has some mysterious powers. The only major plot thing is a vampire which has a mysterious death. This girl kills the vampire, but there are no deaths on the vampire. The characters were made to be too broad to make the plot, the acting was badly done, and the cinematography wasn't that good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie just after it was released because I was a big fan of the original. It was really bad, with a weak script and the story is really bad. I don't really understand it. A lot of scenes are like they don't happen! I think it's the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The only thing that saved me from watching this is that it was so horrible that I actually cried. I know you can tell that I'm not alone in that, I just couldn't see a good movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing more than a waste of time. The acting is completely amateur and the storyline is very unsatisfying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Pug or Informer" is not even worth mentioning. I have not seen it in several years. There is an odd feeling you get inside when you watch this movie, that is not an exaggeration. And if that is the feeling, then I suppose that this movie is about a couple of guys trying to lure a girl into this horrible little movie, and that's only if the idea of a horror movie was ever part of the story. If that is really the case, then you would be waiting for it to be over, and it would be pointless to continue until the time of the film was over. I couldn't stand to be waiting the end of this movie. It is bad, it is completely stupid, and the plot is so bad that it should not have been part of any film series.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about a bunch of old guys and a guy named Sam the Butler to help him, and the villain Sam goes on to kill an elderly man and all of his friends before getting caught in a violent struggle. But the movie has so many bad scenes and bad characters that it's hard to make the movie work. I guess there's something worth saving a few minutes of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is basically two or three characters. And this is about a really stupid movie. There is no plot, no storyline. This movie is really a stupid movie about how stupid it is. But, let's face it. This is a movie about the two or four people who decide on which person is a better person. When it comes to the end, it is all about how well they believe each other. A movie that is basically nothing but boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just stupid stupid and un-charitable. It looked like it was directed by kids. The whole thing had about 10 minutes of real dialog and was just one thing after another. This movie took a few minutes to watch because the kids were in it.  Now this movie is interesting, but really bad, it is a movie you could see on a Sunday morning at the local diner. It was just another thing I can't believe it has been made. It is absolutely predictable. If I could be tempted by it, I would be very disappointed. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The kids should be the producers to decide whether or not to make movies that have a plot. They don't have that much money to make anything they don't make. I cannot believe that these guys are stupid. They should be responsible for a major part of the movie, but instead of taking it seriously, they have done something else. If they are making a movie, they should take care of their business. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the film to be an uninteresting, uninspiring and stupid film, and had to watch it twice. But I thought, despite the fact that I knew nothing about it, that it was fun, but stupid. I have just seen it at least 20 times. I am a big fan of Christopher Walken, and you'd think I would be the same, if not for the plot and ridiculous acting. So, I thought it was pretty bad. I think you can't say the same thing about Mr. Walken. The acting was OK, but not all the way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a nightmare of a horror comedy where no one can laugh in a comedy and yet it is just awful. I watched this for about 5 minutes and said at the end, 'WOULD NOT HAVE CHALLENGE UP TO THAT EXCUSE THAT IT WAS A FUNNY MOVEMENT!!!! A BANGS MOVED UP TO THE FUN FUN OF ANOTHER MOVIE! The film is just about the idea of one night sitting outside at a campground and having a silly, boring party. The story is predictable and just plain bad. Even the characters aren't doing a decent job. There is a ridiculous scene where there is a drunk, drunk, old guy that grabs another guy at a party and tries to rape the female of his friend. Then there is another guy who tries to get the girl in bed, which is obviously not an illegal thing to do. The next scene when they are done with their sex is about a hundred minutes long and you know that if the characters are in their own house, they are just going to leave and say 'hey, we are done here', and walk away to get dressed up in a suit. I mean what was it that they had to do the sex scenes in that big studio??? It is just bad and totally fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not just the badest of the series, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It is so bad that the show doesn't even make a pret-to show. The acting is bad, the dialog is bad. There are so many horrible things in this movie that it just doesn't make a good show, which isn't even a bad show.  There are a couple of scenes where the characters have a little fun (like one scene where they're doing a bowling dance) but then the movie's over to someone else. I wish I hadn't read this movie and waited for a few minutes to see the ending.  This movie should not have been in the program at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was never good at playing the original character in the series, and when I tried it at school, it didn't work. The story lines were really stupid in an attempt to make an interesting movie.  I thought the ending was just horrible, and the ending is just bad to me. It's not worth investing a lot of money to see the sequel, and that is the reason why this movie was so bad.  This is also an insult to this series' fans. This movie is terrible, and is not even worth the price of a ticket. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have seen in a long time. The story line is totally amateur and the story is weak. They are so bad that they're really trying to make up for their lack of talent. This movie is completely predictable. I can't believe I watched this movie. I did not get to know anything that the actors put in it. I think I just watched it for some time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so badly acted that it doesn't even have any laughs. If you have seen one of these movies, you will know that it is just the opposite. The acting is really terrible, especially the acting by the cast. Most of the acting is terrible. The cinematography and direction are horrible, too much noise and a very disappointing plot (something like a carousel), not the "feel-good" film we expected. The script is pretty good, but not all the songs are done correctly.  I gave this film 2.5 out of 10 because it is worth a 2 or 3 in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is stupid. It was a stupid movie. It got me so that it was a laugh, but not one of my favorites. The acting was horrible, the plot was just OK, and the movie just isn't good enough.   I did see the first two parts, but I couldn't see the end. There are many great movies in which you see many great performances, but this movie only had 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to this movie when it was released, but the movie was way too low budget to be considered as a comedy and too slow to go beyond comedy. It really had nothing in common with other movies in Hollywood, which was a disappointing thing. However, despite its lack of originality and a low budget, there is some amusing moments. But unfortunately, it's all too predictable and it leaves you feeling like you've just spent an hour there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is painfully stupid to try to make fun of "Piggy" while the "Pegon" part is pretty interesting and pretty good. The idea of an animal-as-human-as-"Pig" was stupid. The jokes and antics seemed to come more from the "curious dog" aspect of the film. Most of the scenes were silly and unnecessary. While the movie was OK at the beginning, there was a huge "jerk" element, a bad pace, a slow pacing, and some serious fan-boyish overacting. The best part was probably the scene where the cat was going on a picnic to eat fish. The scene with the cat kissing an octopus in front of her was the highlight of the movie, but it had a horrible dialog when they were getting into it. The movie starts out with a nice plot but turns into a "naked animal" plot. The ending was predictable and the plot wasn't all that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A mediocre movie: bad dialog, bad acting, a bad plot. A bad cast (I believe they are very good actors but the casting in this movie is awful) a bad story. I have seen several bad movies (including this one) and I thought this one was the worst of them. If you liked a good movie: DON'T watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this movie at a discount on the video rental system when it was released, I was a total loser. I thought the first 30 minutes of this film was a real piece of trash. I was too scared to even watch the entire movie again. I am not one of those people who are familiar with "Beverages" or "Bolson's" or any other Sci-Fi horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a typical piece of amateur film making, which relies on cheap production to fool us. For example, the movie starts in a "high school" (though that was never an assumption) in the classroom of some teacher (who we later find out is a serial killer), as the school is completely and totally abandoned. The school faculty members are actually all there and the student is already a victim, as is common in these kind of horror movies. If we want to see these kinds of movies, we need to have a lot more money and a better taste of taste. The story of a young man suffering from a horrific childhood (and now) with a friend is just a glorified version of that of a "classic horror" film of a serial murderer, who kills people and rapes people.  I'd like to see how this movie is made for all the people in the movie, and how they compare the "sport" part of that movie to the rest of it.  The acting is mediocre, but the cinematography is pretty good. The plot is weak, and the film isn't scary at all. The main cast (at least the teacher) are very bad. The only good thing I can say is that this is very cheap compared to a lot of the rest, and you can get it out for the cheapest price.  Overall, this movie should be one of the lowest budget horror movies ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really think this is one of the worst horror films I've seen in a long time. I rented it and I can confirm that the actors acted so bad in it that it's not even a shock to see this movie. I have no knowledge of a credible actor that would make a better film than what this movie does.  I don't see that. It's boring.  The biggest problem with this movie is the ending. There isn't a lot of gore. It has no gore. We just have one girl.  If you liked it before, don't watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A "comedy" film - the kind I've been writing for years. It's really bad. I'm pretty sure it's going to fail this time, but I'll just let you go and watch it anyway. It starts out as a funny, but not very amusing one. Then - the first bit - begins to get a bit strange. I'd have to admit - I thought it was pretty damn stupid when the girl was talking to the guy.  Then - I saw that "The Girl on the Boat" movie, and was glad to see that it was one that had more substance. However, this one didn't. I just can't imagine how you can take a film that is like this and make it fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a movie with a stupid story, i thought of "Wicked" instead. A stupid story with horrible characters.  I think that it is so bad that i gave this movie a 1 rating.  The only reason i give this movie is that it has a decent plot. Unfortunately that was not the case. It was just a stupid premise.  If you are interested, go to the movie: 'Wicked'. It has a plot that is not worth the time spent to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of those movies where you can't find a movie that was actually interesting, but this one isn't one of them. The story is flat, the plot is bad, the acting is bad and the cinematography is horrible. As far as I am concerned, this movie does not have a plot. If it has plot, it could have been pretty good, because it is hard to believe that the actors are in one of the first shows that will be released. This movie doesn't even have any funny scenes. It could have saved this movie, but the actors have never done anything they would normally have done in a play. This is a shame, but there are many more interesting ways to be entertained in films that can't be done in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If a movie had to be about a drunk guy, it would be a fine movie. Alas, it is only about a drunken guy and a bad lady, and that is about as much as it is.  A little too predictable. Just the idea isn't bad enough.   I think the ending was well made, but it seems to be awfully predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad it deserves a slap in the face. It just is the only film I have ever seen that has no story, plot, script, and some of the characters (like the protagonist) seem to have been chosen before. The only "story" in the film is the death of one woman (guilty?) and the "savior" she had in life and she never gets to know the guy she died at. I couldn't believe this film was made. In the whole of the film, the camera is so dark, the only thing I liked was that it was so cheap.  I think a better film would be based on a real person and would be great. I just wish someone made something that wasn't this silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few people have said that this was the most disappointing episode of the first season, with little, if anything, redeeming features. However, I have to say, I think the episode was very disappointing in terms of its entertainment value. I was a fan of this episode, although I was very frustrated with it at first. But now, I am beginning to wonder about the direction of the episode. In this episode I found myself watching and listening to this just for the sake of entertainment value, and not because the characters played so bad.  I thought the main character was very weak in this episode. He acted like a child that was supposed to be a grown girl. And the girl seemed to be very naive and childish. I just have to admit that these actors are not themselves, and their characters were really horrible.  It is difficult to come across a series with such bad characters that I am accustomed to. I think it is possible that the producers of this show may have some money to hire these actors in order to produce a better series. I hope they don't have that money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The name of the movie is, as usual, not a title that can be used. The name is really irrelevant as I've seen it described. However, the acting of a large majority of the cast is quite bad. The idea of being "a secret project by the FBI" would be interesting but the actors were so badly written that it was impossible to make it believable. Also, you can't believe the idea that this film was made to include the characters in "the secret project" and "the project is actually in one location. The only actors who had a small role in this film were "the director" and the production assistant, who seems to have had nothing more to do with the project. The other actors were the "normal" actors of the real film. The acting was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad, but this one was still worse than the other one.  The only reason I even have a sense of humor was the fact that it is a sequel. That meant it was an interesting thing to talk about, but not to actually work. I don't care what happens and who dies, the same happens in all the other sequels, and it makes it look as if the movie is trying to kill a character. It's just like the first one. If that is a good thing to do, I would have liked the sequel better than the first.  A little bit of hope returned when I saw "Resurrection", but this movie proved to be worse than "Resistance", "Revengence", and "Rise of The Gods". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a few of sad people in the same house. A couple on the opposite ends of a bunch of college guys decide to go into the house and make amends to their friends who are too weak to act. But what's the joke? They're really sad and they're actually making amends for their bad deeds. It's a little like "Broken Heart", where they pretend to be sad people who are really sad. This movie seems to be based on a true story (a bit too much), but it lacks a lot of humor. Even the main protagonist seems to have a hard time coming into the movie, as he's acting in a hospital and in the bedroom. This is simply not enough to make up the story. The main character, named Ben, is basically a typical loser who can't seem to get up for anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the movie was a true horror film, this wouldn't be a horror film at all. There's nothing in this movie that we could think of really making it, but we do know that it has the same style of horror film. What would we think of? There are no real characters, it's just a bunch of stupid situations that make no sense. There is a ridiculous amount of nudity, nothing dramatic about it (except for a few moments), and no plot, meaning the film lacks any real suspense or excitement. It's not suspenseful and nothing thrilling. It just takes place, and we're bored. The only reason I recommend this movie is because I really liked the other movies on this series. If you like to see old horror films, this is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a really bad movie - a plot that doesn't move forward even if it has a plot to do so (if I say the story, that's how) or anything else. There was the usual "all in the family" story line but the film lacks a sense of urgency. It's really hard to understand what is going on in the real world. The characters don't seem to act like people, they just keep doing stuff for no reason. They don't even seem to get along or communicate with each other. There are some great moments, like the scene in the farm with a little girl who just got married, but the acting is very poor and the dialog is only there because the actors can make it easier.  The movie's title suggests it's all in the house, and I think the entire story would have been a lot better if they had a real person in the film. The actors would have to have some connection with each character.  Overall, it's a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that it's hard to get into it unless you are a professional film director, so you just can't figure out how terrible it is. The acting wasn't good, and the fact that it was one of the worst films ever made is pretty sad.  The story line is pretty good, but it's too long to be interesting.  I guess it's just one of those terrible movies where all the dialogue is forced to have some kind of humor (especially when it's trying to make a point).  The ending is very confusing, but I guess the last scene of the movie makes me feel a little sad. All the characters were way too annoying. I guess they were going to do something with a lot of characters like they were done in The Matrix. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had some of the most ridiculous and unfathomable plot lines and scenes, and it could have been much better made if they had the ability to capture the plot in some manner. That is not the case for this film. Even after the second minute of dialog (there are no more than a few minutes of silence, then after that is when the camera shows the corpse of the guy who murdered the victim. If you have the patience to sit through those first few minutes and watch it just to get yourself into the mind of the villain (there's no reason for a viewer to believe that the person doing the murder is "that big a man, you can't beat him if you're only one of those big men", etc), you'll see that it has no idea what he's doing.  What could that man do with a body bag, or what was he using to make the corpse disappear? Oh, did he get the body back into the back seat? That's where we can't find the bodies. The story is about his father who was on the job, but we only see his father, but not the corpse...  How, I guess the "dance" scene was created on his head to get the victim back into his seat... This is the only way I can call this movie a "film". It's not like a movie set, but more like a film set. The acting is bad, the direction is terrible, and the music is bad as well. You'll laugh for having fun watching this movie, but you'll probably hate yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was made in the USA in the early 1980's and a few years later, the plot, some of the plot scenes were recycled and even worse in the film. In the film, the main character is a woman who, unlike the "Beautiful Jane", is a huge slob and she is more like a bitch than a love interest. That is why I would avoid this film as a waste of space. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got to see this movie at the local movie store, and I was looking forward to seeing it at a theater.  After seeing it, I decided to give it to my girlfriend. However, I was very skeptical and didn't believe that it would be a good movie.  There are some scenes that were extremely confusing and extremely ridiculous. Even though the acting and storyline were good, they were poorly directed and made that most of the actors were not very good either. The scenes seemed like they were designed by the writer to make some small references to a comic book, and then make the movie as big as they had planned, but the movie only made 1-2 or 3 times.  The whole plot of this movie is just a bunch of dumb, bad stuff. There are about 8 different locations (one of them is in the very old schoolhouse on the grounds of the abandoned school in the village and another is in a completely empty warehouse). This whole movie is about a kid named Richard (played by Michael Murphy), and he's trying to do a movie that will scare his parents, his friends and even the neighbours. The movie is so bad that I think it is almost impossible to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen countless video games, most of them having some kind of "real" plot and characters. For example, one of the many games that i'm playing is based on a famous and famous movie of the future. "The Man in the Mirror" is the classic. But this movie doesn't even manage to keep it alive and its script looks so bad. First, they don't even make that man, one man, appear in the movie. Second, the fact that it's based on such a famous movie doesn''t help this movie. And third, i won't believe it when they claimed that they had a real story. It doesn't really come across that it had some real characters to have the story. I didn't even see who all in the mirror was. They probably wouldn't even recognize the other characters. The story isn't even that interesting. It just goes and repeats again, and repeats. I can't believe they even believed that they were in the man's mouth. I guess they got this film so far because they can't care about the plot, but instead were trying to make the film a "movie". If you want to watch a movie that has a plot that has some sort of a real storyline, you would be lucky to get that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest problem with this film is that it's boring. The plot and acting are pretty good, but what happens during the film is not. The story is one of many that have tried to make the viewer feel bad. A good movie would have been the entire film about how this really works.  This movie was also bad with the "reaction" aspect of the film. The actors do little acting. The ending is not a real movie, as we all know.  There are some interesting moments to see (such as when the girl sees the first car and she notices a sign in the window). But if this movie had to be made, it would have to be better, and more entertaining. The movie would need to be either about a person's decision to help an evil person (i.e. a friend), or just how evil he is. This movie just seems like "A Very Stupid Movie" to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first episode of this, where it appears that the "good" character (Tilson from the first episode) is the monster-killing soldier that kills the girl in the back. There is some funny moments, but the plot is a little bit boring, especially the big deal with the big battle in which the monster burns up on the island with a large crew of zombie soldiers (with a bunch of zombies and the usual zombie-bots)  The episode is only 5 minutes long, and the first 30 minutes are about 10 times longer than that, and is one of the worst scenes in the series. If the actors had the perfect chemistry and talent, they might have been able to make the zombie scenes a little more impressive. For example, the first zombie scene in the first sequence of the episode shows the zombie blowing up the car with the car being left behind.  There are some weird little scenes in which a zombie is jumping into a car. That is just a few minutes too.  The plot is so bad, and it is so weak compared to the others in the story, that the other three actors seem to be doing something extremely brave and awesome. The only thing that saves this episode is that it's very funny. But the story is not that funny, and I can't say it was funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those things I've read about people thinking that they might like, but don't care to see it. If you thought "Munchkin", or one of the two "Tail" movies, you might be interested in seeing them, but if you really wanted to, you would just see the "Manda". The Manda movies don't deserve your time.  The only decent thing I did was seeing the real-life Manda Mae Mori and her partner (Melissa Harte) in one of these films. The acting was okay, but the story was horrible and the only redeeming trait in the movie was that it did not resemble a real life story (it wasn't a typical daydream or a movie or even a movie). I don't remember much about her as a person, but I didn't see enough to really consider her as "real". If you have any idea about who Manda was, you should see the real Manda as a fictional character, not as a real person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought the movie in 2003 when I had just moved out of my apartment and was on my way back to go to New York to be a writer. The story was really dumb and really wasn't any good. If I had written it I would have written a negative, sarcastic review about this lousy movie. It wasn't worth my time to write any negative review because it was bad. I'm glad I never saw it when I bought it. I didn't know if it was good or bad, but it wasn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie features a poor performance and a bad script, this is not like a "Rambo Theres" or even a "Dietrich" film. It doesn't have any real plot, it is just a pile of ugly bickering from the beginning. It really reminded me of a bad film: "The Wizard of Oz" or "The Mighty Mighty Mighty" (that's why I chose to watch this). The acting was really bad. The film didn't have much chemistry, the characters seemed to want to be doing something, but it wasn't happening in the script, you can't relate to the characters. My rating is also 1/3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a complete waste of film. I did not even see the actors in it. I only laughed at the plot. A stupid plot was absolutely nothing. Not even the stars. I didn't get much time to see the movie, so I don't care how this movie gets to a 100 million dollars.  My only reason for reviewing this movie is that I enjoy sci-fi.  This movie is complete garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie was pretty stupid. It was pretty old, I'd like to see the first few episodes. It would make sense if the writer and director were working on the same projects, but this movie was like "Wagering Eyes" or "Stray Light". There was no plot, no characters, no suspense, no reason. I was looking at the script and wondering why it wasn't a simple story. The acting was OK though. The film didn't have much of a plot, but I think it had a good idea of what the writer was going to do with the film, it just didn't go far.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really seems like a movie made just because some people like a 'hardcore' movie. In other words, it doesn't even deserve to be on the same stage with such a poor movie.  The characters in the movie are too bland and unrealistic. I had to find one good scene where an angry mother gets revenge against her husband. I was so disgusted by the movie and its terrible acting and acting, I was unable to get the feeling back into my mind, or even to find any enjoyment beyond the "silly" violence.  This film doesn't have a good plot. The story, though, tries to be realistic and realistic, but it's not worth the time, as you'd be missing some parts of the movie when it ends. The script, which is pretty decent, is totally confusing and badly explained, with no explanations. The actors are completely predictable. The setting is the same as every other movie: a barren desert desert. It's only a simple backdrop for a horror movie. The director should've taken advantage of his budget and done something better. If the movie had more actors and better direction, it would probably have been an enjoyable film, but this movie has nothing for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought it thinking it would be good for a young boy to watch. But it didn't work. I thought that it would help him to cope with his school experience, so I wanted to see it. But I can only say that I was hopelessly disappointed, even after reading the reviews, that it didn`t make any sense whatsoever. After watching it I was completely disgusted. And I knew the movie was terrible, too, as I'd watched it as a child and now am an adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the same vein of the first "Godzilla" movie, this is the first one of "God" movies that is bad - the movie was about a real creature, and when the real creature was discovered by Japanese people in an underground cave, their name is a very boring "God". I am a fan of this show but, overall, it is a poor attempt to recreate the "God"-movie which has been so completely replaced by other actors who do better.  If you have to be one of those who are afraid of "the big monster" that comes along - you are going to really feel scared when you watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i have read the reviews of this movie: it's horrible, nothing worth even a "5". even worse is the acting. no actors of any real talent, and the way they act, and look like they are acting in a "movie", is really stupid.  it's just a bunch of uninteresting, unsympathetic and plain-grill, and not even entertaining. (this is a bit of a problem, when we find out that a movie is truly bad like this, i'm really glad that i found out).   but i have to admit that i don't know that the only reason I decided to see this movie is because it was "so awesome", that it was a great movie and a must-see movie. I didn't know whether the movie was really bad, but now i see it's "bad".   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just so bad, and it is so bad that it cannot be made any kind of entertainment or entertaining for kids and adults, you need to be looking for something more fun. If you want to watch a movie that is so awful, do not watch this movie. You might get a few laughs, but not as much as you want. If it was not bad, you might not want to see it. Even if you liked the original, the director did very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a poor ending to this movie. The acting is bad, and the plot just does not make sense. While the movie was fun in some parts, I have since found out that most of the actors are terrible at it. I've never seen a good acting movie that came from a comic book or even one that came out of a movie like this. The story was weak, and I don't think it has even been interesting to see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible ending. I can only hope that it is better. I have nothing to see in this movie but for everyone it's pointless and painful. I really feel like I just wasted my time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically about a big ass girl who has a little, but a big, ego that gets her to do something stupid. There are some good bits, some of which are entertaining, but when they're not, you just feel like you're doing a bad impersonation of a girl that you don't like. A bunch of people that are very, very predictable and have no connection with any real person. There is nothing that happens that makes any real sense and no one seems to do anything except to be extremely self-centered, self-absorbed and utterly useless.  The only reason I recommend this movie is that I believe it to be an honest film. But if you can't find the "clues", do something else. I really didn't find it that interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing film I've seen. It's just boring. Even though the story is good, nothing about the movie made me think. If you wanted to see the real world, you would have to find it on the Internet. As a cop, I didn't really understand what the story was. I am sure there are some people who think it's a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off of the street is a complete piece of crap. It's all about as the movie plays out. When the first person goes there, the next couple go to the house, the other two stay in the room, the girl goes down the alley while there and then goes back to her bedroom (the apartment downstairs). The scene when she gets in there is only about 2/3 as long as the whole movie. The acting is very bad, the camera is not really good either. Also the lighting in the apartment is completely wooden... if it was a real camera. If I have to mention, the guy in the first scene is really hot. He's a really good actor. The scene is only an hour, but not good enough to save the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only thing i can say that I have ever read. The plot of this movie is ridiculous. I mean, what is the plot? I'll explain more, but it's no good. The movie is completely unbelievable, it's just plain ridiculous. The characters are horrible, the actors are bad, the only reason this movie was even made was to make money. This movie is a joke. If it was a movie made for a movie, it wouldn't be like this. It just doesn't make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters in this film do not really interact with the audience.  There is a very good one in the film (Kellei), and this was his only flaw, but to see him so quickly and not understand him could have been a better film.  The plot is very simple and has a little acting and very little thought and direction. Most of the action is just happening, like a fight in a car with other people in another car, for which there is no dialogue.  When this movie came out, I laughed in disbelief. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is simply a terrible movie: a one-dimensional plot, an extremely stupid cast and a bad script...  I mean, look, if you're in the mood for 'the best comedy series EVER' like Family Guy and Big Fat Fats or The Sponge Crew, you should see this movie - it's not worth watching and not funny at all. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because it's just plain dumb. If you like Family Dog or SpongeBob or Big Fat Frats, you will enjoy it... but if you can't tolerate it, you won't enjoy it at all... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know the word 'Bad Movie' is the most important word for movies I can see. But it is bad. Bad in a bad way. It is not good to say that it was bad because it was good. It was bad in a strange way. So bad it is so bad it doesn't matter what else it is. This is bad in every way. There are many bad aspects of this movie including acting, story, cinematography, music, and other. If I was to name some of these bad things, I would name things that are not so bad. So I decided that this movie was the one that I thought I was the best. But I am surprised that the people who gave this movie a 10 are so ignorant. When I watched this movie, I couldn't see anything worth remembering about it. I would like to say "Bad Movie:  The Bottom Line: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a really awful movie this was. Even the acting was not there. It was a bunch of kids, which didn't come off as funny.  How would you even say something funny? The characters were boring and stupid. Even during the movie it was just stupid. The acting was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is supposed to be based on a young girl who was kidnapped in an African jungle. She is also kidnapped by some strange person who believes she is "Witch" (an evil person) who wants her to become a witch. They decide to try and force her to stay in a convent for about a year and to become the "witch" of the mountain people. However, the "Witches" are being tricked in a real way. They are going to destroy the forest and then abduct her. In other words, the film is about the "witches" making fake potions and not about the girl being kidnapped. It is too obvious that this is a story based on some mythological event. A story written only to be a real bad movie and not a movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a stupid movie this is. Even though I don't understand why someone could so much of this...  I don`t understand how these actors were able to act this way. Maybe they knew they would get fired for being in the movie.  Also there was the fact that most of the actors weren`t acting in this movie. Why? The movie had no plot. I guess there was something to tell them to be more careful to keep things to a certain standard.  Well, the acting seemed better in other parts, but this is a shame to waste one of them. It would be better if they had made the movie earlier. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not that man.  You have to admit that this is the worst film that I've seen in any of my 40 years. A bad movie, the only reason that you are even still in this film is to act like it is a real movie.  This is a lame plot, but at least it has humor. What you have here is a bunch of men playing about being the worst friends in the world. The only thing that works is the ridiculous character that we all know from The X-Files, where the guys act like dumb, ignorant, bigoted, sexist monsters.  The plot is so weak that it is laughable.  When I'm reading this I'm just laughing because the guys are so terrible that they can't act as bad guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it were any fun, I would watch this movie with my wife. The idea of a TV movie was so lame and boring, I knew there was something more to it. Unfortunately, I'm sure that I would have laughed more at the fact that I am paying for this movie. If there were any funny parts in it, they were terrible.  I can't imagine how the director got so bad, but it did something to the "feel good" part of it. The scenes were awful, the acting was horrible, and the story seemed pretty interesting but didn't do anything to make me want to watch it.  The only good things about this movie were the wonderful camera work. But that was also a bad thing, because the camera was so bad it got used over and over. This was one of those movies that are made so bad that you can't see anything except the camera work and the lighting. It wasn't fun to watch but the movie was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really understand the reason that this was made because of this movie. I guess people who saw this movie knew they would not care to watch it. This is a disappointing movie with nothing in it. I didn't get the impression that the filmmakers had done the whole movie, only the characters did. Some people seemed to be bored with the movie, others seemed to enjoy it but they couldn't get into the details and wanted to wait for the movie to come out.   As I was saying earlier, the movie is not really very engaging. It's just a simple excuse to get some laughs before you spend the time to see the movie again. The acting is bad. The film's humor is bad, the direction is awful and the whole film is just bad. A lot of people can't wait to see it. That's probably the reason they liked the movie. It was not good enough to save the movie as it should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a hard time to believe what I read on IMDb that it's this funny. I don't know if the other reviewers can forgive a comedy film. The film is about a failed attempt at a relationship between two sisters. When the sister is on the brink of losing her ability to have a relationship with her brother. The sister's boyfriend tries to save her by taking her virginity, making love with her sister. When they do that, the sister decides not to sleep and goes to prison. We must agree that this film is bad, since it is a movie about two brothers that don't get along that well. There are some elements that are amusing. For example, the guy who has a problem is a father who also has a big problem. It isn't really possible that his son would be going to prison on the same father who has custody over her sister, but if his son were going to jail for something that happened to his father, it would be an even worse case. The only thing I would say is that it has humor that is juvenile and not funny at all. If the movie was made like a documentary, it could probably have worked out and I guess it didn't, but I think it didn 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just didn't like this movie.  I don't know why I was so surprised. I just don't like it. It didn't make any sense. It really is nothing more than a collection of gizaderesque jokes that just doesn't have enough thought for them.  So, I decided to watch this just to confirm that it was bad.  Just not that I am a movie director, and I didn't know what to do with the casting. I tried to see the film as a real film, but the actors were so terrible that I couldn't even think of anything.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film for about 1 year, and I still can't find the DVD. It's so bad, I couldn't even find the exact sequence where the girl dies.  There is no proof that this movie would have been filmed like a documentary, I just don't understand how that movie was made. I just couldn't believe that they wanted to film this thing as a documentary. I really don't even remember what they were thinking of doing in the movie. Maybe they wanted a documentary but made the documentary anyway. In this case the documentary is totally unsatisfied. They really should have put more time into their movie, but it's obvious that the filmmakers gave this movie no more than they could have given it. They should have turned in a documentary instead of putting this one on the shelf.  This movie has one good scene. But the rest is so bad that you will never believe there to be an end. I'm not even surprised that it's made this way. Even if this movie is made in the U.S. I don't believe they did anything serious. It just goes along way downhill and goes on in another direction that just doesn't make it worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I would give this film an 8, I would put it at a 1. Its awful. A disgusting waste of time. I have no money to rent it and I'm glad it doesn't have a sequel. The plot was so bad it had to be seen in a movie theatre only.  I am very sorry to see so much of it being put out in theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story line of this film is a little disturbing, given the presence of the big bad guy and the girl who falls in love with him. The plot is predictable, the characters are predictable, and the story line is about a man who tries to kill his girlfriend while she is in the care of his big bad husband.  The plot lacks some of the spark that's present in the film, i.e. the plot lines involving the woman and the man are just plain bad.  I thought the ending made it seem more realistic, and that is only if it doesn't actually show the truth.    For a film with this kind of story line, it should be great. But this film doesn't, it just makes you like it and then you get a headache. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After an hour of the day watching this film I decided that it was bad, but this was not an easy answer. It is a movie that would have been fine if done with one director and one writer.  I'd like to see a movie with a decent director and a solid cast but sadly it isn't. So unfortunately I decided to watch this film without my hopes for a better film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has too many boring clichés to satisfy me. It lacks even one plot, which is needed for a film about the real life. At least I think it had to be as simple as that. But most of the characters seem to be caricatured in this movie like the kids in the summertime cartoon. I think that there were better movies to base these characters on. For example, the kid who made it up in this film is really like the kid from The Adventures of Fluffy Duck. There are no real stories. I could easily find the same cartoon.  This film could have worked as a cartoon, especially with so much money it will cost if a sequel. But I think they are going to get so much in total for the sequel anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that this film is very stupid. I had never heard of it before, and it isn't even a good movie for me. I'm so disappointed in that I couldn't even finish it. Some of the dialogue, although witty, is just stupid and you can barely understand it yourself. But if I like movies, I don't like them like that and the lack of a story was probably not a big factor in it's failure. The acting was OK, I guess. But the rest just is bad. I hope the filmmakers will find a way to make the sequel to this film better. It really had some good ideas and a good plot, but I couldn''t find any of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I'm surprised that this movie was even made in the US. The plot was pretty good, with some interesting and well done performances and the director obviously knew what he was doing. However, the movie is actually quite boring and only shows how terrible it is that people can waste hours watching this movie for half of the film.  There's nothing like a true adventure. This movie is basically about a guy who wants to win over a big man. How? Where did they go? And who can you be? He's so much better than you at that point. In fact, there's nothing wrong with him or his body. I've seen a lot of people making this movie and it's a waste. If you like it, avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is bad... this movie is so bad. The storyline is unbelievable... the plot is so weak, the story is terrible and it is completely impossible to have a good plot. Even the characters are bad...the dialog is horrible, the characters look like they are made out of cardboard (a good way to film this). This is the biggest drawback of the movie...it doesn't make up for its badness. The acting is OK, the dialog is OK. But the plot was bad enough to make it seem like a film... the movie does have some funny things, but the story failed to deliver any excitement. You can watch this movie for a few minutes, but you'll probably miss some funny jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is the only bad film I've seen on this site. It lacks the necessary charm to make it a must-see event. The title of the film is "The Naked Beauty". I would be surprised if the actors had the same acting ability as the famous Hollywood stars of that era. It is a total waste of time and money.  I have seen many great films but this one is about as bad as I have ever seen. It's like a pretentious movie with some predictable dialog, silly images, and the unbelievable plot. I've never been this desperate for a film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is how to sell a bad film: "I like you because you can see me sitting in front of a toilet..."  I guess that when a movie is a movie, you can only find it so bad, or that you have a movie that is better.  I love when movies like this were made but with the intent to make it worse by taking it a certain direction. "This was made to be a film for all Americans, of course you're going to try out in most countries, you're supposed to watch it in most theaters..."  This movie was obviously made to appear more stupid than anything else in it. And, yes, it was better than most movies, but the reason for doing it was just a simple greed on the part of the producers. They couldn't care less about any aspect of making it, they just wanted to make money. They sold their movie, and people thought it was great and all of their stuff was fine, but they didn't care about the actual story. If people are looking for something to rent, I am sure there are some people on the side of the screen that want to see it, I would like to see them again, but you don't find it in the store. And I'll never, ever, see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was terrible, the dialog was bad, the story was predictable, and the special effects were terrible. The plot lacked any real substance, so the idea of a game was silly, the characters were dull, and this movie is really just an excuse to use that ridiculous budget for a cheap movie.    Oh sure, if I had the opportunity I would like to make a documentary about the movie, but I don't know what I would be like. I really don't even care to watch this movie, I just went to watch the credits. I would give a 1 or 2 of the stars a 10 if I thought it was worthwhile. It's not worth watching but a really bad movie is worth watching, but the worst part is the production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Lucky For You" is a dreadful low-budget indie film that does not even make the slightest attempt to capture the suspense of a true movie. The film is very basic and has no storyline and does not do anything to build an emotional character or any emotional bond between the two characters. The acting is terrible and the writing is terrible. It just feels as if the film was directed by someone who has never even visited the sets and set. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame that it was filmed in America. What they did was so bad... I don't think the other films had quite so bad.  The acting was pretty good, but the direction was terrible, it's very bad that the film was so badly written. A lot of the dialogue and the plot is either impossible to follow or just plain bad. I would have thought they could have done something different, but it doesn't really. It is very hard to tell how they were thinking and what they thought of. There's a very long lead-up to this film to make the story interesting. It's almost like they just wanted the whole thing, then they just went on and kept going. There is nothing interesting in any of the rest of the film, even the plot was pretty bad. If I would like a different kind of movie, it would be interesting. However I have to say, this was a bad film: the acting was bad, the camera wasn't good at all, it wasn't funny either, and it was too annoying. I was really sick looking at the face of the guy in the movie. He had too much hair, too much body in his face, and no lips. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is horrible and I will probably never see another movie with this name. I don't think they're even trying to make an acceptable movie and I'm not sure why they gave this one. It's so bad, it's just painful. I'm going to call it a dorkish name and call it "The Dork". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film absolutely despicable. I had absolutely no sympathy for the actors. I was disgusted by the way they tried to make this film. It looked like they were having a hard time making it. If this film had to be shown I would have done something else. I don't understand why they would make this look like it did. I'm sure you can make a lot of money if you want to make a bad film. In fact, you might enjoy some money if there were a decent story. But this one was none of that. The biggest reason this film was bad was because the idea is stupid. I can't understand how they get into such a stupid scenario. The plot doesn't build up the "victory" as a real hero. The only way I can get involved in this movie is to guess what happens and how they will eventually win. It's bad enough that it is stupid to show the winners and the losers. You can't even tell how much money is saved off of a small prize in a movie. The film just shows how lucky people are to win this prize. I wish I had the opportunity to see something else before I saw this film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the film that has been made for a film of a few months to try and be a real film. I've seen a couple of films that don't do that. this is no exception to that.  I have seen so many films that I never understood how to understand, even after reading the plot. It seems as though there is no brain on the screen. If this was a movie, I would have to read the story to understand what I needed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few moments that redeem a film's unique style, but not enough to make a memorable film. This is no different with the worst Batman film of all time. Even the original Superman film is not quite so bad as the Batman films. The fact that the writers were able to keep this up to a decent time on the film is just astonishingly stupid. The movie takes many bizarre scenes (including the infamous robot fight) and then, without a good explanation, we just watch it, and wait until it's over.  Most of the things we watch are bad, but Batman is fairly good. The film itself is bad, as most of the scenes in the story are just plain bad. The story itself, though, gets better with it. I mean, what do you expect to be? I didn't even watch this movie, but I did want to see it. Oh, I didn`t! It was terrible! I could only watch it twice, and I still missed most of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest slap in the face of the director. This movie has all the wrong ingredients for a really good film, but it really doesn't deliver any good things to the characters, characters or the audience. Some of the actors really are good, but when it comes to the real plot, you can't find it anywhere. The story isn't even close to making the viewers feel as sympathetic towards the characters. And the actors don't deliver much that they claim they do. I wish I was a little more interested. The cast of the "Hollywood" are all weak. The rest of the characters are just bad, and the script is not that convincing either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful and it failed to get the same quality rating that I've seen in a horror movie. The best I've ever seen in film is "Night Screams". I thought this was a truly stupid movie, the most ridiculous scenes that I can find I've never even seen in movies were just bad enough to make me scream. It just makes me sick. This movie is just a rip-off, you will never get this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "New Year" is a movie about a group of kids living in a house, who don't pay anything, and who don`t know how to read. It's about a few kids getting bullied by the older people.  This is bad for a movie: it is boring, it is terrible, and it is not funny!  What makes it even worse is the fact that the kids are very immature. They are all annoying and their characters are not even funny.  And this is really the only movie that I can recommend to see. I just don't see anything in this movie: they don't laugh, they don`n laugh, and there are no actors that are funny. It`s really bad that this movie is in a new house, and I don`T think they would be OK with a new place, because it has nothing like the "New Years" TV series. It is all wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of the first "House" movie, but this one is awful.  I thought the story was good but when I saw the first movie and the second, I didn't care as much as I do about the first.  The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the script which I could never understand. I am not a writer, but what writer has a story like this one? The only reason I'm even aware of this is because the first one gave you a copy.  Please excuse me if I am mistaken. The second film is a better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I'd be interested, but I went and watched it only after a movie: a movie that just does not meet expectations of any kind. The movie takes place in a very long time, with a plot that does not exist (the one in the TV series was a very interesting, but unfortunately, after the whole film there was no story and no characters except for the main characters (and one girl was killed, so I'm still not sure if it was just a flimsy gun). What we got were many scenes of naked or half naked people doing what we've never seen before.  The plot's very vague, with many scenes without any explanation (the characters are all very basic, which is probably not a bad thing, considering that many, many movies with very, very scant explanation for their plots have been extremely successful).  The fact that most of the characters seem like they had nothing to do with the movie they were in is just the first indication of what's happening to it. And the only characters had the same problem as the TV characters did - they had some kind of "special" status in that they were the people that the people had to find and help (they could get out of a prison to go rescue), and they just weren't interested.  But I thought the movie lacked the basic "story" that people have claimed it has. To me, it didn't have any plot. It had many scenes where the people who would help the people get out. They just didn't seem like people having a lot of personal relationships. Even when they would help out in this movie, they didn't go far in helping them. That is not the case for the movie, as it seemed a couple of people had a kind of special status - these people were just trying to make a political point.  As for the characters, they had a sort of "romantic" connection with each other and had no depth whatsoever.  They seemed to be so simple as they acted. They were basically just another group of people. I don't think that meant anything, just that the movie didn't act like a movie. The scenes were obviously not as interesting, which I didn't think was a bad idea.   However, I do think that they should have been making this movie in the 1980s, as they had so much in common, and it wasn't funny or funny. It just felt a bit like they were making something for no purpose.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only a bad film, but a bad and awful piece of film making, where the characters are made of cardboard 'cute' characters. The 'cutes' are bland and the 'nip' only adds insult to the movie (this is what was required by the title!). The plot is painfully predictable and it takes its very few moments to find out who's going where. The movie is basically a horror film but is nothing original.  The production was not very good, with a few scenes were well acted, but the movie does not develop the characters very well. There were many scenes of scenes that were just about how things happen. But the movie is not scary enough to keep it's rating. If you liked the original horror flick, I recommend checking out the remake version.   The movie would probably be better if there were a few more characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible, even worse than the standard slasher film. The plot was ridiculous. The film has a "sister" who does not exist and she is the "boss" who has a giant monster on her head. Why is the girl in this movie killing everyone at the farm? How is she keeping all of the farm workers? The film is a waste of time. I can't even put this movie into my DVD player, and I don't recommend it at all. The end is only about 5 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of people are like to read this review about this movie: "The Girl in The Spider" just seems to drag your mind to the final two pages and then back to a completely uninteresting scene.  This is also a very bad movie. It starts off with some very interesting and pretty believable scenes. But after it's over you just feel like the ending of the movie is a waste of time. You can even hear the voices of the people who are involved in the movie, and there's just no closure. The plot is a horrible pile of scenes and just another bad way to try to connect a strange case and an insane person. The characters are pretty dull, and most of the characters seem to be acting like they don't have the right person in the room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors, despite what I said, are very good. They didn't take advantage of the camera and camera when they were obviously involved in the story. What I do think was the worst in the movie were the characters. The script was badly written and there is nothing new. The plot had nothing but wasted time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are just dummies. The premise of the movie is that "the two kids" (with little resemblance to real girls) make a pact with the other parent (who is also a part of the 'junk' movie). While the two kids make deals with each other, each kid just wants to go off on a killing spree.  There is some interesting scenes - one involving a car accident, one involving the death of a friend.  Unfortunately, none of the main characters, aside from the two older kids, really act out.  All in all, this is a really horrible movie, but it doesn't have a lot of suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is even a documentary for the average fan of pop culture (like myself), it's about as bad as that. This is bad film that has absolutely no artistic touch, only bad film making, bad editing, and bad acting. Even if it were the original TV series, it would still suck. I just hope the writer is back for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad I couldn't even watch it. I felt like my face was smushed against the television screen. There was nothing that was interesting. There were some little gags thrown in, but they were pretty far in comparison to the quality of the movie.  The plot of the book was pretty good, but the acting was awful. The dialog was terrible, the story was stupid and I didn't care for the characters or the acting. It's all about the weirdly bizarre relationship of the characters. I didn;t care for any other characters I had seen in the book and I don't really think anyone would be as bad as these characters in this movie. Some people are calling it the sequel to the first. I believe that the sequel is worse than the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an example of "B" film. The lead protagonist is a madman and the two main characters (also called the twins) spend a few hours playing with a bunch of demons that are obviously the characters of the film. However, while the film is good, the plot is very weak. The plot of the twin Sisters is weak, the characters are weak, and the characters act like idiots. Also, while this movie is about the twins and the demons, it doesn't add much value. It lacks a lot of atmosphere and an interesting plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I laughed out loud to this film in a few days and was disappointed that I had to wait until it was released to see the results. What a waste of time. What I expected from this film is a film with a small budget, no plot and no chemistry and a simple premise.  I'm sure, this is still a film made by a filmmaker who didn't know what he wanted to do with the material. He was supposed to be making a documentary about a documentary, but was instead making a film for the sake of a quick paycheck. The whole plot is stupid and unnecessary.  For example, the movie ends with a shot of a man jumping off a cliff, jumping backwards, and then falling down as the plane hits it. That's about 4 seconds to be gone. The man doesn't even get a line on his face when the plane falls out of the sky.  The movie is so bad, I can't even watch the movie without having seen it twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my life. If this was made for "Breaking News", I would not even think of seeing the film. But I had to see it for myself to believe that this movie was a film worthy of being the title. I will admit, it looked somewhat good on the surface. But then, as I sat through it, I quickly realized that this was completely terrible. It wasn't even funny at all. The acting was awful. The script was terrible. The fact that the people in the film had such horrible faces was laughable. The plot was very poorly drawn and had absolutely nothing to do with the characters. I found myself wanting to jump off my own chair and say "This movie is about a killer killing little girl in a remote area by some guy whose sister is playing a small-town cop" so I was really disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to seeing the movie and I thought it would be a good one. Unfortunately it didn't happen. I won't really talk about the movie but it had quite the worst of a movie I have ever seen. Some of the worst lines I've ever seen I'd never heard, some of the most ridiculous lines I have read, and some of worst actors I've seen, such as the movie stars are in the movie! I can't say all the lines weren't well written but if they were, it would probably have ruined the movie. If they had done the right thing and made their scenes, it wouldn't have been as bad as the whole movie I had to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A few things about this movie: 1) No one ever told me that it was a horrible movie: it was, yes. That's what I expected when watching it. I expected a good movie, but I don't remember seeing one.  2) No storyline. It's only about some people who are trapped in a small town.  3) A story is not told.  It's about some strange things, and the people who want to find out more about it, and it doesn't go very far.  4) It is not very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a laugh... A lame movie about a drunken murder. It's a poor movie, but it's a fun movie and it has lots of horrible scenes (like a giant, ugly girl), but the film seems to lose interest and there is no real plot.  The acting is pathetic (like the lame zombie-like characters in the film), as well as the cinematography and editing (the slow pacing of the first half). The film seems weak compared to other similar films. But if you like the characters in this movie, you might like them and if you don't like them, you have bad taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just can't believe that the actors who have been part of this movie actually deserve to play in an original way. I have read the comments about the movie. They seem to come from a place where they just want to get their money. I'm really not sure where this is going to lead them. My guess is that it will end up in the same place as "The Devil Wished Up On Christmas Day", which I think had been made for a much more dramatic way. It would be better to keep that in the back ground. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film for some reason in a local theater. I watched it in a theater. It looked really terrible and was very disturbing. I was expecting a movie like "Eugene" would be at the same level, but this was absolutely the worst movie I have seen so far. What made this movie was so bad was that it didn't even make any sense whatsoever. I didn't understand why people would turn to this show over a movie: "it is a new show that has been made for a new audience..." The plot, the story, the acting, the direction, the script, and the acting was completely pointless. What happened to "Elimis"? Who, this person or whoever is responsible for making this movie is not getting out of the shadow of the dark. This movie was horrible. If you have a few days in advance to see this movie, you might consider watching it after a good movie: don't let them get away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a horrible waste of plot, the acting was bad and the "fun" scenes were horrible, I didn't care about them, I think that the producers are on drugs for that purpose. A lot of it could have been done without all of it, it would have been more interesting than the storyline. I was also disappointed in what they ended up with, the way they ended this movie. They couldn't even give the characters enough to do what they needed to say. I think they should have just written a different piece of work in the same vein as this movie, this was only a bad idea by half.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm afraid to say this is the worst film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an awfully predictable storyline, that the story line is weak in it's execution. I thought it was a very simple premise, that all men are dead and that the only way the story lines could get anyone to save the girl is a death. That's just about the plot. The plot is weak, and there are a few characters who seem to have been pulled from the movie without a decent reason. I wouldn't really think the film is very bad but a pretty bad attempt at a film that you would just watch and die from. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never heard the word "sex," or "homosexuality," but I can say that "sex" and "homophilia" are two words that make no sense. The "sex") words can, if you're truly crazy, be taken seriously. It sounds like the idea of a big secret that "the gays" is "staying on the same sex partners with one of the other sex partners." It's simply a stupid premise that can only be used for a joke, like the "the other half of the gay scene" jokes of the '90s.  "gay-ish" movies are like another thing, "saying" a lot of things with stupid stupid language and dumb plot. This is a very bad movie, but that only counts for about 10 percent, compared to the number of people in the movie who actually wanted it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is completely pointless, so if it is a good movie then why isn't this one. Why waste this movie is simply disgusting to me. If there are any more stories then this must be made for real. That would be an appropriate and decent film and a better example of the genre, but there are far worse flicks like this one then they are better flicks from this year and better fits than this one, or at least a better alternative to this one so I would not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some interesting moments of the film (for example), but this is not a movie worth seeing. The acting isn't good either.  There is some nice little moments, but there are no decent films with bad acting.  The film isn't that bad if the characters were in the right circumstances. They were really pretty talented and there is no excuse for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. The acting is terrible. I cannot forgive the horrible acting, especially the horrible singing. There is not really any plot or the "plot", so I could only say that the scene which is the centerpiece of the movie was quite good. The rest of the scenes were bad, too, but I must admit, at least I didn't find too disturbing. What made the movie good?  I don't know. Maybe the director just made some comments in his film:  Oh, what a horrible movie this is. I am sorry, but this movie is absolutely useless. I give it 10 1/4 points for entertainment value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I'd like to say that if I'm the kind of person who hates movies of this caliber, then I'm not a person who should be considered a critic. So, I won't say anything. But, what I will say is that the movie was nothing like that. Even if it wasn't, this was a stupid movie. I'm sure I could make it better by making it a better movie. But I don't think I would be able to do that. Why do people think I have all this money in my pockets instead of trying to make it up. How many actors can do that? It wasn't just the main actors. The only thing that kept the film from getting a negative score from me was the editing. The script was totally amateurish. I think the actors are just that, not the actors. This was a horrible waste of money, especially considering it was a fairly good cast. I just sat there and didn't even feel the least bit of joy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie would be a lot better if I could make it in front of a group of people. Not only do they not have a script, but they lack any storyline whatsoever, nor any good direction. The plot is completely incoherent.  I know what happens during the movie, and I would have liked it to have some sort of plot, but it has nothing but the story itself. The ending, although I found the ending to be somewhat interesting, I just wish I got to see more of the movie so that it could be more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film had too many clichés to be considered as even a true story. Even more unbelievable are the scenes and shots. If only I was on my vacation from a movie making gig, I would take it in. But after watching "My Love", I found that it wasn't even that bad. There was just too much bad in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like this movie at all. The plot is bad, it's awful. It doesn't make sense. It's so bad I can't even blame the writers. I would just like to turn my attention off to this movie and not see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is very predictable but really poor. In fact the actors did a pretty good job in this movie but there's a serious flaw. The ending is predictable. The story was good in some parts but the dialog was very weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, yeah, I've seen a good movie, if I'm not really stupid or anything, it's a good one, but this one lacks a bit of character development. The acting is pretty good, and the story was good but I think the ending was a little too slow. The characters don't develop like they should. It feels like a bad low budget movie, I think it's only a movie that needs a plot, some action, a plot. I don't know. I think, in the movie it seems like it's about some type of war in the US, a war of drugs, and some fighting of something with no guns. What is it? A war of some kind, for some type, I don�t know. It was so poorly written, I have never had much fun watching it. I have to find it myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it is a horrible film, if one considers it that way. I think its almost a cliché to have a film set in a dystopian wasteland. I thought that was the only movie I had seen. The other two movies were decent, but I don't think I will ever see them again.  I have to admit that I didn't like these guys either. They seemed like they were a bunch of guys in a garage in a parking garage. It was just a bunch o' guys sitting around playing and watching some movies.  Also, the plot is completely implausible. The first film had the whole story already done. The second one didn't. I mean, for example, I don'T think the story's ending had anything to do with a meteor meteor that lands on a planet in the future. And yet I'm sure the meteor lands on the planet "somewhere" in the past. The same with the first film. I just didn't want to believe there would be a bunch a guys in the garage playing around and doing something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't even find my original DVD and i watched this on TV, so i won't even give it the "9th" rating as I'd like to say. It's a really bad film with a horribly stupid premise. The main thing i can say about this film is the lack of a coherent plot. It was the opposite of funny when i was watching "The Simpsons". The biggest problem with this film and a lot of other "zomba" type films is that their creators have nothing but time and money to go to. The problem with the movie is that it seems like it has nothing to do with the real world. It is just a series of silly events, and the ending is no more real. The best thing about this movie is "The Great Oz", which was released in 1968 (and thus is not part of the film). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a brief prologue about a girl's life and her fiance, I was quite nervous. I watched this film because I felt quite nauseated. The characters seemed like some sort of two teenagers and were the biggest of sloppiness.  I don't know if the scriptwriters read the book for any other genre than romance, which I don`t know because I'm an adult and therefore cannot say how badly the film did with the plot, but the idea of a movie where two teenage boys would get drunk and make fun is pretty much impossible to grasp. At first I thought this was a really good film, but then after seeing it I saw nothing but stupid things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a week of the whole year watching the same film as one of the worst movies of recent years, I decided to watch "House Hunters" on DVD and see it once only. I got a couple of friends to join me for the trip and I knew from the beginning of my trip that this is bad, but what really does it have to do with the story? Not only does it fail to deliver on its own, but it actually doesn't make it much more difficult for me to find any enjoyment in watching it. The acting is poor, the story is shallow and the dialog is terrible. It is also bad to watch an actor like Ben Dancy "hurt" the characters at the beginning. Not only is he so inept, but he also shows no depth of character. What was they really up to? The movie itself has been written so badly that it's difficult to believe it ever exists. There's no point to believe what they do. At least they are trying to be clever, but the overall quality of the movie is so bad that it will probably make your hair itch! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first reaction when I saw the first part of this movie was that it was like a big play. Well, I have to admit that it isn't.  This is what I call, an amateur acting.  The acting is horrible, like a kid who plays a big boy, and the sex scenes are also bad, like some big kid.  I won't make this up, because my life is already lost to the story and you can read the book the way it is.  If this film is not as bad as it was, please don't spend your money on it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm wondering how I could have such a low IQ of 9.9?  Yes, i thought it was ridiculous. If this movie was made, I couldn't have seen it to be this low. I tried for hours, it did not even make sense. Some of the actors should have been able to act for this movie but what you got out of that show, nothing. No one could tell it was even a bad show. How does it feel like that a movie in this genre can be a "hit" or "the real life" that has a "star" and a "name" for a movie of this genre. And how come they have "hairs" or some similar things in it for the main cast? I think I'm forgetting that the actors in this movie are actors who can be in films for real.  I'll tell you what I can see. This movie is no more than a "dagestration" movie. It has the standard story and some plot lines but no depth or personality. It's really nothing that even I would enjoy seeing. It should have a special effect but just shows how it sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really disappointing for me, not just in the quality of the story, the directing, and the cinematography. I have to say that this movie is so bad, that I am so bored with it. I am sure my comments would get much more serious if I used the internet to review it.  What is this movie, where the acting is so weak, that it's almost like a child's acting? The only redeeming factor in this movie was the casting. But it's not enough to redeem the characters. The first "star" is Nick Stansbury, a pretty good actor. In fact, his acting is quite good. But this movie lacks any real depth of value. I don't care about his good acting; it's just OK he's there. But the rest of the acting has absolutely no value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie on another channel, and I couldn't make it out in such a way that I'd like to see it. The acting was awful and the plot was horrible. The "movie", according to me, is the most pathetic film that I've ever seen. It just doesn't take place. It was so bad that I couldn`t believe I'd seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible film with a horrible plot. No characters, no dialog, no action, no "character". This is probably the worst film I have seen in awhile, and that is not even a very bad thing considering the fact that it is based on a novel. If you're looking for a low budget, low budget movie, I would suggest going for something like The Expendations or Dead Earth: A Zombie War. It looks pretty good, if you like zombies or zombies. But this film has none of those things. The film only is about a truck and a giant car crash.  If this movie had an ending, I really would like to find out who the characters in it were. You would think that it would be like a movie that is set up to be interesting but then you just get to find who the people are, and the actors who are there are just horrible actors. You just look at a bunch of zombie-throwing, zombie-sucking zombies and it just seems like noone's going to make this film fun for you. I would probably give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well this is a really bad film in every aspect (if you can call it that). It's so bad that the characters act so horrible that you're almost wondering if they're even human. I'd be tempted to label them "super-villains" if I didn't have to watch the entire movie the first time, and they are certainly not. The ending is pretty good though. It's pretty simple. If it was a real film, I'd like it to be better, but it's obviously not.  But I have seen this film a few times, and I really liked it, but I can tell that I'd have liked it even more if the movie was a comedy and a little bit more like a serious one. But unfortunately, this movie does not take its time to develop any plot. I know, I've read enough of these movies to know that they are not as funny as they were supposed to be. So you just have to be prepared for these movies and avoid the ones that go out when they are so funny. If you've got to watch a movie, try and see it in a theater. If not, avoid it at the very first opportunity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the title says, there is a lot of rape and torture in this movie, which is bad enough to consider to see even the title, but not this movie. You can expect about 10 minutes of rape scenes that have to be viewed to confirm that it is actually a rape, and not just some torture done to a helpless victim. This movie can also be called a "tragacy", although I can see the difference between "trailer" and "film" in the title. There are also a few lines that seem pretty stupid, like for example the line that someone was a "tough guy" and was "stressed out" by it and was going to kill himself. But it's OK, because it makes this movie better. The only thing that this movie did was some stupid, pointless lines, like the line where somebody said the guy "loves" the car. It's not even funny to watch this movie as it is supposed to be, the only thing I can say is that you might be able to enjoy this movie if you don't want to know all the details. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched this movie I knew it was bad but I never knew how bad it was. I was wondering whether they would have been more entertaining to watch if I would have known what the show was. For a comedy show it is so far from that.  When it began I was glad I'd seen it because it was funny but then I started to regret the decision to watch it. I felt so bad I had to go to my friends who were watching it to see if they were as bad as I think. This is just not my favorite episode of comedy. If I'd like to see a comedy I would watch it because I would like to have fun but it's so bad you don't want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing a preview of this movie I'm on the verge of giving myself something that I normally do not. After seeing this I am not going to waste any time. This movie is so bad that you have to assume that it is intended to be a joke. It is a joke, no matter how I can quantify it. There are two good things about this movie: 1) You don't know what this movie is, it's not that. It does not take a long time, like most movies: it can take as long as 10 minutes. I suppose that's the right word, but I don't have enough time to get in to this movie. If you want to see a comedy that can last a few hours and is all about getting caught up on your face you would like to be there. That is the only reason this movie doesn't hold your attention. You can try to rent it: I just rented this movie in a few years. It did not hold my attention. I had a hard time staying in it.  I don`t think that anyone could have a more serious view of this film than the rest of us. I will admit that I bought it because it is funny and I am glad that I rented it. The acting was horrible, even the director wasn`t that good. In every other way it was bad. It's so bad it just didn`t have anything to do. But I suppose you are supposed to be doing something more. There was a story line that was obviously not necessary in the movie. I found that to be extremely boring. The comedy is pretty good and it was funny but it was just terrible.  The fact that you can see this movie after I rented the movie is really strange. After watching it you get a feeling that you don't care and you are just done. I think if you had any sense of humor that you might have some sort of sense of decency, you would have laughed.   The director obviously had some fun. He wanted to make something fun and we can all see it again once. But the movie just doesn`t hold your interest. You have no sense of amusement or enjoyment. You want to be one of the people who can say you get excited to see this because you have not got enough time and you know it's a lousy movie and you just want to stay there. You are hoping that it will make more money and you have the feeling of a good mood
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing that made this movie worth an attempt; but as I said in one of the comments, the only reason was the extremely interesting (and boring) character, but even then that character was boring. The movie has a couple of moments that make this movie an interesting, but one of them is when the guy was pretending to be a priest. I have to admit that I was interested in the idea, but in actual reality it didn't go anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film at the local video store and it's the most disgusting piece of waste of a video ever. It's so bad that it could not make the slightest comment. If your eyes weren't so bad as I suspected from the first minute you would have to see this film to the end. It was bad even more than bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major mis-staging of an utterly pathetic film with an absurd plot and an utterly unbelievable camera. The plot is the same as all other action films and is really nothing new, but this film is just bad in every way. The whole story is just stupid. No one ever thought that the plot would have to have this level of stupidness. Even though this is not a bad film, it is the worst. I can only hope the director is working in his free time. Perhaps he's got a lot of free time, but I'm sure he will miss this one, because I don't think this is going to improve as much as a real action film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something strange about this movie: If you can read it, it's awful. I've seen it, and I've never seen anything like this. It is so dumb, I don't believe it exists. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A low-budget film set in the ruins of Tokyo in a Japanese fantasy novel is a big, weak, disappointing story. A decent cast, but the director didn't know what to do with the characters - most of them are complete non-humans. The scene where the characters are put in a cell is the worst part of this. There are some interesting moments, but there are some parts that don't work - and most of the characters don't really have an idea. They're not really that interesting anyway. Even though it's pretty fun to see a zombie monster that has a soul, the characters just aren't that engaging. The action is weak, too, and the ending just seems to be a bit meaningless. There's also a weak, but somewhat interesting opening scene where a zombie burns a guy on a wall. It's good that it was interesting for a few moments, it just seems too forced and the story isn't good enough to overcome the bad drama. I also felt the characters didn't come alive, like they did in "Tomb Raider", and the characters acted like they weren't dead or anything, which is totally ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this to be a total waste of any enjoyment. The actors were pretty bad. It wasn't good enough for a film like this! I have nothing against anyone who makes movies like this. The fact that the characters are "good" has nothing to do with the fact that this film is a complete waste of it. It was just a waste of time. The end of the movie is horrible. I wish it had the same ending with a happier ending. The "comic" of this movie is the fact you get to finish the film after watching the first 90 seconds and then you have to sit there and watch another hour of "no longer". It's a shame that you can get a 10 out of 10 if you're lucky enough. I just don't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Simple Math Challenge" (aka I'll eat anything that can chew) is about a young girl who wants to join the math club, but soon finds herself in bed with her college boyfriend and her father is there to pick her up, but only after she's got a pregnant pregnant. She is married with her dad and dad is in the hospital because he has fallen out of his heart over a few years and she wants to do the pregnancy in her pregnancy. I have to say, I've seen this show a couple times and never understood what they were trying to convey. Even the title seems to be an intentional attempt to convey the idea that this girl is a baby girl, which makes no sense whatsoever. There is nothing about this story that will help her, I suppose. There's also a bit about a group of guys that try to get her pregnant but she doesn't want to help, and I don't believe it matters anyway.  In conclusion, "A simple Math Challenge (aka My Will Eat Anything That Crips!)" is about like an awful movie that comes across every time. The only good thing I can say is that this is the only good movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, a really bad movie about a bunch of actors who live in a secluded, isolated, anti-human village of a hundred thousand people, where all the characters are either addicted to some bizarre drugs or have some other condition. They want to find out that "the good people" living in the village have escaped from a hell for the rest of their lives. They try to find that evil person by making some sort of ritual, but it turns out to be a huge booby-buddy with a little green mask on her shoulder that makes the villagers into zombies.  A really lame plot, but there are lots of good jokes in this film: the plot is ridiculous (as is true, even with the actors being really bad), the acting is mediocre, and the visuals are too weak to keep the story moving. You can pretty much see what happens to the "good people" on the screen. As the movie goes on, all the villagers are killed and their bodies are brought back to life, and then there's some sort-of supernatural stuff happening at some point and all the dead people are suddenly resurrected (again), but when they wake up, there are new dead bodies in the Village. At the end, the people of the village get back into a circle and everyone gets their senses again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been watching the whole "Star Trek" series with its latest incarnation, "Star Wars" as well as "Star of the Galaxy". With "Star WAR", the result was just the worst of the lot. The only thing that I could cheer about was the fact that it was not quite bad. It was OK as long as we didn't get stupid dialogue, but not as much as the "Star MAN" trilogy. Even the "Rage of Monsters" was better than the "LUNGE" trilogy and the "Lord of the Rings" series, at least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a small town in the Midwest, about a little village, with a fairly large house, a few houses, a small community in a village near the river, a bunch of kids, and a big house nearby on another side of the river. One of the kids in this small village is a woman who had some serious problems before the movie started. This lady is basically a very annoying person. At some point during the movie she is a big, big, blonde woman and tries to be a rocker. She wants to get some money to pay off her gang of thugs. In order to get money she tries to rob other towns so that her gang doesn't get killed.  This movie is not so bad, but it contains lots of stupid stuff. The story of one of the main characters is a pretty basic plot, as we all know. The main character is about to have a son, and it's pretty early when we start showing how the boys get a little bit of money.  But once the son starts getting a little involved with the gang and starts getting involved in their business, things become very silly. There's a guy in the village who is a crook, and at some point a big guy who is not as important as the other guys, but gets away from the crook in order to keep it that way. The crook and the kid are pretty close, but they aren't exactly friends, and neither are there are much chemistry between them.  Then the big guy decides to get the little girl involved in some money that will be needed for a gang to kill the mayor, so he wants her to sell a truck and get some cash for it. They get married, but because the mayor is a small person, the rest of the gangs try to keep him from going into the business with the big man. This is pretty dumb, because it doesn't add up to the overall story, and the plot has something going for it but the whole thing just doesn't stick.  Overall, the movie is bad. It's about the girl, the village, and some crooked-ass people on the island who just want to be picked on for a big money deal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of John Carpenter, but this movie was about him. It's not just bad, it's flat out terrible. This is the kind of movie that you want a little bit of sleep after a few hours of too much to work. It was only to get some sleep and find out that John Carpenter had actually come back to life. I guess that's not too much for a horror movie, but I don't want to waste my time with him or his movie anyway.  This movie is probably one of the worst horror movies ever made. It isn't even worth buying a DVD of this movie. It just doesn't come alive. It starts out badly, with a completely pointless plot. I'm just waiting for some new film to fill in the void. It is a shame that even John Carpenter's name was lost in this movie because this movie didn't need him to bring to the screen. He should have known his character wasn't going to like it. This movie just doesn;t even make any sense. Maybe I should buy some more John Carpenter movies, but there are better choices. My next movie: one hour in to the end, I guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have the most painful nightmare that I have ever had in my life. I tried watching this film on a DVD with all the credits, and I was so sick and grossed out by the horrible acting and horrible scenes, that I decided to throw it away and do some research instead. The only thing I have to say is that it is not like a movie I would have expected. The story is only two minutes long, and they use it to reinforce the stupid idea that this movie is "real life" or a "movie about a real world". The director is the only person I can think of to make this movie. His name isn't recognizable, and his movie is not even a good one, and the plot is pretty stupid and not much of a story. I was afraid of the fact that they gave this movie to a movie buff who's known for a movie, but what he did was just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have seen this movie, you might not remember it. It is not funny. It lacks originality, and nothing significant can be found anywhere in this movie. Even the plot of the original movie is more or less duplicated. We can only guess what the plot is, and that has got nothing to do with the actors. The movie isn't good either. There is no direction. The only interesting thing was the very cute and sexy cast. The bad thing about this movie is that the good actors (Bianna & Jennifer) actually played the roles of two good actors, and the bad actors (Niceland and Robert) were simply OK. The ending was simply terrible.  If your looking for a really good movie: I would highly recommend that if you get this movie: don't waste a minute of time and go by a DVD (e.g. The Critics). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I laughed through this film so hard it was sickening. I was not even looking at any of the characters. They are a bunch of people who are so desperate to find a magic and a magical object that they have to be prepared to go through all of it, and I am surprised there aren't much of the "magic" involved in the story. The plot of the movie is a lot like "Passionate Crys" or "Beautiful Little Mermaid", although they're both very shallow and poorly written. I had no idea what to expect from this movie. I mean, it does have "magic", but that is only when you are under the influence of the father, or the mother, or any other person. I'm not sure why they would do that, but I was so bored and disinterested in the whole thing. I wish that this movie was better written. The acting is terrible, but that's okay. The characters are not that interesting, although I do love the actors (they are great) and the movie lacks a good script. If it had more time, I would have enjoyed this movie more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, like most other films, is just plain crap. There are some fine moments but the movie does not reach the critical level of an awful film and this is the first of the bad movies i've ever seen. The plot is pretty bad. I mean they could have done better than that. The ending is also awful. The movie is made so cheap, that it becomes laughable. This is not a movie for the sake of entertainment. You'd be surprised how little people like this movie. I'd go to see it only if I thought it could be good, but it never seems to be that.  This movie is probably an experiment for the director because it will probably appeal to some people. But if you're like me and are a big fan of the movies made in the 70's, you'll be very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty good, but it really falls apart at the end when you get too close to the main characters. The movie really could have made a solid, if not better, film with the main character. But I can't really blame the writers and casting for that. It's a shame that the movie had to go so far down the road to avoid revealing the main plot. They should have put in some dialogue and some thought provoking actions which they could have had in the movie, instead of just the action in the first half of the movie. For example, a woman who has been missing for ten years would be a little more interesting. I would like to see if the writer really thought it could work in a small setting with no supporting cast, but I doubt it would.  The ending is unsatisfying. In the end, a man is missing and all of the characters have been dead for 30 years and the end was bad. It should have been the end of the film.  I'd recommend going to the nearest movie theater and seeing this one over a weekend and leaving this horrible movie behind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even think that this movie is original. It's a "B" movie of the 2000s. There are plenty of cheap flicks that would fit nicely in a movie: the annoying, over-dressed, dumb hero of "Vik" is an obnoxious and obnoxious teenager. This movie is bad, it's not funny, and it's a total waste of time to watch it. The plot is weak, the plot is predictable, the actors are horrible, and the acting is bad. I've just seen it twice and I couldn't even give up and try to look at the new stars, like the old star-zoom of "The Menace". This movie doesn't deserve a repeat to any special category. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of movie that shows a person who thinks that life would be better if she was to try to kill people and does nothing but make them believe she is good. It is so bad that I wonder why it was even made. I'll admit that some actors had done such a good job earlier, but as soon as they get into a movie, they all start talking about how bad their characters are. I'm sorry to say that these people really deserve the biggest award for worst acting in a horror movie ever, as well as the worst movie ever. The acting was pretty bad, in general. It looked like everyone's scenes were made in a very small area, and they seemed to be filmed in an office with a projector, with a few people sitting in the hall, and I couldn't imagine why the audience had such low-end actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have ever seen that contains zero plot or humor.  The film is a typical dumb-adventure story with a plot contrived and uninteresting premise.  In the beginning, I thought that this film was interesting, but it quickly became an incomprehensible and boring piece of footage.  There are just two scenes involving a red-haired girl, who has an annoying laugh, and who looks at some strange animal-like creatures.  This one's not funny in any way, although it may be interesting to look at in some light of it. But I don't know why they were even in this film. It's like watching a cat scratch a cat in a tree.  Well, if you are going to make a movie for kids or teenagers, you would better do something that people would actually watch, like the Pixar short-short film "Up Together!"  Maybe there's some sort of logic in there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely no good. I guess that the director thought it would make some sense to portray the family members in an almost perfect manner. I was expecting much more from the director. However, when the people in the family are in their "fun" pose for the camera, it isn't. The actors look like they don't have any money. We also see a lot of nudity in the film. I've seen worse. A lot of rape scenes too, and just because we can show the naked bodies of the actors it was all pretty boring. The music is okay, but not for that reason. I really don't understand the "music" being made for the film, but it doesn't help us either.    I give this movie a 8 (out of 10) but I really didn't like it. The ending was unsatisfactory, and the acting seemed weak. The plot was weak, too. There was a lot more in it than the actual plot and plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you get a chance to see this film, you might as well give yourself some cash and see it at a bargain basement in a local strip club (that still somehow makes me remember a time, somewhere in my memory).  If your luck is that you know a good girl, you're going to give a really stupid movie a 10.  This movie is full of predictable garbage, not even as I suspected in the first hour. I watched it in hopes of a good comedy, but it doesn't deliver. I think it's worse than a decent movie because it's the type of movie that is just plain bad to watch, but that's not enough to spoil it for me.  It's really bad that these guys are so talented, but this movie is not a comedy. No matter what they do in the movie, if you're in a comedy, you should just go somewhere and try and find yourself something more entertaining. That's all the way, and I've heard some decent comedy routines for this movie, but none of them will help us out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The premise (which was supposed to be a romantic comedy) doesn't make sense when viewed on any level. The acting is bad, the comedy is bad and the plot is bad. But, that's a good movie. I would have to do something different with this one. I have watched this movie multiple times, and I was never satisfied. I had a brief time in the theater with the first two actors, and now I'm hoping that I will never have to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically a sequel of the movie "A Christmas Nightmare", so I can't really comment on the two movies and find out why so many people got to see it. But I did like the first one. I was just an American idiot, not a horror fan, and the story of a group of people who are drunkards and go on a drunken trip up to Las Vegas to try to find out who their parents are. This movie really goes downhill at an awfully fast pace. The scene with the kids are about 20 minutes too long. But it's still an okay action film. There are some good special effects but the script isn't as good as the first film. A lot of the gore scenes aren't shown in the movie so you don't feel the same sense of dread that you do when watching this one. The acting is poor as well. There is a scene where you find out that everyone has a sex addiction and you can't help but wonder if he's going to kill the woman. It's so bad I couldn't stop watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would go as far as I'd go to say and say that i just couldn't get it. i felt like there was nothing in it but a bunch of clichés or one sentence long piece. i just didn't get the message, but at least some sort of message.  i won't say what I did so i just went with it.  I think i just wanted to get my mind into the book, but was too bored by the rest of the movie.  Maybe i missed the ending at the end. it was just one paragraph and a couple of lines. i thought about seeing the ending in the book and was just waiting for the ending to happen. i don't know what a "fantastic" message would be, but a guy doesn't get to go and get that message out on a person who has been a sex slave for 35 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Hemoron", as it stands, is very predictable. In this case, there is no real suspense or mystery in the movie. I mean, the actors are a couple of hot actors, but even with them you have no idea about their character's feelings. In fact, I never understood why these people who were the parents were so scared of their children. Maybe the director just had a copy of a copy and it was that copy of the movie that he decided to use as a script.  The only thing that keeps this movie from being interesting is the ridiculousness of the characters' actions. If I were a human being, I would have laughed out loud at every time one of the actors acted. There is a scene where the man was forced to drink a hot beverage in a bathroom as if he had just been caught drinking. The only way I would like to see them try to act this way was just the fact that the director had written the script. He knew the audience would see it, so he just put it on in a way so the audience will do it.   If you enjoy a bad piece of cinema, you will be left completely satisfied with very little satisfaction. But if you are a person who doesn't have a lot of patience, you might even consider watching it to see if the actors can act in it any more than they appear on the screen.  This movie should not be one of your favorites. This movie will go down as a waste. It should be reviewed as a bad waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really surprised that this film would turn out to be the best movie ever. As I sat down with my wife and my dog to watch this film, I had no idea what I was going to think of it. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my time. There isn't much that can be said. If it was true, I'd be surprised that people could actually watch this movie, because I don't believe this is even good enough to be a movie. This movie was a waste of time. It is about two guys who are both in love with a girl and a girl who is dating another girl.  What a really lousy plot, and what a complete non-character, if that were the case it would be the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has nothing to recommend except for being an awful slasher. As I was watching this film I couldn't believe what the producers were trying to pull off. The acting is ridiculous. If the movie had any substance it would be a horror film. But there is no substance, it is a rip off of a horror movie. They really should use their imagination more to make a horror flick instead of a slasher movie. I give this movie a 8 because it was bad. I don't care if this movie is in 2 or 3 or 4 out of five. If you get an actor, you just give it away and you don't spend anything. The story could have made itself out of something, but that's not the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the most horribly stupid and stupid movies I've ever seen. I rented this on DVD about 4 years ago, and was immediately turned off.  I can't fathom that this movie is so bad. When I rented it my second time I thought it was pretty funny and I thought this movie was funny, but I don't remember any of it.  The plot is so convoluted and contrived that the movie can only be described as a movie with no plot. The actors don't even act like they're in the movie. They seem like they should have some sense.   As I mentioned, the movie stars a blonde girl who can't stop sucking off her boyfriend, a really hot guy who's a hot girl who's sucking off his girlfriend, and a really annoying black guy with no discernable character. The director obviously doesn't know what he's doing. I don'T know what these people are. I've never met one. Even if I saw the plot for myself I'd never know.  This is the first movie I've rented from the video store with the worst plot I've seen in years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad not because it has a lot of funny and interesting things. This movie tries to make everything seem a certain way but it just falls apart.  This film just has one really awful character in it and it's really really just boring!  I wouldn't really call this a comedy. It's just stupid. I couldn't believe this movie was a real movie. The movie has some good humor but it doesn't have any. If you like to laugh and see funny stuff and you'll enjoy it for that, I'd give this movie a 8 out of 10 but it's just not that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well the movie was so much worse than usual. It was full of the same predictable crap in the original that had to stay in the movies. This movie was just a lot more predictable than the original movie. I can't imagine how it could've been such a big deal. This was really bad. My expectations for the original was that this movie would be a big shock to me. But I had the same expectations when this movie was made. It wasn't. It didn't make me feel any closer to the real world. I don't really know how they got into this plot. I think there was some strange elements that I never noticed, such as the robot army. It's like they were trying to be a real person that was being manipulated by the robot. The way they filmed it is really bad, but I think it made the robot look like a big robot like that was supposed to have some intelligence. Maybe that's what they intended. I just think the movie would've been better if they would've just kept the plot, and not put in some other elements. I'm glad the show was canceled. I'll be on the lookout for the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad that it was almost incomprehensible. I didn't even remember when I had seen this movie.  The acting wasn't so bad though the plot was good. But the ending just left a huge gaping hole in the story.  I don't see where that had gone. I could have understood the ending. Why is that? You're telling me that the only way to save the princess is to shoot the dragon with a gun? So, I guess the dragon could have been saved a few hours later. Why? What could have made the ending? I think it was just that the ending has an end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it and after the first 20 minutes, I felt so uncomfortable and sick that I just walked away from it. At least it made me look like I would rather take my time watching. The biggest problem with the movie was that it failed to deliver any "main plot" storyline whatsoever. The main characters were completely unimportant to the story. The film just seemed like another story of a typical horror movie in which there are some interesting characters that were thrown in place without ever getting properly focused on or even being interesting. The plot was just a bunch of pointless scenes and an old woman with some weird scars. I just don't understand why anybody would ever get involved in a film with this stuff. The only thing that was consistent in the story was that the characters were horrible and incompetent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Devil" (1991) is a pretty bad film. The story is ridiculous, but the story really isn't all that ridiculous. The acting is terrible, with an awful one-sided story. If you were a Devil who actually had to jump in the air like that then you would have screamed at me. And it's hard to believe that there are people named "Dirty" in "The Devils" because of their acting. The fact that it's impossible to believe what it's about is why it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical horror film: boring, bad, bad. I was very intrigued to see the ending, and I just couldn't believe it had been done, nor did I buy it until I saw it in the store for $2.99.  This movie is not just a cheap film, but the first movie was also a piece of crap, and it deserved to be just that.  The plot is so bad, that you can't even start paying attention to it. It's not a good idea to have it out at Halloween.  I wish there would be more films like this. This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. It has absolutely no point. You can just go away and laugh, like a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is very predictable, it is not clever nor funny, it lacks any kind of special talent. It is a waste of money and not that exciting, although it may have a few amusing moments. There are two reasons to not like it: First, its pretentiousness - the story and a few funny scenes make it too boring to even watch. And secondly, it doesn't really deliver anything new. For starters, the characters are basically identical. A lot of the scenes involve a guy with a huge beard and a lot of big hairy bald men and a huge, hairy woman. A film that could have been a hit with a lot more screen time would have been better. Even the scenes featuring the biggest bald man in the world are totally useless. If you are a fan of big bald bald men, this is not the movie for you. This is basically the same as a very bad movie that you would only watch if you want to see some action. This film will be one of the worst movies I will ever watch in my life. I wish I hadn't made this movie but I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the review about this movie, and was baffled by the way it was portrayed. What I thought was supposed to be a satire of the plight of the homeless, the tragedy that came about in the first 20 minutes.  I have never laughed so bitterly, so hard, or so deeply, with a movie: it made me nearly sick. I thought that it was only a comedy, that it would be a comedy but, instead, it was more like a horror.  To answer your question, "What do you think that was? It was a parody of a bad joke!"  Not only that, but it was so bad that it should not be released, even with a disclaimer. It's horrible, so bad you can only laugh at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I am watching this I get so sick and sick and sad that the movie is like it's been brought to the stage to be part of some movie that isn't a movie but is some silly show and is just not good. At the start I thought that I had seen it in another movie and was very familiar with it. I had to laugh at the first part when the director couldn't keep it straight. The acting was very bad and the scenes had little direction. There is a good song at the beginning but then the whole song goes off. The film could have done without some of the characters in it and they could have made a more entertaining film. The songs were good but the story isn't. The directing couldn't be done any better than this one. And the camera camera is not very good either. I won't see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this is not a movie to be good. There's some plot elements that make it alright, but they're not strong enough to pull the story. The acting is just OK, although the story itself was pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In an attempt to make a positive review about one of the worst TV series I've seen. I watched the first episode and was pretty disappointed by the fact that I wasted an hour of time watching it. The fact that this is one of those shows with people with very little or no real talents in the first person (Kelley and the "Ace") would be a better comparison to this show.  I won't watch the whole show, but if I did I would rather spend some more time on this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very weak excuse for a film with questionable character development. While it's certainly well-set, it's still not a great film. The premise is not original. It's got about 10 minutes or so of drama. The rest of the movie, while there are some decent scenes, there are not much. Very, very dark, and very predictable. This is unfortunate, as it seems to be one of the better comedies of the year - this is a sad shame. A good comedy is about some good jokes and sometimes funny ones. In this case, the jokes were so bad, they didn't make a good one anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can say that this movie is bad but not that I mean to say that it is bad. It is not that bad. I would watch the first episode of the show and I would not even think twice of it. This is the biggest waste of time of any movie ever made. I just want to be left alone to watch the original "Flex" because it was good. I wanted to watch it because it got my blood pumping and made me cry. But this movie just keeps getting worse and worse. The fact that it's so bad goes back to me. The ending was terrible, but not in a bad way. I didn't even have any emotion for the actors. The reason this movie was made in a vacuum is because of the lack of any real plot to speak of. The movie was about a little girl. In my opinion, it should have had a plot to help her win in the end, but the fact that this doesn't, really makes me upset. It's just a movie without a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is some really awful film with bad acting, bad cinematography and bad editing. The film sets a sad-but-good picture about a woman who wants to keep her daughter's secrets and is very naive. That's all. The characters are just awful. The only funny character in the film is the daughter, and it's not that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had some reservations about this movie for various reasons, but they weren't really that significant. However, I had a pretty good time with it, so that was probably why it didn't get my vote. Unfortunately, despite my reservations, the movie is actually quite predictable and doesn't provide any significant insight. It's a waste of time at the expense of wasting your time on the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a very weak villain and a pretty weak hero. It's a shame because it's so bad.  In the beginning the villain is really convincing and his evil deeds are very effective but this becomes dull and difficult to watch. Then when the hero starts to join his cause he starts getting bored and decides to quit. He tries to get his own shot at the villain but doesn't succeed. The fact that the villain doesn't seem like a killer but actually uses an explosive device is just infuriating. Then the movie goes and gives a lame plot for the villain to show off. It just turns into a very dull storyline.  The characters are very poor as well-known horror movies and the movie is very predictable. The villain doesn'n act like that great villain from "The Matrix" with the huge jet pack. The hero is nothing more than a cliché-gum villain and the plot is not made at all interesting for the protagonist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this movie in a cinema with a lot of empty "fun" dialog I decided to see this one again after watching it twice. After 15 minutes of that I found myself screaming with my eyes in a little girl's voice. There was no plot or reason to follow the story of "Little Red Riding Hood", it had no storyline or motivation, it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and I can't imagine why someone would even consider watching this. The only thing that made me angry was that I had to see that two girls and their son at the same time, and the same film would make me laugh again. I couldn't stop laughing, and after the final 2 hours I was so disturbed that I decided I would be giving this movie 10 out of 10. What a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible and I found myself looking for my first "Cargo" episode since they aired in the mid-nineties and I watched it at 2 AM in the summer time with my cousin and her boyfriend when we were in a park. I saw it on TV again. I've seen this movie 3 times. My brother, her mom, his best friend, me all thought the movie was bad. We just wished the original series would stay intact because it was a great plot.  But what were we talking about last time? That's all we really wanted and it's only now that I am really having fun listening to this horrible movie. It's no surprise, I'm so bored by it that I just gave it 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I know what Hollywood is for, and I'll tell them to shut down. I'm not going to give you this advice. I've seen enough of the horror genre to know that it sucks to watch. I couldn't even make this movie, because I know that I can't get sick. And yet, the makers wanted me to watch it, I know they want it to make me sick. I gave my wife's copy to some friends in her apartment, and she got excited. She's embarrassed. The story starts a little too late, but I guess she knew that was the best place for a movie to begin. I don't really care how you do the thing in the beginning of the movie, but as I watched it I noticed that it didn't get the message right.  I just can't afford to see this one. I have to wait for the disclaimer to get the movie: it doesn't include a copy of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a big rip-off from the "Zodiac Files", but it is pretty awful anyway. The fact that the new book is out there now is what really concerns me. It's just embarrassing that people still think that people can solve this movie. And there's nothing new about this movie either. The plot is just a big lie. The real question here is that if people actually know anything about "Zephyr", what should they do with it. This movie is nothing but an excuse for people who think that they have to learn something for the next time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a friend who saw this movie when we got it in our DVD player. I was shocked at what I found in it: an utterly incomprehensible plot that involves a series of murders that involve a group of black people. There's nothing that makes sense. One can murder another. So you have to read the plot or something else and decide whether they make sense. And if they are only part of the movie- the actors are very good, but it's a waste of a movie.   This movie is an anti-crime plot. It's so bad, and I can't explain why. I wish I had some more time to wait for it to finish. I have to admit it's an anti American crime story, but its not the same kind of thing that we have seen so much in the last few years. I'm ashamed that I just bought this movie with the intention of watching it, but I have such high hopes that this movie would be great! It's a total waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I said in the earlier review, I thought this was a movie intended to be a comedy or horror film. However, this one is full of bad movies and they never should have made a comedy like this one. It's not interesting or amusing to see it so anything except for those who have seen it twice before. I'd like to see one of the movie's original parts just to make sure it wasn't bad; the parts I saw were pretty good. Alas, this movie does not deliver any laughs or scares at all. You can actually watch a decent scene of the dog and human characters but they never come together and are not funny.  I have to admit, I did laugh as much as I was watching this movie, because it did a lot of damage to the genre and the films that inspired it. I'm really upset at the actors for this bad movie. The first part was good but what I can say is that it didn't make any sense. It really is just a lot more bad than it appears to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just like other movies, there is too much gore, and the story is bad-making. For example, the man has a huge penis, which is only seen in his hand. A good plot is missing. This is a total waste of time. If you get a little more info, let me use it. The man could take out his enemies and make his wife pregnant. I am really disappointed that it didn't happen. If it was a movie, it would have been interesting and interesting. But, this is just a movie without substance. I hope you guys will reconsider taking this one and put it in the least dangerous genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is pretty predictable and is very predictable. In the beginning the movie is very boring and is predictable, but then as the story progressed it is boring as well. The ending is very slow and one could easily miss.  The story is really weak, with a predictable ending.  Most of the actors had terrible lines. If your expecting something different, don't give this movie a chance. If you like acting, don don't expect the same movie you would see in a lot of other movies.  I don't recommend this movie for any of my friends, except the people who have seen it for the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I picked the movie: 1 out of 5 - 7 of the bad films I saw from the film this year.  This was a sequel to "The Adventures of Freddie the Furlay." The original, it has a "My mom really liked Freddie" storyline. With this sequel, it does not have any character development and doesn't do a great job.   "Fooling is a horrible way to put life in perspective" is an excuse for a bad film.  If you want to make a film about a clown, then I recommend you to read the book or watch something else. This movie is so bad that it's impossible to tell whether "Fools" is meant to be a comedy, horror, horror or "film" or whatever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and it is simply a disaster of an unscripted movie about a serial killer and a pair of killers in a room. It is about an older person who thinks the kids, in the beginning, is an agent of an organized crime gang, but later comes up to be the guy who kills kids. The kids aren't supposed to be murderers, at least not as serial killers. The movie is made quite plain that the guy is doing what he wants to do.  This is, of course, a typical slasher film, but it's rather hard to understand why anyone could care about it, because there is no explanation.  It's a little better that the movie contains a very disturbing sexual scene, but in that case, the scene isn't that difficult to understand. The acting is terrible, it's too predictable and the way they are introduced are stupid. The scene is too long, as if someone would die in an hour and a half.  The movie tries to build up its momentum through a stupid script. In the beginning the scenes are pretty good and even the scene that opens with a serial killing is quite suspenseful.  In the end, there is nothing new. It doesn't even do anything except to make me want to read the book. And you wonder what the writer had to do with that. If the movie is a copy of something from "Twin Star", it's a real waste of time. I will tell you, not only was the original writer, but apparently the actors had to re-do the scenes to make sure there would be a plot. I can't even begin to imagine how anyone could get into such a complete mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really an unwatchable piece of trash, as we just have the ending for reference. It is so bad that I have decided to recommend to my friends and not see it again.  I can't even believe what this movie is. This movie will NEVER make it to my mind, but if it does make it out, I'll definitely take it to the trash bin. This is just plain old bad, with no real characters, like the rest of The Simpsons. I don't have any sympathy for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a shame. The story is pretty good, but the acting is terrible. Too bad. I'm willing to admit that the acting was OK in this case, but I think they could have found a better story with more action. Maybe a short, one-tracked episode with a much better story would have been nice. I was expecting a better episode with more dramatic, compelling actors, but this only got two scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As an example of a bad way to communicate, I like the storyline of the young girl, who has a huge crush on her boyfriend (The older boy, who just wants to take her to school with her). But unfortunately the story isn't very memorable and nothing good happens when she is put in a high school, and the end result is the worst outcome of all.  So for example, the story was pretty good with the end where she went to school, went to college and got her boyfriend into her new college, but when she leaves, we only find out that she didn't have the graduation ceremony ceremony she said she would have. The only good thing that happened was the ending with her boyfriend kissing her sister, so that's OK, that's her brother kissing her. The funny thing was that when she was at school the teacher didn't find out about the kissing, and it was funny to see the teacher being surprised that she got that for an adult.  Overall, it's pretty bad that when the guy has to make love, he usually takes an unimportant family member as his partner and then leaves his girlfriend, the end of course is that he wants to make a commitment to the woman, because he's in love with her but she keeps asking him why he doesn't want to be in a relationship with her and not be in the same relationship. I thought, because of the end, he has to ask about it and get his girlfriend to make her see the wedding ceremony that he has planned before. That's just not how you plan a relationship, you should just make love and go to a wedding ceremony because you can't wait forever! The ending just had me rolling out of my seat! The fact that the teacher (as you can see) was really surprised when he left his job is even more annoying. I really don't like how teachers get out of this mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see what a horror film would look like. I'd be very happy with "The Purist" if it was a horror movie like "The Ring" or "The Exorcist" and it would be a good movie.  The film is a piece of trash and its not funny.  I'm tired of this crap. I have a really good laugh at this crap and this is the reason why I decided to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, that's a bad name for "Troy" and even worse for "the Sons of Anus." After the fact that the first episode of the series was about a cop's obsession with "Crazy Men," I was hoping for better. And then I got caught in the second episode.  There are only one or two parts in this film that are good, one of those two is a very interesting villain in the book. I think it was about the same villain in book 1, and not a complete bad movie, although the villain is definitely pretty good in the first episodes. But the film is really bad. I guess it's a good movie because the acting is good. But if it is, it's just like a movie I've seen many times. This is bad, no matter who you are, and it's no good for a movie: it's about a very bad movie that doesn't even try to make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a very bad movie, but it is not one of the worst movies I've seen. It's just a bad little movie. In the end, it just ends, so everything has been destroyed. All the way it seems, it is very predictable and nothing new. It can't get a message to the people who actually created this movie. All I know is that it's about the man that fell into the well. And it's supposed to be about the life of a man. What happens, is that he had a son.  The plot of this movie is that a man tries to find out who is responsible for the murder. His wife thinks that she got pregnant because she could have made it. Well, the son of the woman killed in the hospital is dead, but we can't find him.  He is a good guy, so, no one would be mad at him. But in the end it is impossible to find the killer. Who is he and why he has a wife who thinks he had an affair with another woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just to save a few laughs and to bring us to the very worst place in comedy. If there are any funny movies worth watching in 2016, this one doesn't fit any of them. I don't know why this is. This is the movie equivalent of a bad sitcom...a very bad, sad movie with bad jokes and bad jokes, and I thought of a better movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was quite interesting, but the ending (which was quite horrible) proved to be just a pile of tritons, a bunch of clones who have the powers to save the world. While there are good characters, the story just doesn't go anywhere (which is the main reason the story is so bad).  The other part of the movie was a buncha scenes with a bunch a clones that we never see in the main plot. When this was shown it was just a weird scene. The rest of the film is a pointless collection of scenes which we don't get to see. The idea of an evil cloning girl is hilarious at first, but once you find out she's a monster (after her death) it seems to be quite annoying.  If you were hoping to see some action, don't waste the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dark Knight 3" is basically a big fat waste of precious screen time. There are a few things I can say that couldn't even be said in a negative way, like the fact that the entire "Dark Knight 3' series (and some of its sequels) are the direct-to-the-video games of a video game fanatic. I thought I was the last writer in the universe, who can do better than this. I didn't like the ending, especially the final boss battle. The movie just has too much cheese and was so far removed from the story to the actual plot. The ending could be done with an actual movie instead. The action scenes were so overdressed with sex scenes, especially graphic graphic scenes, that it really brought down the mood and was just an utter waste of time.  I'm not saying this is the fault of the writers, because it is one of many films made by some of the best filmmakers of their generation, and I'm sure they all learned lessons that the others didn't use as much. They just aren't good enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first season of Breaking East was not great. Its premise and the fact that it was a comedy had a certain charm, but the first episodes weren't as good as the second one. The comedy ended with a pretty good show, but it's very difficult to suspend your disbelief for an hour. The problem with the show was the lack of plot. What's it, we don't know what the plot was. For instance, in one episode we found out that a killer was dead... but we didn't know that he was dead. What we did see, he was really really dead, and in fact the killer was never caught in the act. We know what happens next, but we never know what it was.  Then there's the problem with that killer. It was so terrible that I was almost willing to admit it was an impossible thing to guess that it had killed someone, and it was impossible to guess how it had done. It's not good to think that people just knew that a crime had been committed, but there are countless things that can't be inferred.  I was really bored the second season, but I think the final episodes were much better than the first one. A lot of great actors failed us in the second installment, and I can only blame the writer and director for having the idea to do this. I'm pretty confident that there will be a third season, and if that's the case, I would recommend canceling the second episode. I just didn't like it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really bad. There's not a lot of plot, but the fact that they use a giant robot to attack another planet in the future, which is really cheesy as well as a piece of garbage, is. I don't know how I feel about this movie, but I find it hard to care about the action scenes, and I can't blame the filmmakers. The actors should never have been chosen that, as they are clearly incompetent, and the movie had nothing. For example, I'd like to see better action, if the movie was about robots instead of robots, but this is not the case.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm having trouble believing this movie was a film. I thought the acting was OK, but the action sequences were the worst. The story could have been filmed differently. It is bad for a "star" filmmaker. The acting in this film is unbelievable. The special effects are lousy and most of the shots of the movie are just unreal. The sets and the photography are terrible. This movie isn't about a murder but about an actor, that doesn't have a heart or heart in him.  If you want to see this movie: Don't let it be in the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was made for the purpose of killing the original film.   It is extremely cheap to produce, the acting is bad and the characters are poorly written.  I don't know where the actors are based on the characters, but I know they don't exist.  Overall this is a really bad production, but it's worth watching for what it's going to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one scene where two people are kissing, one of them looks like he has a beard and he's holding one up while they are kissing.  It isn't funny, it is just embarrassing to see how the guy is making a joke about it. If this movie was even a movie: I'll never see it again. It's so bad. I would never recommend it. I mean you would watch it if you're a fan of the original series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I did not enjoy it at all. I will never want to see this movie again. It doesn't get any better than a bunch of sad little people shouting about stuff. The only reason this movie made it is that it did make me think that the other two movies had fun and should have made them more entertaining. This movie is terrible and the only reason I gave this movie a 10 is because I like other movies that do better with it and the fact that I did like the other ones is just irrelevant. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is predictable, as always, so it isn't that much fun. The characters are predictable, so if you aren't expecting a movie with a plot at all you might enjoy something like the film, but not much. This is what a movie can be like when a director wants to waste the money.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a total waste of time and effort. I mean that this movie was extremely disappointing, as it failed to accomplish what was supposed to be the main purpose of this film, which was to introduce us to the movie. It had a disappointing opening sequence, which I think was the only reason it failed, because it did not provide any real entertainment. I'm not sure whether it's a bad idea or a bad production technique, but if it is it certainly a bad one. It's just a plain-old, dumb-wail job of trying to get the audience to make the initial impression that a movie is meant to be. I guess the writers felt that this would be a good idea to do and I guess they thought it would be good if it actually did it. They should have thought of some better ideas and ended it at the beginning of the movie instead of this silly wackiness. It looks like they had a pretty good idea with a funny premise, but when they tried to put it all together it seemed to me like they didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely no dialog, no plot, nothing. It is not even the funniest part in my memory. The only thing that was funny was the stupid acting.  I'd be tempted to call this one a film for all the low budget British movies and slap this one on a pile of garbage. This is about an British soldier with a black bag strapped around his shoulder trying to find his "missing wife" who is a spy for the British Government. At the end of the film she goes to jail for being involved in a terrorist bombing. Why did she get into this film? Was there any way she could do something like that in a real war zone? I can't imagine why it happened at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can't say that this movie was very good, but it was pretty bad. It seems that the creators of this movie wanted to recreate the famous "B" storyline from one of the last "B"'s film (I think this is why the actors had to work on a new B movie in order to develop the story). The original story was a lot like that film, but in fact, it was worse than that. This story is full of a pointless plot. The dialog was way too long, with no plot! And I think the actors should have read their own book, because this movie contains no plot whatsoever. The plot is very predictable. The ending leaves nothing to do with the characters... It's just another silly movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a classic case of an overrated dumb teen movie that is all the same. It lacks a storyline or the usual plot elements and fails to develop. The main character is obviously a naive girl, who can barely read the book on the book's cover. She is the one person who is aware of all the world's evils and she can't seem to believe it. There's a little bit of nudity in the movie and it's pretty obvious that the nudity is for male tities. The movie revolves around a girl who is having sex with a group of girls (or at least I believe that there is some sort of sex) and there are some scenes which are just not worth paying attention to. Even though it contains a plot, there really isn't much of a plot to it and the film tries to pull away from the plot so much that you can see the plot without being completely blind. There are some weird scenes that involve the characters in a house, but they just aren't interesting enough to matter much. In the end, the movie just ends in disappointment. I don't see the writer's plan to make the story more interesting by making an hour or hour or half hour longer, so I'd stay away from it. The DVD is a horrible waste of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first 20 seconds of this movie I saw "Lift" and immediately wondered why the movie was trying to include a real man in a movie. In some films this would make it okay to see them. In this movie the man is not a man, but just a man. He looks really, really ugly. There's nothing in this movie that is either true or real. The story is predictable, the characters are predictable, and the actors are predictable. Even though they are real people I have to wonder how many people will ever see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I can give this movie a 1 out of 10:  The plot is interesting but I just don't know what to do with it.  If the scriptwriters had a good script or a good concept, it would have been fun.  As I say, the plot is not the same as the movie you can see in the theater, with a lot more detail and some more surprises.   I am afraid I will miss the actors' performances if it's not a movie.  But I guess you can call it a movie if the acting is OK.  Bottom line:  No. At all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible, and there are some things that are funny in it that just cannot repeat without having some continuity, but the most annoying one was the little bit about a little boy that got a girl and got attached to his girlfriend. If it is any consolation, it does get funnier than the rest of the movie.  I would give this movie 2/10 because the director of this movie, Jim Gage, should not have made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main plot is one person who was killed at a gas station in the past, and it's been four years since he dies. So after they find out that she killed her husband they go to look for him and find him at another gas station on the edge of the city. They find him and watch some of the guys in the gas station to make a deal with them.  Unfortunately, they are unable to get the information because the guys are on their way and only a few minutes before they go there.  The story is not interesting. It's just a cheap, but incredibly slow paced. I didn't get to see the first half of the film. The main character is a guy who was once in a hospital while being held captive and he doesn't try to get help. He had no idea that he had done something so horrible and was only a little concerned. It was more interesting to see him in a car or something else and see him holding the gun. It didn't help the plot whatsoever and the movie had an absolutely ridiculous pace and the main plot was so poor that I didn`T even have the ability to keep watching it until it got to be the full-length version. It should have been a better movie but unfortunately it was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's no wonder why the movie had to be so low-budget film. As we all know, this is just a cheap copy of "The Matrix", it is completely predictable, totally predictable, and utterly disappointing. It's a bit like "The Terminator" - when you see the two main characters(George Michael and a robot army), they don't even have a chance to act in the movie. The actors don't act like real characters - they are just actors who do nothing but read their lines and pretend to have their character's lines.  It had nothing to do with the real world - it doesn't even really make any sense! The way I understood it, I felt it was an unrealistic, but not totally unreasonable. In the beginning it just seemed absurd that this movie was a real, but in the end it just didn't make sense. My only real regret is that it made so many unrealistic predictions. I have no idea how this movie made up the Matrix formula for the characters. It also doesn't make any sort of sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not an even halfway point or halfway point of the plot. The plot revolves solely around the events of the first movie (I think this movie could be better described as "The Sudden Scene"). The end of the movie has some scenes from the movie the first time, but they are not as much as you normally see in the series. The story has no semblance, and the only reason it was made was because the sequel was so terrible that the original writer could not make it alone. The only redeeming quality of the sequels is that there is a lot of action. I mean, "action" like throwing, kicking, punching, cutting each other, stabbing, and killing each other. If you see this movie, you'll see those things, but you won't feel like you're watching something that happened 30 years ago. That's not a good thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was really bad in the beginning. For example, the movie starts out with a woman in a remote village whose parents are gone. The woman has to find a place to live. But then the village has to be filled with hundreds of people that all have to start eating, bathing and praying. They are trying to make the people in the village look like they're not human. They use drugs and keep people in a constant state of insanity. In the end, one of the people starts being infected by a local plague. The movie ends after a lot of blood and guts is spilled out onto the village in a horrible way. There are scenes of blood in the water and the blood is pouring from the ground. They also use water to make fire, and even a lot more fire. Even the town was so disgusting it couldn't be shown. That is the story for a while, but I don't care if I missed some of the scenes because the movie has to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really bad. A lot of people go out to watch it and don't even get the chance to see it again. There are two good actors that play the title role (Tyson Hanks) and donn't have the same problem with the rest of the supporting cast (George Lynch, David Lynch, Robert Korn, Eben Grant). But this movie isn't the only bad movie that's been made lately. So many people are left looking at their time and wondering how they got into a movie made by one of the greatest comic authors ever and who was responsible for the most terrible movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie thinking I would never be able to believe such a stupid piece of crap.  But I still laughed. I thought the director had some redeeming feature that he missed.  This was a disappointing "documentary". I felt like I was going to vomit. The only reason I was even a fan of this movie was that it had so much nudity and gore as well as a bad acting. The acting was bad but the "plot" was totally devoid of intelligence. The ending to the movie was really poorly written.  I have to give this movie a 1:1 because of some clever touches but this movie is too much like your typical porn flick and is so bad to watch over.  If you have some sympathy for this film please don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no patience for such a bad "movie" I watched just because it reminded me of something I loved in the movie "Lug" (a movie with Steve Ross, Tim Masters, and Tim West as the lead). I thought it was a little disappointing when it didn't get a good look in any way. If you didn't like the "Lip" movie, you'd like "Lobster". There was a reason for my rating:  It was a lame attempt at a comedy that just lacked the "punch-line" of humor that is required for a comedy. There are plenty of reasons why a movie like this would fail. It's weak, predictable, predictable (with no surprises), and totally ridiculous. It is also bad for the actors that came up as well. I can't blame it for what it tried to be. But it was too predictable, so when they tried to get to a point to make the whole movie funny, they didn't succeed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just has to be one of those classic B-movie genre "adventure" movies - but it was far worse than that. I have to admit, there are times I wish to give this movie a rating because it has some interesting (or disturbing) elements. However, this movie is simply nothing like that. If you wanted to make a movie about a real adventure, you would probably do something more like this - as opposed to making something about a cheesy, self-promoting B-M-N type movie.  But even if it has interesting things, it fails to connect with any of the viewers.  I would like to point out the fact that the director and writer are so incompetent that it's basically impossible to even decipher the script.  If you really wanted to see a good movie, you probably would have liked something like this. If not, then you should at least see a decent one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just so bad that I don't even consider it a work of genius. And the plot is so boring that it is pretty obvious why they made this movie. There is a good film in the form of "The Castle", "Underground", "Kitty" etc. that deserves better than this crap. But the reason I am hesitant to give this movie any rating is because I didn't like it much more than the other ones. Even though I think the storyline may have been a bit better than the previous ones, this movie is simply bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not kidding. I thought this was the worst movie I've ever seen. What are you really? An ungodly woman with the brain of an old lady (Brianna) is about to go on a rampage and kill her husband, who is just about to leave town to have a nice dinner. She comes to his room at a random hotel, and starts a fight that goes out of control and she tries to kill him, but she kills a hotel clerk on the street who she is about a couple of months later and then kills his wife. I think that is pretty basic. You might expect something like the ending of a movie, which is more than an ending. I mean, what was that ending? Did I see it the way the movie was shown, or just as it was shown? I didn't know. I don't care about the movie, but if you read my book, it would be OK. I just didn't want to see it for the reasons I listed above. What a horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete waste of entertainment. The dialogue between the protagonists is so stupid that it isn't even funny. The action is so lousy that it takes away any suspense. The plot of the movie is just OK when it's not bad. The ending is so weak that it can make you cry if you want to. What is the point of this film? Why is it so disappointing that it just happens? I'll tell you that I liked "The Dead Zone", but I don't think it's been the same since the sequel. Why just keep coming out with an excuse for another crappy movie and ruining your fun? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you really like the original Game of El Castillo and you like El Castello, you might watch the movie and laugh. But, if you really hate it, you will just keep watching it until you lose your sanity. If you enjoy El Castoro, you'll still enjoy El castillo but with no plot, no acting and the worst dialog ever in the history of the film, the movie is so awful, I couldn't believe that I had actually seen this movie. It was really terrible! I didn't even enjoy it! I laughed the whole time! The acting was OK, but the script was completely lame, it just made no sense, the music didn't come out like the music and the actors sounded like the voices of idiots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the show only three times. I didn't know how I felt when I watched it. I knew I would not like it but the first episode was a little bit better than this one. This one was so bad I couldn't even finish it.  This one just lacks quality, which is what makes it so bad. If I'm a "comedy" I'll get up to watch a comedy like this and say I like it. But, I'm not. If you are a "novelists" you may love the show. However, if you're not like those kinds of people you don't get to enjoy it. You'll end up wishing it didn't exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really believe that this movie was directed by the filmmakers who were on the set for the original. I thought that the movie was a "romantic comedy" (or, at least a romantic comedy), but that was only the case that the director's were not well versed enough to realize that this kind of movie doesn't make any sense. Even though this was a flawed movie, it still had some charm to it--the characters were poorly written, the scenes were poorly filmed, and the plot was completely meaningless. I'm not sure if this movie will ever be interesting to anyone who cares to make this kindof movie. I just hope that the people who put this into their heads that it is really stupid, and I've read many times that this is one of those "uninspired, fun, sexy, sexy movies" movies that are all that. But I don't think I'm having enough money to spend on them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film of no value. As I mentioned in the comments, it is ridiculous to suggest it was ever made. While it does have one decent funny moment (with a pretty girl) it isn't a movie. This is probably the most boring film I've ever seen. The only good parts are the scenes in the hospital in which the guy looks like his wife and she is the most ridiculous looking person ever, making that scene funny. The acting was too pretentious, which I think is the worst part of the film. I'm not going to mention any of the famous names for a reason. It was horrible. I wouldn't have to admit it to be so but I never enjoyed watching a movie made on a budget like this. There is so much trash and bad acting in it that it isn`t worth checking out. In my opinion, this is the movie equivalent of that of "Indiana Jones". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some decent films about a mysterious, evil killer but they are too dumb and too convoluted to make a movie.    I won't give this movie 4 stars because it is actually really dumb. It's so bad it's funny. It isn't worth watching. I'm sure I missed the funny parts though, but I don't want to give it the same rating as the other half. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had a very strange plot. In this version, the main character has an interesting connection with a good girl, but only with a bad girl. The girl can also transform into a bird and also transforms into a dragon. And they can't go into an abandoned house and see the dragon. At the end of the movie, we see the girl transforming into a cat and taking off into another type of beast. Then, the girl is supposed to return back to her human form and try to help the other girl to catch the dragon that is turning into a beast. But the girl, while turning into the beast, can't tell the beast anything about her transformation and she doesn't seem to notice anything about it. There are scenes with the girl's transformation that just don't make much sense, like the girl being the dragon, and there are scenes where she is looking at her tail and then falling asleep. If you are wondering why the two guys have to go in such a confined space for their lives, then you might wonder why they need a giant robot to do the transformation and all this will probably be the end to their lives. The main girl (also called "Lissa") has her cat ears and the dragon has hers. The robot is supposed "to take care of the girl".   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing that I would ever go watch. If I had to guess, at least ten minutes of watching this movie would have been wasted on "the other half of the story's message", while the rest of it contains absolutely no messages whatsoever. The movie tries to be a satire, but tries to make the joke look ridiculous. It is no joke! For example, the way that the people in the backroom laugh at each other is just plain bad.  The actors and sets are awful, especially the way the characters are treated, including the scene where one character was treated like a slave. I think it is just terrible. I'd give it an 8 out of ten if the movie was in a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely amateurish. It is very, very terrible, a piece of crap, and I am glad my friends and I can watch it when it comes on. But as is, this is not even the movie for that. This is a huge waste of time and money, to be sure. It lacks even the basic elements of artistic quality and some of the plot lines I would enjoy in a real movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing more than a collection of mindless, pointless acts that just aim for violence. There is no actual plot, nothing, nothing. There are no story. It is just another cheap movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this movie I thought it was about as dumb as a dog, but that was only half the fun. A lot of people think they can watch the story and figure out why it's so bad. I've watched it two times and still couldn't figure out what they're talking about. They just talk a lot and talk about how good it was in the past. When they say they just can't figure it out it's not true. The plot is like an old horse, and they just repeat over and over the same stuff. That's why I stopped watching. When I do watch I just want to punch holes in my head and say "Oh, good things are so great. I think we could build a better world". But they just won't admit this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the original series of Star Trek series took away some of the most beautiful and well made characters in the galaxy, it could have become one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made. Unfortunately, the sequel was not much better, and a lot of the plot and effects were bad. But if the original had been a little bit better at the end, it would have been a great film. This new movie was nothing like the first.  The main villain in the sequel to the original was a female (and male) Vulcan (you can see a good male Vulcan in the original film). The rest of the movie was really terrible, except for the little moments that kept the actors and characters alive.  For example, there are some weird scenes where a bunch of men are fighting an alien (or something like that), and there are a few scenes with the characters being put into a suspended animation. In many scenes it seems like there is going back and forth and back for several minutes, and then there are moments where you are suddenly back to a normal time.  There is one part where the actors are wearing clothes that are not worn at all, but at least they were not totally revealing. There are a lot more scenes that involve only the characters, and nothing involving them.  One way around this was that the film could have been made much better. However, there is no way to make it a good movie. There is only one woman in the film, and no other part can make her more interesting. I would recommend a good, original episode of Star Wars to watch to see the original one, and I would not recommend it for this film, because of the terrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is difficult to describe how i this movie is about the relationship between a cop and a rapist, both of whom must have a really bad taste of irony. In one scene i saw an scene in which two guys had their hands locked up on their face. If the cops had to cut off the fingers of the guys who had done the crime, i would find that difficult. In the conclusion, they put a finger through the face, and the victim said, "the doctor cut my flesh off. I thought I was going to die, it was really hot!"  I just thought i was watching some sort of torture, but the fact that there was no one around this movie made me laugh so bad!  I have read that the movie was pulled off the radar, but my guess is that it was a very bad show.  I do not understand why it was released when it was in the process of making this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Gothic" has been on the shelf for the past several years and I'm surprised that this movie even came out at all. I can't believe that this was ever made in Hollywood, or even that it got to the top of the charts with people like "Gobie" as a stand-up act and a "B" actress. If this was made at a low budget, I can definitely tell you it didn't work. This was an excuse to play out some of the cheap effects for the movie and a completely unnecessary attempt to entertain your audience. I don't believe this movie will be remembered as great as it was because it was only the most pointless parts. This movie was a poor effort to entertain the audience, although I can tell that it certainly was an attempt to do just that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has nothing to recommend, and it is absolutely terrible. I have never seen anything like this, and I suspect that it will get worse than the sequel to this movie. But I also suspect that the sequel was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just got to the point where it should have been the last film to be a decent and entertaining film. But it still seems a big step backwards in the process of directing. The acting in this movie seems so bad that you can't think of it as a movie. The direction is so bad it's good, like the infamous "Matrix" film of all time, but it really isn't.  What really bothered me in this film was the complete lack of any inspiration and inspiration from the other films, especially the "Matrix 2: Blockadeo 2" film which had more action, atmosphere, and action. In other words, I'm afraid the only reason the director knew to make this was because of what had happened in the first film, and I wonder if he was inspired by the first movie or anything else.  The reason this movie was made was because a few days after the first "Matrix 3" was released, the studio had bought some property (this movie included "Matrix 1", which has been removed from the "2". This movie was so bad, but at least one of the film's producers (John Zuek) was able to use some of the very interesting footage and music from the first trilogy. However, since the very beginning of this movie, he has continued to try and create action sequences from the original trilogy, only to find that the first two sequels didn't come close to the expected action of the sequel. As the sequel of "Matrix III", a few minutes of the first three movies were made. However they had to wait for that, and this movie only took place in 5 minutes. In the end, they decided to save the 5 minutes of action in the movie. They chose to save money and cut a long, straight line of action into a whole long time, which was probably the reason why they had chosen to release "Matrix IV", even with the new production process of cutting this video into a longer video. This seems like the excuse for the whole production of "the next film" and there has been a lot of money involved in making it. This movie made a very disappointing impression in all of the things that were made, including the acting and the production in general. It really was just a poor attempt at a "prequel" to this movie and there is no excuse for that. It just seems to be another excuse for Zueks to work on another "Matrix II" movie that he has made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie I had a small smile of disdain. I didn't understand what it was supposed to be or why I would even waste my time on it. I have to admit that it had good intentions in the first half, but then you find out that most of the scenes don't make it work. I do hope I'll get better at editing but then I'm sorry to say I still think it's a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you didn't go out of your own pocket and buy the DVD of this movie: you'll miss the good parts.  This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I have yet to meet with this movie in the hands of a stranger.  I watched it twice so far, and it sucks all the way back to front-of-head. But the good stuff is in the movie; you can't get it anywhere but with a camera, the best movie camera ever created.  The script is too convoluted, not a good plot, not even a good character.  So I gave this movie a 10, but I would rather be a moron than sit through it for a half hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I can say that I find myself in the minority of the people in this movie. For example, a very good movie: A Heart is a Heart. But the heart is, in this instance, an incompetent, and stupid heart. That's not to say that the heart would actually have worked out. But if you're the heart, you have to find someone who understands you, even if you don't understand you yourself. The problem is that the movie is so stupid that it's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are no excuses for this horrible movie. While I liked some of the movie's moments, it was a huge waste of all there was nothing to like, nothing to discuss, nothing but an insult to the fans of horror films that made this a "classic" horror movie in 1994.  The only thing worth mentioning is that this movie would probably not be released at the same time as the "Beveridge" and "The Purification" films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In short, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The plot is just the worst. It's just horrible. The characters are so clichéd, with the predictable story lines, the predictable plot, the unbelievable acting, and the endless dialog. It is just unbelievable that this movie was so badly made that it's a miracle it survived so long. In this case, it was the director who did this film. The director is no professional, a professional at worst. He seems to believe the whole thing is going to be a great one, and I believe the worst people do this kind of movie because it is too much fun, too complicated, and too absurd to make them laugh. You can't be so sure. The script and the whole story of this film is nothing but ridiculous. The acting, the special effects, and just about the acting were bad. Even the movie looked a little different with each episode. And the plot itself is too simplistic. In fact, the script had so much in it and no where in it were the story lines to build the "love" between the two. The movie was just an excuse to keep the viewer bored and on the edge. The ending was bad. I didn't even laugh at it. I don't think you will enjoy this movie as much as I did, but don't even have the courage to sit through it, even if you're into it. It really is a bad way to do a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible plot: A couple of kids set up a farm on some good grounds, in this case a huge grass farm, on a pretty sunny landscape, which is situated right next to some beautiful houses. They rent the houses, and then after they rented the big house, they decide to get into trouble. The couple rent the first house and it turns out to be one of the big big houses. So they do not understand the real reason they rent the big houses and it's a bad idea. The real reason is to get the kids to go to a different location with the big farm and that they get to run around on it and get into the bigger houses.  The other thing I hated was the ending. It had to be some sort of strange ending that makes you wonder why someone could have gotten so far away from the farm. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the whole "Bathroom" episode of "House of Secrets" and finding a movie of John Carpenter's "Dark Castle" it's almost embarrassing to watch the movie. It's just boring, and the acting is terrible. Even the actors were awful. I'd like to know if you can see the video on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My opinion is that this movie was the worst I have seen for over thirty years. It was boring, meaningless and even a bit incomprehensible to me. While I was watching it on TV I couldn't understand what was going on.  I thought it would be interesting if the story was interesting in some way. I think they would make it a bit more believable if they got more people into it. They couldn't do that. They just wanted to sell the movie because they would be able to make more money. Well, they weren't able to sell anything.  If this movie had been set in an American village, the characters would be better actors.  But you know, if this movie could have been a little bit more entertaining, they probably would have had something to say. But then they couldn't because they were afraid they would get taken into a situation where people would be killed.  My vote is that it was better if they put the story back to its original beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first bad movie ever. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie begins with a very poorly acted, painfully drawn, dumb movie with a couple of creepy characters. The good part is that the actors are very talented. They are terrible at acting, but they are good at acting. However the bad part of the movie is the storyline. It is too bad to waste time on it, but the only thing you can get over is the dumb ending. The film is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would give this film:  If you can find the film in any store in the country, avoid it at all. It's bad. I don't care for the original, the cast is so bad, the characters are flat, and the film is so empty that it can't help but feel disappointed when the last scene happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't know why I gave this film a 9 from the top, especially the film itself. It doesn't feel like one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It's bad, bad, and worse, it is one of my least favorite films. The plot, the plot, I don't remember. I can't find the original lyrics, if I do, it's like having a black hole in your mouth. There is no plot, no plot. There are no scenes, no characters. I would have bought this if it was not for the fact that I know it's going to be a dull but entertaining waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went with this because I'm so stupid that I'm going to be watching this for the enjoyment of stupid people and I'm not doing any harm to anyone. I have friends who swear that this is their first favorite movie, and they are right. I'm just like a sucker. I'd watch this to see why there are so many "sex scenes" of a naked guy. And there was one moment when you just sat there watching the guy in that scene. I guess it was a while before he got turned in. And that was the only time it ever happened. In the movie "Bachelorette" it didn't even go anywhere. There are only some pretty girl spots on the stage in this movie. I can tell you there are some really hot ladies in this film. But at the end of the movie, there is one scene that is really bad and you can tell that it's the only one that made me laugh, but I'm sure it didn\'s not only bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a complete and complete waste of brain-dead stupidity of the writer to write this movie. We all know how the story could have been written without having to change the basic premise of a "evil force of nature". For example, we could get the idea that the "evil" force would be in charge of some kind of war and they would begin to fight "against the "good" human race with its "superhuman" technology. They would also use their technology to build a bomb to kill humans... and of course the "heroes" would also build some kind or other such an "attack" against humanity. That was the basic story in the book, but it is the worst plot line ever written. Even for the book it is not that hard to guess what was the "monster" on the ship and why it had so many of its parts and that the ship was sent to the sea and was crashed. This was totally pointless.   The actors even seemed to be the most inept among the cast.  The movie had only one plot. There was one "villain" who worked for the "hacker" and that was the only villain. There were also two human characters in it. They are the "leader" of the "garden", who is a human leader who could be "leader of humanity". In the book they had their long conversation and they just barely talked. In this movie they were talking about the "wander" who is very suspicious about his actions and has to be saved from an attack by another "hocker" which is also in the movie. There are also "humanoids" (with "hobies") who are in the same storyline. In the books, we also had a few instances of the killer using the "science" that is not in the books. The film is just another pointless and pointless story, no matter how much effort is put into the script. There is also the fact that the book is a comedy. The book is supposed to be a horror-comedy. It is not. In fact it is completely devoid of any message except for the fact of the existence of the main character, which was created for comedy.  This movie is like a horror movie without any substance, no substance at all, and just plain lies.  If you liked the book - you will not get tired.  Avoid from this movie if you don't like horror-comedies. You will be bored
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an example of a movie that relies solely on shock for its entertainment. This is a piece of trash that tries to be frightening. Its only good if you're bored to go see it. Its bad and only good to watch a movie for no one else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely trashy. The plot is not original enough to make this work. The casting is poorly written. The cinematography is just plain bad. I'm going to admit that I was a little bored watching it. I didn't care much for the story unless it was so unbelievable. The acting was bad, even with the exception of Robert Costner who was in the film. The most disappointing scene of the film was the infamous and pointless and pointless death scene. If you liked one of the movies this movie, you can't make yourself believe. If the film had a compelling plot, it could at least be interesting. It just doesn't do anything that I would have been bored about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As far as I'm concerned with the genre of "film" I have found, I have never watched it. I have seen lots of films but, I know, if this one was a sequel to something, it would be different. I mean, what really matters is how well written it is. I know that this is a bad, horrible film because of how much money it cost and how badly made it looks, but, to me, what was it? It's a very, very bad film. And I don't like it at all. I was hoping that it would come from, but I don they get any better than this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've watched "The Expendables" on Showtime, you know what to expect from it. What was even worse than that. What did it get away from its pretense to be a true story about a plot? The movie was a little like a "Tad" with very little plot. The plot is about a drug cartel, a little more like a little game, but with a bunch of "assassination" terrorists that keep getting "acquitained" (if the movie was real). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I'd see something like this movie when I was in school. I thought it would be good if it was funny. I didn't have a sense of humor, but I did get bored watching it. After the first scene, I was bored with how bad this movie was. It wasn't funny. It was too predictable. I couldn't see the ending and I didn absolutely know what it meant. Even when the camera moved there was just a camera set of a black male with a black hat on it. He didn't even smile or have a hair. The last scene in the film was only two or three minutes long.  The plot was fun, but there was no humor. It really wasn't that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find it extremely annoying to see these types of films. They are often made to shock the viewer and then then usually take away from the idea and turn into a completely meaningless film in a series of predictable scenes. Even when it's not completely predictable it never really does anything interesting. A large part of the story revolves around the relationship between the two main characters, and in that situation there is no relationship with either of the two, as they are nothing special in the way they act, although there are scenes to drive the plot forward and then we have to wait so long for the final showdown. It's just a waste of time, but that is really the only reason I can put it into. The acting is pretty bad, as well as the camera work and the sound-effects are just awful.  There are some scenes that are interesting in the middle of the movie, but they never work, you don't care about them, and there are just few scenes that give the viewer a chance to interact with the characters. The other film I had is called "Babylon" but it's far better as "Bane." What I mean is that they just try to do the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are willing to spend a few hours looking at a mediocre movie: you might watch this only to laugh. The film is just boring and stupid. It is a completely stupid story with a bunch of people with a very simple storyline. This is not even a good story. The acting is terrible. The story is pointless. The girl who got stabbed in the face is still screaming about "Why is this guy even alive!?"!? It is like seeing a person screaming in front of an open car. Very disappointing. The only thing that is nice is the ending.  The film was also mediocre in the beginning, but I still laughed more than I expected. I guess, it is better to watch the first few minutes, because it is a good idea to watch a movie: for people who don't have a clue. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have seen that I have yet to rent from the local video store. At the beginning it is extremely pretentious and not funny, the plot is incomprehensible, it's unclear if the characters are truly human or not a robot, etc. It seems like they wasted their time trying to put the characters together, instead of making the movie a funny spoof. I laughed at the opening scenes and at the beginning of the film it was OK, but just like any other bad movie I had seen (that includes most of the "spots" as mentioned above) it can't carry much of a plot. The movie itself is over-rated. The first scene is about a man in a hospital and the second one is about another man in the hospital trying to save his wife, and the third has the wife doing some really scary things.  The dialog is terrible, especially the ending where the father dies and there are two men sitting in a room talking to each other in an office (and I suspect that would be the beginning, since the end is the end). The acting is OK, it is well acted, and I was hoping that it would be funny in some way. But that hasn't happened. The plot is totally confused and it is so bad that you really can't care how much effort they put into the plot or what they're trying to achieve with it. If you are interested in horror movies you will want to spend your money on a DVD and not on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When a movie that I had a good time with in school is suddenly put on the shelf, I am really worried. I couldn't care for a new movie, and I never did it so bad. I gave it a 6 out of a 10 because I liked the first one. However, when this movie finally hit the shelves I found out that it was completely predictable and just made no sense whatsoever. I don't know if they decided to get rid of this one because they liked the previous film so much, or because they thought they didn't like the first movie. I'm really disappointed that they didn`t know what to do with this one. If I've ever heard anyone comment on this movie, I will never forget it. I want to stay away from movies that have nothing to do but go to war with each other. It was an awfully slow plot. And the actors couldn't do the job that was expected. In fact, I felt I was watching the "The Walking Dead" series of shows as they were meant to be. I didn't think this movie would have played so differently than The Walking Dead series. The cinematography was awful. They used the most expensive production methods possible and the camera footage was terrible. The fact that they filmed the same scenes as The Walking dead is also terrible, because this movie had no budget whatsoever. They wasted money, making over 70 minutes a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched the film one time, in order to save me from watching the video again. I laughed at all the terrible acting, acting, and direction. I felt sorry for myself that someone in the casting of the film would turn around and call himself "Jodrudak Houd" instead of a "Jowdy". In fact, "Jondy" Houd was in the video on the set of the movie, and he was a fine actor. He should have known the film was bad. The only time I saw him in a movie was at his birthday party. If you were the film's director, that person should have seen the film with the new director that it had gotten to the studio at the same time. The director could have chosen another actress, who would've been better for the film to go with a "Humble" Humble. I think the "Jumble" character was a puppet that was used to make the film. The same is true with "Humbled" Huddle, who was also a puppet. The "Jumbling" Huddled characters should have gone away. The whole film was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film with a few very weak elements - the "normal" script, for example.  My feeling is that this would not have been as successful if the filmmakers had just started directing and shooting a handful of short-form shorts in the early 2000s. Instead, they went to the old-fashioned way of putting some of the traditional "noir" elements on top of an old-school slasher flick with a bunch of old fashioned special effects, low lighting and a few more light-theory moves. It is sad to say, this is probably the only time in the world that the makers had put so much special effects into a horror film. They should not be doing that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this was in 'Ine In A Minor Country: The Story of St. John's The Lost Creatures' I laughed at the idea of it being a documentary.  This movie is about a little kid who learns the story of St (John) The Lost Creature and then finds out that he's been separated from his dead mother. He is then taken captive in an old castle and has to learn how to find the monster and all the people that supposedly killed his mother.  The film was completely flawed in that it lacked the depth that it claimed. St. Peter (Paul Cushing) is a boy that has recently escaped from the orphaned village and has a special relationship with the monster (Michael Dancer) who is obviously evil, but the kid didn't quite understand the connection between St. Jon (Michael Cushing), the monster, and a new man that has a strange connection to St. Joseph. The new man is a giant creature that can supposedly change the very land into another dimension with the powers of the other dimensions. St Peter is then taught how to deal with this monster but the monster is evil because he will kill any child who tries to go along the way. I cannot say which of the two characters was more disturbing, but it seems to make more of the monster than the kid was.  I am honestly not sure where the monster was described in this film and if they have it's all but I never saw it in this version.  Well, there's two more bad actors in this movie, and neither of the characters can act well for the first time.  Finally, a little joke has been added to the film, and it seems like I didn't even take it very seriously. If you want a joke of a monster, you will find it in the film:  If the story is supposed to be a horror tale about the disappearance of an old guy and his mysterious wife, it sure doesn't work out well. If it is meant to be horror, the monster obviously should be more frightening than a kid.  If you're interested in horror movies, however, this has not been a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was the only one I liked. It didn't work. The actors did very badly in this one. The fact that they are famous for their roles, made the movie seem like a waste of money.  I was really disappointed. I thought they should have put some substance into this movie so that it wouldn't have just one joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie features a female protagonist who has nothing but breasts, breasts, and nothing but a vagina. The director tries to keep her in the picture with a pair of boobs, but fails to do so as well as a naked woman.  In the same vein, there are many scenes where the naked woman is shown naked in a bathing pool or pool or swimming pool or sitting in a shower, without any context whatsoever. There are also many scenes of nudity of body parts, and this is not even remotely close to the nudity in "The Naked Killer", with all the nudity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely bad... It was just plain stupid and pointless. The story line was weak. The cinematography was bad, the characters were weak. It had no suspense whatsoever. The acting was awful. The scene of a big bad guy killing his girlfriend while being surrounded by three big women is so bad, so bad it made me almost scream. The ending was terrible. I would like to see a movie that would be better than "Pipsy Rock" or "Golfer" or other movies. But this movie isn't either. It just isn't even that. The whole movie is stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible, and is the only bad movie I have ever seen. There is little humor and the most irritating lines in the history. The story lines are not even close to interesting. The acting is bad. In fact, the movie is horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was nothing special in the way it is currently portrayed, but it was bad in a way which makes it difficult to understand why anyone could be fooled. For instance, a movie with some semblance of intelligence would be "fun", especially a little bit of mystery, where people are not completely incompetent, but with an occasional twist and clever ending. With the film, however, I can't imagine anyone having any connection to the people in this film. You can't really expect to be caught up on anything that you have seen before.  You really don't have a feeling for anyone in the cast. The story is the worst I've ever seen in a film. It was like being caught up in a maze and the camera just zooming through the maze to look at you and see who was left behind.  This movie can't compare to other films, especially films from a former era. What a little twist.  I'd give this film a 7/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As we just discussed, the film is a film about a person who takes off a sex act with a female. This is the worst film ever made that I have ever seen in my lifetime (I am sure that in the case of this film, it is not the case with "The Naked Ray" and my personal favorite, "My Girl's Killer.") This film is only a few minutes from the start, when the main character, the real one, turns on his girlfriend and then kills her. As an example of bad films, it's pretty scary to watch someone turn on his wife, as it just goes on for several minutes that I don't care for. The plot is stupid and the movie was so bad that I didn't even take it to see if it had any message. If you want a film with a message to a film that you don't want to see, just do a stupid movie: don't watch this one. It's not a movie that you would recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew from the first movie that the producers were trying to make something that is not out of their control, even if they thought it was "hard to understand" it was actually a silly movie. They should have tried to make more movies with stories that were more interesting to the audiences, or to the audience.  I can't understand why this movie was made in the way it is now. The biggest problem I have with the movie is the way that it is made so that the movie isn't a documentary-like movie, but rather a commercial piece that relies on a movie "script" rather than anything else. I've never made a movie that was so stupid that I couldn't even see the story for half of it.  The plot was pretty basic - a couple of men find a car, and get married, and then have to find out that their husbands are dead.  This movie is about about a bunch of people who are suddenly married, which seems to be very unrealistic. It's about a car that they are going to do a test of the marriage-making process, which I'm not too sure of. There was also some weird acting by people who aren't obviously involved. There are some "sharks" from the movie, and people who look like their fathers who are very familiar. But I think the plot had an excuse to be made as a movie about a real car. Why the cars had to be buried by the same tree that they were parked on top of. I have to keep in mind that if the story was true, then all the story would have to be true. It just didn't seem like a true movie. I also think the producers made the car look like they would have seen in the real car, but that doesn't make much sense because they made it look like a real one, and the only thing they got from it is a bunch more cars.  Overall, I don't know how I can give this movie any more ratings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very poorly made movie that is not even worthy of being on any list of "worst" movies in the world. I mean, if the plot was a good plot, it would probably be like the "Matrix" sequels. They would have been so much better than this pathetic plot.  For the sake of its entertainment value, I give this movie 4 out of 10. If you want to see an un-fun entertainment movie, like "Matrix", I would go for the first one or even the second one. The second one would be a fine one, as far as its entertainment. The reason why I gave this movie so low a rating was because it has so much to say, but I don't want to hear so much. This movie was probably the biggest mistake the movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film we see a guy with a car that can drive and also be able to drive. In it, he can't drive and is confined to a few scenes that are either hard or just hard to read and not like they should be. In fact, they aren't even hard like they are in other movies, like in "My Love." In this movie, the story is more about an old man who has a girlfriend and wants to sell her a car. He wants to get rid of her car and has a bunch of friends to help.   If we were to review the movie: * 1/2 * 1. A bit good - OK, OK, ok, not great - very bad. * 1 - OK - OK * 2 - OK 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something I'd never seen in my life, or anywhere, that was like this movie: a man who kills people, but kills himself.  This movie is like "The Expendables" but it has something more to it. It's so bad, but not much. You never see the characters reacting to each other, like "Breaking Down the Walls" where the people are all reacting to the events of a movie, not acting in them themselves. The acting of the main actors are completely, flat, uninteresting, and completely pathetic. I just don't understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was about a guy that stole and rented a bunch of cool equipment and tried to get into the high security house, that was totally stupid. And he got there and went into a bad house and started having sex with a bunch kids.  i know that this was an attempt to make a satire, but the way i feel, the way the movie was made is just dumb and boring. If you're interested and don't want to watch this movie, then you better just ignore it and move on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete ripoff from the original "Lord Of The Rings", "Lord of The Rings" and of course "Lord To The Rings". I knew that these movies would be different enough from the book, but it was still stupid to not even make the Lord of The Ring an actual movie in the book. The story is a bit overworked and it's very childish. The plot of "Lord's return" is just too convoluted and childish. It was painful to see so many scenes in this movie where something was obviously cut and replaced with something completely irrelevant. I was really looking forward to seeing the sequel of "The Lord of the Ring" coming out on DVD. But since it's not coming out under Sony's control I can't wait for it to be released. The acting was good, but I feel like they just wanted to make it seem more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film quite interesting, but I couldn't find the actors in it, so I turned it off. I was, unfortunately, more interested in the idea of an incestuous couple that we could only guess was going to occur on this vacation trip. It seemed like they had done something like this before, so this was a bit disappointing. The fact that it showed a couple with a child seemed like just a flippity fantasy, though. I'll admit the fact that the acting was OK was a factor, but for whatever reason they thought the idea was suitable for children. I'd have thought the characters could have been much more interesting, had the incest between the two involved. I thought the fact the mother was a pregnant and that the father got it to his wife was kind of ridiculous.  The best part of this film was the creepy sound design. It's pretty awful, but it really got me in. I didn't see it and I couldn'n't really see it coming through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most horrible film I've ever seen is this movie. You would never think there would be a more horrible film than a bad film. The premise is a cop is taking a girl who is afraid of a gang of kids, and she forces herself into a little house to help with the gang. The woman is forced to become a little girl and give up her father to the gang in order to have him get in the gang's hands. She has to leave a couple of weeks early and meet the gang while she is trying to convince them not to gang-rape her. Then she tries to convince the group of girls that she's crazy and is just a slut. At the beginning of the movie there is a naked girl sitting on the sofa wearing panties. It should have been the girl was lying on the couch. After that she has to undress and get into the kitchen for some reason.  If you have the patience of a person then this is not a movie for you. However, I would give this film 10 points. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a total waste of all but one person who has never been a film maker in the past 25 years. I have already said it. But this movie isn't one of the worst I have seen, in spite of the fact that it is rated 8 out of 10. It is a complete failure. And it is not that the worst, that is really.  The only problem with the film is that the film stars a black man. That can't help to make this movie a hit, so we don't really care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll try and do the following a little bit of research: this movie was made about a man named "Pipete" and his girlfriend, but sadly it was all too close to reality.  I don't know if that's a spoiler, but my feeling is that it isn't. I know, for example that the "Pipee" is not an individual named after the person it comes to a specific place and there are people named "Pepe" and "Pete", but I don had no idea whether "Picee" was actually called by the person involved. That's why the movie seemed so fake and so ridiculous.  Pipee and Pipeen are really not two characters who can't get along and have no romantic chemistry, because they are about not one person but "Pile" and a person whose relationship is a lot like Pipeepet and Pile. "Pig" would be a pretty boring character to watch as they were both about the same thing, but the movie just lacks an actual story. I have to wonder what would have been the point when Pipeel and Paree are just two people (i.e. not two separate actors).  Parees should be allowed to be more than one character, because to me the real point of this film was that Pareus is in love with Pipete. That is the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't remember exactly why the film was so terrible. We are all familiar with "Hollywood", even for the occasional appearance at the Oscars (such as "My Love"), but I'm not one of those actors and would not expect that. I had the urge to watch it because I was a little concerned, I mean, with the idea that this movie would be the equivalent of "The Godfather", or the equivalent to "The Man in The Moon", or some other similar idea. I just wanted to keep an eye on it as it went and it didn't, so it's a bit difficult to be sure. I have to admit that the story isn't very interesting, and the performances are not very convincing, but I have a sense that there would be something more interesting to see. I don�t remember why that wasn't the case. There isn�t any real plot to it, and I think it might be hard to understand what we're going to do with it. The story of the young boy and his girlfriend comes across with a friend, the best guy she has ever had. We don�ve already seen it at the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a waste of pretension, and so much more so that it is not only not good but an insult to anyone who has any sense of decency. If the original message is so powerful, why is it so disappointing? I thought this movie was a cheap, cheap attempt to try to make a "fascination" which really didn't seem to be a serious effort. What a pity that this movie could have been a bit more convincing than the first one. A lot more effort could have come forward to make the story more effective. In this film, the characters don't really do anything except talk about what they've seen, and they don't talk at all about anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Best Things" is a really bad movie that is reminiscent of a horror movie. I thought I had gotten it from a video store, but I think it had been rented, possibly from HBO, so I had to find a copy of it on video.  "A Night Like The Red Sea" just isn't good. You get a bunch of people who have an excuse for acting, and I didn't really care too much to find out what their rationale was. The characters seemed to have an understanding of the movie but don't know what they're doing. I wish I had been forced to watch the entire movie and then have to see it twice for myself so I can finally finish it.  I'm sure the filmmakers were working on something for this. They had to figure out a plot, or perhaps that's how they ended up making the movie. It was hard to follow the actors, for one.  The problem is that the script is completely incomprehensible. The only thing that made this movie even remotely plausible was the idea that the sea would get covered up by the cold air, and that I didn of course believe it would happen. This is something of a classic fantasy, but it just didn't work. The best thing I could do with this movie was to watch it twice and tell you that it's terrible. I can't see what I'm supposed to do to save people. Even the actors don't seem to know what's going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have ever seen. I have never heard of a film like this. The acting is terrible. The only redeeming feature was the opening sequence. It is awful. I don't know what to do with that sequence. There are some scenes which are so simple that you wonder what happens next. It was an embarrassment. And, of course, the film did not do anything that it claimed to do. I've never had much of a chance to watch a movie like this, and I've heard from several different people that it is one of the worst films they've ever seen (this is not even a close call). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of David Lynch, and I have long time enjoyed his work, but this film is not one of his best films. The story is flat, boring, and totally lacking the depth of character character building, which is the reason I did not enjoy it. There is very little chemistry with the characters and there are several instances that I was completely bored. I have never seen a movie like this before, and after watching it I cannot forgive it. A lot of the scenes seem like a staged version of "Man" and I would never see that movie again. While the story is good, the direction is awful. In some scenes you can look at the face of the camera, and in others you cannot see the face. The movie's ending is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed. There was too many unnecessary scenes and unnecessary scenes. And the first person in this movie is a woman that is actually the main villain in the movie. He was the only person that even seemed like he had a conscience in this film. This is bad. At least the man who used to have a very big ego in real life can have that personality. I'm surprised to find this was still in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of movie: "It's alright if you're a vampire."  There is no explanation whatsoever as to why this movie is not the typical vampire flick. There is a few "buddy" vampire that you know from "The Twilight Zone." The vampire in this movie seems to be in love with a classmate of the protagonist, with some weird and dangerous sex scenes.  "The Best vampire film is the one that you can get through to watch with a single look. If you're looking for a vampire, you might just try one of those "The Vampire Chronicles" movies, like "The Vamps" or "The Dark Side of the Universe," and see how it looks.  This movie is just bad. It's terrible to watch, bad writing, bad acting, bad story, bad casting (especially the acting), bad camera movement, bad camera angles, bad special effects, terrible lighting.  As far as writing goes, "The best vampire film: The Twilight Zone," and it does more to bring attention to vampire movies than this movie does. The cast, in this case, are good actors (i.e. the actors), but the writing is bad. Even though this was an interesting plot, the story was just weak. The characters were really badly developed. It just lacks some sort of emotional depth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was not a movie worth watching and so I didn't bother to watch it. I didn the DVD and didn't see the trailer either. I think I'm going to rent this movie only as a curiosity now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I've said before I have to admit that the plot is terrible. There are three major flaws, all of them, which I think are bad. The first is the premise, which has no bearing on any current issue: the fact that there is some new man in the town, and that it is his only purpose to help a young girl who was missing for quite a few years. I believe that a good premise should make an important contribution to the world and the general understanding of the world, even though the girl will be killed in a couple of seconds before any of the action. This is far from being realistic. There is no explanation for this.  Secondly I'm baffled that the whole town has a secret, and why people don't believe in it, and the idea that it's impossible for anyone in the world to take one's word for a fact. They are all, as I am told, involved in something, and are all friends, but none of them are "evil". Why would anyone think that? The other point is the girl's father, who is obsessed with her father. I guess I'm guessing he's the guy who has done something with all of the town people. I don't know. We don't get more from her mother, as we know only what he says, and I can't believe it was not part of the plan he had already made. Third, I'm wondering why they wouldn't go to a real person to meet them. I'm also confused as to why they hadn't brought the other person to their meeting in the school. The third is the fact the other two, the father and mother, are very suspicious of this woman and her father, and there isn't any reason for them to be so.  Lastly, I think the idea of this town is a totally artificial one. I think it has been created in a very peculiar way and seems to be just an attempt at creating a theme that has a little resemblance to a typical "fantasy". I believe in realism. The story would have been very good if it could have been a real community of people, where everyone would really care about and help each other. As I said before, the movie doesn't take long to get interesting. The fact that it doesn't go far enough that I can believe is bad. It's a sad day when I start to think that people who don't care and don't want to be involved in the current state of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I wanted to watch this film with my wife and our kids. It seemed to me that it was too much like a big budget movie. So I couldn't watch it alone... I thought maybe a movie could have been a little bit better, if only to keep it off the family. Then my wife wanted to see it again, because it was entertaining, although she did not like it.  I think that the writer of the movie went to Hollywood to meet with the stars of a movie: I wish I could have written a positive review about it:  As a result I can't comment on this movie, but I can say that it is a bad comedy. I don't understand how anyone could possibly expect that it would be so good. The story is lame, not much more than an excuse for a big fat person named George (if he's not playing a superhero). The acting is terrible, the story is pathetic, the characters are awful, the ending is terrible. I can only conclude that they are going to make another stupid, dumb, terrible comedy movie (no spoilers) based on this one. We can't expect to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film just a few weeks ago and I was horrified, to say the least, to see it. I knew it was bad but, then it began to be worse. In the first few minutes I had to see this movie because I couldn't quite find the words. There are a few things that I think were wrong. The main plot of the movie is about a woman who has been taken prisoner by another female who has a boyfriend, who we are led to believe to be the killer. The real killer is very simple. He's got a coat and a hat that he hides behind his back. He shoots at her and she shoots at him. The next few minutes are just about getting into the mind of the killer and how he's able to get into the person's mind without being caught, which is not the case in most movies.  What really bothers me about this movie is that it's about an ex-cop. This could've been a real killer, but not her real murderer. Why would this ex- cop turn to being a cop? This is really disappointing. It comes up at least two or three times in the film and I didn't understand that a killer turns to being an ex cop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to call it "The Flicks of Oz", but I'd be more correct, I guess that it was based on a movie called "Itz'S A Nightmare". This movie was horrible. I'm glad to see other people's reactions to the Flicks being shown on the TV, but this movie was way worse than any other, and it's pretty embarrassing to see a movie like this (especially the parts that are supposedly based on real actors, such as the actors from "The Incredible Miss Wonder" or "Supernatural"). The characters are really badly dressed and their clothes don't fit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really bad in every way. A few jokes were funny, but this was a very disappointing movie. We've seen some good comedy movies, but they don't all have much humor in them. In a funny way, the jokes were great, but the acting and direction were awful. The acting in this movie seemed fake and there is nothing wrong with that. The director had the same problem as in A Funny Movie: a lot of jokes are not funny. If you have seen A Funny Movies: you know what we mean by that. This movie does not even have a storyline. The movie is about the people and their lives, nothing happens. They all get a job, go to a movie theater, get their big movie ticket, and try to find a good movie: just like the others with a bad plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I have to comment on the fact that the script is so incredibly bad in its script alone, but the director's decision to take away the director and just let the audience do the damn work (and I must admit, this film is not that big of a thing) was not too good. I found that most of the audience just sat there and stared at the screen without any involvement. Not really, they just kept asking one of us, or one of the other actors, to help them get over this mess. I mean, if they would just do the job, they would probably have fun and not be afraid of it. But, what the hell, it isn't just the director, it's the whole damn cast.  I can see some people are going to point to the fact of the casting of the supporting characters in this film, and it is nice that it gives you that insight, but when the supporting cast is bad, then you get the really disappointing ending. It's painful to see how these two actors had been chosen over the supporting performers. If the director wanted to include a positive review about this film as a positive comment about a good movie, he would have said something along the lines of "You have seen it before, and I know it was a good film. In truth, I'm really tired of those kinds of stories that are made in the world of film. The film should have been nominated for the Best Film of 2008 for the fact it helped put it in some way of an Oscar. The world needs to change the way it is made in order to make it better. But at the end, I guess you will agree that it was an OK film. I am not sure why. The supporting characters are good actors, but this movie isn't that good. This is bad film at the best of the worst for a film in recent memory. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A documentary entitled "The American War Machine" which includes the infamous "The History of The American War Machines" but it is so bad that it is almost impossible to comprehend.  Not only did this documentary fail to capture a major and important message but it also failed to make the case for why it is important to discuss.  One thing that this documentary failed to do was capture a positive message about the role of the American war machine in the early years of the war. The documentary had nothing to do with the very important lessons that were so elegantly described in the original documentary. The message that the war machine made to the American people was that it used machines to build, not to fight, and the documentary only served to discredit the other parts of this message. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't believe how I saw this movie...I thought that it was gonna be another low budget Italian horror film like "Giallo" or "The Vigna Mortis" or any of the other recent Italian horror flicks. It's worse than "Vigna" in that there isn't that much gore, and it really seems like it has to have some serious plot and characters, or even some plot twists. I am a little bit paranoid about the Italian horror movies and I have trouble believing that they're so cheap and cheap, because they're pretty good, don't take any real risk or risk to the viewer. Unfortunately "Vigile" doesn't have any plot, no real characters, and no plot twists, which gives you a sick feeling. The plot is nothing but a simple one-dimensional line about a serial killer who takes away a girl who has turned her into a monster and keeps the girl alone, torturing her. The scene which is set in a garage is about 4 minutes too long for me to even explain, but it's also completely predictable. Even when there's a character in that scene, there's nothing new, and they just throw her around the whole time, and you're pretty sure who is going to be doing that murder. The only plot twist in the whole movie is that the person who does the murder is obviously a murderer, who's a murderer who took away the woman, and then he has a brief conversation with her. He explains that he was a serial murderer, that he's had to take care of her as a murderer. But the only thing that is new is the idea that his serial killer had a sister. I thought the whole thing made me uncomfortable.  I'm not saying that this is a good movie, it's not the only horror film made in Italy, it was pretty terrible, but unfortunately, it doesn't do a whole lot of work. It does have a very creepy ending, but I wouldn't really call it a horror film. Maybe I'll see a better sequel one day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can get past the first half hour of this movie, you will enjoy it for a few moments but you will never see that. It's like a movie where the camera is set on a camera lens, but the camera actually follows a black cat and a girl, and a bunch of black cat characters are put on a pile of plastic trash in the bottom of the movie.  I'll admit that the first part of the film is a little bit better, but after the last half hour the film becomes a total waste of entertainment. A film with nothing but "explosion" scares is no good. There was no special effects, but a very bad plot. I was looking for something that could keep the movie interesting, but instead I watched this whole thing in shock. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was just a few months away from finishing my college studies when the director of a movie called the movie "The Legend of Sorrows". This movie was terrible in every way possible and had absolutely no plot, characters, or any interesting things to do. It was absolutely nothing I would care to watch. It had nothing to do with any real plot, nor any real life in it. There was no real storyline and no real purpose. This movie had absolutely nothing to recommend to anyone except me. I will not give this movie 10 out of 10 because it was pretty bad, but there is a movie I wish I could see that would make it worthwhile for people like me. The name of this movie was so bad that I couldn't even say anything else to recommend it, but I would do a lot of homework for it so that I could actually get into it. I can only imagine that the movie would be a lot better if the director changed the name of Sullards for a few minutes instead of having it in the same name as "Sullards". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the result of some really bad writing and story. In fact, it's really really bad. Even though it's supposed to be a romantic romance, it really doesn't go there much. The dialog is not really good, and the girl is not convincing, not really convincing to me. This movie isn't funny, it isn't interesting, and it doesn't really bring me to tear up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and acting are not very good.  The main villain is a ruthless man named Houda, who is hunting for a thousand dead bodies (that he killed in the first part).  This part is very predictable.  In the end, there is a battle of wills between Houdal and his enemy, an anti-hilter.  He kills his opponent, but there is nothing that connects this war to the end. The plot has its issues, but it is at least good for a comedy.  I give this movie two stars. But as usual, the quality of the plot is poor. If you like humor, humor was very good in the beginning of the movie. But now it is simply bad. The ending is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film had no concept. It seemed so much like a movie for a guy who liked The Three Most Beautiful Movies...that was probably the reason that I turned out to be interested in this movie... but I'm not sure why it was for him. In the ending of the movie, the movie had some of the most infuriating moments of all...(I mean, you'll sit through it and you'll think, oh, you're going to be in prison if you see the last few moments of it. I don't have to give you an idea of the film, I'll just say you're never going to get that sick feeling again.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a shame, I am sure it was meant to be a comedy, I thought it would be hilarious. There are so many clichés, even a few funny ones, that the story is not interesting at all. Even when the characters get more interesting, it's mostly a pointless one about how a real woman (I guess she has a few years) spends a few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just like they usually do, with the film's end to justify the story's stupidity.  One example was the fact that this was the movie that made the famous zombie outbreak. This movie had it as an excuse for the fact it never happened and since it never had the guts to tell us where it happened, let's skip it.  A funny joke but it's not funny at all. It was like this was just another example of how things get better when you get to the end, but this movie is about some ridiculous, overused, ridiculous stuff.   It's a shame because this was one of the most poorly acted, overrated movies of the 1990s. This was also the last movie that I ever saw. The ending was so much disappointing that I had to ask someone how many times I'd see this movie. It never bothered me. I've seen it so many times. I can just guarantee that it was the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and performance of this movie do not improve. It's an awful movie. The acting is unbelievable bad and the storyline of the movie is not even close to being a complete story. Not only do I get bored watching it, but the whole movie is just boring. I will never forgive this movie, because it just isn't a movie, and I don't want to pay money for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed. I laughed at the beginning. At the beginning of this film, there was a lot of blood and guts spewing out from the mouths of the people. This movie is absolutely horrid, and frankly I couldn't take it seriously.   In fact, this movie could have been shot with a great cast. There are some actors who play well, but the main actors in this movie are terrible. If this movie had been a drama, I would have believed it to be a decent film. They were either stupid, stupid or stupidly silly. There is absolutely nothing to get from this movie. This is probably the worst comedy ever made in the history of cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is weak, the characters are dull, the movie is just lame. But this movie does have a redeeming. One of the best I have seen so bad I will never again watch this movie. If you liked the first one I thought it was a good movie. But when I heard "The End of the Movie" I thought the movie was better off than the first, you could say it has lost its appeal. You can tell that, I'm sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts out great but is very quickly lost and then dies. But, even after the initial shock of watching it, it still makes some interesting moments.  This movie is a collection of boring scenes of a bunch of people sitting around a hotel and, after a few hours, being treated like a bunch people by their friends and even in the scene with an angry and bitter teacher, slowly turning into a pile of empty rooms.  The best thing about the movie is the horrible writing of the story and the horrible acting of the characters.  I am a little bit of a writer myself and I can understand a certain style of writing is completely incomprehensible to me. I felt like these scenes were written in the movie in a very amateur way.  Overall, I thought the movie was really bad and very little. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horribly flawed film: a predictable story with no plot and no real meaning, with no dialogue (that you actually have to sit through just to be there), a predictable ending (which really was the problem) and a horrible plot.  The story is about a little girl, played by Jelia Cates.  She's a little bit crazy and she's about to take an apartment in the countryside with her little sister and the guy that she's marrying.  Well, since they're both really crazy, we can't let the two get together.  It's also really confusing for the main character, and we're not sure why we care what's happening, even though it may seem to be a small thing. We only find out that the guy is in a relationship with her sister and not with her husband, and the brother is a man (I don't remember) who loves her sister.  When he dies, the story is basically ended. In the meantime, he can't find anyone in that neighborhood. (I assume he dies to avoid her death, but she dies just after they are married, so that would make sense, wouldn't?)  And you need to know that she got married, because they can't get to the house to save the sister. So why should the sister be able to enter the house anyway?  I don't think I can blame this film for being completely absurd, considering the quality of the acting and the rest of it. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the cinematography is excellent. You can barely watch it and you will probably miss some of the scenes (because they are so long, of course) but I don`t really understand what happened in it. I doníll even tell you what the big reveal is. I really don't want to see more of this movie, and for all the reasons mentioned above, it's not for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film looks like an effort to steal a plot by some obscure Hollywood producer (or is it a TV series?). It doesn't work. What was the point? Was it supposed to be a "serious" film? Did it all the stars make a cameo in it? Did anyone in it in order to have it make a hit? Oh, it's so horrible! A lot of dialog is simply repeated. The actors act like they were in an awful film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was stupidly predictable, to be fair, and I didn't care too much, I can't give enough time away to watch the movie. The plot is really just a joke. For example, a black man named "Joker" appears to be a black "juggler" (who's never been out of the closet), while "King" is portrayed as a black woman. I mean, there is no real difference between "Jocker" and "King", but both do have female stars. (So, why is a black guy pretending to be black?) That is all the plot of this movie is.  It's too bad to put this movie in your top 10, I'll admit that. I really don't know what they're trying to make this movie. Maybe it's better that they make a comedy movie out of it. It would probably get better with a few more jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bad Girl" is not a classic movie, but is not very good. I'm not sure what other people saw it. I watched it on HBO just as a DVD-on-DVD. I have been looking for the movie since it was released, but I couldn't get it until a few months ago. The only reason I finally saw this movie was that my daughter's dog was really excited to see it.  The movie begins with an almost standard plot, but quickly moves toward a completely unbelievable ending. The plot was supposed to be the main focus, but as it develops and there is no way it can be more interesting than the story of the two girls from another family. The first one of the girls is obviously a girl of high intelligence, but the first girl seems to be quite dumb. She is an average girl, but she has an attitude that makes her do something like all the rest. She steals lots of money and runs into trouble with a group of guys, including a few named "The Fat Man". In the beginning, she has a couple of guys in a garage, and one of them tries to pick her up, and it's only when the other guy comes to her for help that the other one is interested. He is a man with a large and big erection, and she is a really slutty chick with a small body. I find it odd that they have a girl as fat as she is. How she was fat at the beginning was completely random, and I have to wonder why she had to go through this ridiculous crap first. Later on, the two guys are arguing, but then she comes back to the garage with her friend and they begin to talk. She tells them that her father is cheating on her boyfriend, and that he wants to have sex with her. The one guy says that if she doesn't do something, he will get "sex" with her! At the end of the movie, she begins to get mad, but in the end, she finally gives into sex with the guy, and the whole movie goes on like a chase down the road. If you are a girl who likes sexy guys, don't try to make a relationship with this movie. I don't see this movie for a good reason. It is simply the same with every other movie made on television (including this one). You just don't get what you want.  This movie has really no purpose. It was about a couple actors and a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just laughed at this movie because it's really bad, I've watched it twice, it's bad but not like the last few movies. It is horrible and a stupid movie.  I hope my words will not go a bit further than that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie stars a man named "Henry" and who is an old, wealthy, and corrupt billionaire. He has a lot of money and is married with a young, beautiful daughter.  When the director comes to see his "boss" on the set, the director tries to make a certain name known, "Henry," so the audience doesn't know who he is.  The acting is terrible. There's a guy, a man, who has some really good acting but he doesn't do anything like Henry does.  I had to turn this part into a footnote because I thought that they kept giving us this story for the rest of the movie. They just kept showing the girl kissing Henry in a certain way.  Well, it doesn't work for my tastes. I am afraid that the producers just used the name to fill in the atmosphere, but the movie didn't make me forget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Karate" follows several of the worst atrocities of World War I and II, which are not only regrettable but also historically ignorant. Although the production is good, the acting is very poor, the visuals are dull and the story isn't interesting. While the initial premise is interesting, the dialog is extremely poor and the scenes were not very appealing. If you were to sit through the entire film, you would miss the plot, and the acting would suck even more.  If you want to see something like this at home, I would recommend "Ties" instead. It can't be blamed for the fact that it's so cheap, although it can't really be faulted for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Pets" is a stupid, terrible film. Sure, the original "Pits" had some good laughs, but it is not one of those comedic geniuses. In fact, the film is so bad that it is painful to watch it. This is a movie that focuses on the bad qualities of its cast, particularly the way that these characters are treated, which is also not funny. The acting is pretty terrible. It is the kind of movie where you want to put it on a shelf and watch something that you've already seen five times.   This film has absolutely nothing to recommend. If you are looking for a fun movie: watch one of the original films: "Rugged" (1995)  This movie is not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this movie i felt more in that world of horror than i would like to be. I was left wondering what the hell these people are thinking? I thought the ending seemed like I was going to have the same ending as the one in "The Legend of Conan". Why did they make this film? What were the people who made this movie thinking they would love to see it? The only thing that made this show worse was the bad acting of the villain. It was not really believable, it wasn't dramatic enough to make this movie a movie, and it just looked like a pile of garbage. I thought they had some creative ideas, but they just threw in a bunch of garbage to fill out the plot.  It had a few moments where you could picture something like this in a movie. For example a scene where the villain goes around in a maze to make a deal with his sister. But that was only in one scene. The whole movie is just a bunch more bad movies. Maybe someday I'll see a movie with a creative plot. Even after I've seen these two I will never get anything else from them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just couldn't stand this movie. It's really bad. A lot of people from my race were really turned off by the show. There was a lot of the comments about how you should avoid watching it. People seem to think that everyone should not have to pay attention to this. I don't believe that. It is not funny. It just shows a lot, but it just shows nothing. It isn't funny. The characters are not cute. It doesn't have any heart or humor.  I did like the storyline but I think the way the guys are treated is just a way for this film to make money. Don't get into it. It shows a few very annoying jokes but I can't say I agree with that. I didn't really understand the purpose. The biggest problem of it is that it is just stupid jokes. I couldn't find any jokes that are good to make. You can make jokes like that. There are some funny jokes here but that is not what matters here. If you really like stupid humor you might just get bored and watch another movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original script (by "Cynthia Adams") for this film was supposed to be a documentary about a girl (the girl who was formerly known as "The Girl With the Dark Hair") and how she had developed as an adult.  Instead, the movie is the opposite. The actors do an awful job, with very little dialogue, and the film is very long.  My own opinion is that this movie was awful in every sense possible. There was no real story, no real conflict, no actual plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was full of bad dialog. The acting was bad, the movie just isn't worth one and two. The plot was so bad that it was laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part of this movie had me completely gasping through it. I thought it was going to be a comedy with some real dramatic moments and a touching romantic moment. Unfortunately, they didn't take the time to get that message. All the characters in the movie seemed to be either boring or self-destructive to me. There was the annoying and silly dialogue.  The other parts of the movie were quite good and it didn't too dark. I had hopes to see more of it. However, I was left wondering why I was so bored by the characters.   I give this film a 9 out of 10. There is one scene I still missed out on and I can't fault it for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely one of the worst movies I have seen, i have been watching since this movie, and i think that is the only reason that i would recommend watching it. There was some bad plot and dialog, and some very very bad action. It was the same for the rest of the movie, which has been done so many times before. The only reason i can say is that it wasn't as bad as i expected it to be. Maybe if they were given a little more time and attention this movie could be good but the film ended up sucking so much blood from me. i know this because i've seen it many times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically a story about a teenage girl who is a sex fanatic who is constantly involved in a sex addiction. This film is so bad, it doesn't even feel like it's a movie; it is just a big dumb sex addiction-story. There are plenty of drugs in it, and the whole movie revolves around a teenage sex addict, and a pretty sick movie in that regard. The film features some of the worst scenes of any type I have ever seen. The ending is very, very stupid. There's some really creepy moments in there, and it has just two scenes where a woman gets penetrated, and then just stays there for the whole rest of the movie. And the girl's husband, the father who was cheating on the girl, does not try to stop her from having sex with her husband, but instead goes on another route, instead of being arrested. So basically, this movie is about a girl who has a sex problem, and she falls in love with her boyfriend, but then she is totally addicted to the addict boyfriend. She has a lot of sex with him, and what happens in that middle section is about her going on another road and meeting another girl, a sex addict. But, that sex addiction, that is supposed to be a passion, is not even worth mentioning. And for some reason, I guess it's not even part of her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the title, "The Monster Killer" is an accurate description of the film, the only thing worth noting here is that it isn't even funny. Most of the actors don't seem to come close to the characters in it. It's hard to believe this is the first "film" based on the "Killer," the movie was based on another of the most famous movies, "Casper," which had a killer named on it who was a serial killer. The only other movie that has made it to Hollywood is "Jaws." They made "Jawes" about a serial killing murderer, with some footage taken from his previous murders and was obviously influenced by the killing of another serial killer, which is why they felt the right to make this movie. They obviously felt no remorse. The movie was made in a completely ridiculous manner, with a number of characters being killed in horrible ways. This isn't the way to make a horror movie, but it's one of the worst movies ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What really bothered me is the fact that the story is so weak.  I just couldn't care for the plot and the supporting actors. I just can't believe that all the actors would suddenly start acting like that. A lot of the actors in this movie didn't even have a clue what they were doing. The movie is a complete waste of time, but we had a good time anyway, because the plot is so bad. What a shame. I've seen better films. I am not really satisfied with the rest of this movie, and I hope I will never have to see it again. The only saving feature is the camera photography. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible, it had absolutely nothing to do with the original premise, a family-owned store (not a movie) and a mansion that would have been very much fun to see if the director hadn't been so sloppy with the plot. If you're gonna see a plot involving a family with four and a big mansion, make it something like the "Dasco Brothers" or "Sawteks Brothers" (if you are looking for a comedy), not this one. I'd like to see better material than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely bad, except for the great ending. If we were actually going to see a show like this, I would never pay money to watch it, even with a bunch of friends, because then the movie was like a normal sitcom, which isn't the only thing to watch.  You can't really complain about the stupidity and lack of budget. But I would like to be able to see this movie at a local movie theatre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is weak, the action is weak to the usual action of a Hollywood action movie, the characters are weak to their usual characters, the camera work is bad and the performances are bad. It is difficult to say that this movie deserves to be relegated to a "1-in-5-the-best" movie unless a special agent (or a top-end Hollywood agent) was involved. It's also difficult to decide which is the more important problem: the fact that it was a failed sequel of an action movie: the script, script and the director were all weak and uninteresting, the director wanted to "explore something new" (which was probably the intention of the movie), but that's all he wanted to do.  But it doesn't make a lot of sense and is not funny. It doesn't help that the director doesn't want to explore something new. That's OK, but it doesn'n make the story interesting.  That's about the way the plot worked. If you like action movies, this movie is good; if you don't like action or adventure, this is bad.  If you don`it and like action, that's OK. If not, your bad. I think that's about 10% of movies that are bad, or 1% of films that are good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointing film, that's all. I'm afraid to think anyone will admit that this was the result of some sort of bad copy-writing and editing, but it doesn't have that much in the way of a copy-written movie. The film is a very weak attempt at a musical documentary. It's just the only film that has a title, "I Wish Music Was a Movie." Well, that title is just about the songs, it's not about the movie.  The "music" portion of the film is the worst part of the movie, I'll let you off. The title is obviously a parody of "I wish Music Was A Movie," but it's really far-fetched. I don't know why this was ever allowed to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the film The Terminator I was very satisfied with this movie and even considered it to be a good film. However, The Terminator is just a bad sequel to the movie The Terminator. First of all, the story is boring and is completely without suspense. The movie had no real plot, no real characters, and the storyline was nothing but repetitious and predictable. Secondly, the action was extremely poor. It was either boring or even mediocre. The plot was way too convoluted. The scenes did not follow any logical logic and the actors did not have any great lines or characters. Finally, The Plot was absolutely horrible. It is obvious that the writer had never even read the book or seen the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a HUGE fan of horror. But this was not scary. It was a stupid movie - i'm sorry if i had to say it. It wasn't original at all. It had nothing to recommend. There was nothing to like. The story could not have been made any more predictable than to be told in a cheap movie - you know who would die of the plague and who would be rescued from the plague. The acting was poor. The director was bad. The characters were not made for a plot which would have made them stand out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I would agree to this movie, I would make the entire thing. Unfortunately, I won't even admit to watch it because I don't like movies like this one. I only saw it after it was on TV. It was a little disappointing. The plot is a bit confusing and the ending is lame. It doesn't make the slightest bit of sense, and the movie has some serious acting flaws.   I was not sure if I was watching this movie because I didn't know if it was for kids or adults. This movie is terrible and I am not expecting my children to like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as dull as a crumpit from the box of a bunch of empty boxes with a bunchof plastic bags in front of a cardboard box in the middle of a two-story apartment. The premise is that the two-dimensional box of cardboard boxes is stuffed in with some kind of magic. That is about it. Even the plot seems a bit unrealistic, though I think it's probably the kind of thing that could make a real movie. It's also extremely boring to watch, and very predictable. There are no real payoff to the movie other than the magic. There was a bit of nudity, and it didn't make me cringe as much as it did during the first few minutes. Overall, this movie had quite a few moments that could have been filmed better. The characters were predictable and the actors weren't good.  The only really interesting aspect of the movie was the plot. Unfortunately, there was no plot that seemed plausible. The ending had nothing to go along with, which was a pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not a true horror film like Blood Cry. The story goes like this: a girl who has the rare disease, and that's the last thing she wants to do. She has a man who is infected by a virus that turns the infected girl into a zombie... and then kills her. A few minutes of time later, she's back to "normal" and she starts getting picked off by other zombies.  Okay, what's the point of this story?  Why do you expect such a story in a horror movie when you're trying to make a horror film that is truly scary?  The plot's too weak to justify the gore and gore, and it's too slow to establish the truth of the case. Also, the plot is so obviously made that it's impossible to see what is happening, unless you've read this book.  Overall, it's not horror. It's just some really bad, predictable, boring action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just like the old, old, formula, this movie has a story that has no purpose or value and tries to bury it with a few false premises. It is absolutely predictable, and it lacks a sense of coherence. There is also no coherent plot. This is why I wrote this review.   The only redeeming factor is that the dialog was surprisingly funny. I was just getting a little bit bored at the beginning, but the funny bits didn't go as planned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with a series of strange, bizarre events. This is not a film.  If I have to spend hours of my time watching this film, I have a feeling my head will explode. The acting is horrible. There are no actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very uninteresting and predictable plot, with an uneven and confusing plot. While the first two films have a nice plot, this movie has nothing. I found it very difficult to keep the idea that it was a movie would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of this show, but i just couldn't believe the whole thing was in it.  I felt like the whole movie was a waste of some good acting. The idea of a guy (played by Jon Lovig) who kills the person who just had the name of "Nolan's Daughter" and is then set up to find out where it all really happened. A whole bunch of horrible plot lines, and no plot whatsoever that made sense... i don't know if there was a plot. In it the entire show was just a lot of blubbery junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a waste of some excellent actors. But, when is a movie called a film with an excellent cast. Why is it only one film that can be described as good, and it has been reduced to being merely a joke? So, what are you going to watch in the mean time? Why do they call it The Greatest Movie:  I rented this DVD for $3. It's the worst movie I have seen in a long time. It does not hold a title, although it does contain quite a handful of the funniest moments of history, but is really about as bad as everything else. I give it a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing I think I can see as a movie, in a film set in an abandoned hospital, is the fact that it is filmed in a hospital, as if it was a hospital for nothing else, the hospital is the only thing that is not ruined, in this case it was supposed to be a place for patients, not for patients. But as the film starts, the person that is acting as the director is so old, it could only have been filmed at a hospital set, where a real director could be. The film is so bad that the whole film is about how bad it is, the director just couldn't be able to act like the director. He should have been a real, professional director who would not allow his characters to be treated this badly, and this is only the first film in which it was obvious that the director was just a cheap man pretending to be an independent director.  If you are a horror movie fan like me, you will have a similar problem with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but a piece of rubbish. The "good guy" who turns up a beautiful woman is so slow-moving and is so weak, so weak that all he cares about is what he can do in order to save the life of his dead father. He just wants to kill his son, to save his daughter.  The whole thing is very, very dumb.  A woman who falls for this guy is dead. Her husband wants to find her. He wants to bury her. The man tries to bring her back, but she is too strong and too selfish to do this. He doesn't help anyone, he doesn't care about her life, he has no empathy for her.  This is really bad. There's no story and the whole thing isn't interesting. The best actors, and the most important ones are the supporting characters. But the rest of the cast is stupid, either, or so dumb that they don't deserve the same attention. I didn't even finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed. It just made no sense. If it was a movie about some sort of evil thing, it would probably be interesting to watch, but that the whole thing was a joke of me. It wasn't. And it just made the audience look stupid. At one point where you get to know the protagonist, I saw that he was a very, very stupid person. But that's OK. There are plenty of those in movies, and it's not like the villain really does the things that are supposed to be so.   But I thought it was better to be watching another movie to see the other characters. And even though I didn't think that this movie had much quality, I did enjoy it. But I can't really blame it for a bad idea. You can pretty much see what's going on in this movie. A few parts are good, but some parts just just make you feel like you're laughing at a very stupid movie. It's not an intentional bad movie, and I didn''s think the only reason I'd leave it off the shelf was because it wasn't as bad as I thought. But if I hadn't noticed, that meant I missed some very important bits in it. There was a lot of pointless action and a lot more pointless action. A couple of scenes were good, and the ending was good, too. But some parts of the movie were just a bit too predictable. I wish I had time to think about it. I just couldn't really find it. Even though the film itself is OK, the plot was pretty bad. It had so much wrong things that I didn�t believe it was good. This was mainly because I wasn't particularly interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always felt that the way they've made it in the past movies, has always been to some degree, a big jump forward to the film. Unfortunately, that was the case in this one. This movie was awful in every way possible. It could have been pulled from the very beginning with the little plot of the film, and it would have been a little better. It got a little bit better in the closing scenes, but the overall effect was too much of an "pilot" to stay. There's a good reason to leave this movie at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed out loud at this film. Not even for the fact that it stars the best actor in the movie (I'm sure he could do better than this). The worst part was the way the plot was written. How, the writer had to make such a big leap in the "movie" to have all the things in the book and not just be some of the action scenes.  The worst thing was the ending. The ending with the ending that I felt was too contrived. The scene that ended was probably meant to be the end of the movie, but it was just so terrible. I'm not a writer but I felt the story was a bit weak. The plot was pretty good though. It would have been better if the writer could figure out some kind of plot structure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As if I've been to the last movie, I'm sure the writer/director intended to have the same effect as the famous, famous, wonderful writer/directer from the 1960's, Richard Condon, who wrote this film. That would have been a good movie, if the director was able to deliver the same message in the same way with that other film (that would be a great performance in the making of it, but it certainly would not have been the same), but the opposite is true. It has nothing to do with any of Condon's writing, nor any of his directing skills. If there was any real connection to the story between the two, the actors should have done something to make that connection stronger.  The only real connection between the characters and the director that exists here is Condon himself. There's absolutely no connection to Condon in this film, nor has Condon any connection to anyone else. He was obviously involved in the story as a writer, but the way he portrayed Condon is merely the projection of Cullen's character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was the name of the movie: A short movie with some interesting songs. What could it have been? For instance, a few minutes of a guitar music is shown, that no matter how it is written, was terrible, not even that funny, nor dramatic nor anything, but quite bad.  I thought that the plot was really interesting. But, when the ending was reached, they had lost their right to be in it. And I was tempted to leave the film to be an hour, as I have heard that many other actors have done so. And what about the director? I felt quite surprised when I found that his was a "real-name" for such a bad film. I think that there is something that I wish I didn't do in this movie. For example, they should have replaced the scene in which the orchestra is singing. It is just so bad, because it is so badly done. This movie is not even funny. And it doesn't deserve to be put in a DVD or anything, because a film that was filmed in the Czech countryside is not that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is interesting and a bit more than a plot, but I didn't care for it. The idea that it is all about a bunch of idiots who make a bunch off of a car and are driving around in circles on a road (with a very predictable plot) seemed to be a joke at first.  A couple of characters actually got some screen time. I'm sure that most of the rest of the actors would have found it amusing and funny. However, none of them acted.  I did not particularly enjoy any of the characters, and the acting was pretty bad. I gave it a 7, as a writer. It was just weak, and not funny.  This is the only movie that I would recommend. Other than that, you might enjoy it for a couple of minutes if you've got something that's interesting, but if you decide to watch it, you'll have a pretty bad time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only redeeming qualities in this movie are that it manages to make some semblance of a plot. However, this is all too predictable and makes the movie nearly meaningless. The characters do not even seem to care what happens to them. And they have no chemistry with the characters. While in some movies this might be acceptable in one direction, it is not the only thing. You can easily guess the story and it would be different.    What is the story of this movie? The plot is simple. A man meets a woman who wants to be with him and he agrees to marry her. However the only problem is that the woman falls in love with the man instead of getting married to another person. There is nothing to help the man save his marriage with his bride or anything else.  When they marry there is no idea what they are going to do. The only action that happens is that a woman's husband tries to save his wife by creating a fake family. In truth it is impossible to save the wife because she cannot save the man's wife's husband and all the men in her house will betray him. This is probably a true plot, but the plot does not go far. This movie seems to be for two people who don't have chemistry with each other.  The movie is about a woman getting married and discovering that she cannot find out that her husband is crazy, but then going to a local strip club to meet the person she sees on the stripper.  After she is married she is having problems getting a marriage for the next couple.  This seems like a true story of a bad film. Avoid it if you cannot have enough chemistry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A "comedy" movie with a stupid plot, so bad it must have been made, and I don't care about the details. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a comedy film, that's just a silly, overrated film with a ridiculous number of ridiculous scenes. And the acting is also not good. Some of the characters are pretty good, but most of them are awful and pathetic. It's obvious that some serious acting would be done in this movie and it most certainly wouldn't be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful, it can't even come close to the other D&D films that were made in the 70's, so you would normally go out to get this movie if you like cheap action movies like this one. This is not a good way to do a movie, because it lacks an interesting plot, so it just comes out of thin air. It does not have any decent message or plot, it just ends up doing what it does with a predictable and easily predictable ending.  It is OK as a popcorn flick, but it can not sustain any form of entertainment. When it was first released, it was an interesting movie. This was obviously not meant to be a movie for people who wanted a "B&B" movie with a lot of cheap sex and violence. There are some interesting moments but they are lost in the endless story that follows it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My thoughts were, "Why the hell?" This is a truly bizarre film. They tried to make a horror film, but ended up making something that's truly disgusting. They threw in a bunch of gore for "extreme violence", and then proceeded to waste as much money as they had to. They had the courage to include gore and gore, but then threw in some stupid, stupid dialogue. They couldn't get any more gory than one of the female actors from this film, who said, "I'm a woman, but I want it all the more for this film." (And what the hell is that comment? My own heart!) If you wanted some gore like this, you would be missing the actual gore. They're not very gory, but it doesn't really do anything interesting to me.  And I'm afraid the next time I'm looking at the video, I'm going to stay home, because I don't want to watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main plot is one of the many dumbest plots i have ever seen in an action movie: one of those dumbest actors in the history of movies. This plot is bad enough to make you want to pick the garbage out of your closet and stick it in your hands. The first time you see it you'll think, "This is some stupid movie that just isn't funny, but it does have some funny scenes and there is some pretty cool scenes. There isn't a whole lot of comedy, but the action sequences are pretty good and the characters don't really go for anything except stupid things. It's like watching some terrible slasher movies and seeing people being stupid.  I'm sure there are many funny moments, but overall it sucks. There really wasn't an interesting story nor the main plot had anything to do with any plot. The characters are really dumb and the director was really out of his mind. The movie is completely out of context. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, about a bunch of people that make out for a buncha hooty guys, that starts in "B".. and suddenly ends up in "C".  But then it starts in a nice way, with a good story, and ends in a really bad place - but we will have to wait until later when the real story starts. This is why it isn't interesting.  If you like your old horror films, this is a bad choice. If you liked your old scary movies, like "D", "B", and even "P", you will love this one. But don't get a lot of money and you don't care about it.   I don't give this movie a 10 because it's not good but not bad either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the title says, it's a cheap, cheaply made film with bad cinematography, bad dialog, bad plot, and a lousy plot. While watching this film, I couldn't help but to comment on the fact that the director can't really take the time to make a great film. It's a total waste of time, as most people in the industry are too busy to be put in a movie. The acting is OK, but what is it? I guess we should be expecting a lot more from this movie. Maybe a musical version would have been better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a while, I had some idea that this might be some sort of clever film in the future. That is not what I had hoped for. I had to look at it just to know it was a bad film.  This movie was just awful. The only two things that I like are the "evil" parts. First of all, the fact that this film was so obviously made by a young girl. It's so pathetic that it is really painful to see it. The acting was terrible. I guess that it might have made a bit of a profit at the box office, but if that is the case, I think that it had to be the most terrible piece of film ever.  The scenes were really boring. This was such a cliché that it really was just bad. And this was bad because it was too slow to be a good comedy. I've seen movies with much better performances. I'd like to say that the whole cast is talented and this movie is just bad at that level. It has nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not going to be a big fan of this. But even though it was pretty good, I just couldn't give it 4 stars, and I did not like any part of it. At the start of the movie I found it a little slow, but at the end of it everything was way too slow and really annoying. I would prefer not to have to sit through it again, and instead of just watch it, I'd recommend going into your local video store and renting something instead of watching the whole thing for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are so bad it makes the entire film seem like a waste. The only thing that stands out to me as being "interesting" is the actor who plays the villain. It's so weak, it's so laughable, it seems like he's auditioning for a role on a sitcom (and it is OK for that).  In conclusion, this movie has absolutely nothing to recommend. It would be easy to say that it's OK to look at a movie with some real talent, but this movie is nothing except an embarrassment. The idea of a villain in a movie is supposed to be fun, but in this case it just makes you look at boring characters.  I'll admit that a decent movie can survive these kinds of bad decisions, but not so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really the worst movie i have ever seen, that is right in the middle of the end. i've never seen it and i never would watch it again! i rented it because i like movies, and i just found that they had a good ending!  This is the movie that i thought was the worst in the world, it had a terrible plot, a bad dialogs, a terrible cast and it was just awful!   But i thought that some of the dialogs were funny but they were not funny at all. i didn't really see that when it was released, but i thought they added a few interesting and funny things to the movie which i didn`t notice as the movie progressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say that I was expecting to enjoy this film. I was disappointed by how bland it was, but somehow I found myself interested. I had the idea that this film would be a funny movie about the famous American baseball player, and that it would be entertaining. But then the script seemed to be scripted in a manner reminiscent of The Terminator.  The first bit of the film was very predictable. It was about an American who is forced to kill a man who is threatening to kill him, which seems to be a very predictable thing. The plot is predictable but not as predictable as the first two films. The funny part of the movie was the fact that a woman (called Lucy Beller, played by a really cute actress named Lina Jane) was trying to kill the guy in the film. Although this film isn't really funny, there was too much of this film just sounding like it should not. The whole movie seemed to take place in a very ridiculous scene, involving a bunch of zombies.  And the movie felt like a very convoluted plot. It had so many twists and turns that it really wasn't believable. I didn't want to see another one of those movies.  I think that the script and the direction were very bad. The actors were too wooden to act their parts. And I felt like the whole movie just consisted of one scene of the protagonist's life.  Overall, I'm afraid that this movie was bad, but I don't really blame this film for making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the only movie I saw that made me not want to rent.  The actors were terrible, the acting was terrible, and the premise was ridiculous. The fact that I watched this was not because I'm a movie buff, but because I don't even like movies with the actors that are in this movie. I've never seen anything like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not to be a complete movie, but what they do in this movie is to break out of the ordinary in their stupid way.  A couple of people have it, some people think they have to make the movie to work, but this isn't the case. The story is completely stupid, a man wakes up in a mansion and goes around to find someone who he can be friends with. The man is a guy who works as a boun at a nightclub, so it makes sense to take him out of his working job, and he goes to the owner of the nightclub and finds a good place to rent if he is interested in renting a room. He wants to rent the room, but the owner is extremely insistent on it. He doesn't rent it, so he decides to keep it to himself and try it again. Unfortunately, the room is occupied and the man doesn't like the other tenants, so the man decides to rent it for a few hours anyway, but he doesn't care about the rent and instead wants to stay at the nightclub anyway. He has nothing to do and just shows off his talent as a man. He keeps going back and forth through the alley, getting away with his fancy gadgets, and being in a few cars. But when he goes back to his apartment to try it, the man gets bored with the new guys and he decides the two guys in the room are about to fight. Then one of the guys comes back into the apartment and kicks him on the floor to try to kill him. The other guy decides to get away. But what is that guy doing? Where did this guy get away? The man wants to kill the man and shoot him, but then a female is killed, and the two of them fight one another. The guy decides not to kill everyone and instead uses a gun to kill someone and then kills the guy. In the end, he gets mad, but only because he has already shot dead everybody. The whole movie is stupid and stupid, but at the end it doesn't seem to make much sense at all. I don't really understand it anyway. I mean the story is mostly about a man who doesn't know the value of his money and has gotten on a plane and flown out of India and gone to India. Why? There is some reason to be scared of flying out to India, a couple of bad guys from a movie show off there and all are in the movie. And that is just about a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just a really bad movie. It is just not funny. If you like the movies, you will enjoy the jokes. In this case, you just won't like this one. Please go see a movie: 'Hitch', 'The Rock', 'Shrek', 'Ionnoon', etc. It will save you from this lousy, slow, boring movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is something that I really wish I had to read about, if I didn't know what. When you watch "The Bourne Supremacy" for the first time, you see that there's some scene where some person in the theater, I'll call it "I'm an astronaut," and we're basically talking about the guy who's in the movie is really a psychic with a psychic connection to his father. After some months, we've seen him in that movie, and you don't find it strange that the guy's in a hospital for some reason. So if we're the person, who's obviously in charge of the ship, we just have to guess it a bunch of times. When we finally reach our destination, it seems like a bunch, you know, like a lot of others we've killed. We see these "tactical" characters, and it isn't until we see the guy that we should find out why he's in this position, that we suddenly understand. I'm very frustrated by that. Now, in this movie, it doesn't go as deep, and there are no characters that you actually care about, because it's just a boring movie. The story is really bad. The only character who does something interesting is a guy named Katerina (Katerina) who's a psychic who can tell people where a piece of a corpse is located on the ship. He is in a huge cave and it seems that he can pull things off of bodies, such as a metal box and a metal helmet that the actor wore for about thirty minutes. I don't really like that. He seems to believe that he's just some psychic who doesn't have a clue about people.  The acting is OK, I guess. The plot is interesting, though I'm not 100 percent sure it's going to be worth watching. The scene with the guy going to get pulled into a big box that we see in the car is actually pretty funny. The thing is, I wouldn't have guessed that the director is really an artist. He can make some funny images. But it doesn father that I'm sure there's something else that he could've had in there, but I didn'd like to see him make that face.  Overall, I couldn't even say that "The Incenties of a Master" really had an interesting plot. I can't say that's because it has a boring ending. In fact, if you want
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry to say that I watched this film in a few hours, and that it was about as boring as the whole "The Expendables" movies. But this film was the only one that was disappointing to me. I'm not a big fan of martial arts in particular but I was very disturbed by the fact that this was a completely made-for-TV show. The special effects were extremely bad and the acting seemed to be just that of a big budget American movie that happened only a few months ago. I'll admit that the scene where one of the guys was trying to make a fake gun was absolutely ridiculous as well as the scenes of dying in a hospital were absolutely terrible, even for a big action film like this. The only good thing in the whole movie was the great scene in the back room where Bruce Willis and The Joker were hanging out. This film was extremely disappointing in all of its points, and the only thing that saved the film was this great ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible, and this is why I gave this film one stars. Unfortunately, the acting and the story don't make this a good movie. As a female fan, I would rather see the original "Dragula", which I enjoyed because the original was such a classic, and I did. With this remake, it is awful, and that's not a small thing. In fact, I wouldn't care if you see this movie. This is bad enough to not be considered a classic film, but to claim to it is ridiculous. I'm not a "fan", but I couldn't even consider this movie to be a real film. It's a bad one. I had so much fun watching this movie, but it was extremely weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film seems to be the only film of the last decade that I have seen that could just be a joke. It is not funny and most of the action is just very old. It also lacks any sense of real depth. There are a few funny jokes, but mostly the scenes are just extremely shallow. At times I felt like I was being pulled in. At certain points the actors were trying to portray an American accent, which I am not willing to believe. There is only one scene that was interesting in some way and then I got bored and I felt too bored. It seemed like every single scene had a predictable ending. This is not a good movie for a non-spandardaged audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see a documentary called 'A Long Tale.' But I am more disappointed that it was a documentary... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am pretty annoyed about this movie. It's only because of some silly story and some silly acting. It was just one out of many similar garbage movies. I watched this movie in Russia just for the sake of seeing it. Not even a great Russian movie. That's all the reason I had a big picture of it in my mind. I have never seen one that so bad. The director is a very talented person but, instead of creating an interesting story, he tries to make stupid jokes about stupid people. Well, the acting is OK in some areas, the camera moves pretty well, it's interesting, but the plot just doesn't get past the boring part. The ending was just too silly. And I had the feeling that the Russian movie was a very slow-moving film. I also don't have a sense of people who can communicate and communicate easily. I felt that it wasn't any fun and I felt the plot had nothing to do with Russians. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, let me get some help.  Just remember: You need to watch what you are going to watch to find out what this movie is.  If you are not a film buff and a DVD or digital movie fanatic like myself, you'll find it extremely boring.   I am more than a film enthusiast, but this movie was really bad. If you're a film expert and you really enjoy movies, you will enjoy this one far less than the other parts. The plot was pretty silly, and I did not understand any of the characters. I was scared to the end of the movie and even the beginning. I really was hoping that my friend would die after watching it.  The biggest problem I have with this movie: the dialog was really terrible. Some of the lines were so bad that they almost made me think that the characters were speaking in one way, and then started talking in another way.  So, I'm not going to be pick on this movie for its "stardance" (but there was some pretty good dancing, and the cinematography was pretty good, as well as some pretty funny special effects), but it doesn't need to be much of a film to be interesting (especially since I would've rated it a 2 if the plot wasn't so bad).  I would definitely avoid this movie if you are a film person.  There's a lot to make you laugh at. But not the whole movie. I would probably pass this one as a film no one would really like...unless you enjoy the story and you have no idea what to do with it. I don't think it can be good for children, because I just laughed so hard after the first hour.  I don the movie out of the DVD or any other outlet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not sure exactly what is going on with this movie, but since I watched it I am just looking at what I can tell. I will admit that it was at the bottom when it came out. The most disturbing aspect of this movie was the fact that the two of them were being married in the movie is ridiculous and sadistic and I have not seen such a terrible thing in my whole life.   The acting was awful in every scene, even the one involving a couple of friends who have never even spoken to each other (especially the girlfriend who was supposedly in love with her boyfriend, and even the boy who was going on to have sex with her).  This is the way my opinion about the movie was put into words. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original movie was OK, but the sequel got much better. But this one, like the first, it's just bad and they need to do better. The plot is weak and the acting is weak. Not only is the plot weak but the acting was awful. The only good thing is the scene when the villain was making the tape! How was that supposed to be a villain? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film without having seen it in the other word, but the fact that it is so bad (and even worse than the original film) is no excuse for not having seen the original, and not watching it in other words, is just the icing on the ice, but I am glad to see it at least for the sake of watching "The Misfeels" and seeing the "Misfel's" original film in it's own context, as I like it better than the remake. I do not understand what it is trying to be. There is a theme in the original movie that is clearly represented, but it is left at a weak stage. The actors are generally pretty good, although the plot is mostly unbelievable. I didn't see any actors in the movie, and I am disappointed that this one has two good actors, and one of them is even worse. I would like to see this one in one of the films that I would have seen if I had not seen it before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a dream about seeing some girl on a lake in Colorado that was supposed to be the end of the film. I knew that would be the case when the movie was released. And I thought I could just sit back with a good ending. But this is no more than a movie with absolutely zero plot, plot, character, direction, and even characters. So I was pretty scared to watch it. I didn't get past this. Not even the best, because it just seemed like a piece of trash. A very boring ending. A terrible film with horrible writing and lousy direction. Not much of a plot, and not much good. I was looking for something else to watch, and I couldn't find one, so I turned it off. I guess that this movie was intended to be a serious movie, not a waste of time, because I was sure it was. But I think I missed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing that i would consider an insult to the movie industry would be that a movie made in 2002 would have been a documentary, but the reality is that it wouldn't have any documentary features. The other thing that you'd consider is that the movie would have to be a documentary and therefore a lot of the film would be cut off with a documentary focus. I don't think that's the case with the Making of Pearl Jam or with this movie, which consists of some very interesting footage and some interesting music. But then the movie, along with some amateur footage, has some amateur film footage on it that just isn't 100% interesting or dramatic enough for this type of movie. Some of the footage is pretty funny, but a lot is just extremely dumb and poorly done. I wouldn't even have paid attention to it but it had a lot more action and action than even a real documentary. It would have just been a series of short clips that would have given me the opportunity to find this movie. The movie has the potential to be very interesting and even if the movie is a documentary that would be like a documentary. But if you are going to see this movie then you need to do at least a documentary-quality job that would make this movie interesting to anybody but me. If this movie has any value whatsoever then it is a bad one. I'd give this movie 1/2, although it may be a decent one, but I donít feel the same way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for something more interesting for a movie: I don't know if you knew that it was a movie, but I do know that the title was an interesting title. But unfortunately this movie is not one of the two that I would have had expected. I didn't enjoy it at all.  The problem with the movie is that it has to do something, but it doesn't really do something. It has a ridiculous plot that has to keep a few things interesting and it has a pretty good costume design, but the acting is so bad it really doesn't make any sense. Also there are a lot of empty scenes, which only add to the stupidity. There were some interesting scenes in the movie, and a nice costume, but unfortunately it was the bad kind.  If you are looking for a comedy movie with a lot more plot and a funny face and not very annoying, look at Billy Brooks and the Three Stoops. They make a lot better movies than this one.  I'm sure that this film was going to be successful. But I won't even think that it would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When i heard that "The Wizard" had a cameo, i thought they would take care of one for some sort of comedy. But then I thought that a part with "The One True King" was a little too long, so i made myself too uncomfortable, and watched it in shock to make sure i was really sure. My friends were not impressed with the whole thing. I'd like to get to the bottom of this before it's released on DVD. I'm so sick to think of my childhood seeing it when it was made, as well as the hundreds of other movies made on DVD and a DVD of a movie made in my childhood. How do they ever expect us to do anything? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Out of Time" is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The movie is about a person who is trapped in a time period that is actually about five minutes shorter than the real time period. This movie is so bad, I don't even want to talk about it.  The best movie I have ever seen is "The Legend of Conan". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on a DVD set for a DVD but didn't buy it until it was released in 1999. The film seems to have been based around a very bad-movie premise (like, a couple's relationship between a couple and a woman who has a sex fetish) with some pretty good actors in it.  The plot is so bad I actually turned out to be very depressed, as I have always had with these movies. The acting was terrible, the direction was bad, and the storyline is just really bad. I was wondering why the two people who are portrayed as lovers do nothing but try to act like they're married in some way to try to make the relationship more awkward or to prove they're in love. It's extremely predictable and stupid (like a sex scene).  The ending is really stupid. It had all the elements that you can watch in an old video store (like an old set), and is the only thing that made me feel depressed. The other actors acted as horrible or even worse, and nothing is interesting, unless they make themselves look ridiculous.  I think I'm going to watch this one with my friends, because it was really hard to find a copy of it. My husband had a copy and bought it at a video store and it had a really strange ending, but I won't be having a lot of fun with it. I don't think that this film is worth watching in any other way, so I don;t recommend it as much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Jodorova" is such a dreck of an attempt to "make" Russian-style comedy, but it does not succeed in any way.   This movie features a handful of actors who seem to be auditioned for the movie and are then treated like normal people (namely, Michael Rapia and Ivan Shivu).  The characters aren't so bad, but the script is completely out of place, with most of the dialog written to make fun of everyone except Rapia (who is clearly a "normal" character, even in a way she seems like a Russian punk).  You get the feeling that this movie is about two guys (or more like two guys) sitting around talking to each other, without a sense of humor.  The movie is also not funny. It's not that funny. They seem to have gotten their idea, but they never actually act like they're at the beginning of a movie. The acting is, as usual, so bad that the movie doesn't take place at all.  For example, a couple, playing poker, talk to each person at the table about a lot of things, all while discussing how they're planning something and discussing who is going on a "secret" trip to California. The conversations are stilted, and they don't really seem like they have any sort of life in them.  You would expect that there would be some chemistry between the characters; instead, we're told that they have some chemistry, but that's not the case. This movie contains a bunch of actors and actors who don't seem like each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of people here are complaining about this film, "a piece of rubbish" (as usual) and they are probably right. For them, it is the only film to be on TV in the last year that has not been rated a lot by the critics. The plot is predictable, the director of the film has some good lines but they are not all consistent. It is not as bad as "Lunchbox" which was released on the same day, but it is bad enough that it has a decent number of lines. But, as usual, when this is released, it does not get anywhere near the attention.   This film is about a couple of kids who are in bed with one of their parents when the parents move out of their house and are living in another house, which is probably their own home. They meet their sister, a blonde girl who is also bed a little longer than they have been sleeping at least twice a month. She gets a good deal from the man who brought her into the house and later agrees to marry her. Unfortunately, she only wants to do something for her boyfriend, but when they both disappear, the little girl doesn't care. The girls break into a number of houses and steal the furniture before they finally catch her. Of course, their parents find out that their daughter is stealing more than she would have been able to. When they arrive at the house, the old man and his wife find that they are in possession of a lot of stuff and get a good reputation by doing some work. A lot can't believe that this is illegal. The only thing they can see is that the man was taking away whatever he had stolen and was getting paid to do a lot more. So the man's wife comes to the house with the stuff he is paid for. The man's lawyer tries to convince the little girls to let him sleep in the dark so he can use his skill, but he tells them that this would be too risky so he is trying to convince them to abandon their plan. He is a very violent man, but there are only a few scenes that show him violently punching an old man or hitting a little girl. We are obviously not used to seeing people punching people in this film but there is not much of anything that makes this movie stand out.  The acting is not great and the whole movie is just annoying. There was some action but the acting is only OK because the director has a few good lines
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you see this movie you can only expect a few more action scenes from the infamous Jacky Walker and Johnny Knox (although there's enough action in that movie). Unfortunately, I have to admit that the movie is pretty bad. But it is worth watching it because you want to learn something about how bad movies can get into. (And a bonus for you, I like Jacky in this movie. The little bit that was supposed to be a Jacky Walkthrough is probably the best part of the movie.) Jacky and Johnny (or, it may be the director, who could make it better) are shown in a couple of scenes together which are about as useless as a bad musical act as I have seen in a lot of Hollywood films over the years. They are trying to make some kind of jokes here, but they are just awful. There are two supporting characters, Jacky, and Johnny. Jacky plays a very dangerous man (a criminal who killed people), so we can't blame them for not trying to take these roles as a joke. I have also noticed that the "sister" who we meet in the movie doesn't seem to be very funny. It's rather sad to see people like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i thought this is one of the worst films i have ever seen. a big mistake on your part. really nothing happens in this film. you're really like that kid in school when you see this!  so i am not sure if you saw this film because you know that you would not like it. it just got bad when the characters were playing the roles and it wasn't funny, even if you would like it, it was not funny at all. I give this a 10 as a "scary movie" but you are really a pathetic excuse for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The scene where the two women are in a car around a restaurant is awful. The acting is terrible. When there is a car behind them, they go right into it. The ending is the only good thing in this movie. The bad things include poor direction and lack of suspense. And the movie itself is bad. The camera is not able to move around in a fast car, and the plot is not well-drawn. I don't really understand it. It's a bad picture that is not much better than the "Godzilla" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read other comments to this site about how this movie is going to ruin the franchise. This is because the story is so bad that the director was forced to make it better. It is no exaggeration to say that this movie has nothing to do with the rest of the franchise, so far as it comes.  This movie does a very bad job of showing the character's story progression. The story starts with something that sounds suspicious, but after a while is completely predictable. It then abruptly falls off. This can't have bothered me.  I can't really blame this movie, since it only shows the villain's behavior and not the story's.  Also, I don't know why any of the "experiences" mentioned in the movie, in which they are obviously tied to the movie (the fact that it had a "real life" experience), would be the basis for a franchise, since they didn't even do that for this movie.  The movie isn't any good. The only thing that works is the ending. It does work, but I don`t think that that has much to do.  If you like this movie don`take out, then don`just try to wait it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is about an ancient pyramid, in which it can be seen on the map. An ancient figure, who appears to be the only man in the world, can be glimpsed. He must be killed by a woman who has a hunchback and appears to take part in this movie. If the viewer is lucky enough to witness this one, it will be an anticarabarabration of the ancient Egyptian mythology. The movie is not so good. A few years after it was shown on TV, it is known that it was filmed in the wrong light. I have seen several documentaries films in which the story of the pyramid was completely different from the story, but this one just looked like a badly made documentary. I really don't want to see anything that is about the pyramid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had so many terrible lines that it was a shame that I didn't watch it before I could even write a negative reviews about it. The acting was horrible. I've seen this movie several times and even with a few years in the film experience can't forget how bad it was. I'm glad that I don't have to pay for this movie but I did spend a good bit of time with it. If you're a serious film writer you don't want to waste your time on something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just the most terrible movie ever made that has ever been made. The whole plot is ridiculous and the movie seems like a 'Pistochnik' attempt at a slasher. If there was any good acting in it, it would have been more in it than half the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a total waste of film but it seemed like a true waste of time. It is very difficult to find a story that doesn't go horribly off-script. It does not make any sense.  It is not enough that they should have turned out to be a "romantic romance" film. The acting was mediocre and the story lacked a sense. The story was not developed or developed.  There is something that may help this movie. They are going to work on "Dancing with Dragons" on the Disney Channel TV, and there would be a happy ending if they were good actors and there was a great story. Unfortunately they aren't that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that can only be seen in the worst movie ever made. The movie, while very good, gets a little worse as it becomes more obscure and bad. It has bad acting, bad direction, bad dialog, bad story line, bad acting and bad writing. It makes me want to turn over the channel and do something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an odd movie. The acting is bad and the plot is awful, especially the final sequence which leaves me feeling disappointed. I've seen this movie over a hundred times and I can tell you it's not only one of the worst movies i have ever seen. This is not even remotely like a good movie: it's just a bad waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good thing about this movie is that it comes at a time when the TV "experts" are ready to "make the same kind of movie" only in the future. In this case, it's a movie based on a "one-line story." That is the way to put it. This movie is so horrible that I have a hard time believing anyone watching it. It can't be said for sure that I'll ever watch it again. The plot is so shallow that it doesn't have any storyline to stand. I would have to go out and look at it on my own as an example of a bad "movie."  This movie had it's worst day-before-date ever. If this movie were the only movie, the story would be completely made up. There are two other characters that got their time as much as I could do. It just isn't worth spending any time watching the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just wanted to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not as funny as "Stand Up For Your Wrong Side" (but at the same time) that this is, but not as bad as the worst horror ever. If you're looking for a comedy, go with "Munch". You can laugh but you will never find it. If that's what you're going for, watch it instead of watching a horror movie.  I've got a couple of friends on a comedy movie club in the San Diego area, and all of them found this to be totally useless. I wish I hadn't bought this movie so I could watch it alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad I felt like I was going to do something to change my life. I don't understand why the people in the movie think it's an "film" or a movie: it isn't. What do you think it was? I guess you must have seen the "Strawberry or Pumpkin" posters?  It's just not scary. I found it on DVD; I don'n, but it doesn't make much sense for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major disappointment...   The first one to enter the movie was a bad and mediocre effort. A second one was much better.  A third one was a very good one. But it turned into a movie of lame twists and plots, and the bad ones did not do justice at all. There is no way the movie would win any Oscar Awards. The plot was weak, and a poor supporting cast. Most of the time there was nothing for the audience to enjoy.  This movie will be a total waste of money, time, and effort.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In most respects I did not care for this movie. I was expecting a good one. However, the fact that this movie was so horribly filmed that I would not even consider it's relevance to me. It is obvious that it is not going to be a big blockbuster film. It's just a few scenes from one movie... and one which, if you want to be serious about this, you will not find it anywhere. This is one of those "big deal" movies that is just not worth seeing (this is one example of that).  I won't go on another person's testimonial of this movie and try to analyze it in detail... but I will say that it's just not funny. It was pretty bad, and very little in its own little story. The story is very basic, and the fact of it being about the love of a girl is probably just the result of the director's over-protective obsession. I thought it was pretty silly when it was first filmed. The only reason I chose to go with it was because it was a great movie. It just didn't make me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen it twice.  I'm going out of my own accord to admit this movie was very bad. I can't believe this movie made any sense. The only redeeming qualities here were the fact that it was so obviously filmed in such low quality that there was some light entertainment for the viewer. What a waste of time, when you can just watch the movie alone to get the laughs. The plot was very predictable, and nothing seemed interesting at all. I don't know why any of the actors gave so much effort. I guess it wasn't hard to make the characters interesting. The dialog was very weak and the acting was bad, although some good performances. And I'm afraid I'm not a particularly good writer for this movie.   Not only that, but I'd rather watch this movie as a joke. The humor didn't come across to me. It's not even a good movie but you can watch it without having much thought. If the movie was real, it'd be funny. But this was just a pretentious, badly made piece of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only is this movie really bad, but the only reason I should watch it is because it's a good movie. If you're looking for a good film:  There are no good things in this movie, and the biggest problem I had was the fact that it is so unbelievable. The main girl is a really horrible slut and does not deserve her fame or the attention of any other guy. I mean what is going on is the fact of how the guy who raped her is able to rape her at will in a parking lot. She has absolutely no morals and has been a part of every good movie I've seen. The end is really painful. I don't believe I will ever see this movie again. The girl should be a part-owner of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is about the first human encounter ever, and how the next human encounter takes place is not relevant. The characters are utterly uninteresting, and the movie itself is predictable to the point that it isn't. The movie was really only interesting to the idea of human interaction. The main character is, well, dead. The rest of the movie seems like a parody of a horror movie, complete with the usual, stereotypical "spooky" plot. If you see it, your brain will turn to mush. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie so unbelievable that I was thinking about writing a negative negative review to a bad film:  You'll never learn how it is really made. What happened? Oh my gosh! What happened to all my fellow actors. How did they just fall for this garbage?!?! They must have wanted it to happen and they can't blame anyone. When they knew they were writing this movie, they had to write the movie. I don't blame the casting choices. They knew how these actors would do the lines. How, I'm guessing, they just used it for a couple minutes until they needed a whole lot of work. This movie really is the same as other garbage films:  The first few minutes of this movie are like watching a TV show about a movie: the actors are horrible, the plot is bad and the story is bad. I guess the only thing that really stands out is the scenery. This is really an old movie from a movie shop. Not like the real movie but I can understand the inspiration of making this movie. But you get tired watching it. It is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot: The movie was too predictable and it was too dull. There is no point-plan and no way-out, nothing happens (except to some point-out). It has too much money and too few scenes. It's so bad that I decided to try my favorite action movies and I am shocked. I don't care how well-known it is in the USA (I know the movie is about 30) and I think that the story could have been more believable and had some more depth than the script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find it hard to read about this film: it's so very cheap, so bad it can't stand out from anyone, even with the best camerawork of the legendary B-movie director Roberto Verdeja, it doesn't fit my eyes even in the most subtle way. The camera movements, the movements of the women, the camera shots (that you can see in the picture below) are awful. The editing is the worst part of this film. It's not the story, there is no plot, the story is not even close to the original story, the characters are poorly drawn, and the whole movie is nothing but a pretentious, cheap looking movie. I was very sad to learn my beloved director has been reduced to a mere shell of what he once was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A new trend in Hollywood and now movies: movies that are utterly predictable and uninteresting. So if this is a trend I don't want to partake in any of them, I will stick a lot of popcorn in my mouth.  The characters of the "Simpsons" movies were extremely good but the writers were absolutely nothing like the creators for them. The premise was very predictable. I won't even bother to try it for the sake of entertainment. The end of the story was predictable, as it has always been. I don''t understand why they decided to leave this predictable movie, or why they bothered with a plot that was completely different.  They obviously thought this movie would be funny and funny enough, but it did nothing for me. I will keep watching it for a few more hours to see if it does anything more than put me into the dark. The ending was pretty bad, but at least they had a happy ending.  I recommend the movie: go rent it if you don't like the genre of "Simpson", and if you do, avoid the movie completely. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie does not have a "big" script, but is more like a "dumb-in-the-brain" style. It is very slow and unbalanced. The actors in the movie were badly done. I have read that it was considered a comedy, but it really wasn't. A lot of people had such high expectations for it, but now that it failed to live up to them has turned the fans against this movie. This is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot seems to be based on some of the classic movie that was featured on our TV (as well as The Terminator). But when I look at it, it's only the story (from The Terminator) which seems to have some relevance in the story of "I" from the book (as far as we can determine) in the book. The story is about a robot with the capability to create human robots. The robots are not human and I think they are programmed to do exactly the same thing that "the Terminator" did in the books. In other words, the robots seem to be made of machines and not flesh! The other robot is not that of a robot. It's an empty robot with a body with a skeleton. The movie isn't very good either, except for some weird scenes which are obviously inspired from the original book. I just wonder why they chose to put all this junk in this movie. The only thing worth saving from this movie is the scene where they rescue Sarah Jane Hart (the Terminator) and a small girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Love" is a pathetic attempt at an American remake of "The Woman". The original movie was so much better. I felt that this one was a ripoff. The plot had some good ideas, although the fact that they're stupidly written is only a minor complaint. The dialogs were not terrible, although there were some very poorly written dialogs. There were a few places which had some nice dialog, and this is why I left this film to die. If you watch "The Man" on DVD, you'll find that it's pretty good, but it's still awful. The only redeeming feature was the music, which was actually very good. However, the music was just too bad for it to be worth the effort. I'd rate this a 4.5, but in this case, I'd give the movie 4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part is a horror film with a very predictable ending. The second part is similar but differs with a film in which the main characters are killed off. In the second part the characters are never made to interact with each other and only are shown to talk to the other characters. What's good about this film: -The ending (which is supposed to be a surprise) is a bit too predictable to make it effective as a horror movie. (And when the ending happens it also happens to a great deal of people and in this case the movie has the worst ending possible so that the movie looks like it's going to be really scary).   I can't find more positive comments about the movie: it is a piece of trash and I'm hoping that someone will make this better by throwing it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most painful thing I've seen from any Hollywood movie I've ever seen. It's like they can't even make this up for a week or more. It doesn't have a plot. It is about a girl who starts having sex with a priest (BJ) and then decides to make the first ever "date" with the priest (Kara). It is also about a priest and a mad scientist (Dr. Stupendey) who create a virus and that's when the virus infects the priest and the girl. When she's having sex she begins to experience hallucinations, which only makes sense as a sign is for her being crazy. But then the scene ends. After the episode, it just sort of goes on without any more action. If there is any plot, it was obviously horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really just is a waste of time for me. The plot is really stupid and poorly written. The film is about a bunch of women who are all in the way, a couple of married ladies and a couple who are both in the end and the beginning. While the two main characters seem like they have a couple on board and just want to be a normal person, the rest of the characters do something that is not completely acceptable for people.   They have to be called by the writer. It really is just a pile of "uncompelling pieces." And even with the great acting of Jennifer Feldman, Michael Jackson, and the great Christopher Walken, it's just a bad, bad, terrible, bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen much more wonderful films (than just a few, I guess, some movies) and one of the best, but this is a one of those movies that has the worst premise and bad screenplay. What gives this movie a "wow" is that it tries so hard to make its "wOW" moments, but fails to succeed. The story and dialogue are bad and they are not even funny. The actors were poor. There were only two things that I thought were good. One of those things was the cameo of Richard Simmons. The other was the original scene where he was wearing his best tie and hat.  The last 30 minutes of the movie were the worst scenes I've ever seen from a movie. The main character didn't have the most interesting parts of the story but he had some fine moments. But the bad guy was such an annoying character that we just wanted to kill him. The film could have been a much better one with more interesting parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a bit boring and the ending was predictable. However, the fact that it didn't end it was extremely disappointing.  The acting was decent and the story was pretty good but the story lacked a believable ending and the plot didn't have the right feel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad in every possible way. The ending alone is bad. I can't tell how, but the plot and acting seemed so real that it just made me uncomfortable. The characters just seemed fake.  I just gave this movie a 1 out of 10 because I didn't like the story and characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a dumb plot with a lame plot, boring plot, and stupid characters. The plot of this movie is so shallow that I was expecting to be put to sleep by it, but I just kept watching, hoping to come out alive. I don't like that! I didn't understand that there was any suspense, and when something happened that made me feel like the suspense, I just felt so bad.  I do believe that the dialogs were OK, if the acting was more dynamic, it could have made this movie better.   The characters, however, weren't much good, as they were either very predictable or extremely annoying. I wanted to be convinced to finish this movie, but just kept on watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was supposed to find out what would happen in the future and it turned out it was a movie that has not been released in decades. The acting was terrible.  What does happen in a future? There was a huge explosion in the sky and the city was in the middle of being attacked by monsters. So, the people from the city were forced to escape and they take shelter at a movie theater. In this movie, we have about 5 minutes in the theater as the two brothers start shooting zombie monsters and it is a scene that is completely unnecessary. The monster kills both of the brothers and then, for the sake of the sake, we take it to a party where the main character is in danger.  This is one of the most bad movies I've ever seen. I wish it would have stayed away from my video store and I'm sure if I was watching it it would be a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read about this movie and wanted to see the same as other reviewers, but unfortunately I didn't read it till today. I am very disappointed because it was bad.  I thought it was pretty decent. It is probably the worst of the two sequels for this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had no ending, even though it is about an old man. In a nutshell, a young man gets a car that kills his friends and father, and then a man has to be saved. There are a few strange characters in this film. The movie was probably too slow to develop and just got away from it. The ending was too weak to make the story work. I gave this movie 10 stars but I thought this was really bad. The acting was bad and the story was bad. Overall, this is probably a bad film for a first time film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I are both avid fans of the film "Mr. Smith" starring Charles Dennell in the lead role (Dennell's role is played by Gary Hayes, the younger brother of Dennel's brother, the two brothers, as the family of the three victims). However, Mr. Smith seems to be so desperate that he would hire Dennelle Hayes to act in it for his own entertainment. The film is absolutely awful and utterly uninteresting. You get the feeling that Dennells are trying to make a "Mr." film out of his younger brother, Dennen (as depicted in the film). It is like seeing Gary Hayes try to act like a teenager, trying to act as a teenager and trying to be a teenager without a proper personality.  I have been watching it for a couple of weeks and was quite disturbed to see this film. I am sorry to say that I can't put my finger on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just wanted to call this movie "Tongaradova: A Fistful Fighter". And, I thought it was a good idea... BUT what happened? I couldn't get it back once I watched it. The plot is dumb, the acting is bad, the story is terrible and the cinematography is bad... but there are some pretty good moments and a lot of funny moments, but nothing much good. Also I noticed that the music is not as good as the first movie with the huge soundtrack, but it's better with the horrible dialog. The scene that is supposed to open the movie, for example, has been edited a few times to make it worse, and the way that you can hear the actors shouting and talk in the movie is stupid. I won't see this movie again, but my brother saw it the other day and decided to watch it only to see what was happening. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My review of this awful film is worth watching only for the fact that this film is so terrible, I can't help explaining it. There were very few people on the crew who actually showed that they could have done better. The acting was terrible. The scene where we see the boy, the killer, is just the worst bit. I think the man in the house with the gun is the dumbest guy you've ever seen. The girl was cute, but a stupid character. I don't know how you can turn such a bad actor into a movie that had some good parts. I had my hopes for some interesting characters, but to be so bad, it's really sad. You want to get something that will inspire your entertainment; this movie didn't. Maybe there were people involved in making this film, but they didn't do anything about it. If you're interested, try a documentary: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the films, this one is probably the worst.  If you want to laugh at it, don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What makes this movie so horrible to see are the characters, particularly the lead, for a short run and over a half hour of the movie, the cast and the dialog were horrible. The main plot, the big picture that will go far, the characters are weak, the movie is a waste of time. The best thing about this movie is the fact that it starts with a good beginning and ends with a horrible, horribly predictable one. The movie is not the best thing for anyone to see, even a short one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible.  It was boring and bad. The only good part of this movie was the movie of a big bald guy sitting on a mountain. That's all it was.  I'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone. The plot is simple, a bald guy is looking for a girlfriend to take care of because he is missing. Then she comes back with him for a couple of nights, but is never successful.  The ending is a little bit like that, except for the fact that there are two different endings.  What can a guy do to a big guy in the forest to get his girlfriend? What could a couple do to each other?  How could this movie not be funny?! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really is an insult to anyone who knows what's going to happen. The actors who are supposed to portray the characters are horrible, and there is no explanation as to why they're so terrible. I am really sad that it was so low in the budget. If I can forgive some of the crap this movie is, I'll admit I think the director was right to include some of these elements. I do believe it was done right for the most part, and what was the point of doing such a horribly bad movie? You're going to see a lot of dumb-assed movies like this, but not even that kind of a movie? Not sure what was going to take away from the whole movie was that. I mean, I can see that it has some plot, so I have no problem with that. But you will get no sleep when watching this. Please, I wish I could give the movie the time it needed to be released. This film is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a feeling that this is going to be the first film I am ever disappointed with. I am a man who cares about the truth and not the lies I read. This movie contains some of the worst acting I've seen, and not many scenes worth watching. The acting is completely bad, but I will not go on a couple days to waste and be completely insulted by the film because I don't like it in the beginning. I found this movie at a local movie store, and I felt like I was being abused. This is simply a bad film for all the wrong reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no "to the side of life" which is why the "to his side" of a family turns into a horror or tragedy as a family discovers that they have become selfish. The ending includes an incest between the mother and daughter of one of the family members. It also features a rape scene and a sex scene involving one of their daughters. But not too much is supposed to be revealed and there are too few (or no one) to identify with the characters.   The scene in which the father and son of the couple act as a couple is rather creepy and seems very fake. The father seems to be a god who "talks" to his son and tells him that he wants to take advantage of his son's life. It's just one scene, which is nothing that will make you want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is absolutely ridiculous, and it's difficult to figure out who's the main character. It's almost impossible to find the main villain, and I just don't know why anyone is there at all. Even though I'm a very weak person, I enjoyed the first part of this movie, but I just couldn't finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a person who loves Disney movies as much as possible, but this was simply an embarrassing waste of what a Disney movie should have been.  I rented this movie a week ago. However, as a complete fan of Disney, I thought it would be a good movie to rent. There is nothing else I can say to you other than, "don't rent this movie because it is a lousy waste of money".  I was very disappointed with the film. It's not like "Lassie, Where the Kid Was" which had a very good cast and cast of characters, and "The Adventures of Alice and Roy" which was very well developed, and a good musical score. The only thing I remember was the use of the Red Sox's mascot.  There's nothing about the Red or Blue Sox in this movie. They have the same cartoon sound, the same comic reliefs as usual, and the same musical score as the original. Only the movie itself is boring. The characters are just there to fill a few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had this movie for the "movie room" so that I could have it for my own eyes and only in hopes of making this movie in a manner of entertaining entertainment. I thought this movie had a very small budget and some plot elements were predictable and it didn't really get me into the mind that much. The ending was just too harsh to admit it. I did not really care for the direction the way the story is written. I do not know if the plot was written and the acting was good. I just think that this movie is way too predictable and its not in my opinion. I'm afraid that when it is released, it will be used for a couple movies. It's sad when people fall for people who are simply not committed to what they are doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on a crappy DVD-on-DVD set, and I thought it was a mediocre movie that got a little bit more interesting. I was hoping that the fact that it was rated would make this movie interesting, but unfortunately it did not. Even if the subject had some interesting content, this movie would simply fail to make any sense at all. It's a complete waste of time and money. I can't even think it's funny, let alone scary. A random dude has an idea that a mysterious, strange little girl with an over-sexualized face and huge breasts gets ahold of a giant girl who has supernatural powers, and tries to lure her off to a dark forest for a couple of days. He gets more drunk and then makes advances towards her, only to realize she's not so scary after all. And while she is drunk and horny, he has sex with her. And then she is naked, and he sleeps with her again, and she screams. So they get together, but after the three days of alcohol-induced pleasure, they just decide that it's time for them to get more serious.  The only redeeming element of the movie is the music, though. Well, that's about as much as you could do. The other songs are mediocre. The plot was decent, but it did have some good moments. But the story and the acting were quite bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a waste of an original concept of one of the most terrible genre films ever produced. The only reason I am ever buying this is because my friends said it was so good I needed more. It is bad so bad it's good! I just think it was bad so I gave it to a friend. It's so bad that it's so obviously not good that I wonder why I didn't give it to my friends. What did I see before? It's like one of those movies where you get an idea of what a movie would be but then it starts becoming predictable. I wonder if I would be in a position where I would just tell me where you want to go to get movies:  I saw this movie for about an hour and I cannot fathom how I was in the middle of sitting there for. If I could, I would have put it back and watched it again. However, I wouldn't change anything. It doesn't matter how bad this movie is. It does not make a single good impression on anyone. This is like "The Expendables" which only made one or two of the very good scenes in the movie and the last. The good part of this movie I found was the fact that the acting was good and the way it ended. Unfortunately, this movie does not have as much feeling for the characters. It was like you are told about a movie when it is played out so you know that it was the right choice for the actors to do the right thing they didn't do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is pretty awful film. It was only 3 minutes short of a decent performance. If you find yourself in a theatre with people who are so stupid it's entertaining, it's good-if bad-it's bad. I had to turn the dial up to 60 on the phone to get my attention. The biggest reason this film is awful is because it is so poorly written that I can't believe what I read in the DVD. I cannot believe it was actually written this for. It seems like a movie by the director of "Rambo: The Humor of the South" who obviously didn't want to film the same story, but rather try to write an excuse to make a film about it. It's so bad that I am almost willing to donate money to a charity that buys this movie.  This movie is not even from a documentary studio. They really should give it a look, and give it to the "Rampo: A Love Story" guys. They have such a good idea, as the title suggests. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely horrible.  The plot is extremely predictable and the characters, the plot, the story are not so great and the "plot" is only an hour long.  A lot of the dialog is extremely contrived and has no storyline and is just about how someone kills some other people and why. The director, writer, and director didn't even bother with an idea. The actors just put some of the characters in a box and put some popcorn together.    It was a really bad movie, it wasn't very good but it was good to watch it because it was horrible. The biggest problem is the lack of story and storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the one film that has turned out more often than any other in the past 2 years. If there is one film more disappointing than any of these: it would be this one. The acting, direction and cinematography was horrible, but the story was a poor attempt at a film-based version of the film, as evidenced by the film's lack of any depth whatsoever.  As a former film buff, I was quite shocked by it. The characters were stupid, the script was poor, the special effects were lousy, and it lacked any plot. It had absolutely nothing to do with any film. I couldn't care for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just the first low-budget, no-name horror movie, ever. No really. The other things in this film were quite good in the first three minutes, but after the beginning, you're just looking for something to be different from the rest of the movie. The only plot point is that one guy gets really attached to the female lead and it happens to him. We've seen this thing many times. The story is pretty generic and it's obvious that it is trying to make a point about how the female leads are the only ones that have survived. This is about as bad as movies that come out in the past, like "Housewives of the Year" or "The Bride with the Baby". The premise is really stupid. In other words, it isn't that hard to make horror. At least the writer of "The Girl With The Face" can actually get a name. That's why it's better than the others. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll never really call this movie "the best one ever," but I know the people who have seen it think it's about the best thing ever! But, if I have one piece of wisdom to be able to say to anybody, and to whoever reading this:  If you are so young that you believe you have the potential to make movies, you should never waste your time to watch this one.  I can't believe that this movie was made in the UK. The production techniques used for this movie were so amateurish and the editing was so sloppy that it's basically impossible to follow it, even though it's not as bad as you've read. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad I can't even make this one up in a proper way, but I can say that it is bad at least. You have no idea what you are going to make with this kind of crap. At one point in the movie, I said to myself that it would be like "The Shining". But it's just not like that, at least not in any way. If there was some kind of magic in it, I would have felt much better with it. The plot didn't come in for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a very interesting thriller thriller. I was a fan of John Hanks' book and I'd been looking forward to watching this one. I got it but it was really bad. In its way I don't think that it will win anyone in this award, and it doesn't hold the quality of award, but it does make an extremely disappointing watch, especially when it is done on "crowds" (I don't know why that is!) It is too long, the dialogue is poor, the story is weak, and the direction lacks the quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought of this film at a friend's house and thought, "Would this really be like a movie?" I'm so dumb to admit, but I was wrong. And I don't understand why a movie made at the age group is as bad as this film is. The plot was absolutely horrible. A girl with two sisters and her husband had to leave the house and start working in a factory. The father was just a dumb guy. The wife had to keep him around because he was a horrible, connent man. This was extremely annoying. And when she got mad at her husband, she didn't understand that she had to stay with him until she could get mad at the man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have a stomach I'll see this at your local video store. This movie is nothing more than a poorly written, dumb, bad movie with a very predictable ending that has no idea what will happen, and a completely pointless ending. The only reason to see this movie is that you have to try it for yourself, but if you don't, you'd be missing out on all of the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not much good here - it's about as shallow and predictable as usual. The ending (and the ending to the whole film) does make me think of all the terrible things that came out of this film; the rape, the shooting, the rape by the "good guy" and the killer. I've been watching this movie since its first airing - I didn't like it. The problem with it is that it is just awful. A really bad, awful film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very excited to see this movie, and I thought it would be a great, entertaining film, but unfortunately, the movie was only in the small part that we could actually see. The story was really ridiculous, and the film didn't even make the impression that it would actually be a good movie. At one point of the movie, we were shown a lot of body parts, and at another point of it, it shows a giant robot. At this point, it is so bad that I decided not to bother watching it. The plot is really bad, and this is the only movie that I have been disappointed by so far.  If you want to see a movie, watch it at your local video store. It's bad to see anything that is so terrible in itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a waste of time. I rented the movie with my wife and she laughed at it when she laughed in it. I can't tell why I even bothered to rent this movie. I was so sick of this crap and not really know why it was so scary for me to watch it. We just kept thinking about buying it over and over and making excuses to not buy it. The actors seemed to be acting out of their underwear as well as the "the stars" in the movie and we thought they were pretending to be people. The only good thing in this movie was when the "stars" fell in water and became a man. We tried to buy it, but we found it hard to find the DVD in Canada. We really expected a more intelligent and intelligent movie that would be better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is a serious film with a story, then you are going to have a problem. It is so bad, you wonder why anyone should ever have even bothered to buy it. Even worse, it doesn't deliver any good story. The story is very bad, mainly because it isn't believable. And the actors should be more believable. As far as the directing goes, it's pretty damn horrible. It makes the "bad" guy very convincing, but there are no good actors. It's just bad, bad and bad. Avoid this one at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible. I had the worst I've seen in this type of movie, but I can't complain. The acting is a joke, the plot is pathetic and the story is weak. The whole movie was nothing but an unbelievable mess. The actors seem to be bored with the situation in the first 30 minutes and then get some strange things happen. It was so bad that I had no feeling like the characters in it. I have to wonder if the writers did the original character justice. I wish they had a writer with more talent to help them. If the writers would like to come back, I'd love to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the writers should have avoided this movie. I'm the one person in the world that has ever written a good movie: "A Christmas Story". Well, what do you do when you do that? How do you feel when you watch this movie? A short story and a few scenes about a boy named Steve who, in disguise, falls in love with another boy. This film just fails to deliver.  I'm not even kidding: The acting is mediocre and the storyline just plain bad. The idea of the movie is "a Christmas story" with a boy falling in love, but the story is not even that. What gives the story to this movie is the boy who falls in Love with his girlfriend (which has been done before). In order to make the story interesting, you must have a very good story. But the movie just doesn't deliver it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i found this movie to be boring and stupid. this was not a good episode for sure but it was stupid to go to the same location at the same exact location twice. I felt like it would be a waste of a shot because it would ruin the movie, and not only by the ending but by the actors who put the camera in the same room twice. it's pretty basic but there are more twists and twists to every twist and you could just make yourself jump off and jump off. I don't see why people would pay so much money for this and you will not even survive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie after seeing a documentary on the program: "The American War" by Christopher Platt. The documentary was an hour long and had many inaccuracies in the movie: the fact that the invasion of Iraq in Iraq was planned and planned from the very beginning and the fact of the American intervention only in Iraq were they got wrong, the fact about the destruction of Iraq's cities and the lack of military action during the war. Also, the war itself had not been that great, and the American troops had only taken a few shots at a few cities (that are far from the ones depicted in the documentary). I couldn't agree with all of the factual statements that the documentary provided, especially the one that said that the Americans had put up some of the heaviest bombs in the history (that is true, they used 1st and 2nd of the bombs, which were not used in the first war). Also, they should have made the same mistakes as the documentary, that they never bombed the "the greatest" cities in Iraq (the only ones they bombed in the war were the cities that were not in Iraq).   Overall, I don't recommend this movie as much as I would have liked to have seen this before. There are plenty of interesting things to discover, but most of them are useless and I can't even consider the actors in the film. They should have avoided making the story so crowded with so many inaccuratums and even a documentary would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most shallow movie I've ever seen. It's full of ridiculous situations and the biggest mistake was in the plot. The first plot of the movie involved a small town and what happens is that it doesn't exist. That doesn't mean a real person, it doesn of course mean a town. There was no real town and the people were just a bunch of people who got drunk in a car and were killed. The scene is like a horror movie that never really takes place. The acting is terrible, the music is terrible and the plot is very poor.  The main plot of this movie is a young boy's obsession with a young girl (played by the excellent Catherine Zeta Jones) and he just can't seem to keep himself away from this. The end is horrible and it doesn`t make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was pretty good, with some really good visuals and some interesting characters. But the story felt dull, too slow, and uninteresting.  The ending was completely predictable and the final shot of the movie was left open. Also, I didn't understand the end.   It could have been a really cool movie. But for everything that could have come from the movie, the story was too slow.  Overall, this movie is only an excuse to use a bad TV series for a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like having a small group of friends and sitting around a group of drunk teens who would like to try to have a fun night, but they all end up having sex with each other. As the movie goes on, one of the drunk teens has an extremely horny girlfriend with some really awful boyfriend and another drunk teen tries to bang her so that her girlfriend can climax. But what happens? If you have the good sense of humor you can just laugh and get out of it. But if you are like me you'll be on the edge of a cliff. In conclusion, this is about as bad a movie as I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first "Ghostbusters" movie but the other 2 movies were pretty good. This one is no exception. If you have watched one of the previous 2 movies and can't wait for this one, skip it. This movie does not manage to capture what it is supposed to. The plot is so lame and has little substance. I mean little, but it's fun to watch it like it's supposed to be fun. Unfortunately, you're just watching a bunch of dumb, fake Hollywood films. This is not the only bad movie out there. I won't give this movie a 10 because it's good but it is not so great to see an empty plot. If this movie had some real meat, I would give it 7/10 but it doesn't, as I had a hard time sleeping after watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have ever seen "The Legend" before and don't know what it is, you would be better off staying in the dark for awhile and listening to the soundtrack on a CD. The plot is so stupid it's not worth watching. And the characters are completely awful. They are either stupid or completely unlivable. There is no motivation for this character or for the entire movie.  The music does a few minutes of entertainment when the director is playing it for her own amusement. But it's so annoying, it doesn't really do anything for you.  This is a movie that needs to have its own little time on a disc rather than a DVD or a DVD. It is the same with the movies of the "Bubble" series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a small woman who is sent to perform an embarrassing performance and she cannot resist the urge of the director to film her naked body in various positions. The woman finds herself in a situation, but she is unable to resist.  I don't know what makes this movie funny. A few minutes of this film's performance would have been amusing if it was the kind of movie I was expecting. The only part that I was like to see in this movie was the naked body. The body is obviously meant to be a nude body, not a naked body like that of the famous American model, Jenna Lyons.  This is simply a piece of trash. Avoid this movie at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My son loved the movies and I don't blame them for that, but I do believe the premise was illogical and ridiculous. Now, if the man is in fact alive, then why would he give her body? If she was alive, I'm sure she would have kept a purse and a purse on the bed and could have returned a couple of nice items for herself. She would never have left her boyfriend, nor would she have left any valuable items behind. She had nothing, and that's what made the plot a joke.  I was curious as to see how the guy in the first film was killed but she didn't even get away. If she had some sort of magical ability or any power that would allow her to go on that ride, I would have to wonder if she had taken a life. The ending was so silly. If they had had turned the man in a girl, it would be funny, but they obviously didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like a movie with every other plot (and with all the boring stuff thrown in front of the camera) that you can't even get away from. I was looking for something more serious but I got tired of just walking through it. I found this in a movie on DVD with a really cute cast (especially the older girl with the little tan in a blonde wig). I was sorry to find this movie, but at least there was enough to make it fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie. It was a little boring, but I had a hunch as to why there were so many gothics that were cast in it. I don't have any idea why the rest of the cast was ever casted in it, but a lot of actors had some pretty good ideas, but only a handful of cast members got anything to go on. My guess would have been that the guy in the movie, Alton Bardin (who is a great actor and is a huge fan of the movies of his) would have had the same ideas. But it was just bad.  And the whole cast seemed to be more interested in how things were portrayed by the cast than anything else. There wasn't enough detail to make the movie interesting. I'd have expected the actors to actually be involved in the storyline and the plot, so that's what I was looking for. I guess the reason it doesn't turn out as a movie is because the director didn't want to put too much into it. It's not that he was trying to be serious or anything, he just didn't like it and didn't try too hard. The acting was pretty bad. There weren't much to do for the actors. The best part of it was that it had a nice soundtrack, but it was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people are on my side of the spectrum of this film. They are just wrong and they don't see this movie.  It's bad, I have to give it a 8, because it isn't a bad film, it's an awful movie. This movie is horrible, no one should see it... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really embarrassing. The premise is obviously a very stupid one. If there was a single good thing in this movie then I would go on and rent it to every family in the world. But this just doesn't go that far. In fact I have to wonder if this is actually a movie or if there's some kind of script that actually makes this point. The acting is extremely bad. In one scene of the film there's a bunch of guys in a room that are shouting at each other. It makes me wonder why these people will ever act in the same room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is just a pretense for a romantic drama. In the end the two leading actors can't hold the story together. The movie tries to imitate the idea of a romance, but its failure is apparent. The ending is not a romantic one, rather it's like watching a dumb movie with a plot based on the idea, and without the development and development of characters. The idea is that you will like this movie (for some reason) and watch the final performance, but the movie does not deliver.  The characters don't even look real. There are some good scenes with interesting characters, but what happens at the end is unbelievable. The acting is pathetic, and the dialog is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two reasons for this to go on a long list of movies:  Well, 1) They make a "hit" movie and they sell it. 2) There is some weirdness. This really only proves to be a poor choice of comedy in the 1990's. It's just a cheap-to-see, cheesy, non-comedic-gum-gump! If you find yourself looking for this movie it should be hard to find! The director also seems to believe that there is something about these people that needs to be shown to anyone. If you have some sense of humor to this film, then you're gonna have a bad time. If not, do not rent. I'd also suggest that if you rent this, watch it in a dim light so your eyes are not open. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not gonna spoil anything and say anything that I will say in this review about the badness of the movie. But I will be doing something. I will simply try to figure out the "plot" that is "Bored" as a "taken-away teen" with no real explanation as to why she killed herself. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my career to date, and even if it's just a few minutes, it will never get past the basic "plot", with no reason why it's an acceptable one for a teenager to do it. If I can take that comment into the film and its effects, I'd be a fool not. I won't even try to take this into the minds of the average American viewers. There are no twists, no "gossip" drama, no comedy, and I wouldn't even call it "fun." I've never watched this movie. The actors I liked looked like people who knew they was supposed to act in these movies only days. The director, however, was not funny enough, and the acting was horrible. My personal take on this movie: if it was a horror movie, it would be far better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After the big bang of War, everyone knew that the 'Dark Angel 2' was the best movie they had ever seen in the '80s. But at the start of the film, the action is extremely dull and uninteresting, with some blandly directed action and some boring dialogue about a good man that is being killed by a giant demon that is able to break through steel steel armour. I was very nervous that the storyline seemed so weak, with just one line left out of the entire plot, and after it started I had to watch the ending with my eyes and wonder what happens next. I didn't care for it at all, but after it finished, I was just grateful to be rid of it. What was the director thinking? If you want to see this movie, you'd better get a better deal at the cinema: 'Dark Angels 2' isn't the best of the 'Savior War' movies, and I won't give it another chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are only a handful of decent American films that I have seen. But that doesn't stop an American film with a weak plot. This film is just a bunch of humbugs, an idea that has never been made before, and a plot that has not been developed into a compelling film. This was a bad film to watch.  The characters were too similar and the story didn't do anything new to make it interesting.  This film has to have some real substance to bring the film out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is another example of the sort of anti-clinic movies that do not stand for any reason but to say that people who want to be more "real" than a doctor will turn to an anti-scientific approach in search of truth. This is bad, because it is only about the truth of science and it doesn't work well to say the positive side, and then the positive one that it is about does not make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was obviously the worst movie I had seen, even at a festival for the best of the year, which I attended. I didn't like the idea of the game "Deception" for the reasons listed below. I was also pretty bored, and the acting was weak.  I would have been more impressed with the rest of "Deceptics", as I'm sure they're capable of making a decent film, if they had a good script. But I didn her at least, because there is something more disturbing than the movie.  If you're interested, go watch a movie: a horror flick: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I did, with the help of a fellow who just left the theater for reasons that aren't exactly what you can say about a movie: I don't know how one of the guys would respond to an event of this level (I had a good time doing the film in the theatre), but you can't find a good movie in which that is the main focus of the plot.  I didn't like this movie. I tried watching it with my girlfriend and the other lady from the theater after it, and I couldn't think they would like it either. It is just bad, stupid, childish, ridiculous and pointless. I cannot even forgive myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is decent, but the acting is pathetic. I was looking for some good characters so I would have expected something like a movie or movie with some interesting characters. However, I found out that in this movie, there are nothing interesting to talk about, except a few of the male characters. The only interesting character was the killer. The story is a predictable one that has little or no explanation for its characters. I guess the producers of this movie felt like they needed to make this film and just put out the bad movie because that was easier than the "big" movies.  I have no idea why I bothered to read a movie: the plot seems to be so far from reality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a very annoying movie... it has the same slow pace... and, if you're a true fan of martial arts, you'll be the very disappointed. The plot is about some kids who make this video, and we can tell how it's not about the kids... no matter what they have been doing lately. The characters are not believable, even the ones that are supposed to be kids are stupid and annoying... the acting is poor, but it's also poorly planned, so the pacing is not all that bad, I guess... the director is just trying to use this as a convenient way to add the little humor that they need to fill the empty space with... (as always!) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not all that bad a movie: it's not an extremely original movie, but you get a feeling that you're having fun watching it only when it gets dark enough, and even when it does, you're not really in a fun mood. As I watched it, I was left feeling so miserable that I felt I couldn't get past it. While it's an interesting premise, it's simply an awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing in this movie was a tiny bit of humor. The acting was bad and the whole storyline was completely unbelievable, especially the ending. There was some of the most boring and ridiculous scene scenes I've ever seen. The ending was absolutely unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst thing i've ever seen on television. It's absolutely not a comedy. You really think that this show is a comedy, and not a horror movie, and there is absolutely no reason for it. A big reason is that this movie was supposed to be a horror film, but it was instead made to look like a comedy (a stupid film). If this movie had been a comedy film, it would have been better. However, it isn't a comedy - it's a movie that takes a very big slice out of a bunch of stupid, stupid movies.  This was really terrible. It was boring and poorly made, with horrible effects. I had to pay $5 to rent it in the theatre and the theater was empty. The plot wasn't very good. I would give this movie two thumbs, but 1/2 is the WORST of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some weird story in this movie. I can't say how. The acting is ridiculous and bad. I won't say anything about it, but if you like the concept of "comedy" horror and can't figure it out then you might be stuck on the "story" as a story without a reason or a reason. I guess the story tells a story about a couple who is divorced and has a boyfriend, but the guy ends up on the road with another girl who tells her about an "event" that happens in the woods and the two of them have to get back there to investigate it.  Then they have to fight for their lives.  They meet the guy on a bike when they arrive at the woods, but there's no way he can escape with the girl's gun, so they try to shoot each other and try to make their lives so they don't get killed. However, he doesn't do anything but try to escape.  He tries to get them into the woods to avoid getting caught in the headlights of another car and there are other situations where they have different endings.   The final story is not very scary but the ending isn't very scary either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about to be the least disappointing movie of all time - it seemed like a waste of time. The storyline is stupid, the characters are weak, the story is weak, but I don't mind spending hours reading about this movie - this movie is only a waste. If you want to see a fun, exciting movie: you'll have to see this movie on a late night. If not, watch something stupid! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only laugh because this is the worst film ever filmed in Europe, which is something that I can't understand. If you're looking for a real-life European horror film, don't waste your time: you'll just find yourself bored. It's worse than the "Stalker" series, at least, and I don't know why this is considered to be a horror film in any way, shape or form. They don't even make a creepy atmosphere, except for the monster, which looks like a gigantic dinosaur. It has the same "wobebulka" or "chatterbot" vibe you can expect to see in the movies and the only real thing is the girl. Her body looks like nothing more than a corpse, a body with no skin and a corpse in a coffin.  This is easily one of the most ridiculous lines I've ever seen, and the movie is actually worse than "Sticker" in some ways. The acting is good, but they're just horrible. A few moments in the film do give it a slight surprise, such as when I saw the girl crying at the beginning of her first scenes, and seeing her eat another corpse that had its head cut off. You get the sense that this would have been a movie based on a horror movie. Then there's the "lion's face" monster and "stalk" monster that appear on a scene where the "stalker" are going to pick up any woman in the street. If it's as bad as this, then you might be able to see it in some "wet-dog" horror film. The only time where you see the girl going out for "hunting" is when she's forced out of the car. It can't be helped, as I think the girl was in the car, but it didn't help the way it was made.   This movie was a shame to watch as a horror flick. The script isn't very interesting either. The monster had a somewhat interesting and scary appearance and was pretty scary. But I'd like to think there was something more scary in it. The beginning was the monster had her eyes filled with blood, I think. But the monster was supposed to be scary, and she wouldn't have been scared by her. The rest of the acting wasn't good enough, neither. The ending was pretty awful. The plot has been made very clear. A lot of people were killed in a big
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst I have ever seen. I've never seen anything remotely as horrible or even awful. It is bad in so many ways that the movie could be classified as one of the worst movies ever. But it does have a few redeeming qualities. Not the least is the fact that it has a few moments that are worth watching.  As you might expect, the movie is about a bunch of people who decide to get drunk. And it is about people who, for the sake of the movie, decide to be drunk. It contains a few lines that are pretty funny, and it contains some clever jokes that keep the audience involved. But unfortunately, this movie is horrible all the way. It seems to have little real substance. There isn't a lot of plot either. It does seem interesting. But what are the chances of it getting made into a cult film? I think that if you watch it, it will be watched by children, but there are some scenes that are so weak that they give the audience no hope. I think it's bad for children, too, because it only happens at the end. I'm really disappointed to see that it was even filmed on a small independent film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film had a nice opening scene and a good ending, but it's just really bad. It's not very interesting and very predictable and the "plot" is pretty convoluted.  The acting is pretty good, although the characters don't seem to do much. Overall, the film just feels like a bunch of people pretending to be normal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible, but not because of a lack of artistic direction. I thought it was a documentary based on the movie "Backfire". If only the movie had an actor who would have been in the first and not the second one, then it would be good.  The first one of its three "sides" had a good plot and story (with the best ending), but the other two, one which had the best end, failed so badly to deliver. I am really disappointed with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you see this movie at a decent movie rental in LA and you enjoy seeing the actors, chances are that you will be bored or offended by the dull story and the predictable action scenes. You won't like the direction, the cinematography, the story line, or the plot. You will likely be disappointed and most likely will not even get to see the actors again. This is only a couple of minutes of enjoyment from the moronic "Mysteria!" script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, what was your take on this film?  It is the dumbest piece of film making ever made. It is awful and awful, but is not worthy of being in the library.  It could have been made by any other director than Richard Harkness. The story is predictable, and it's not even worth a second. The movie's characters are terrible and the movie could have come out in a much better way.  But as with "The Love of Murder" or any other horror film of recent years, it would be much better if Harksses' character had a different identity. He was a cop and had to put up with an impossible boss and a criminal named "Brent".  The ending of this movie is so pathetic that it is not even funny.  I would like to see Richard HARKNESS' first ever film in America. I want to see his name again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just screams a 'no film', but at that very low budget. The movie would have been much better had it been made for a movie that was less predictable and at less risk of being attacked by the army or the army of the first time a major combatant. It's simply a predictable, low-budget, hackneyed plot, with no explanation of why it matters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie at a friend's house, I was in the house at my local store, and I was not alone. I knew nothing about the movie, but I knew no one was going to talk about it.  The movie had very little plot. The movie's main character, I had no knowledge of, is a man with a bad mustache, and the only part of his face was a fake mustache. The other characters didn't talk. The only real-world characters were the characters in the movie. My friends are only 8-10 years old, and only one had a beard. It was hard to find the others.  And this movie had no music. I had a couple of friends who saw it, and we laughed at most of the acting. It had no action, and it had no voice-over. The acting was unbelievable. In fact, you could not hear most of it. The fact that this movie was so bad made me mad. My father and I were both really annoyed at the same time. It wasn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the biggest fan of this movie but I do think it needs to be put on the shelf so people don't get the shaft again. It's not funny to say that it's not. Just some silly scenes to make people laugh, nothing to make this movie any more serious than a big slasher flick. Just don't watch it. It is no where funny. I mean you'd have to watch it for it to be funny. If you want to watch some serious comedies this is one of the worst but worst in the category. The only reason it got even that slight bit of humor is the fact that it was rated by people that actually know what they are watching, not the studio that made it. Don't buy it, you're going to watch a much better comedy in the form of The Hangover, The Van Corner, or The Brothers of the Blues. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of film. As a viewer I am going to watch this film in hopes of avoiding future embarrassment. If you have read the book, it was very entertaining but with the horrible acting, a movie like this is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was awful, but the movie was interesting. But the movie wasn't so interesting, and the idea of this movie was so bad. It's so bad I'm scared to watch this movie. The guy is crazy. He is such an idiot. It is such a waste to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not to mention that this is a very bad movie. Well it doesn't matter that there is no real plot, nothing. There is only one main person, a person, which is completely artificial, who is just an ordinary person who only wants a little money for an act. The whole movie is an excuse to waste money and time. The only positive thing is that the plot is cute, funny, funny and even cute but the story is bad.  It is bad not only because there is nothing interesting, but bad because it has nothing except a stupid and stupid character. The movie starts out so beautiful that you get to care about everything. Then you get a few minutes of stupidity, nothing, nothing to really make you care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really couldn't enjoy this movie. There was nothing to go in with this movie aside from a ridiculous plot. I watched this film for the sake of money and the purpose of a movie is to entertain me, not because I don't know who else in the audience is. If that were the case, then what the plot was, I would have to assume it was made for children only.  But the lack of any storyline is really disappointing. I don`t know why a movie would waste a plot for this piece of crap. This movie was absolutely useless to anyone in the theater, especially me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If your eyes are open, you can see a short film: a scene that, if filmed in real time, should have been directed to be a comedy: funny, but badly made.  If we were to do one of these in a comedy, the script would have been a "short short film".   The script for "The Good Fight" was pretty funny. But the "Good Fight" does not even stand in that comedic environment. If we wanted to make a comedy "short", we should have "The Bad Fight" here instead of it being a comedy. There's something really special about The Good Fight, but it just isn't funny. The funny part is in the fighting scenes, when the characters are playing each other; you would be able to tell if they're acting like two people.  There's nothing funny in that situation.  The acting is bad in the beginning. There are some pretty funny and amazing things about the fight scenes, but they are just not funny.  It was pretty good in the way, but in the second half, it was pretty bad. The film is not funny either. It seems like a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just plain boring to watch as a family's lives continue to disintegrate. In this movie, they're on a vacation for five days, but there are some scenes that are almost entirely shot in one spot. What happens is that they get back in the hotel room and try to rent a room for the other five guests, and we can pretty much guess the result. Not even great special effects like the underwater camera. Very predictable.  I don't know what made it. Maybe it got some time, like a few long scenes, a little bit of smoke, some background shots or something, and just a few scenes of action in a small room. But I still felt that the acting was terrible and the camera moves so badly that it doesn't make a lot of sense. It has the potential to be interesting if it got a bigger budget. But as a viewer you can't really feel anything. And the dialog didn't make it more interesting. The camera is either moving or not moving. It doesn't seem like a story, the story has nothing to add to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't even go that far. It was a little disappointing. However, this is a movie I saw when my friends were bored with a boring movie. I don't really remember it well, but my friends remembered it better. We were just looking for a story, which is not it. There's really no real plot. When we first saw it, it didn't make any sense, but afterwards, it was very confusing. I think the scriptwriters just weren't able to do it because the director had nothing to do but tell us what we wanted and then we had nothing but an excuse for that. We just sat in a circle laughing! The only saving grace was the voice-over. We must have laughed for that and for a bad reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all i am not sure if this movie is based on any comic book or cartoon series. In fact its very clear that the characters are meant to be cartoonish characters that you can expect to "get" on to the show only to end up "disappeared" by the "other half" in a manner more reminiscent of "Ciderbate". Even the movie itself looks like some sort of a cartoon. In the first minutes it looks like it will not get more or better than "Kung Fu" with a cartoon style. For example, its almost entirely based on the idea of throwing into a pool and throwing rocks onto the pool as well as jumping and diving into the pool that will be either in the pool of your pool or your pool. Of course, even as you get deeper into the movie it does not really go anywhere. The movie is a horrible parody of the aforementioned "Krugga" movie that comes on a summer vacation. Some of the scenes seem to be real. It even got a little bit to where I thought that the story itself was unrealistic. If you were to get a chance to see the movie after a while I would suggest going to your local store and paying your $5 to rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first I've seen that I cannot remember after having seen the other 9. The acting was almost amateur to watch.  As I said, there was nothing, nothing, and nothing. This is bad, bad, and bad. This movie is worse than the other ones and that I've never watched in the last decade. The best thing about it was the original cast (which are great) are the best people in the movie, but there was so little effort put in by the cast. I think they just want to get a little money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the story were correct, this is an insult to the fans who go to see this film in the theater for something else than entertainment. As much as this film makes me believe in the idea that the director of the film is the man who wrote the script, I can't imagine why this is. The main character is a black man who lives in America, and the fact that he is black does not make it any easier for him to write this film. He seems to be one of the most self-promoted bigoted celebrities of our era, but there is something that cannot wait for him. I thought he was trying to set that up. Why do people think he wrote this film?  I have never understood the argument that someone who was actually a bigoted filmmaker would write a negative piece of nonfiction. It is simply inconceivable that someone so bigoted as that man has such an ego that he would try to put a negative portrayal of himself into his film, and then try to defend himself. This film contains nothing but a ridiculous premise that doesn't have a script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just stupid, stupid is an insult to anyone who cares about animals in the film world.  My wife and I felt like we were watching the movie when we both had left the theater at the local bar and were at the same place where we would have been. This movie wasn't even remotely interesting, and I can't believe my husband and I let this movie even reach a passing grade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on the TV in an advertisement for a horror movie: The "B" movie was about a big-to-complete family (the "B") and I felt my heart beating in the throat. It was so bad, it was so terrible, I had a hard time watching this movie. I'd rather not believe it just from the first time and I didn't care to buy the DVD. I never even bothered to look at the title or see the video in a store because I was so terrified I would never even have to watch it.  I was not even mad at the actors and the script but I felt the movie had been badly written and badly filmed. A lot of actors had the same acting ability as the ones in the "B". It was like casting a group of actors together in a movie (or casting a movie with actors in a band playing songs, for example) that was missing the characters. I don't remember a single person being there but I saw it as if a movie had come out of some movie shop.  It has been nearly a decade since I wrote this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A man is kidnapped by the KGB, and it's not even a movie, its a waste of a couple of hours of film. The only thing that makes this movie work is the bad direction and the stupid character choices. The dialog is ridiculous. I wish I had known to be more mature. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was horrible, but what is the point? I watched it, and I was surprised that the filmmakers were allowed to make it. If this film was ever released, I would have been in a fight with the producers. It was terrible, but not entirely offensive. It wasn't that it was bad, because I can understand why a film made like this gets made. You can watch it on HBO. There are countless, thousands of people who are not capable of seeing this kind of film. I would expect more to see it in a library, and then I would be sure to see more of it. This movie doesn't make any sense, and the people who produced this garbage had absolutely no idea what people would do with it. I'd give money to this movie if I were to watch it at a library. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the movies of James C. Midge and Gary Klein but nothing like this one. I'd like to see more of James and C.Midge but this one is very disappointing, a complete disappointment. I can't figure out why they made this a movie. I know it is probably based on the old "Buck" movie but if you were just watching it and never watched "Bucks" it was actually a very disturbing story. It's really not worth a second for anybody else. The main character is absolutely ridiculous. I would have like to have seen Gary Klein back in his normal life in his more natural, more intelligent, manhood. This movie should have been better than "Backs" but it just isn't. I have to assume that James C on the DVD was actually trying to make a movie about the two brothers as brothers but I just can't get behind the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a piece of crap this movie is. If only someone had some brains, the best thing would be the rescue movie I have ever seen. Alas, I couldn't find it. I guess I can blame the poor screen actors. It's too bad. I will admit that there are some fine actors, but they seem to be very bad. The only thing that works is the scene where there are four women standing in a window, and we see a naked girl. What fun! There is a moment where a man in a tattered room with a chains is raping her, and all of the people are screaming in the background. How much did it have to be? Well, for starters, it's a horror movie. But at the end, after all that we have to leave the room and wait to see "The Host" again. How will they get there again? If you saw "The Guest" you can probably tell that we weren't even in the middle of the movie when the girl had been raped. I can't wait to wait. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, this movie was obviously an attempt to remake the whole classic "Lets Do Anything" video. It's clear from the outset that there is no real plot, the characters are just plain moronic, and the movie takes about two minutes to get the big idea (the idea, that's a plot) before we get to the "hint of action" in the story.  Then the movie started going on and on and, by the third time, everything was dead but it all seemed to be trying to get "hints of action".  The whole thing is so poorly written, and so badly directed, that it can't be the only problem with it. It starts out with some of the most ridiculous dialogue I have ever seen. What? When we have been watching this for years, you know that you have to go and see it and then watch the rest of the film just to make sure you're not listening to the bad dialog that you could possibly hear. It was so bad that I couldn't believe that this was the only movie that was worse. And I did NOT even care for the ending.  I give this film a '2', but if you liked it at all, I recommend you skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in Mexico with my husband and we watched it with our kids. In this movie a huge plot turns into a stupid attempt at a movie about a gangster with a missing body. I mean really a ridiculous plot. I can't imagine what a movie is like with this type of plot. They are just ignorant that this movie is going to be released. This is not like any movie I've seen. It's just plain bad. Some of the actors are cute and that was the best. But sadly the plot and the acting is stupid. The ending is awful. Why I thought this movie was interesting and it isn't just lame or bad, I just can't believe this movie will ever come out. This isn't even the best movie I have ever seen. I hope the original will have enough power to overcome this. This movie really sucks. I'm giving it two out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've ever seen. This movie is pathetic, a bunch of idiots. Not enough time is wasted in this film. They are obviously not talented at all and this must be considered the lowest-rated horror film in history, along with a mediocre remake of "The Dead"). It is a waste of time to waste your time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not worthy of the hype.  A bunch of college kids made a film about a big family of parents, and after some time in the studio, the result was a pile of crap. Some of the kids are very smart but this is not a movie that is worth watching. Don't watch. It just does not deliver. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bunch of people in China decided that China was the best place to shoot a movie. Unfortunately, there are so few really good films in China. When the film industry is in China, everything is bad. This is the reason I didn't even buy this one. The idea was to make a big hit with a really bad movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A low-budget movie with little depth. I guess "Roots" had some success when "American Dream" hit it big. However, the production had little direction, much less in a visual language. Even though the ending is very good, the lack of development could leave a little confusion in the narrative, particularly the end. In the beginning, the plot is not that surprising--as in most movies, it starts to develop and develop as the movie develops. But when the plot stops progressing, you are just a helpless little guy.  The movie is not a story of racism, especially not even though racism is a big theme in "American Dreams", and the movie is just about an old man trying to find his daughter. But the plot lacks any depth.  You really cannot see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst I've ever seen of a movie: a cheap, crappy, noirishly pretentious romantic comedy with no character motivation. No redeemable qualities, neither hilarious nor interesting or compelling, just mindless entertainment. I laughed my whole way through it. I think I can't understand how some of the actors managed to find time to act and then to act their scenes. They seemed to be completely oblivious to their surroundings and just seemed to want to be in a movie. They're just so awful, I can only laugh at the ridiculous and pathetic way this film made them, like that they needed to read a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never enjoyed watching a movie, but I can only watch movies with a sense of a plot. This is not the case with any of my favorites.  I can't even begin to guess how this movie is supposed to get to the end. There's some of the scenes that are so bizarre and pointless that it isn't worth a second.  The only time I can forgive it is when I'm watching the credits roll. And then, of course, the film's title is the name of some movie, I've never seen this movie. I mean, that's what this movie's supposed to be. It's a movie about a bunch of people, but that's all the same.  Well, after watching this movie, my only real surprise was that it didn't manage to hold my interest. It wasn't interesting, didn't even make me laugh.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie seems to me like a film made on a computer, directed by a group of people who don't know what to do with film making. It is full of clichés, no surprises, nothing interesting. The acting is not as good as the first "A Night on The Moon" movie which was actually an extremely sophisticated piece of movie making. The story is not interesting. There's nothing memorable. The movie is predictable. The characters aren't even memorable. I was looking for a movie about true romance, and I found it. It has none. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is an absolutely awful movie. The story is unbelievable, if you ask me. The movie is just so bad, but it somehow seems to be ok when it's an OK movie. I'm afraid to say that there is no logic behind this. It's just another way of saying to put me to sleep. Don't wait for the 2nd part to finish. Avoid this movie. It makes no sense at all. I can't believe that these people actually made this movie for money, they just put it on. It really is so bad. This movie is no better than any of the other "Picking-up-A-Movie" movies. This was the only thing I had watched and this was one of the worst movies I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a fan of American Horror films and I find this movie very disappointing to me. I have read some of these movies in the past and I've never been surprised to find the same level of amateurishness and stupidity in them. Even a decent actor, who was well in his role, could ruin the movie. It's obvious that there would be some interesting material to add to the movie, but the story lines and characters just don't add anything new or interesting to the film, and it just doesn't even make much sense. If you like horror films, you'll enjoy it if they're good, but this movie just sucks. Even if the acting is good, the storyline is weak and the dialog has nothing to recommend. If we're not one of the greatest horror producers in the world, then I'm not sure why there are people who are willing to be fooled and fooled that way. I give this movie a 1 out of 10, because I couldn't even watch it after the "movie" "experimentation" when I read the book. The fact that this movie is so bad is simply an excuse to be stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing like the "Staterkins" movies where the villain is a complete sociopath.  But then it is a perfect opportunity for the villain to do horrible things. The villain is very stupid, which leads to some very disturbing scenes in which he kills innocent people and rapes girls. He's really good at raping people, but what makes this movie even worse is that the protagonist is portrayed as a horrible serial killer. While the story is interesting enough for its part, the characters in the film are just boring and dumb. The story is obviously supposed to be a horror story but there's so little attention to it.  This film is a huge waste of time and money. I gave this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a completely lousy piece of work, it's so bad that you have to wonder whether to turn it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for five times - and at one point after watching it twice, I couldn't believe I was watching this crap. The acting is appalling, it's boring, it just doesn't go for long enough. This film is a rip-off of other films like this one:  I can't say it wasn't terribly bad, but it definitely was very weak.  If you're looking for a good movie: don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i think i picked the title for a good movie and it was bad i think it's boring if its only a short movie. I was expecting a "comedic" movie but in fact it is boring as hell. Its not even funny but the jokes are boring. I just hope i didn't get too caught up watching this movie. If you really want a funny movie: don't rent this movie and don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have seen, with no plot, direction, direction nor direction whatsoever.  The characters don't like to act, and they don't act like they're real people, except for the characters that are obviously their real people. It's like they didn't even want to act.  I wouldn't even have picked this film to see it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a writer of horror films I would recommend this film for the sake of shame for its dreadful performances and horrible acting. As a producer of horror film myself I find this film disappointing because the acting was so poor, and the sets were so terrible, that the film became quite bad. This film seems to be the film that a writer like William Strauss said he was writing before, when he had put in more effort than justifiable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really does not work. Even though it had been completely worth watching for its characters, the plot really doesn't add up to the show. When I heard the first time, I thought that the actors would be able to do something different. I've seen too many movies from "Brick" (and "Bolts") that make no matter what, even from a villain, or even a villain in a movie like this one, and it's not even that it makes sense. Not only is this movie pointless, but it also has nothing but bad in it's way to make me want to turn it off. I'm not one of those people who has seen every movie that has been released (that's about 50), and I just hope you will not waste your time watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bunch of guys from some other school (which we can call "school" in this case) are pretending to take down a group of terrorists that we need to rescue. They are called "Fukkah" in the beginning and throughout the movie. Some of the "fukkahs" are actually people from Fukkuhah Academy. The "Fuhkaah" are the guys that we rescue. I don't know. The main plot was cute but I think the idea of having terrorists that come to a Fukkaah academy was ill-conceived. The idea of "Fubkah"'s the other main plot point. I think this movie was bad because it didn't have as much screen time as we expected. The acting wasn't too bad though. But overall, if you are a fan of comedy or a genre film that requires very good directing (especially for comedic, there are no exceptions to that) then this movie is pretty bad. I would recommend against it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I could sum this up in a positive way I would give it a 10, I would make it a double- 10. I mean it would be an Oscar.  The movie itself is very bad and has a pretty scary face. This is not even the worst of what I can do with a movie that has some very famous actors. I'm pretty sure this is the movie that was made that has the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie. This could even have been a better movie if one of the characters was a big bad guy (maybe one of those famous actors, maybe the "The Brothers" movies).  The good part of this movie is the ending. I believe it ended with a big punch to the face of a villain. But that was the end.  This movie didn't deserve to be in the Top 10. It could have been another story, something like a love story or a story from a book or a movie: a reunion for his wife (some like a movie or a love song), a story with some drama, an ending with a happy ending.  It is a movie with a horrible ending. And to be sure I can't blame the director for that. This movie was so bad I can tell you it was so horrible it had to be put out because the movie is so bad, that it was allowed to be out. This was bad enough to make me want to stay away from the movie to watch it. I couldn't understand what made me want it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea that it was a documentary is silly, but then you have to add the "special" and then add the narration and the camera. There are some small moments that do not come out, but not enough to really make anything out of it.  The fact that it's about "The Last American" is also ridiculous. What happened to the rest of the characters? And then how did they know about the movie? That's not a documentary. I don't have the guts to add "the best and worst part of the movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a movie. There is no story. The movie is a collection of some of old cliches from the 1990s, that has no plot, no characters. Some very boring scenes, lots of sex and some scenes that are very predictable, like a few scenes with a man, a girl and a bunch of robots that are not really even connected to anything else in the movie (in the movie there is only a scene where a car is driving down a road) or some scenes where a guy is in a car on a highway, not really connected with anything. It seems that these scenes were put together in a rush to finish the movie. The only reason I will let this movie stand is because it is interesting. But it is a very bad movie to watch. I gave it a ten rating because it has some moments that make it interesting to watch, but this movie was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen many films in the past, some of them are better than this one.  But this one is one of the worst...the only films that I have ever seen. If you liked it you should see it somewhere else. You won't care if you ever see it again. If there is no one who liked this film you will get a very boring ride and a pathetic story for a lame comedy. It doesn't even have a story about the story of the movie, which tells the story from one perspective to another (with no dialogue) and a simple problem with the actors. If the movie had a good ending then it would be a great movie but it doesn't.  In the end it is very disappointing. If I had seen "Funny Girl" and "Poshikea", I would have done the same thing. It's just bad. If not, don't even look it and avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a total waste of good ideas, but the production of a movie is the most ridiculous job in the history of filmmaking, if you want to be embarrassed by some film making, then you don't want to waste the best job in Hollywood. So, I guess you could call this movie a waste of time... The movie is boring and bad. The plot is pretty good, and there are some nice surprises. But, what happens in the story? The plot takes several seconds after you have finished watching the film. When the movie is over, you see only a couple of minutes of action scenes and nothing else.  It's too bad that it was so badly made that it had to be put out at this level.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so terrible it cannot be considered a "film". It is so bad that it is laughable that it made it the basis of the Criticizing Criticize-Worst Film: The Film That Never Happened! What gives it away? The film does have a very interesting plot but that was only a few minutes worth of time. I could easily give this film a 1-1. It could be made at an American Film School. Why should this film be set in Mexico? Where is the film set? Why does it make the argument that the filmmakers should not be in the field of theater in the United States? Where do these producers get their line on? What does the film say that it doesn't set in the theater in Mexico or anywhere in the world? Why can't the film in Mexico be a "Mexican Film"? Why doesn't the actors do the work of supporting the actors that they're supposed to have done? They have been forced to make this film through a combination of editing a short movie and a staged piece. In what state does this film set and how do we know it was made? It doesn't have a scene that we could recognize as an original. It doesn;t have a story. The characters are so horrible that it had a pretentious title, a storyline with a fictional premise that seems to be so fabricated that I didn't believe it was real. I was shocked that the writers could make this ridiculous mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, despite being the best title of the series, has no storyline. This is why I am writing negative reviews about this bad movie. I am looking for a decent movie and I couldn't find one. There was some good acting and the movie had a lot of action but the story wasn't there much. The scenes that we got the most of were just boring, not even enough to add something to the movie, and we didn't get any new insights. The story was bad enough, but it was bad to begin with. There wasn't much to recommend apart from the idea of a killer and a mysterious killer. Not a good movie, really not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not the way that the real "Star Wars" movies were supposed to be. It's a bit confusing, so it just ends up making you feel as if you are watching a movie about space battles. The plot lines are confusing and there is nothing that is remotely original.  The cast is very weak, the action is weak, and the story lines are flat-out stupid.  A lot of the dialog in this movie just goes on with no real connection with anything important, so there is no real value.   Also, I think it is probably not even intended to be a comedy, if you find comedy in other movies, like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is some nice action but it is so badly executed. There is also some funny humor but no really funny. The film was horrible to watch but not the same funny. Although I enjoyed the first 3 parts, I thought that the final 2 parts were terrible. I don't want to have so much wasted money for a movie like this. I am sorry for the fact that this movie can't even be considered an effort for anyone but the production company. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was extremely predictable. The movie is no more exciting than a mediocre movie like this. What a movie could be better than this. It doesn't make even half of the story of this movie. If this movie was all that, then I would have to wonder if it was all the movies.  I watched it with my wife and we both felt that it was horrible, that it would not be able to make any good memories from it. The way it is put together is just wrong, not even remotely funny. The actors in the movie were just not able to act as well as any other actors. Some parts were a little bit amusing and funny while others were just plain terrible.  The ending is about 10 minutes too long, and the movie was about half of what I expected it to be. If your watching this movie, you are best off leaving it to the trash bin and throwing it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the opening scene shows, a family of college friends, on a trip to South Africa, is getting bored as they have a few hours ahead of the movie's release. But at some point, the actors decide to switch to a video game, and the story starts, like this one, where the parents take their children and start their game, as they get to the end of the game and then make some really awful things, such as throwing their daughter down a pit pit. I'm wondering if that was a movie or a movie was cut and made by a bunch of amateur animators? Well, I don't know either. I suppose it's a documentary film, but I don´t know why that is. If you want to see a movie for an excuse to play video games, then watch this one. Otherwise, don't see it. If we were all in for making movies like this, we'd all be dead. And, what a horrible piece of trash this movie is. I mean, the dialogue is stupid, the characters are stupid, there is hardly any story. You get the sense that this is about having a stupid teen sex scene, but it isn't that. If it were a documentary, it would be OK, but this just goes on and on like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I'm lucky, I can say that this film is one of the worst things I've ever seen. It is full of boring dialog, stupid scenes and awful writing. The director did this at all cost, even when I thought that it was funny. But the joke isn't funny enough to make me laugh. As for the actors, the director should have known that the actors were wooden and that they would never act like this garbage. The only reason I thought this film had even a bit of funny humor is because the director was obviously trying to do a comedy set at the beginning. The acting was terrible, and the film looked like it was going out of its way. The film would have been better if the writer had written a comedy short about how people act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am writing about a really bad movie. I don't know how it got made, and I didn't even go to see it because I donít like the story.  The ending makes no sense. I was expecting more from this movie.  And if the ending wasnít too weird or disturbing, it shouldnít have been.  I only saw it with one other person.  My own opinion is that the ending is not much worse than the movie itself, and it wasní not as bad as it is made. But there are some mistakes worth mentioning, as well as the movie being too slow and predictable to be truly frightening. It also contains a very annoying plot, which is one of the worst genres I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely no excuse for the late night set. As far as I can say, it is not worth an A+ grade film. However, it does manage to pull a couple of decent stars. However... the story is totally amateurish, even by the standards of the genre. What was the message behind the film? Did the movie have a message? If I were watching this film, I would have seen it differently. It doesn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a very hardcore fan of comedy, and my tastes are pretty consistent, so what happened to you when you got the cast on DVD? If not, what happened? What happened to your tastes? What does this cast have? I don't know. What does I care about the movie? What did it do? I just cannot believe this movie was even done. I thought this is the best comedy I ever saw, but the movie had a few flaws in the first 20 minutes. Maybe if they'd gotten together, there would have been some sort of comedic genius. But, you know, we don't get any sort of genius. I just don't believe this film had any real worth. I am pretty confident that the characters had some sorta magic that kept their sanity intact throughout the entire film. So, what makes them laugh? I think I might have just gotten a flat on a box, and was a little too old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I thought this was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it before, the actors are simply terrible, the director didn't seem to care about the story and the cinematography wasn't so good. The story is boring, and the plot is no better. The acting is also awful. There are a few scenes where some of the main characters are supposed to be "freezing off the grid". The scene where the characters are in the bunker is pretty scary, I had some serious flashbacks about it. The plot of the movie is only about 40 minutes, and it isn't even close to the finish. The film is really stupid, you won't even get a chance to look at the plot! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie, nothing better than a dumb movie made out of paper and pencils and a car driven down the road at speed. Well, I'd like to keep that statement and say it was the dumbest movie ever filmed in the history. This is probably the worst movie ever made, although this could have been the worst part of a movie made, since the director is one of the best directors of all time. The problem with this film is that it's not funny. The jokes are not even funny. I am not against people who like funny things, but this is the absolute worst comedy ever made. In fact, it makes no sense. The only real humor that came from this movie was the guy that was playing with the car. He would make jokes about how funny it was to drive around and be "normal" with the other car drivers. This movie is pathetic because the jokes were bad, and the director knew that. The movie was poorly made, and it was very poor, which is why I felt so bad when I watched it and saw it in the theater. I give it a two-star rating. But that's really low. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When the story of Richard III is finally revealed and this movie starts, it is not all that a horrible film. It is not the least bad movie that I have ever seen in my life. But when the story is over, it seems like the writer was thinking of things. The first attempt at making a film about Richard III begins with the appearance of Richard's brother, Richard III. When the writer finally arrives at the scene where Richard III appears at a party with a young boy named Matthew, his father is dead, but in another scene in the movie, Richard's sister is also dead. When Richard's father is finally shown in his grave, he has been killed, but his brother will soon be dead. As Richard's family find out the cause of Richard being killed, they find that he had left the family and started going out on a hunting trip. This is a terrible movie. It contains some of the worst foul language I have seen in Hollywood, the most obviously awful. The plot is so bad that it just does not have any redeeming qualities to save. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie, I don't know if it was for the new wave or not, it had some interesting ideas. But then I think I just watched it, and my brain exploded and I left. When I left, I felt I couldn't wait to leave because I didn't even understand what I was supposed to be watching. I felt like I had wasted a hour of my life and watched a film about a guy who had been on his own and was making movies only for his ego, not for the story itself. That's not even the plot. It was just an excuse to watch a movie. The acting wasn't even the most interesting, and the movie made me angry about having wasted an hour of an hour watching this. The plot of the movie was not even very good. The music wasn't that good either, it could be described as a big rock and music show only, but the script was lame, it didn't come off well. It made me feel like I was an idiot for not listening to my son. It had no plot. The movie wasn't like a horror film, and I felt sorry for not buying this movie. If you're going to watch it, just read a negative reviews about it:  This movie was so bad I didn:don't waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to watch a movie with two dead and living people, you'll be paying a fortune. I'm not one of those "wits" who make movies that leave them on the edge of life. For the most part, this was a pretty bad movie. If a movie had more depth than it did, it might be something worthy of some degree of recognition, but at least the actors weren't the actors that made this movie.  The other side of this movie is a good example of a bad film: if the story had a real story and real characters, it would be worthy of it's name. It is not, in any significant sense.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I heard that the remake of this film would be made, I decided to watch it on DVD to save my soul. But it was not very good. I can only hope to see that it will make a difference with my new knowledge of the world. Not only that, but I decided that this is the worst remake I have ever seen. The acting was terrible. The story was terrible; the story wasn't even interesting; the storyline didn't develop, the scenes were lousy and the dialog was terrible, the cinematography was bad, the direction was terrible and the sound was terrible! I can guarantee nothing about this movie has gotten me to see it. And yet I am willing to see this movie again, even as a DVD! A bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the UK on DVD on the local video rental rack for about 5 minutes straight. It was boring, and was horribly uneven. I think this movie is an attempt to recreate "The Naked Edge", but it just doesn't work. They are basically trying to recreate the film in some semblance. I'm sure they did this in the original "The Road", but that was far easier because they used a very different set of actors and settings. There are a lot of scenes that don't even come together at all. It's so bad that it could be a documentary but it doesn't really work. I don't know if they ever had to plan to shoot it like this.  I'm not sure how they were even able to get into a movie with this lousy special effects. I guess it was either going to be made like this in a few weeks or they just got into the habit of using actors that weren't actually in The Road and making a movie using some of the actors who were actually in the real world (although they obviously weren't in The Naked Edge). The only real effect of the movie is that the "fembs" are shown on their regular TV screens. I didn't really like the scene when the car was flying into the sky. The car flew around and after a moment it suddenly disappeared, leaving the two people. If I'd had more time to spend watching the movie I would have found it interesting and might have done a bit more in the car and possibly would have been better. I have no faith whatsoever in the director either of the film. I was looking for a movie about British cars and was hoping to see some action, but unfortunately I just couldn't find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll never watch this movie and I will never have it in my mind. The title is a pathetic excuse to a bad comedy. I'm a big fan of comedians and I can see nothing that would take a joke seriously that would have made it any funnier. But this is the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. The plot is very contrived and predictable and the characters are weak. The funny ones seem to have some pretty good comedic skills. But they just can't play their parts and I just don't believe they want to make the film any better. I'll be looking for "The Last Stand" movie instead of this. The only reason I can make this film is the story. But the plot is bad enough that it just isn't interesting to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first "Fantastic Four" movie I have ever seen since "The Manta Trilogy", except for some brief cameo appearances in "Superfancy" and "The Chronicles of Hope". The film didn't get much better. The story is pretty stupid.  The plot is very predictable and very predictable. It had a little bit of fun with some of the scenes, but it just wasn't fun.  Some of the characters, like the rest of the film, are pretty good. But there are some terrible ones.  I'm afraid that people who are more familiar with "Fants" could have a harder time finding it. It is too hard to find this film in any of the DVD stores. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was horrible. It was horrible to watch. I thought it would be another film that would get me into a repeat viewing. But I didn't. I'm tired of seeing movies like this. It just isn't that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen several movies with actors who should be in better roles, and I have always wondered why this was the only one. It had the worst dialog, the worst acting that I've ever seen in my life, the lowest acting I've never seen. I watched this at the library, I didn't see it for over two hours, and it made me sick, sick, and then the only thing that made me angry was the acting. There's no way that this movie could have been made at all. They are so incredibly stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I could see the scene in the movie where the two men were looking for their partner to begin their wedding ceremony but instead they just want to do it yourself! I must have had some sort of memory disorder...  If the two women were in one scene and the man was in another one, what would be the time for them to do the wedding ceremony? Who knows. The idea that is made up for these kinds of scenes is absolutely pathetic.  I can't tell you what they were thinking when they made this film. I would give anything that they have just done this sort of film is better than the life that they would have put into your life for it. The only redeeming attribute that I have is the fact that this movie has a decent number of interesting plot elements, I've seen plenty of movies with very little plot or dialog. I thought they got into the story in one episode but then they decided to stop filming, and then they just cut some of the scenes off.  For the sake of further comparison. If the movie had the scene where the man and woman are in bed and he was on the beach when he and the woman are sitting there waiting for her to begin planning his wedding ceremony when she is ready to get married. The scene in that episode where they were kissing, which I thought was the scene that they used to set up their wedding, that was all done for that scene. But the woman was in the room after that scene finished. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just found out the video "Meseeks" after seeing it at a video store. What a bunch of hicks! The first episode seemed pretty good - it was a cute movie about a school girl who works at a school and meets the big cheesey nerd girl. Unfortunately it didn't go as smoothly as it should have. The second episode was also very silly - the girl has a girlfriend (I can't remember where she is), she gets bullied and gets fired by the principal. What the heck?! How many times can you go out in the neighborhood and do babysets? The third episode was the most ridiculous and ridiculous. The movie had a completely unrealistic plot - one of the best characters in the whole world is one of two guys who doesn't use a phone, one of his neighbors is a carpenter and another guy has a goat. How did we get to meet these people? How did the guy get a phone? I guess you can ask about a lot of things, but I'll try to save you some of the details. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I arrived at the set and the scene of the scene I watched was where an Italian guy (the guy who was playing the main character in the movie) started yelling, yelling and throwing his cigarette out. I was surprised to see that the guy was one of the'stars' that is mentioned in the film.  There's one funny scene in the scene where a cop (from the movie and the series) looks like a man, but only has a human face.  The acting of the main actors is so bad that they can't even act the way they used in the original movie. The other actors did a good job in the beginning of the film but later on were completely out of control. The scenes of the movie were totally predictable.  All in all it's really a bad sequel, but it was pretty funny at least. Maybe the guy got away with a ridiculous plot.   My rating: 2/2 - this is a bad waste of the entertainment from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just stumbled through this movie thinking it would be a good movie. Unfortunately it is not. Well, I say, it isn't. It's one dimensional and just the worst part of this movie. The plot is really bad and nothing happens to make it any good. The acting is awful. It was like watching two movies and you only got two minutes of the dialog from one of them.  This movie is so bad that you just need to get rid of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about an aging college student who decides to follow his teenage crush into a life of being a cop. But there's also something about this story which really doesn't add up. I was really hoping that the teen would come to a conclusion and that they would get to know each other more. But this movie is so bad, it really doesn`t make an ending. The idea of an old man to become a cop is pretty ridiculous to me. How does this supposed to work? How is this supposed 2-on-3 story to build a life? Why can we just see them in a classroom? How can we get so involved in this? It really just doesn`T make sense. The acting is bad, the plot is bad. The plot and the story just do not seem like they make sense at all. It really wasn`s hard to find out anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really annoyed. I was bored out of every movie I saw in this movie, although I'm not the only person on earth who would have been annoyed by it. This movie just is an awful movie.  I tried watching it on the DVD (this one is only the second part of the movie, and the rest of the film is only made to look like a DVD), but I couldn't make it look anything resembling anything. I had to watch it twice, and I was pretty sure that I would have enjoyed it but I just couldn't.  The story is about a teenager who has fallen in the water after being chased by the other members of his family in a hospital. They have brought him back to where they're holding him and they bring him into a house of their friends and they try to put him into this hospital where it's really scary and they're also trying to get him into their gang. This is so bad. Why do they have to bring him to the hospital? We have seen all of the doctors and staff in the hospital... if they had the right equipment, they would have put him in the back and saved him from the drowning situation. Why is he in the Hospital instead of them? Is it only when he's brought in and they want him to be in the same environment where everyone else is. Why isn't he treated as he was supposed to? They put him on a stretcher to save him from drowning and I'm sure they were afraid to do that. And then they put him back on the stretcher. They thought he had been in the car, and that was a good way for them to save the car. Well, that's what they do. They want to go and investigate this situation because he was in the wreck, and there isn't a chance for him to make it up in their minds anyway. I have no idea why. How did he get into this car at the hospital and rescue himself out of the car without even telling them. Why didn't they just see him in a car and tell them to not look for him at all? It was a really disturbing thing to hear those guys talking in the cars talking to each other. I don't think anyone on this planet knew what was going to happen at that hospital. I felt so bad they wanted to investigate it, and this guy had been brought there on accident and could have done something more than just helping the kid out. They've been there
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Tremis" is not even remotely credible in the case of the movie: it's a pretense that all the scenes have been filmed using some sort of photoreal photography. This is so shallow as it comes from someone who can't even read or write. That means, for example, that the story was invented by a very naive producer (who just plays her scenes backwards). At the same time, it's really quite dumb. The characters are so dumb that they are almost never shown in their natural form. Some actors, like the one that is in the movie (Flynn) are supposed to be convincing, but are not so convincing. I am just saying that it's not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing movie I've seen since I had to watch a movie: I don't want to waste my time and have wasted a half-hour of my time watching "Loser" because the movie itself is a complete daff. It is obvious that a lot of people in the movie got bored, and as a result, I had no idea what I had been missing. The acting is painfully amateur and the plot was completely without any real knowledge. Most of the scenes were completely senseless and there was no development at all. The ending of the movie is just so bad it makes you want to punch your girlfriend in the face. The fact that you have to wait until the episode is over is infuriating because the actors were so good and you never know how long the movie will be. I have never heard such a bad ending before.  It also has been completely pointless to anything.  If you have any sense of humor, this movie is the worst of your life. If you're not one of the most annoying people in your life, you might try to watch this movie. It isn't fun at all and it's got to be hard to sit through. This movie is too bad to watch because it's so bad that I couldn't even tell how it was bad until I got it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has very predictable ending. The two lead actors are the annoying characters that are a bunch of guys who have no self-respect. Some of the dialog is just too dry and tautological to be written, and other actors have no chemistry. I just decided to watch it on a DVD and leave it on the DVD rack. It's about as entertaining as a car wash. The only good thing I can say is the casting, and this is just the most pathetic actors that I've ever seen. There's only 1 movie that I have ever seen that has done this kind of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not a pleasant way to watch a movie that I have to watch more than once. I guess the only way out of watching this movie is to pray to God that it will make up to me. The main plot is absolutely ridiculous and extremely meaningless (see "The Secret Mission" or anything else in this movie: no spoilers here! I'd give this movie a 10 if it was funny). It isn't. There's some really bizarre scenes, and some stupid moments, but there is some good action and some great lines. Some of the scenes are pretty good, but a lot of the acting isn't there either, and this film is just a "skippered" movie without any real purpose. The only good thing I can say about this movie (the opening) is that it contains a very good performance from one of the actors (as the woman who takes over the movie), and in spite of its utter lack of purpose I believe this movie was worth watching but not worth your time. The script was pretty good and was funny, but I didn't have any expectations. The plot was pretty bad, but nothing for a "movie" about a movie: there are plenty of bad things out there, and movies aren't necessarily very good. This film is about as bad as that "Secret Mission". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife, at age 9, would not take this movie lightly. She was already a very mature person, and I just made her laugh like hell. I felt terribly sorry that I wasted some time watching it. It wasn't funny at all. I'd even call it 'punch-glorified.' The acting was awful. The script was an appalling waste of time. I have to admit I was so sickened, I felt like the entire movie had been done in.  But what a pity it was. I couldn't have afforded to see this movie. Even if the film is good, I don't see why you'd spend your time watching this. You'd be bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You've seen it so many times, it's no wonder the producers put this as a movie, and you know that it's not a movie. But this movie is no movie, or even a real movie. It's a movie with little, hardly meaningful story and very old, but that's not the problem with it. Even the worst of the characters, from the writer, Michael Rapkin, to the actors, don't come off as actors. Some of the actors are so bad that you just think they don't even exist. But, I guess the people that made this were simply too experienced. They must have made it all on one little movie. The end of the movie is the movie that was supposed to be the funniest. It just does not make a good impression in my eyes. You can still laugh at the actors but you're left wanting to go see the rest of it on video. Not only that. The only reason to see it is to see the movie itself. The story was badly written and the direction and the cinematography was terrible.  I'm sure the actors were good. But the story was bad. Not even the script writer/director/writer had a creative mind. The film isn't funny, it isn't amusing. There are so many wasted minutes of film, and while you enjoy reading the movie, you have to do nothing but sit through it and try to look at it like an idiot. But I guess you'll find it boring anyway. The best thing that happened to me was seeing the movie's end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and dialogue of this movie were lame and they were completely predictable. It has the feeling of a movie from the late seventies and it could have been a really interesting movie with some of the original characters. Unfortunately the script was completely un-voiced and the characters were just too predictable. The director should have made this movie to some sort of parody of the late 1980's sitcom or something like, like, "The Bobbue(s)". The acting was OK, the camera was good but the direction was weak and the plot was not even close to "The One True Thing" like it could be.  A movie that requires no special skills to create a successful film and that has very poor actors should not be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad even if you can get the DVD edition of the movie. What happened? The director, who is a nice guy, decided to make an action movie about it.  Well, not really, I've seen a lot of action movies, but not like that. It's not interesting. There is no story, the only thing you can think is "Oh, I'm going to be a cop". The action scenes are just one minute long, like a scene in a hospital, which happens to be the actual hospital. There are few scenes with good special effects, but they are just a few minutes long. This is the only movie that is "good" in the movie industry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason why I was able to make it work out of this film was to be bored. I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 rating (though it deserved it). And my wife, who is pretty easily distracted, couldn't quite get the jokes out. In spite of that, I still got to laugh pretty badly. The film could've been more fun with a few more actors. Perhaps I would have had to wait for some parts, but then I would've wasted an hour with a mediocre film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing i noticed when watching this movie was the incredibly boring acting, the extremely annoying and uninspiring acting. Then i discovered the fact that the actors were in the same movie as the video in the first part and it was almost impossible for me to understand what they looked like and how they sounded like. So, when the movie is finally released, i am going to watch the video that they made, and i will have some open questions for myself. Please note that i would like to be one of the few people who said this movie is the worst movie in the history of English cinema. I mean, if you're an English film director, you're supposed to make movies that were entertaining. However, when it is done, you need to leave the whole business. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a very impatient filmmaker. In my youth I had an urge to be able to "escape" my old high school into the dark side of the force, the dark heart, the only thing that can bring me to write and tell stories. I watched this at the Film Club when my friend (I remember the first movie I ever saw) played the role of "I'm not sure what they are trying to say" and I was disappointed. The movie is based on some of the most terrible movie ever made, namely the infamous "My Dreamland", which was a movie for two people. I didn't really want to see it at all, and I have absolutely no faith in these filmmakers.  In conclusion, this movie is horrible, because it doesn't have any real plot, storyline, a direction, a real message, anything that makes it any worthwhile at all. Even though the ending has the promise of a plot, it is still horrible and without any real reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible. The acting was pathetic and the plot was poor. The ending, however, was nice, so if you have one of those kind of movies then you might be glad for it. Unfortunately, it is just the result of bad writing and bad acting, making it a total waste of money. If this is the only movie I have seen, I would watch the whole thing and then get on with my life. If you have a brain then you'll be wondering if anyone has written a good movie or something. The story of the guy being a big star is so bad that it's not even funny. The plot of the rockstar is just not funny. What was the plot? You will never know. The characters were OK, but the writing was bad and the ending didn't make you laugh. The movie stars some actors who are not even worth to have in the movie. The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack, which was OK, not the horrible thing it was. If I were a movie producer, I wouldn't even make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the same as every other dumb horror movie of the 1990s. The plot, lead actor, and acting are all bad. The story of "The Bride" is painfully silly. The actors (Ludegley and Ragenour) are pathetic. The fact that it's only a 15 minute movie and even less time is a pretty good example of a bad horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most painful piece of trash I've ever seen. I watched it at a movie theatre just for fun and then moved it to "I don't watch this movie". I think that after I saw it I just wanted to destroy it. In terms of a film, this is absolutely horrible. The acting was horrible. This movie just shows every single bone of the actor's body and that is simply not the case for the rest of the cast. The only good thing in this movie was the soundtrack, which was quite good. But I doubt it helped. If you have a sense of humor and appreciate a movie, don't waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie follows the standard cliché, which of course it can't overcome. However, it can have some funny moments if you're a diehard fan of the film and it does. However the movie just isn't funny. It's predictable, like so many dumb movies and comedies, you get to know the characters from the same predictable plot and you get just a depressing and depressing ending.  Just don't watch this movie, there are better alternatives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was not even good - or enjoyable - except for the fact that the first few minutes of the film are so bad that the entire film was depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on TV at the local library and was so disappointed. The acting was absolutely terrible, and the acting was ridiculous. The idea of doing a sex scene, in the middle of a movie about a sex-themed movie is ridiculous. Even a "movie with a sex theme" couldn't have that much of an effect. The movie was a bit more interesting after its original airing, but it got lost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so bored to watch this one at times it is hard to care and see a show on TV that was so bad that I couldn't tell if they had gotten to a decent level. To be fair the show had been going on for years and I'd almost forgotten about it until I read the book cover. To start with, the acting was mediocre, the directing was terrible, the sets were lousy and the sets of the characters were so poor that I didn't really know what they looked like at all. In the ending I didn`t really believe it was going to be as disappointing as it was. I was expecting to find a comedy-like show where the actors would get some real acting talent to bring the story together and to make a movie that would be a winner. But that didn`T appear. The acting was bad. And the dialog was so dull. I didn´t understand why there was so many actors playing the characters. The scene when I first heard of it was pretty funny but I could only guess why so many people would jump off and leave it to wait until the next episode. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My rating is "1 out of 10".  A really awful movie in which all of the actors seemed to want to play for a few seconds. They are not even in the movie itself. The acting is completely terrible. I was very surprised to find that the people that I knew in the first few minutes that seemed to act like people in a real movie were actually in a bad, low budget movie. I just couldn't believe they could act in a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Not good. The only good thing is that the story was interesting. But the plot was bad. It lacked depth. The plot was so predictable that it was almost predictable. The characters felt like they weren't real people. The story was so contrived that it just made the audience wonder if they were actors or actors, and then it seemed like they were acting. The movie felt like a movie made by a group of drunk teenage pranksters. And in fact the young actors were acting like drunken teenagers.   No, really. The film is a horrible waste of time. I'd rather watch something else than this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a really bad movie and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was extremely disappointed with it. The film was totally over dramatic. The storyline did not move forward in an interesting way. The characters were very weak. In a way I think it was a bad move on a low budget film. I would recommend using a cheaper copy of the film as a stand for low budget films. I wish I had the opportunity to use this film in the beginning of my school as a comedy but I did not. I have not seen this movie anywhere else, and I have tried so many times to use it but I am stuck with it only now. It is really disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is an effort to cash out on the "F" trend by showing off that famous movie "Fist for The Party" from the 70s. There are no way it really works. The first movie was a bit of a mish-mashed mess, but this one was far worse. It is no wonder that people are calling this movie "fist for the sake of a bunch of actors who don't have much to do as it appears, as it contains nothing except for a few plot lines. This movie is so bad it has to be called "FIST FOR THE PARTY" or something more stupid, as the movie tries to build some sort of political power, not to mention a story. I'm a real person, and this movie is pretty bad, if you really want to spend money on an actor playing a character like Fist for THE PARTIES.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the opening sequence, I felt like I'd be sucked in. There is little character development and a lot of annoying scenes. It's not that great if you like comic books or have any knowledge of literature or anything else. I've seen some pretty bad movies, but this one is not one of the worst. While there is a lot to enjoy in the end, the lack of a plot and character development is just the tip of the iceberg. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointment.  What am I getting from this film? An excuse to let the worst movies into the mainstream. The story is one that we can see no one can do but watch.  I was hoping for the action to be more visceral and exciting but they really lost me. The actors were so horrible it wasn't funny.   I also didn't enjoy the directing or the photography. The action sequences and special effects were not impressive.  The cinematography was horrible. The plot was lame and I didn't find any real significance.  This was not the first time a director made a bad film. I don't know why I'd give this movie any respect. A good film would have put some value into it and I'm afraid I'm going to lose it because I just can't wait. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not good at all but a movie with very bad acting and a bad plot. A few parts, like the "Battleyba" episode, were pretty good. But if they were allowed to use the whole thing, they would have done worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen any film with so many missteps, like this one. It contains some bizarre scenes that make it seem like a real movie (like, "The Outland"), but there's nothing interesting about it, and in fact, nothing interesting to watch. What is so bizarre about this film? I guess, I'm the type of person who gets angry whenever I see a movie where I don't have any clue whatsoever. Anyway, I'd recommend it to the worst person: the guy who actually does this, the guy whose job was at a university and has no clue whatsoever as to what he was doing in the movie, the person who was the film's director. I'd really like to see a more complete version of this movie, although I don`t understand why this was ever made. It is just a depressing waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not much good. In this movie: A major plot problem is the movie is so shallow, the characters are not funny. If you want to see a funny funny film like The Last Breath for example:  But this film doesn't do that.  And I don't really want to watch The Last Eye for it's original story. If I do this film I would probably just go into a blissful little sleep and see it in the daylight. But I don�t want to sleep then to see an atrocious movie.   I'm sure I could just go to a movie: it's an interesting one. But it doesn't like this one.  I am very disappointed that it got some attention. It doesn't seem to be in a bad way, but I think it should not have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just like the movie I saw the first time I watched it. It's too long, too little, too boring. I won't say why it isn't better. I would like to see a movie with more action, some more interesting characters, something more exciting than the previous 2, but it is bad to watch it. If it were the other way, I would love to see this movie. But this is no one but a bad one. I wish you would take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, you may be tempted to say that it was one of the worst, worst, most terrible movies I have ever seen, and that is the case in every movie ever. But I think that if you really see it, you'll find yourself completely amazed at the fact that you can say it in your worst movie ever, and you will then wonder how I had to write a negative rating. This movie is the most painful and stupid movie I have seen in my life, and is possibly the worst comedy I have to see.  If you have been in a movie theater watching it, I highly recommend not doing anything that you would see anywhere near the movies of this movie.  But if you do watch it, don't even care for a plot and its characters. If you watch this movie, you will be bored, and will most likely lose your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I have really enjoyed "The Secret History" since the second installment, but the next time we rented it was the one that started it. I watched it on the big screen with only a few dim red lights. The plot was very poor. I could see nothing more than the naked body of a male naked man. There is nothing in this movie that will make me laugh. Also, I was afraid to see it, but it had so much sex and nudity, and the guy was really really awful. He seemed to be like a teenager. How was it that he was still able to have a girlfriend while being naked?  Also, for some reason they used a lot of nudity to make this look like an action movie or a porn set, and it came out looking like an adult movie. The only reason this movie was even released was because they got a lot less money when the sequel came out. When I rented it, the owner (who, at the same time, was the casting director for the movie) got a call from one of the producers asking him to use some nudity to film the scene with the naked man in the bathtub. I was in a little hurry to rent it because I could tell that they were not planning to release it.  I rented the other episode and that was much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a complete waste of time...all the dialogs are utter garbage...no actors who can act. And I'm not even the slightest bit sorry for this because it is fun in most spots...no one in this movie gets out alive...noone alive...  What a plot? It's the kind of plot you could never watch. The dialogue was really bad, the only good thing were the scenes. In fact it's not quite the way to make the movie fun, because there was a little bit of romance that it added a bit of color, but it's just a big waste of effort, especially for the big girl...which is never a part of the movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of talent this film is. I don't care if it's a bad, but there are so many boring scenes and bad scenes that it doesn't matter if the characters were good. That is a problem. And the last scene was even worse. There is no reason to watch this movie. It just shows you how bad the people who made this film are. And there is no message to message to this movie, it just shows how bad you are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to out-act and out-lie with the "The Legend of Batman" theme - which has always been the worst part of the DC Universe, despite the fact that the character's resemblance to Batman is unmistakable. The acting is mostly pretty bad, but it does manage to score some points. The story has some very good performances (as the comic book heroes do), but the movie is bad in several respects. As I said, the story lacks depth and it lacks the much more obvious theme of a Superman movie - the moral purpose, and the idea of saving the people who are suffering from "evil", which has not been explored as much as it has been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think they must have thought that the ending of the movie is a movie with some action. I guess they missed the fun. There were a lot of jokes and the storyline was completely stupid. It's just not very good. I'll admit that the dialog is really good, but I have noticed that they have taken out a lot more humor than I expected.    Well, I think this movie is bad for many reasons. The story was really boring and didn't fit the other characters. I'm sure some people are going to like it but I don't. I didn't like the ending, as it was too predictable and there were only a couple of scenes that were interesting. I also think the ending was very predictable because of the fact that it is a very slow pace. For example, I could guess the exact ending from the beginning of the video. It is better when you are watching a movie in one of the regular theaters, as the actors and the action sequences all fit the plot better.  But, the movie had some interesting ideas and a good storyline.  I'll give it a 10 out of ten without a spoiler. The ending was OK, but the beginning was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "This Is a Bizarre Movie:  The following is a pretty bad movie, but there are some redeemable scenes. I just found it on video store, I liked it, but it just isn't good enough, I don't like it. I'm not going to be insulted by this, because this is the kind of movie that is a lot better than the crappy slasher genre which makes the big explosions and explosions without the action (although the explosions in this movie are pretty well done). The bad-looking girl was the "beautiful" version of a girl whose husband has stolen her clothes, is now in a relationship with the person in charge of the prison, and they are having some fun together. There is no scene or sequence where the "hero" and the "villain" meet. This is like a movie with a bunch of people playing in an empty warehouse with a box, and the box gets stomped by another guy. When the box is smashed, the guy has been knocked unconscious, and there is screaming, screaming, and screaming, not a sound you would like. The best part of the movie is that the two guys are trying to fight each other, while another guy stands holding a big wooden stick that looks like a wooden stick with wooden teeth. The movie is so much like a bunch who get their first shot at a movie and then get disappointed after watching them get their second shot at it. The fact that you can die at a horror movie that I've seen just makes me want to hurl my mouse through the window and run out my eyes.  I gave this movie 7/10. I thought it was a dumb movie and I thought that the ending was horrible, but at least I didn't mind the gore. The story is really terrible, but I don; 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just a repeat of some of the previous "Wins" and it's pretty bad. This movie was directed by one of the worst big-screen filmmakers EVER and it is not worth a second of your time. The plot is horrible and the acting is terrible. The dialog, script and direction are poor. It is not that I'm looking for an action-thriller and "action-adventure" with some depth to it, but that's what you expect it to be. The cinematography is awful. And the ending is terrible, too. The story of the "wins" is just not there. A story about a girl who was kidnapped and raped by some gangster and being tortured for years and then being killed by the police is just a waste of time.  It has some of that great dialog, but it doesn't have much of anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was bad, but I thought the good ones were better. I thought I could really appreciate the quality in it. But this show got so stupid. It was boring, and even a good actor like Robert Stigler (which he wasn't even great) couldn't save this show from getting ridiculous. I mean, this show is the same as the other shows I've seen, except for Stiglug. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just rented this film just to watch it in America (I think it was in New Jersey) and then sat down to watch the film on HBO after I got a DVD copy. The story of this movie is horrible to me. How did he get the idea to write this crap? He had a couple of friends, obviously some of his friends are some friends who are very well-known in the neighborhood, one of whom is a huge star in some Hollywood movies, another is a famous comedian and the third is a very famous singer. So he was just some very disgruntled guys that got drunk at night, and decided to get his girlfriend drunk in a rented lot in the town near where his buddy lived and he decided to film himself drunk on his girlfriend's motorcycle. When they finally arrived in the scene, they were attacked and beaten up with some drunk thugs. He then decided to make his girlfriend into a blindfolded virgin and rape her while raping her. Then later he murdered the victim. When he finally released his girlfriend, he was on his way home with a couple bags of cocaine and was arrested by the cops. He was also arrested by police in Santa Clara, California on drug and alcohol crimes. He has a tattoo that reads "SORTA. HE WANTS TO KILL", and I have to say, that's not an accurate word, because it describes the murder of his girlfriend. I've never heard of a more boring or boring movie of his. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many good things in this film: i'll be the first person to admit i haven't watched the film at all, but i think i would have liked it more. But the plot wasn't great. i don't remember what happened with the 'evil guy' - i think he made up his own body and a new body... but it still didn't go to that. i guess the 'wonders' were just a bunch of aliens who used their bodies to do some weird things to get revenge... i'm afraid there would have been a lot of casualties. the ending was horrible, the ending being that the "heroes" got to find a cure and kill the 'villains' so they could find that cure and use it. the film has really nothing interesting to watch. The story is so bad it isn't even funny. In fact i just wish I could see a movie where people who have the powers that make the 'heroes' in this movie were better... and better had to do something that has been done before in a movie... i don\'d like to see more movies with funny and interesting topics, but this one is horrible. There were a couple of scenes that were funny, but it's not worth watching. The fact that it made no sense... i thought i'd be really surprised if someone was going to make a sequel with this plot. It's so bad to watch a film with so many terrible plot elements. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not only terrible because of its disappointing ending. The premise is that the killer (Kane) kills one person so that the other person remains alive. It's extremely ridiculous in a way, but the premise itself is very predictable. If this movie were a documentary and it was about a documentary, it would be extremely good. There would be some serious analysis on the viewer to determine the meaning of every moment. The lack of dramatic tension and the story could have made this movie even better. There is nothing that can make this movie interesting. The acting and the acting are bad, and the ending is terrible, it's just not satisfying. It just doesn't feel like it's trying to be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was about a young girl who (as is anyone who has any sympathy for a human being) could not be herself. It is not like the usual teen film.  I have never seen this type of film before and I don't know what would happen if it were released in 1993. The acting is bad. In fact, it is so bad that I was wondering whether I could even talk to someone who made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little bit of hope for a film, which sadly is not present here, and one of the worst films of 2013-2014, as well as the worst film of 2014, I have never been so sorry to see.  If you have any interest in the genre of horror or cinema then I would like to see the film, I've seen it on several occasions before. Unfortunately, this is a film which is simply nothing but a very boring, extremely bad movie, with a lot of boring action, nothing to see and nothing to act. Very little fun, no real plot and no story. It just takes place on a shelf and does not even have a beginning.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not seen any of my friends get this film, not even at the local video store. It's not funny, it's bad, but it is funny. I thought, if I read about a movie that was funny and I saw it, it wouldn't make me laugh. Even the most stupid and sarcastic person would laugh. But I laughed at the other side of this movie, not at the end of the movie. It is painful to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had to be a lot worse than the film "Waking the Dragon" if the actors made the slightest bit of effort.  The plot is nothing but boring, and the characters are poorly drawn, and just about as boring as the "dragon", which was so well made from one perspective that it was almost predictable. I guess I'll stick around the first one since I know it will not be as bad as the movie "Wakening the Dragon", but perhaps I'll watch it twice so that it does not get me to see the worst part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to say that I have never seen a movie that was so bad I was ashamed to see it. But it does make a few points worth highlighting. First of all, as you can tell from the title, this movie is about a dog that is very, very stupid. In this case it was the dog that was supposed to be stupid. As for the actors, there is only one. The dog's behavior and behavior was pathetic in every aspect, including, unfortunately, the fact that the actor wasn't cast for a role of dog. It was an un-spacious little dog. Even the camera was so far off camera that the camera had to be positioned so low to the ground. I would have liked to have seen better performance from it.  The acting was about as bad as it comes with big movies, and while some actors, it wasn't bad at all. But if I had to say anything about this movie I would say that it was about so bad that a film would have been made about it. I don't think that this movie would have made anything. At least it didn't make me go into another one of my dreams of my old lady, and didn't have to be one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is basically stupid.  What does a movie like this do?  Well, you have to remember it's about a couple of guys who get into a movie and decide to pick up the girl who is supposedly the "star" and, in order to get the movie to finish, they take a big gamble.  There are five or so sets of characters, and I have seen this one or two. Each one plays a different character, and what makes one a better or worse person is not that of the actor, but that of their "actors", which then goes back to the script of the movie, the characters are simply incompetent, the story is one of those classic movies that are just a lot of lies that a film could have made and this one doesn't.  The movie goes to waste my time because it is so weak. If you watch the movie you'll be disappointed, if you like "The Ring" you'll enjoy it but it's not the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie ever made in my opinion. The plot is pretty ridiculous. I mean this movie was pretty good, but it wasn't quite so good.  Also I felt very disappointed by the ending.  I didn't feel like watching it. But it was pretty disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. If you are going to watch this movie in your life you can expect to pay for it. It contains a lot of bad acting, stupid dialogue, and bad plot. I'm not 100% sure why it was made. I can't even find the original book for it was pretty good. There is a lot going on in this movie and the director had no idea what he was doing. It is pretty bad for kids. The premise is unbelievable. I know when I read the book it is scary but not as scary as this movie. Also I'm wondering why they gave a lot more money and an hour extra to make it. How did it get on TV? Well, I guess you can watch the movie on cable. I do think there is a reason for the extra hour that is. The only thing that saves the movie is that it's a kid's movie. I think if you're going to see this movie then you might like to watch it on the cable channel instead of making yourself go mad! There is nothing else that could make it a better than this movie.... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see this movie, do not. The first one of many instances in this film where a poor film gets made by a talented filmmaker, with no more than an understanding of how to make it worthwhile. The next one comes out, as a cheap, pointless, predictable film. The movie doesn't deliver any good scenes, the dialog isn't engaging, the script is just a waste of time, and the characters are poorly developed.  This is probably the only film that has "made a positive impression" in a given time of its life, and this is probably one of the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's nothing wrong with the premise. We don't know anything for the actors except for the one who does a cameo for this movie. The director is very unentertained in terms of his movie's action. But that's OK for a movie with a big name and very good cast (Brynne Ramsay) as the lead. But why is this movie so low budget?   The ending was awful. The ending that was written for this film was absolutely pathetic. The film was way too slow and too slow moving. And the ending just kept playing as bad as it was in the first 20 minutes. The actors did very little in their part and there was no believable connection with these characters. The plot was not as interesting, the dialogue wasn't convincing. The acting was extremely bad and the idea of a movie wasn't very convincing.  The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 was because I don't see anything in the rest of the world that this movie was capable of doing better than.   If you want to see a better movie, I recommend watching the first 10 minutes of this movie: It's not like that other movies did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a classic example of the "B" standard, the film industry's answer to film making and cinema in general, that takes a lot of "B", which is all the worst films we've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the story is lame, the characters are just plain bad, the camera work is bad, and the idea of film making is totally incoherent.   So, as I watched this film, I thought that the plot was good, the idea was interesting, and I was really happy to see the actor play his parts. But, unfortunately, it didn't hold me. I was disappointed that this was a movie I would've chosen to see.  This was only because the film didn't follow all the lines and rules of film production.  I thought it was stupid and bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is really about a person who's drunk on their couch and does a really terrible job. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad, the plot is weak, the ending is terrible. I like to think of myself as a simple man who loves to take care of things and to help out the world but I couldn't bring myself to this movie. The only thing I did was laugh.  I will admit I didn't like it. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The first one was a fun one but this one doesn't even fit. I didn`T enjoy anything I saw but I was sure I was going to like it, but it wasn`T worth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The scene in the early scenes is a pretty cliché, and they might have thought it was funny when it came out in 1998, but it really wasn't.  A lot of things in this movie were very dumb. It's easy to forget that there are two people who are trapped in a remote area, and then there is just about 3 minutes after the people, everyone, and the local villagers are on the road.  This movie had very little value. What happened is that the person that made the movie is an alcoholic with a penchant for drinking and drinking. That isn't worth playing.  The characters don't seem like real people, but they can't blame the writer for not making it that realistic. They should have at least showed that these people are normal, like a normal family.  I'm thinking of watching "The Way" without using this one. The plot of this movie was good but not that much better than the plot in The Way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this film, my friends went to sleep, and after going into another movie I decided to watch another one. I don't have the time to watch it, but I'd like to see something more.  The plot was terrible. I won't even admit it. The film was so bad I felt nauseated after every five minutes. I felt like I was dying. The acting was terrible, the film was terrible (I felt like my skin would stick to the camera lens). I felt the director had no time for directing. I didn't have time to enjoy anything I watched. I feel like I wasted my money watching this movie and I don´t recommend seeing it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen a movie that has ruined a movie like this. It is simply a bad, unfunny film based on a stupid premise and no story. The plot is weak. They tried to bring a character who has a bad history of bad things (an ex-CIA agent), but what makes it worse is that they had to find it. There are a few interesting things about the characters in this movie that just don't make much sense. The script and acting are bad, the camera is terrible, it doesn't have any real sense, everything is just stupid and bad.  The plot of this movie is about two guys that are stuck together and decide to stay together (the 'friends', as always, of course) with a guy who thinks that he can cure whatever happened (with no medical expertise). But his stupid wife (the protagonist of the film) gets pregnant and is forced to get pregnant for him (or at least) so that her husband doesn't get the cure for the 'bad guy', because he thinks that she's infected. It has no real relevance whatsoever, I can't imagine how they could do such a thing in this way.  In the end, the film gets so bad that it starts to take place entirely in a room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the movie was shot in a sloane camera in the dark. In this film there were scenes of a black man in a gas station. This man was obviously not dressed for his face. It was apparent from the camera that the lighting had a very dark effect. The scene which seemed to be the one where the black man was wearing a hood is only about 1 and 1/2 percent light. This is not an unusual problem in this movie but it really made it look like a black guy dressed in a hood. Not a good movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad because it's an action movie that doesn't use any real people to make fun of. It's an example of how bad movies can get on in Hollywood (and we're not used to that). I won't take these details from the movies because I want to sit in the theater and see myself. The acting is bad. The special effects are bad. This movie had a very disappointing ending. The villain was just plain annoying and unappealing.  The movie could have been a lot more entertaining if they would have used real people instead of just talking about the real people. The plot was pretty good, but I don't know how they can think they're in the movies anyway. They just need to stop making movies about how you can change it to get a little better. I don;t give them enough money so they will never learn how to make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely bad. I mean bad in every way. The first 2 minutes of this movie are bad. The characters have no personality. The dialogue isn't interesting. And most of the movie was just a bunch of actors pretending to be characters in a movie. The only thing I can tell you is that a lot of the actors are very annoying. I just can't say that they're good actors and I don't want to waste any more time to watch them. If you're a fan of acting, don't see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was so bad to watch, but I can see why. I can't figure out why it got released. I just don't know. I'm just curious why there was so much drama and so much pretentiousness in it. I am hoping that it will get out of the way as soon as it was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thing about this movie is that a group of women (or at least one of them) has taken control of the local police force, and with it, they can take any action they want.  When this show was released, it was deemed as a "Wackfest", as it's so, but the acting was incredibly bad. The plot wasn't made for the sake of the show, it wasn't funny at all. The main villain was played by an old woman who has been a resident of the neighborhood for a few years, a person who has nothing but money and a complete lack of emotions to be anything except an idiot. The whole movie revolves around a bunch of old women who think she will be the villain and she's going to get into the arms of some person who could actually be a villain (because she has done so much evil).  The plot is very bad, but that doesn't matter much. The movie is mainly about a bunch who are all old ladies. That's a pretty standard plot for a "wackfest" movie. The characters are, in fact, not very convincing and the film isn't much funny, but since they're old ladies and are trying to steal their neighbors. The only good part of the movie is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what we feared would happen. The first film, I remember was "The Legend of Rambo" with Tim Cabe, and the sequel, "The Castle", featuring a very annoying Michael D'Angelo. It's OK to admit that D' Angelo and Tim C. were actors, but they should not have been a screenwriter. If a writer doesn't get the creative talent necessary to write a good movie, then he can't be an editor or a writer. They can't just dictate to a film how to shoot the script and what characters are supposed to look like. It was just obvious that it wasn't trying to do anything right. The plot was a complete mess, the dialog was terrible, and I just couldn't care how well you can get into it. The acting was terrible. The story and the plot were pathetic. I don't have to give the spoilers, but I can say that it's not the first film made in history that has these sort of problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bitter" is a pretty terrible movie that takes the concept of "famine" to the extreme. It's about a starving gang of cannibals. They want to get their victim so that their prey can be fed. But they just can't eat and eat. For whatever reason, they just keep on biting. There's also the part where the cannibally eaters eat the human meat, so that they have to eat their victims. This is just plain stupid. The whole idea of this movie is to see how these cannibal canniballies can eat their prey. But there are too many things in this movie that are just stupid, but I was really bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an odd one-dimensional attempt at an art comedy with zero effort, which only a few people noticed (i thought most of them would be so). It can't be all that bad as it could be if the acting was as good as the writing, or the movie could have been a masterpiece. I am baffled to say that so many people who were so interested in it actually believed that this was about an art-cute (and now it is) of stupidity. A few of them even seemed to take the film with a grain of salt and a grain from the very beginning.  I was quite surprised that this movie is not a bad film. It is not funny enough to laugh all the way out of a comedy movie: I really thought they would have gone a lot of crazy lengths to get something this dumb. And I do think the movie was bad-ass, as it did not bring much energy. The writing is very bad and the movie, though very entertaining in its own way, seems like a typical action-movie spoof. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe how this made it to the top. Its an absolute waste of entertainment.  The original was a great fun movie, but the sequels were terrible. The first is bad. the second is just a waste of money. The third is too much too much. The movie is completely ridiculous. the acting is bad, and the plot is unbelievable. The ending is really bad. The best part is the original ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that after viewing this film I was really bored with the plot. The movie seems to have a plot, and that is the problem. The premise really does not end up with anyone.  It turns out that the guy who is a giant robot (and that has never been seen on TV) has found out that other robotic creatures are going to take over and "treat" the city, which was supposedly the only reason the movie was made. The whole thing just seems to take an increasingly long time, and it all just seems like the end of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The fact that I've seen it, and have never considered a movie with this rating, is a complete piece of crap.  There are only two people who made this movie, and they weren't even close to the story, which I think could have been much more interesting.  The director also has no idea what he wants to do with this film.  Also, I have seen worse movies than this one.  I know how these movies are supposed to be made: they use clichés and dialogue, so you get an impression that you don't care about any of the characters in this film, and all you really care about is the ending.  In the end, the movie takes a total of 30 minutes to finish, and it doesn't give you much. It's not enough to make you care or anything, really. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this bad, horribly predictable, movie, you are forced to see the beginning of the film to see how much this girl is like the other guy. It is just like a film made in about a few weeks, with no background, no dialogue, and no plot. What's it is? A girl who's going to marry a man who has only one arm and one hand. One hand can be used for everything, and the other hand is completely useless. What a pity.  The movie is about how she loses her virginity by the man who raped her, and she just doesn't go there until the man threatens her. The plot finally resolves, and he is able to seduce her after his marriage. It just turns out that she is a virgin, and her virginity is not the reason for his marriage, as she only married him in the first place.  I think the real reason this movie is so terrible is that it is so bad that it doesn't even try to make an attempt to be funny. It only shows how bad it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has one serious flaw (the fact that it doesn't come out in "The Wizard of Oz" or any other version), and that is the lack of a story. As far as I am aware, there's nothing more ridiculous about this sort of film, and it lacks the traditional story-line, which is the most important part of an adaptation. The movie is nothing but an attempt to exploit the old story of the original film in the form of the film that I will call "The Lost Tribe". It doesn't have any message of a message. All that was required to make this film was to rework it. When it does, it lacks. The film itself tries to be original, but is very old, is very predictable, and simply a pile of words. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just got released, and I decided to watch it because of the good action that was in the first "The Expendables" film. But since The Expendables 2 is so terrible, I couldn't take it in. The action scenes were poor, it's too crowded and the story was a bit stupid.  This is the reason why it doesn't really do any good. It's too predictable, it got its name from the first film, and the characters aren't as funny as The Expendants.  If you have to see it at all, just watch it in a parking lot, and you won't regret it.  The best thing about this movie: The fact that it was made in 1996, when there are no computers anymore, is a huge mistake. Even the actors got some extra lines, and they were good enough.  But the acting wasn't as good as the first. There's some real talent in this movie, and if you liked the first one, you will love this sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You would expect a thriller thriller with a plot to be a plot that would have made the best sense out of the film itself. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen. Even when it's a plot, it doesn't really help the overall plot.  The plot is very similar to the previous "Red Water Bridge" film, which was a very clever idea, but the plot is simply nonexistent and the storyline isn't even that interesting. The plot and character development are completely absent, leaving you with a vague ending.   The movie isn't really bad, but, if it did get an award, it would be a very poor honor for the movie. It's just boring and boring and extremely bad to watch it. I don't even recommend this at all because I've seen better movies. I do admit that it's pretty good that this was a film, but to be so bad could be a truly terrible movie, but that is just a bad way to do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "My Life in a Film: A Journey into the Madness of Silence" is really just a disaster from a very mediocre director. For example, the film features a guy who has killed a bunch of people on a yacht, and turns around and gives a whole 'climax' about it, even though the movie does not have a great ending. The film includes some very weird and confusing scenes. They seem so incredibly stupid in it, and they obviously had to make that point by creating a really lame story. The acting in this movie is really bad, not just in the story but also the camera. Some scenes are unbelievable, and most of the characters are extremely stupid (such as a 'crazy' woman) and there's absolutely no chemistry between them and their characters. A very minor plot line is the part that is 'the only character who kills'. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. The only interesting part is the scenes of a guy that comes across the island where the killer is.  The ending is about a small cabin in the middle of a jungle. The killer comes to it and decides to pick a woman to kill the other guy. If the woman gets on his ship and kills him, then we're talking about some sort of a couple. The two people from the cabin look in the cabin at around the same time, and that woman is the girl. They both sit in a hotel, and the man is dead. If he's dead, then they're both dead. Why? Is that supposed to happen?  What's really bizarre? This is simply a case of 'just trying a movie'. It's like the plot was written for a 'feature' or something, and it is just horrible. If you're looking for something interesting, you'll like this one. Unfortunately, it's bad and not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was only decent if you thought it would get to the top, but it didn't. After watching this movie, you can't imagine what they were doing in that movie. The acting was bad, the dialog was bad. There wasn't any suspense. The storyline was lame. The actors were completely uninteresting, the movie had no real storyline. It was just a series of scenes that had nothing but the end for which there could have been some excitement or suspense. That's the main reason for my rating: the fact that it was a big budget made me even more depressed than the budget made it worth watching. I had no expectations at all for this movie. I didn't even watch this movie at the local theater, but I just wanted to throw it on my shelf and watch the credits. For those of us that prefer the more polished and more professional American production (and I'm pretty good at that) this movie was absolutely useless. I wish I could have seen this film the first time it was made. It got pulled from my hands. I'd like to see it again, but unfortunately I don't think I'll ever see it in my lifetime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie, as well as its ending, is extremely bad.  I'd be tempted to say that I was surprised that such a terrible film exists, considering the quality of the material.  There is absolutely nothing in this movie worth mentioning. All of the actors in it are either pathetic, or their characters are pretty good, so bad they have to make an effort to make their own movie. This is not the movie for your dreams. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just don't understand this idea of making a comedy that's a little bit like a joke... A comedy, yes, but it's no joke! And this one is awful...The only reason why I'd go see this film is that I think it's funny and the plot is funny. I've heard several friends say they didn't like it because they felt it was boring, and while I'm not a comedian, I admit that I'm a bit bored by some of the scenes.  Oh...I guess the scene where the car falls off is interesting and funny, but that's all I'll really care about. That's the only thing that makes this movie an awful comedy. There's really nothing funny about this film. The fact that it's a comedy is just an excuse for making some movies that are completely out of place and just aimless and pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some pretty good dialog but most of the rest is a bumble-buddy hackney. The ending is just not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really excited to see this movie and was expecting it to be good, but unfortunately it didn't. It's so bad it's almost impossible to believe, and it is really painful to watch it. I know it isn't as funny as it seems, but it does have some humor. If you're a casual fan of The 'Strayer' and have a lot of patience you'll like it, but if you're not, it just really sucks. The acting is terrible, the script is awful, the whole movie is a waste of time. It doesn't deserve to be an Oscar nominee, and if you decide to see it, you will never see anything like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got involved with this movie, even though my expectations for it were that this would be a fun film. I am really stupid not seeing it, even after seeing the trailers I couldn't care more than to waste my time watching it. The ending to the story seemed to drag it out at an almost impossible degree and was actually very disappointing. I can't explain why. But it is an incredibly cheap movie with no real plot, no good characters, no real cast, no storyline, and no convincing ending. The best place for it would be on TV. This movie is a complete waste of your time. I'd like to recommend a better movie: "Gagon!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest movie of the 1990s, with very little to recommend. I cannot imagine any reason to put it on. The plot, which has been so thoroughly covered, is obviously very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am so ashamed of this movie and so embarrassed that I sat there watching this at the beginning of the last year because it got so much worse than I had anticipated. What were the producers thinking when they chose to make this? I'm surprised that someone so under-paid and unconnected from the real-world could take that plunge to make an attempt to make a "real" documentary? The best possible explanation would be that they thought to make something so incredibly dumb, that the producers thought to present it as a "documentary" so that it would be OK to watch it. And that's OK to make sure that the viewers do not forget this film (as they surely did with the "Real" series, "Real Life in American Dreams: The Real Life of a Man and the Real Life a Man) so that they could then turn it into a movie in the vein of "Made in America: A Man With A Mind." But, then, they made the movie as another, "Made-in-America: Real Life: Real Marriage," which was somehow supposed to be the real movie, but only became an advertisement to their own film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe that this was the movie that I expected from this movie. When you get into the "thrill and spice" part of the story, you have to expect the movie to be one of the worst movies ever made. It was the opposite. And I didn't like it at all. What really did the "Thrill and Spice" story. I was expecting to get a story of a "thristand spice" guy, and I got that story with the "bitter"-bitter-straw-mouth-guy who goes to prison in order to make a couple of girls--the two sisters. The movie was basically a big fat little guy, who does a couple "Thirst" moments, and his female partner--that big fat girlfriend--just doesn't want to talk about it. The way they met was just too predictable. The two sisters, were in love with each other, and the two sisters didn't know the other. The other was a sex-cater person. And that's about when the "cater" guy's sister falls in love.  And that is when the story goes completely downhill. They got to the "kisses" part, and we get two new characters that are totally overworked and not in a way to do anything in life. This movie does not add much to the story--one is a big bitter bitter bitch and his sister, and one is a sex biter who has a big secret about how she is going to try to get the best girl of her dad's life. And the fact that they didn't really get the "Bitter" part is a major hole in this movie that needs to be filled with a much better story. There are a few moments that were good and they are good. But it's not too much to be just "Biter and Spice". If you didn't care for the movie, you really didn't get much of an interesting or satisfying movie.   This movie was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete piece of garbage and very badly filmed, but there are a few very interesting scenes and I thought these scenes made good sense. They are really just silly-set-up (for example, there are two female nurses in a hospital), but the rest of the film is simply a pretense of some sort of plot. It's unclear why they want the killer to be killed and then used as bait. The whole film looks like a parody of The Wizard of Oz and the Three Kings' finale, but the latter are pretty good. Maybe that's why I went so quickly and gave this movie an 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete failure. The idea of this movie is just plain stupid. The ending just is horrible. And not to mention the fact that this movie was bad in the first place, but it's not just one of those terrible movies in that category. It's got to be like a nightmare or a nightmare of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the whole show just to laugh at the crap this movie was. I knew from the beginning that I was going to be watching a dumb comedy, but I didn't have to wait to get a full laugh. The show lacked the magic to it's main character. It didn't really get a clear message as to how the real world works in a real setting. What was funny was the ending was the main theme. The plot lacked a real ending.  The ending is nothing to see and is obviously not interesting. This movie was just plain dumb. In the end you just laughed and watched it. You wanted to see it disappear as quickly as it could be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was no good. When I heard about it I thought it was a really funny, but then it was awful. I didn't even like what the storyline was. I don't have a sense of humor anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As always, the worst "blockbusters" of the year.  The problem with this film is that it doesn't really work, which is what you might expect. It's just a bunch of dumb, stupid, trash-on-landers who are trying to get a good laugh.  And if you want to get more laugh, you have to wait for the sequel to happen, which doesn't even come with a cast in place.  I hope I didn't waste my time on this movie. You really need a lot of time in your life to sit through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointment.  The acting in this movie was terrible. It was only the director that saved this movie. The script seemed to be written in another language and that is not a good thing. We just weren't given enough time to develop the characters. The acting is pretty bad. The story seemed to drag on with the characters that were not developed. We could tell that it is a typical Hollywood movie, but that isn't necessarily the case.  There is this really irritating annoying idea that if a movie is a 'traditional Hollywood film', then it must always be based on some sort of existing reality.  This movie has the wrong kind of realism. For example, the characters in this one can't tell the real world as it really is. This is why they are such a bad film: they are so obviously not based on something that exists in the real life. That is the way that the world works, this is not how they should do it.  I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two questions that I keep hearing about this movie. I first heard that this movie was a "B" movie and "A" movie, but I've seen it twice and you can easily see that there are two movies. One is a comedy, and another is a horror movie. If you really wanted to see a movie that would be "B", it would be like the film "Killer CX". That's all there is. The only reason to watch it is because it was released in "B". The plot, plot, and plot development was terrible and the acting was bad. The movie is overrated. Some good actors, but the rest of the movie was awful. The characters were too weak to do anything that they wanted to do. The acting wasn't even good enough to be shown. The story and the ending weren't good enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. In fact, it's the worst thing that I have seen in all of my life, and I haven't even been the biggest movie buff in the world. It's a really cheap knock off movie. If you're looking for a cheap thrill that you can rent and then get back to again, I would recommend you NOT rent this movie, because it's horrible and stupid. I rented it because it was well-known and had a fairly good rating. Unfortunately, I had to spend much of my time looking at the cover of it, wondering why it was so terrible.  If you have any sense of decency, I recommend watching this movie only if you have to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how one of these guys made this film. Maybe a friend, maybe a friend or something like a friend of yours, or some of my parents or one of our friends. I'd like to hear more than one word.  They obviously do not know what the hell they are going for. I know from the name and the title that this is a movie, but the only thing i really cared about in this film was the fact that it's a porn. If they can make a porn movie, then this is it. I didn't care that I was watching something that was so stupid and full of lies. I donn't care about that crap at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a typical low budget movie that had some pretty good actors and a good story. But, at the end of the movie, the story is really stupid. A little girl gets to pick up a new baby and then spends several days and nights sleeping with her husband while she tries to convince him to have sex with her. And then she discovers that she really has a big appetite and wants to eat some food. And, when she finally eats some food, her little girl eats some pizza instead of having sex.  The other part of the film is a little girl that has her husband's little sister on top of a bed and she wants to put him in the bed. This is really lame, because there are some pretty decent scenes that are not just the girl's little brother but also the girl on top. And even worse, the ending is the saddest part of this movie. If you don't like sex in such movies, you don`t really want to watch it anyway. I thought they should have cut that part out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had enjoyed the early films I'd like to see it again, but what was left? What is it that I just can't bring myself to it anymore. I mean, I'm not sure if it's really about the little girls who have been rescued (a bit) by some old lady and are now forced to leave their "normal" life to work with these guys. There's nothing here but a couple of weak female protagonists, none with a personality that seems to be as shallow as their previous characters. I find the lack of action very disturbing and I have not seen this movie in many years so I can't help but feel that I've seen too many of them. In all I could say this is a really bad attempt at trying to appeal to "society". I found it to be a shame because it seems that all the other films in this genre were about more of a "socity" thing than the "jag-a-man" type of movies. I think that it doesn't matter if you find yourself in the mood of a certain type of person, but if you want to make your own, you'd be better with the typical film, which usually doesn't have a problem. In any case, I recommend this one to avoid. I have a hard time watching anything resembling this, and I'd be glad if someone else with my interests would take the time to watch it, but unfortunately that doesn't happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it does not suck at all. There are some very funny and amusing scenes, but the only thing that doesn't seem to be funny is the script.  The movie is basically made as an excuse to go out and buy a bunch of cheap films that we might not understand a lot of about the world in the world. Some of the lines or parts of the movie were just plain silly and I can't blame the director for making it. This is why I had to look at the IMDb ratings to see whether I was amused or offended by it.  Also, I really didn't find the movie particularly funny or funny, but I did enjoy it. But there's not much to laugh about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I've seen made that I've ever seen that I can see in this very long time. The story isn't about a great love story - this movie is about a girl who gets into a relationship with a bad guy with a lot of money. The plot is totally lame and this movie has been made so many times worse in my mind than I can tell it. The acting is also so bad that it seems as if this movie was made in the 1920s. The characters were terrible. There are no redeeming traits or characters that make this movie worth one minute of my time. This movie is one of the worst movies I've had, and I'm not sure if it will ever recover. But it does have some redeem qualities. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major plot line: Adam is a big cop and comes to see the new chief of police, Peter Sarvigar, who is so dumb. Peter can't see why Peter is so smart because Adam has never had a brain transplant. Adam goes into a house to steal a video camera and shoot Peter, who, apparently, is an FBI investigator, and he gets the camera back, but when Peter is the victim he wants Peter to try to shoot him. Adam wants Peter's brain transplant surgery to succeed and it doesn't, causing Adam to become insane.  Adam is obviously bored and bored. Adam does something very stupid with Adam. He wants to kill Peter and Peter kills Adam and then wants Peter and Adam to kill each other, but Adam is so weak that he is never a threat.  The plot is so stupid that the cops just watch Adam's death and then continue killing their victims.  A good ending for the movie was the revelation that Peter's body was located in a bad house on the day of Adam's demise.   It is a shame that this film does not deserve an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So far, I'd like to give this movie 1/2 stars but I think this is the biggest mess in film. It is slow, annoying, and worse for the fact that it can't really have anything to do with characters who were, in fact, very good in the first film. The first film had a great plot, even though the characters in the second were badly handled. The second film is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen such pathetic acting and a bad performance this film had. I mean, even though the actors were nice and they were good, this movie was totally overrated. In some respects it was worse than "The Lord of The Rings", if you think the actors deserved more than half of the film. I believe that the acting was better than the performance of the Lord of the Rings because it was so unrealistic. I know it's been made in many movies but it's hard to think that such a movie will ever be even remotely believable.  I think it's more likely that the producers just wanted money than anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A documentary of all the stupid shit i have ever seen in the cinema! If you get a chance to see this film, you will lose your mind, and will become more sick than a pregnant girl... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of this film, but it wasn't right for me. I'm not a movie fanatic. I like some kind of films that I think are more interesting than these movies. Unfortunately this isn't one of those. Even if the actors were good I wouldn't have any interest in this movie. I can't even begin to describe a bad scene: a couple of kids who were drunk, and then had their car towed down to a stop where they crashed. They just kept saying they had to get in the car and drive it home because it was their parents driving it. That's really upsetting to me. There was also a couple more scenes of drunk, lying, making love with their girlfriends and then getting into some sort of bed with the guys. This film has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I did enjoy "Jelly" though. This movie was completely predictable and didn't provide much of the plot that usually happens in a movie. There are some nice scenes but no depth. For example, the scene when they are all drunk and talking around is the most pointless scene. I think there would be a lot more interesting scenes in that scene because of some of their characters in it.  If you want to see this movie, you can see it on a DVD with some music. It's not worth paying for. It sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed out loud as the title is supposed. The "cure" is just the biggest insult in the history of film making. It's just a big fat ugly fat baldhead with a mustache and a mustache, and it is so painful to watch him make jokes at any level. I mean, if I was the director, I would of course make a parody of the "cures" in order to prove that they were actually jokes made at the right time and the right place. This movie was the complete opposite, though. It has so much to do with nothing. I am not going to give this movie four out of 10 but four out the other. I would give it four out one but one is the only thing to give it 10 out of 100. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film contains a weak plot, which becomes almost tiresably predictable.  In fact, this is the only film I would recommend skipping out to see. It is only for those who would like to see it for the fun of a fluff.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so horrible, it is so sad, that I just can't stand that this film will be made. The first 30 minutes of this movie, I felt like it was a complete mess of a movie. You can't imagine why people will even find this movie. There's some actors that are really good and some that aren't. There isn't much plot. That means there is no story to speak of and the characters are just the typical clichés.  The movie is really awful. I didn't see that even when I watched it because I didn`T care about the film. You need to watch the video to know it.  If I had some advice for this movie I would say to find a good movie and save yourself some time. You don't spend much time viewing this movie but you get a lot of mileage from it. It is so bad, I'm sure it is meant to be made by some guy named "Dirk" and not by Kirk. The script is terrible and nothing else. It isn't worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, I felt like I was watching the last 30 minutes of a serial. There's nothing worth watching.  The plot is very basic. But the acting was bad, the dialog was bad and the story was very weak. It's just like the first one, so not good at all. Even though I felt bad about it, I kept watching. The ending was better than the beginning of the movie.  I'm sure the original version was a better version than this version. But if you're looking for something to do with kids, this movie is not for you. I give it 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i can't believe that this movie is so low to write. In truth the only reason i have ever seen this movie was because i was bored...that was the only excuse i needed to see this film. This movie was literally a waste of my time. It is pathetic. I give this movie 1/2 out of 10 because i had so much fun in this one and nothing else really can make me laugh. I am a mother of 2 boys and I find that this bad movie is not appropriate for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can find the title, it is not a pleasant one. If you are a viewer who is bored by a bad TV show and does not enjoy a good movie, you'll see this. It's bad in a number of ways. You've seen it before and, at first, you think you'll get bored with it. But, the truth is:  You'll never really enjoy watching this garbage and you will regret you wasted your time on it.  This film is a typical, low budget, hackneyed, pseudo documentary. In other words, it's just a bunch of empty pictures, crass, and some boring dialogue. In what I've seen so far, this movie is nothing compared to some of the other, better films of this genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a very predictable, predictable and predictable. It lacked the magic of some early films from the 1960's that made the classic formula. If you had to sit through it, you would just go mad. The acting was awful, and the acting was bad, too.  If you are a die-hiding fan of James Dean and his escapace, you'll love this movie, but don't waste your time on it.  I had a really hard time figuring out who this director is. The movie is about a killer who has a gun and hates death, but it's not really about the killer. It's about a guy who wants to kill someone, but is turned into a serial killer.  The director's use of the term "Bershell" seems like a very stupid name, but the filmmakers clearly knew what that was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like being a car dealer. There is no escape from it, no escape, nothing happens, only a bunch of drunk guys. There are three guys who drive a Porsche around for no reason. They spend their lives on the road, and then have to drive the Porsche around the corner. They get mad. They have a really good time. I guess I don't know if the audience is involved. This is one of those dumb movies. There really should have been a much better plot, but instead of having a story to work on, it is just a bunch or people. I'm looking for something that has substance, but it just doesn't have it. There's a lot of people in it. It's bad to say this movie doesn't even seem to even be in your mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is basically a pile of bad things, with a good movie about a good boy, which the director thought would be a great movie. But the movie turned out to be a very bad movie, with the following mistakes being made.  1. The girl in the movie is just a few minutes late for her. She is only 10 minutes late so she can get her message across. 2. The man in the film is just the right age. 3. The way that the movie shows his brother, who is very, very wealthy and who is more wealthy than him, has only made the slightest cameo in the background.  The reason why the director did such a terrible movie is that this is a film directed by a bunch of famous names, which only means a lot of other movies. 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a pile of crap. I mean, come on, just take this one for an example. A few days ago when I was a kid and would watch this on "The Family", I couldn't believe it was even a movie. It had only a one or two brief minutes of footage from the very beginning.  I was really interested in watching this movie, and I ended up spending two hours watching this in a night with my younger brother, so why do I waste time with this garbage? I've had enough problems in life to see my son's college graduation, and this is no different. I could barely even get a look at the movie, much less make eye contact at the beginning of the film, and my older brother's little brother was too late in the middle of the movie to start filming his brother's college class. This movie made no sense at all. I wish the producers had some sense of humor in their movie, it seemed to me that this movie was very ridiculous and pointless. If it were just a simple story, then maybe I could laugh, but sadly they chose to do anything else. If you are a fan of a good movie, you'll love this one, but you really need a laugh as the ending. There is one reason that this film was made, and that's the fact that it had a sequel. They had a reason for the sequel and this one has one too many and it has failed to make that connection, which is what I think is the only reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely horrible, if you've ever heard the word "bad" in a movie: I mean, really bad. The writing was terrible, the acting was bad, the plot was horrible, it had no redeeming feature.  Even the ending, which was good in a few parts, was ruined.  This isn't an easy film to take and see, as it's been done, for years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The fact that this movie is directed by a few people and directed by one person who apparently have never shown any special skills is truly embarrassing. The story begins at a few locations in the desert that, because of that fact, must have some sort of mystical and spiritual significance. But this is just a very meaningless story and nothing has occurred that we would know. Not even the characters have ever seen before. The ending is nothing more than some sorta meaningless tragedy. I believe the writer of the book for which the movie is based should never have written that story.  The whole movie consists of about three or four scenes, which can only consist of one or two characters, that involve some incomprehensible and possibly embarrassing situations. But that is the most painful and upsetting part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not expecting a brilliant performance in this movie. While the "B" scenes were good, this movie is awful. I think the original B was better. I just don't have much faith in this director. I'll admit I was looking forward to "The Best Show of 1993". After seeing it, I just didn't care.  If you want to see a movie that pretends to be a piece of true art, take "B". Avoid this movie like the plague.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty vague, which is OK, I guess. The characters are bland, the actors, mostly pretty good. But the movie is bad for several reasons, most of which are simply unhelpful. Firstly the plot. I have never understood anything about the plot except this one. The main character, David Arden, is completely unconcorded in the fact that he can tell you that his brother is a millionaire. He wants to find out how David is, and he is unable to explain the details of his family. Why? Is he so deeply entrenched in his family? He can't even tell us anything about his brother. It's just a simple matter to decide what happens to him. The movie goes on and on, but that's it. Second, I'm thinking the characters are stupid. I mean, the story is pretty good, but it just seems weak. It doesn't really work. In fact I can't quite see anyone. That's why we have to wonder how they came up for something so convoluted. And as for the characters themselves, they don't seem to have anything to do with one another. They just want to be rich, but they're not so good at what they do for themselves. It just seems like they're in some sort of trouble somehow. Third, it just doesn't seem like the time to be really convincing, either. The camera is a bit boring. And the plot is dull. And in fact I'd have liked to have seen more than half of it. But I suppose you can always guess which scenes you will see in the movie. So maybe it's just the beginning and end. I think that's because they couldn't figure out the details for themselves because they don`t have the imagination that comes from the genius of Kubrick. Maybe someone like Kubrick could do it better than they did. It would have been good if they put more time and effort into the story and less time and money than they spent on the whole thing.   Also I didn`t understand anything that I read the first time, because I've never read anything by Kubrick. The reason I'm not really bothered by his film is the fact they don'n't seem as involved as he does. It is the standard of the genre, and that's something that I know is not accurate. I want to try more. I've had good and original Sci-Fi horror movies, but this isn`t one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a big fan of the new Spider-Man films, and so when I heard that one would be in the same genre, I was very curious to see this one. The story is weak, the characters are poorly written and the special effects are awful. It has just a few minutes of plot development and then you just find out about a huge alien named Venom. This movie is about all of the horrible things Venom has done since he made it (he's been responsible for pretty much everything). A very disappointing sequel to the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical late 1980's exploitation of the genre of exploitation. There was some fun but nothing special for a big budget, but not much good either. It was very hard to make the point with so little acting and a very bad plot. I didn't have any faith in anyone but Adam Sandler as the director. He was supposed to do something more than an amateur sleutless exploitation piece but didn't do anything like that. It doesn't have much better material to recommend to the audiences of this film: the story was interesting but the dialogue was weak and the characters were extremely thin. The only good thing I saw in the movie was the sex scene. Unfortunately, it doesn't get much good in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Buckets" is a bad film with an obvious low budget to support, a bad plot, and a bad script. However, the actors have a good chemistry and the movie is well made, but unfortunately it's all about the boring "Bits" and their lives that doesn't really relate to the rest of the movie. I'm glad that this movie is not in the "Big Buck" franchise, but a bad sequel like "Big Bucks" can't compare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie: I have seen it 2 or 3 times and every time I see it I cringe. Even after seeing the beginning and the end of it I still can't get over this garbage. A typical "B" movie. I don't know what to think of the guy in the front. I've never seen anyone look like he. I guess he's really not. I thought he was cute but not like the guy was in "The Man With The Face". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not really sure why there are people who are trying to make this movie and make a movie about "Fugitive and Abductees" for this reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of this film is based on a very poor plot. The main character is a man who murders all his enemies and is trying to win the favor of the good guy. But in the movie, the two characters are not even related anymore. The man, who wants to be his best friend, is a sort of 'brother', but the guy is actually a 'father'.  And if the two of them are related, why would the "brother" be interested in killing his enemies? Of course, we've seen some movies that are similar to this, but I'm not sure why they get the same rating, because if the 'brother' is the 'father', then, obviously, the'son' would also want to kill his enemies.  But the plot is very simplistic. The 'brother'/son of the main character in this film was "brother to his brother".  That means that the characters in the film are supposed to be related, but there is only one character in the main that is connected with the main characters. The other main character, meanwhile, is unrelated to the "buddy" or the main protagonist. The plot is not developed enough to even begin to develop.  This film isn't even worth watching, unless it will make you laugh. But I am afraid, if you are interested, I would go for it if I got it. The only positive thing I can say is that it is interesting. But if you didn't care for it, then don't waste your time, you might as well do something more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Lights" is basically a piece of trash that is nothing but a cheap excuse to waste millions of dollars and produce something that nobody has ever seen in a movie theater. If I hadn't heard about it, I'd have been expecting something much more intriguing. Alas, the lack of the "jolly, good, strong and handsome" script does not make the film much more interesting.  The film follows a bunch of people who are being treated at a private hospital (as we see in the credits) and have no sense of security whatsoever.  Some of the characters are as insuccessive as it is supposed to be, especially the girl who is supposed be having sexual problems and has her boyfriend who is a psychopath who kills everyone he sees.  At the beginning of the film, this film starts to be good. Then everything goes really crazy. Some of these characters are really stupid. We've seen them killed off.  They have their lives destroyed.  After the film is done I can only conclude that there is no point. For it's sake I recommend avoiding this film. It is nothing more than cheap junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Kolakli Kolak" is really a lousy movie: a typical action-crime film, complete waste. If you find it interesting at all, you'll never watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has been done a number of times. If it were an action movie then it would be great. It just doesn't have enough action, but it does have a few jokes and some amusing moments, but this movie is just too stupid to make itself worthwhile.  I will admit that this movie was probably a better than the movie from "Patton & Neely" or "Ties With Me", as I have done a similar effort with "The Expendables", but even that movie isn't all that much better.  The film's lack of a plot is one of the biggest things that ruins this movie. The characters are totally oblivious, while you don't have an idea that what's going on yet? The characters who are clueless are probably their only life line. The only thing that is enjoyable is the idea of the movie being a horror film. When it is finally over, I don't want to be bothered for another three hours of entertainment.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie once, and this is a one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I think there is really nothing else that has happened in the past 20 years since this movie to suggest that it will ever be good. When i saw it I thought it was a waste of time and money because it had too much in the way it was scripted and the plot was so pathetic and so bad that i had to laugh out loud. I'd like to see something more like the "Pants" from the original "Pets" as it was so funny and had a similar plot. I'm glad that "Paws" has such a good ending, but even as it is so predictable that "The Secret Pets" is not at all the kind that "Pet" is. I also think the kids should have been involved in it because it is the biggest insult in the history of the show.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is decent and its characters are interesting but nothing else. It seems like a complete ripoff of a movie "Al Pacino" and a terrible knock-off of "Fast And The Man".  The director's attempt to imitate "Fast and The Man" on a grand scale is obviously naive.  There is no way to make this movie interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a collection of over-indulged nudity in some of the most painful moments imaginable. You'll never really be able to find a movie in which this happens. In fact, the most disturbing scene in the entire film is when the titanic demons take off to murder and abduct young girls. The film is not a horror movie, it's just a porn flick that is boring. The story is utterly predictable, the actors are terrible, and the story is completely lacking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had read this movie when it came out and was very interested in it. However, I was not satisfied with the film in the way it was written. Some things were amusing but the most of the stuff was not. It was almost too predictable and the acting was extremely bad. It wasn't even funny, so bad it had to be the worst film I've ever seen. It tried to take the time out of the action to make some sense of it, but unfortunately it didn't succeed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read a good review of the film:  What I mean is that the plot is a bunch of people on a bus trying to get a date with a bunch a bunch in a hotel.  If they are really all there, I think they are a bunch hudded people and are trying to act like the movie it is. They act like they're on a train and trying to look like people who act like people, rather than acting like the people they act like. And it's OK if they are acting like that because it is good. But I think it's bad to watch that kind of movie, because it lacks any substance whatsoever. The movie itself has no plot and nothing that could make the audience care for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is the absolute most disappointing comedy ever made. I can't even imagine how anybody could expect this to be funny. You would think these guys were really talented comedians but this is nothing but trash. The plot is stupid and has really been a waste of time. This is just the most ridiculous comedy i have ever seen and you will just laugh and say "hey, hey, that was a funny movie" and "oh good lord, how did they make it?" You'll even laugh at the fact that this was filmed in a "no one expected to do this" type of venue in the middle of the summer but it does and it was just that sort of a waste. And since I watched it, I saw it for an hour and it is the same as with most comedies made in the early years but at this point, this is the only comedy to be on this list of 20 movies.   I have to say, if you liked this movie, you will not enjoy it the same way. It's a shame to have to comment like this one because it was very, very bad. You will see the same people talking and laughing about this movie but it really does not make any sense. If you are going to watch this movie after seeing it, make sure you do not watch it with the kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are only 2 or 3 people in the whole country who actually understand this movie. The rest of the people know how stupid it is, but nobody has an understanding of it. In short, this movie is a complete waste of time, even at the beginning. It is not even that bad. But I did not enjoy watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A new documentary that follows in the title, this is a piece of a dweeb's collection of poorly acted, dumb films that don't have the slightest bit of intelligence. The main character is a man named Robert DeClue. He is obviously a little bit paranoid. At the end of the movie he kills his girlfriend by having the guy shoot her. The film tries to keep the man around for a longer time to get information about a murder. He wants to be a millionaire but after he dies he tries to kill another woman to take her money for her murder.  The next part starts with a woman named Liana Elisza in an apartment with an apartment for many tenants. Robert De Clue is there. He asks for a couple of dollars and a few cigars to help her rent a few apartments. She agrees to rent the apartment when she asks him to get into a situation, but then at the end when the apartment owner is about to rent her apartment he wants her to rent it for another couple of weeks. As they rent the movie they try to get her into the apartment, but instead of taking rent money they rent an apartment in another building. Robert Elisz is there, and at the beginning of the film he leaves the apartment and kills the couple of tenants. They try to rent another apartment for a week, but at the same time they decide not to rent anymore. Later they try again to rent this apartment for the whole of the next week, and the next morning they rent it again. So, the whole apartment is going to lose her rent. But now it is raining, so Robert El is now running around and yelling out for help. It doesn't seem like he had any idea he was going to do anything stupid. It really is all about Robert El getting out of a situation that has nothing to do with it but ruining his ego. And even that is bad. The guy is a complete piece of garbage who is obviously going to get caught up in something so stupid he doesn't even try to escape. We have no idea what this guy is thinking at the very end of this movie. There are some funny moments, but the plot is very boring. I can't say the movie is terribly good, it seems to be interesting and fun, but that's the only thing it has in it. It's not very exciting, either. It just shows how many horrible movies are available in every year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just plain awful, with horrible graphics, bad jokes, bad acting, bad dialog, bad music, bad plot, and no redeeming message whatsoever. I could have made the whole film a bit better if I did the whole thing myself. If I didn't, you should leave the film alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be boring. When I saw the opening sequence, I knew the film would be terrible. It just seemed that it was way too long and had no real character development. The acting is terrible. I can't help but wonder how a movie like this is going to build a successful movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director wanted to make a sequel to "The Castle" but when he tried to make something, he got so crazy that he couldn't even think about doing the sequel. He wanted to "remake the Castle" in the same way he did in "The House Of Darkness". The director was in a huge ticot jungle and the original castle was set in a forest that he used to rent rent a building. But the sequel set up the castle in a tropical jungle and it got a totally wrong place in the jungle. There was some good actors who did a good job, but the acting was too bad, and the movie was completely unbelievable. The story was pretty good in a way, but then when it finally came out, it completely ruined everything and it seemed like everything was happening in one day. It was a shame to see this movie. It should have been released in the 1980s, and it didn't. The only good thing was the acting of all the cast. But this movie should have stayed on the shelf. Maybe this movie would have actually been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The opening sequence in the first hour is an excruciating sequence of one girl screaming in her underwear, followed by another, in another, screaming in an apartment with the same girl, the same guy, and the same zombie-girl-hanging in the window. I must confess that I was not paying too much attention at the beginning. There is also a scene in which a girl runs into a shower, and then a scene where a girl is locked in a shower and, as we get closer, she starts talking about all of the bad things she has done during the night. There's not enough sleep in that first hour, and at the end, you might find yourself awake. It seems as if all the scenes were filmed in a hospital and then filmed in front of a clinic. A doctor and a nurse do surgery on a guy, who's in a bed. A little bit of that footage appears in a few scenes throughout the rest of the film. This is, I suppose, the only decent sequence in it. The acting is a bit off-to-good. The zombie-vampire girl is pretty good in her costume, but she seems like a campy psycho. The woman in her dress does little or nothing.  The plot is nothing special, except for the zombie-boy-hangers who, by way, appear to be members of a cult. In the case of the girl in her bra, she also keeps asking for "the other sex" and the girl who is screaming in the shower at the start of the movie (the scene in the bedroom is about her trying to get off the bed). Then, in the next scene, there's a scene that starts with her asking a guy to bring his girlfriend, who is, in short, the girl that has been screaming and crying for several minutes in that room, and all she can't stop. At this point, you must try to guess which is the zombie girl. And then, after she has been raped in a car, she's asked to leave the motel after she's gotten over with another zombie girl, and it appears that the only good thing she can do is get out of there. But what are you going to do? Well, it's not really a good idea either, because we know that a couple of people are in this car. I won't say there's anything good about that. But I guess you can at least wait for a moment, because there are two people
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been looking forward to watching this movie for a while, but I have not been able to get into the plot. I felt like I was wasting my time.  The idea of "Jobs" is interesting but just barely interesting. I am not the person who would pay one hundred bucks for a movie. The characters are the same boring caricatures that I have seen every other movie.  I'd like to see an episode with real people, real people who actually want to save lives. If we get "Jocks", I would be willing to pay the money, but they would make me jump into their lives just as quickly as they make me.  It's just bad science. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll never watch this movie. I am not even going to finish it. It is a bad, boring movie with bad acting, and bad plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first experience with this movie was very painful. What the hell is this? A movie about this is like no one ever can tell. They don't bother even to tell us the name of the actors. A movie that is about a bunch of people who decide to die because of a stupid accident, and then do something stupid. We've seen that movie a few times now. The fact that they manage to make it so unbelievable, has no bearing whatsoever. You are seriously getting sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie seems to be about a couple, in a rented apartment, having a little girl named Sarah and a little bit more. However, Sarah has a bad connection with Ben, the father of the girl who has fallen on her, and his nephew, a teen who has been living for months. The girl is basically a bitch who keeps calling Ben and Ben's nephew a "kid" but she keeps coming back to the apartment. There is a lot of sex scenes and a lot more drinking. But what is Ben's name? There are a few scenes where the two are sitting at the pool or sitting in the kitchen or in one of the other apartments together. There's some kissing, and some dancing. But not enough sex scenes! There are no real kissing scenes and the story seems to go by the formula of the movie and this is the only movie that Ben and Sarah ever made.  The ending is stupid and the movie itself is completely unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a couple who have no money and can't find their child. They decide to kidnap a girl in order to get money from him. There are a few awkward scenes, a little girl with hair that looks like a big fat chick, and some sex scenes that are too disgusting to mention. If you have any sense of humor about horror movies you might like this one. But unfortunately the film is pretty bad. The plot seems to be about going to different locations at different dates, all of them leading to an impossible conclusion. There is absolutely no plot at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read the reviews for the other one, but it is too late. There are many better, more interesting things on it. I have the feeling, I have heard that before. This is a totally pointless film. The characters are not funny, not believable, no real plot, and most important, nothing interesting. The film has many mistakes. Even the first one (which is still the best) gets a few laughs. This film has a bad track record, so don't waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible piece of crap. I think it should have been the only thing I used to watch in the world. If someone was sick enough to make this film, he could have made the original and it would have been good. This film would have made me laugh as I am sure there are lots of people that are sickened by it. I'm sure the people that made this movie were not in their place. I do not believe it's ever going to make me laugh.  I've just come across a new movie of this. This is like a person made out of plastic and a really stupid person. I have to be reminded that people like these movies and that's the only reason I can watch them. I am looking for answers from someone to where this movie was made, but I have not found any. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't help think that this is supposed to be an original feature film from a classic, yet, original, Canadian movie: and it just can't be. This is, in a very basic sense, an ill-advised and poorly thought-out action flick. The story is not the usual "You don't know where it's from" story; it's a bit weird to think the writer knew that they were making a movie.  The biggest problem I have with this film is that the acting is really bad. There was one scene where a guy was saying to another guy, you know, to be, "Hey, you shouldn't have a dick for a year". Oh. My guess at least.  But in this case, you don't really have to get mad about the acting, because if the acting was good, the story was pretty good. But the acting wasn't good. Some scenes, for instance, were really bad in the film. I thought one of the characters in this movie was supposed to have a huge dick in his mouth. But not only did he, in that scene, get a big dick, but he also got the dick! It was hard to believe that this really had a real dick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a waste of time... I was scared to see the ending because I am a horror fan.... but this movie seemed to be so much like "The Shining End" in a way that it was painful. It was really bad in comparison to the "The Walking Dead" in which every time I looked it was fun and had fun; it was a little bit like a sequel to "The Fear".... but it was stupid and bad. I thought this movie was ridiculous. It just seemed like I wasn't watching the movie the first time when it was released, because of the endless crap it was making and I didn't like it. I don't know what it was meant to be because it was pretty bad.  The acting was OK.... the acting was decent but the story was very poor, although some scenes were interesting and were pretty fun. I didn�t like "Avengers 2" because of it's weak story and the ridiculous ending. I had to look the box after every scene and didn� not understand what was happening....  The music was OK but it wasn�t as exciting as the horror movies that came out of Hollywood.  "The Castle" is probably the least interesting horror film in it's history.  I don�t know if you're going to find this movie on a list of scary movies.... you can�t really find it unless you are looking for some serious horror. It's a shame that a movie like this is coming out this month. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So let's see what the critics think about this movie. "The best one I ever saw".  Why bother? Why bother?!? You know how much I liked "Santorum" (a pretty funny, classic Sci-Fi horror film)? You know what I was. But the producers chose to make this one stupid. They gave me a movie with a little bit of blood and guts and a lot of gore. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  So when you get a horror film, you don't want to see that crap. You want to feel a little more comfort. But this movie leaves you feeling like you are about to sit on your backside.  I just couldn't believe what I had been watching. I was really bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people, including a certain percentage of the Internet, seem to be surprised that a movie so much like a movie: that would normally be the case. However, if you consider the acting, the sets, the storyline, the direction, the music, the lighting, the costumes and the camera, you'll probably be surprised to learn that there are very, very, few people who have actually seen this movie. The only thing that this movie has is an extremely stupid premise. The plot is literally just like a standard "horror story". (See if it ever occurred to you, or you need to read that description...) If you find yourself on your way to something interesting, you will never watch this movie: the plot does nothing but fail to stay there. The acting was good but not enough to save this movie... and the movie could have just been a little boring. There are no story. No character(the main character) is given enough to do anything but the dialogs are not convincing or interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie a female police officer discovers a secret. She is afraid of her own gender as a cop and the whole family of the cops is involved. But at the end of the film the family starts to be really bad, especially the female chief of police. She starts to look like a female cop, but then she starts acting like a male cop.  In one scene she is being filmed for "murder" and then the other cop goes into a shootout as a hitman. The fact that this movie ends with a shot of the shooter and then a shot at the cop's head is just pathetic. It's a waste of money as it just doesn't go any deeper.  I would also say that you should have a sense of humor when watching movies. There is some humor if you want to have something fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I have to describe, it's not even the worst part of this movie. There are just a few really annoying characters, and it just lacks the ability to feel anything. But the film is so, so, slow that it just leaves you in the pocket feeling bored. The good part of the film happens, and while there are some interesting scenes, there isn't anything, anything, that is even good enough to make you want to jump in and have some fun. The bad part of it is that it isn't even a movie worth having. The film has a totally predictable ending. The ending starts out with a simple idea, and then slowly, slowly, it goes on and starts losing its energy. There isn't much that I can say about it, except that there are two of the characters that I like more, and I'm more interested in them. The story isn't that good, but there are several moments that make me want to watch it over and over again. I won't even give this film a 4. If you get the DVD, you'll miss out on all of the interesting things that are in it. I wouldn't give it a 4, as it is a typical film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched it on TV, not even a TV show, for the sake of its novelty and was supposed to see it as a comedy, which I didn't mind doing. But then it became an absurdly boring piece of film that I felt a deep hatred for.  I think this is the worst comedy ever made, it's like a piece of bad movie making. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The name of the movie is "Stater", but I'll call it "Staters". If you're a fan of "Stator", you might as well just watch the original series. If you do, watch a lot of "Steels" instead. If the original was a movie like the original, you would have been missing the most exciting moments. This one is a pretty awful sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film because I was a big fan of the original and wanted to see it again. The plot was horrible and so stupid that I was not able to stay awake and actually turned into a drunk. The movie was completely incomprehensible and very insulting to both me and my wife.  The first few minutes of the movie were OK but then the story got dragged into the trash and the story starts to make much more sense. Even the two characters are ridiculous and there are a lot of boring scenes.  Not only that but I think this movie is just terrible. I have seen many better movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like watching a movie about a serial killer with an evil wife and a bunch of minions and their attempts to make him do what he does while keeping the people of the house in the middle of the day with their lives.  I mean, if the person has all the knowledge and skills that is used to make movies, then his character would be a genius.  Why bother is there.  The whole movie is about a man that would like to eat a large amount of cock in the mouth while having a mind full of mad scientist crap to do with. He was very nice to have a guy who would take advantage of his brain and let his brain get on his nerves. He didn't make a great deal and that's how he ended up taking advantage of the people. He got his brain into an environment with a lot of stupid guys who make up everything and try to exploit it.  If I was hungry for a movie: * This movie has not been done before. It's not even as bad as The Naked Ray. In fact, it's worse than The Naked, but not really bad. I don't even see a good movie like this one. I'm afraid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really horrible to watch, although it is entertaining for a short time, but is really boring. I was surprised by the fact that there was a lot of actors that were cast in this movie and they actually didn't get paid for their parts. I found the idea of a movie based on a bad play, a few actors and some funny actors in the movie, but unfortunately didn't have much to show us. The only redeeming part of this movie was the performance by the actors and the special effects. Unfortunately, they weren't even good at doing the special effect scenes which had a really cool effect. The story is pretty bad, but there's a lot going for a laugh. The movie was bad, the acting, the scenery and everything about it were horrible and the movie lacked substance. This is the worst movie I've seen, and I can't imagine that anyone will even find this one interesting. If you want to see something interesting, try: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's very difficult to describe the plot, because the movie has so much going on. The first scene is almost a comedy or a comedy, and the second is not even a comedy. There are several scenes that are simply the scene that you would be waiting for. The ending isn't even remotely that good, and it feels like it would've been a complete waste of time to create it. I'm really hoping the filmmakers will see the error that has been created by these two actors. The plot may have worked if the filmmakers were a bit more focused. I just can't believe that such a plot would have worked. I did not know that was the case before I watched it, but I still don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not interesting...at all. The acting is bad. Very predictable. What's most annoying about this movie is the fact that it tries to be funny.  If you are one of those who thinks that a comedy is the only way to entertain, you have failed on that very serious thought.  There is absolutely no humor in this movie. Everything is too predictable, and the acting is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on Saturday night - a little drunk, a little bit drunk, but it had some decent laughs and it didn't go through too much of the time as I expected. But it didn`t have much plot and when the plot developed it just went wrong. Some of the actors are really good, but the way the movie is structured, the way it plays off, the actors` character's behaviour, and the characters` situation are poor compared to anything else. Even the acting and writing aren`t terrible, but this is just bad cinema.  I couldn`t bring the plot down to the level of some of the older, better movies I watched - "Ricco", "Taken Over", and "Virví". "Bad Movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first impression of this film was that it was nothing more than an old-fashioned British spoof, but then I was just too disgusted to go on. I'd heard something about it before, and apparently I had seen something like this before, but I still think the film isn't a spoof. It's simply a pretense to entertain the masses who want to waste their time, in a rather predictable manner. That said, it might actually be funny, if it was merely a parody, which I suppose is the standard. It isn't.  What the hell is wrong with this film? Well, for starters, the whole notion of having your child watch this film is based on the idea that it's a fun entertainment, even though it is plain bad.  For me it's an insult to the British people, who do this every year and it just infuriates me. Also the idea of having a child watch the film is just stupid. And the "scoop" of the film sounds so terrible to me. A good director doesn't want to include anything that is bad - it's obvious that the film just does nothing. I think the idea is the old British people don't care about their time. They just want to "sink their brains and have a good time" with their kids. In short, it's just bad, and I think British films need to do better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is only one good thing in this film: a plot involving the evil twins. That is it. That's the only thing in it.  The characters are bland, but this is a horror film with an interesting plot. Unfortunately the plot doesn't stay interesting. There is no suspense, no surprise and no surprises. It's not a scary movie with a plot to do anything. It is just a terrible, horrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the type of movie I never see in my life. I have to conclude that this is one of the worst movie I ever saw. I was surprised to see that this was rated a 9. I didn't even realize that I was watching something so bad. It just felt like I watched a horror movie, and that was that only the first mistake I had ever made. The actors weren't even good enough to make it look that way. I guess if you're going to make a horror film, you're better off making a horror comedy. And there are some pretty good horror films in the world, and I've got no doubt they're all OK. But this movie does not include any of that. It was so bad I was afraid I would never see another film, and even I'm certain I'll never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have to see this at some point in your life. In no way. You need a real, mature, adult movie about a story of real people suffering, or any good movies. This movie is the opposite of those things. The characters are ridiculous and the acting is terrible, except for the female lead, even the director of the movie is not that great. I think this movie is "so bad" because people are looking for something, like "fun" or "fun," or "great." And then you get the other movies, and this movie goes down in a heap. If you are a real adult, you won't be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a typical "horror" movie without any plot, character, or storyline, but only two very annoying people. I won't say the people who did it are horrible, but they are bad. The story is thin and only two (or three) scenes were developed. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's just a bunch of horrible characters. I was hoping to like this movie, but instead, I rented it twice and I won a bad reputation for myself. In what country I rented this movie. The reason I didn't rent this movie was because I saw it first, but I didn`T see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was an abomination. I have yet to see it, and it would be a shame to watch it. It doesn't even have the slightest bit of humour. In fact I think it had nothing but a juvenile over-the-top film. It's just a moron looking for a little bit of fun to ruin his reputation. This is not the way to go when watching a movie at a coffee house. If you're bored enough to watch an action movie, you will get more out of it. If not, then you need to watch something else. If that is true, then watch a movie that is not action oriented. You won't get much from this film, but perhaps one would enjoy it. You might as well go for one of the other films on the list of "the least action films". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew I would get into this sort of movie if the script was good, but it didn't. They were either too vague, or had bad plot, and the way I ended up in the end is a classic example of the "The Sop with the big fat bald bald guy" syndrome. It's just sad to see the amount of detail in the movie is too much of a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an insult to anyone who thinks they can enjoy watching a movie. The plot is weak and the acting is awful. I saw it just because I'm a big fan of "Hollywood's Big Night". I don't know why they made this movie. They got away with their "fun" idea. The idea was that the actors can't act. Well, that was the theme when "Hootie was born". A bad director has used "fun", "funny", and "fun-based" movies for a while to show how little movies are made. When they finally made "Holly", "Hooley Baby" did a very well job on this movie, but, well, it did nothing to create laughs. It's only the fact that it's so bad that you won't realize why it's bad. It doesn't give any of the plot of the movie a chance to be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the book, I watched the movie with a few minutes of time and some of my thoughts. I watched it not believing I was going to watch. I mean after it was just a story, I was supposed to take some time to finish the movie... In order to do this I had to watch all of it, but unfortunately that is not the case. I was left completely confused, the story just seemed to drag on and on, and it wasn't even made a bit clearer in my mind.  I felt like watching the movie for about ten minutes before it started and just as I was getting to the end. What's the point of watching a movie about a bunch of people in a car? I'd have a car in another car if I didn't know that. This movie isn't worth it at all. I've read so many books, books, and blogs about it and I've never come across anything like this.   It's a pity the movie does not have subtitles. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just as I am trying to keep myself in a position to avoid the film, I decide to watch it anyway. Why? There are a lot of interesting parts, but the acting is so bad that you really feel like you're going to die.  I thought I'd like to see a movie about a documentary on one of the most violent and sadistic animals in the world. I was looking forward to it. The movie could have played out, had it played out. But that's not the case. The film is a waste of time. I have no idea what this movie will be like. I think it's a waste. Avoid this movie at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that I don't remember seeing this at the film festival in San Diego or anywhere else, and I'm not even sure that it's as bad as I say it's supposed to be. But it is, in terms of the story, about as bad a movie as you might expect, even if a great and talented actor like Michael MacNeil (see the first scene in this review) has done it. This movie is not nearly the right place for a movie that tries to be a film about a crime or something else (or anything else, really, really). I found it in the movie section of a DVD store. I'm sure the actors who play the parts don't understand why they're in this movie, but it is worth a visit. If I was in this situation, I would have left the book alone. I really didn't like this film. I'd rather get a movie with a different title and an alternate plot (like "Gloriad") in it and just watch it for the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Monster" is another bad movie to watch, but it does have one redeeming feature, which is it gets a lot of money and some of the funny bits. Unfortunately, the movie has too many bad things to make the movie worth watching. It is horrible to watch and just horrible. The plot is a bad attempt at a comedy that has only two or three punch lines; you need to watch something more to make sure it works. I had low expectations for "The Monsters", and I was disappointed in all the bad jokes that came before it. I just couldn't stomach it and wanted to put it on my DVD. There was something good about the ending, but this was only when the monster made a cameo in the movie, and the plot had too many holes that were missed in the middle. It has nothing in common with a real monster movie, so unfortunately it was left alone at the end. I give this movie 2 points for being a bad horror movie, but 1/2, if the monster is made as the movie it is meant to be, 2/3, and 1/3 (out of 10) is the only reason I give it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate this movie. What makes it even more disappointing for me is the fact that the movie has to continue the cycle with the same plot throughout the whole film! I mean, if the entire movie revolves around the idea of "savage" invading the tribe, that has to be the only thing that could possibly make the film interesting! I find this to be extremely weak and uninteresting in the whole movie! The acting is OK but the story (especially the first part) is not good enough to save the movie. I had hopes the story would be interesting but this is too much of a bad deal! It just doesn't make enough sense and I will really regret watching this movie, it just doesn the same as "The Invincible Men". This is a sad situation for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A major disappointment to the good old movies: "Sisters" is about a couple of sisters who want to have a younger brother to take over as dad...  After the death of the brother, the sisters begin to lose their memory and become crazy...the idea is that they have to find a man who they can talk to...   But this movie does nothing of that...the movie is just some stupid "tack on stupid humor" and that is the only reason why I gave this movie a 3 out of 10 (1/2) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an obvious attempt at some kind of money-making effort which falls on deaf people. The acting is not terribly good and the plot is simply too predictable to be considered "intelligent". It's just boring, like a film made in a store basement. This movie reminds me of most cheap movies made in Europe and very few of the great American films, although it does manage to do so far better than some low budget films.  I have enjoyed watching some foreign films, but this is no excuse for making a movie like this one. And, as I said, I have nothing to do with the actors who are in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can't find the book on Amazon, go somewhere else, and you might as well find the movie on Amazon. It is nothing like any film. There's absolutely no logic, the acting is terrible, the direction is terrible... and the cinematography is awful. If you watch this movie, you might think you are about to die! It is truly unbelievable!  This movie is not funny, is not directed, and the script has no logic. It doesn't matter who made this movie and no one cares to see it, because they obviously don't have any time to even read the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies i've seen. I found myself laughing at the stupidity of the characters. Not only the acting, but the overall plot.    Even the scene where the kid is sucking a lot of blood out in the woods and there are three people that try to catch him and then try to get him back is ridiculous and ridiculous. The other guy in the same movie just stands there, watching his dad do this. And I've seen many of those types of movies.  I don't know why they even put this movie out in their sets and then put it into a new show. It does not fit the show. Even if the kid was a little bit famous, I would just throw it on the trash. There really is no place for it to be put on the air. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is about some bizarre plot, with a little bit of gore to justify it, so nothing really stands out, and the performances are mostly bad.  it's a little better than a slasher film but not great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First off, I had to read the book and see the movie (only after my mother and my aunt made me) and I have a huge problem with the fact that this movie is a total waste of both of the story and the director's talent. I mean, that's the movie, not a film. There are some pretty good scenes, but the story isn't that good, in fact it's really bad and there are some silly moments, and then the movie's pacing sucks even after a couple of weeks, but I didn't really think it's an awful movie. The characters are really pathetic, if you look at them they are really despicable. I'm not a critic, but as I said, I don't want to read anything. This movie is only to "watch" and "review", not to "take". This movie was like a joke. I don 'f*ck! You might see if the movie is more interesting to me than the book, if I'd read the movie I would actually believe that it was a comedy or a serious movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just does not make any sense. I watched it at an airport with no one to sit in front of the camera. I guess someone was watching the movie and saw it on the plane. Then I said "no one could sit in that position to watch it like that". They probably saw it in a different part of the plane on the ground.  Anyway, I do have a suspicion that the DVD of the movie would be a lot easier to rent if it made the case for more time.  I was really annoyed at the ending. It doesn't have any more detail than the beginning. The ending is just terrible. The camera work is bad, I thought it was just stupid for there to be more stuff to it. The movie was supposed to be about a car and the ending was just about how much time is wasted in one hour. There was a couple of scenes in the airplane, but the last scene didn't have it.  Maybe it was meant to be a documentary film, but there are some funny moments where the camera gets into the bus as it gets into a car, it just doesn't go far enough.  The most surprising thing was the scene where the guy was running away as he was walking into a parking lot. I have never seen anybody running so fast and so suddenly into another car. I was very shocked when he got out of the car with his head and made a good shot of him in a parking spot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely awful, but it's not really that bad, as I don't think people could make such garbage (or even the sort of "awful" genre that would be appropriate for this sort of movie). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, unfortunately it does not deliver.  Well, it is not the worst movie I've ever seen but unfortunately it is the worst film ever made.  I guess it is better than the other things in the movie. But it is only a mediocre piece of film.  This is the kind of movie where you can sit around and watch people try to act like an idiot.  If you are like me you will want to skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie seems to be the first of the 'Bunch' movies that doesn't contain any fun (I've never really seen one of these). It's like you would get a piece of paper with a bunch of characters that are very boring and a bunch in your pocket. The plot is predictable and it's predictable, but not all that much fun. If you have one eye and one of your ears and you can't see the characters in your head, you will be bored and bored. You get yourself in the mind of a zombie or a zombie that isn't as intelligent as you, and it doesn't help you as much as you would expect. It's not just a movie, it's a piece on life that is not funny and not even a very good one. It contains many things that are not in the best way to make a movie. It is just a cheap trash piece that doesn;t have a funny plot. The whole thing is that it is just not interesting. The jokes aren't funny. It doesn't get funny, and you never know who's gonna die in the movie. This is not a movie for people with a sense of humor. This movie is bad, especially since it's been around for ages. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the great success of "The Lord of Rings" (1st trilogy, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) The Lord of the Rings "The Hobbit" was released in 1994 and the sequel, The Hobbit (1/2, 3/4, and 4/5) was released a year later. This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The actors were terrible, the story was incomprehensible, the acting was awful, and the film was utterly meaningless. The plot was bad and the acting made absolutely no sense. The only reason I even considered watching this film is because it was the first one to do it. If this sequel is any good, I would rather see it as a horror film and not see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish I hadn my money back. If they did have the good intention behind this film, I wouldn't give it to them. A really terrible movie: the actors do not act nor seem to act. In fact the entire movie was a waste of money. Why was this made? If I knew it was a bad film I wouldn`d say it was better than it is. What a waste. If you have seen the documentary on the DVD, you can see exactly what I was thinking when I was watching it. But then the same thing happens. This is a movie that has absolutely no message. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing short of horrid and unprofessional, but this is the best movie of the '80s that I've seen, if you've read any good books: the first half is about a drugstore clerk who falls in love with a prostitute who then becomes involved with the police. There's a ridiculous story about her doing the drugstore business (this is true, in the movie: she used cocaine) and being arrested for cocaine (also true, if the script is any kind of accurate, it's totally ridiculous). It's just not that funny, not even funny. But what does the writer do to make up such an unbelievable plot? There are three lines about the girl being arrested, and she being arrested is not something you can gawk at. There are also some very strange scenes that involve some girl in a car with her sister (I'm not exactly sure where, but I have the impression she is in an '80's car). This film just doesn't work. In the end, it is just a very stupid movie and I don't think you should waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, yeah, it is true that this movie has nothing, nothing, and no redeeming redeeming characteristics. It is nothing more than a waste of time. There is nothing to recommend. I will admit that the film was filmed in Korea in 1980, but that was also the standard in the late 1980's. And it certainly was an improvement from the early 1970's Japanese film, which still had the same problems. If you have any interest in martial arts in the early 70's, go ahead and rent the movie, but be very careful about buying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really like this movie and the acting was pretty bad at first (as it was about a movie that had only 3 or 4 actors at the beginning of the film). I also didn't like the whole story. It wasn't really that interesting but the main character was pretty dull.  But the scenes were pretty good so they seemed pretty fun to watch. I don't think it made any more entertaining than a crappy TV show, but it was pretty disappointing to see a movie like this. Maybe that was because I didn`t really like the movie, but was also because it just wasn`applied a little bit too late and I could get better at acting in a horror movie.  I think I would prefer this one over one of the horror movies that are on my TV, or my movie collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still feeling the most ridiculous and awful things. What a little bit of torture for a family that made me weep for a movie that "says everything about you", if the character was a person (I'm not sure) and I wanted to scream. And I felt nothing else. But it wasn't just the acting, it's the script itself. It's so bad, it hurts the soul. The plot and story are completely predictable and they are not believable. There's only one character, and they aren't the main character, because it's hard to believe that anyone's going to make a person like him. It was just the story of another stupid person.  The director knew what a typical horror movie was supposed to be, so it wasn they made a little one, that's why they wanted to see the same, but this only seems to be their worst. The script, though I can see it, is bad, but the ending was way better than the first one. I mean, if this were the end of all horror, I'd be pretty disappointed. It would be great if the film was better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big question is why a movie set in a village (with a somewhat ridiculous plot) would have such low budget. If this movie was in a real village with a real plot, one would be able to guess that some elements from the plot would be drawn out. But when they came out in a fake village, the plot becomes ridiculous. For example, the movie contains many elements of the fake village from the real village, such as a few dead people who actually do not exist at all, a couple who are obviously not their parents, etc. And the main story plot is completely absurd. The only way this could be redeemed was by a couple of extremely talented actors, but it was extremely disappointing when they were not allowed to act. And at the end of the film, when the village finally goes to war, the only people alive at the village are the villagers from the fake town. They were not the village people, nor were there real people or real people from the village, but they were somehow the villains in the movie. I don't know who in the village is fighting who in this movie and why it was so hard to find people who would be fighting. I wish it would have been more fun to be in the real town. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had so little plot to make it interesting that it is laughable that it was even made. A lot of actors could have used the role of one of the characters in the movie to do more. A number of characters in this movie are only two or three out of fifty in the entire movie. The plot is terrible. I just went through the script and saw how I didn't even think they would have had a lot more lines than just some lines for each person. There is nothing to write about this movie worth a second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many plot holes that I can only conclude that it is intended to be a film no one would ever watch. The plot is nothing more than a re-edited and improved version of a video video, from a video made in Korea during the Second World War. The fact that the movie was made in such a fashion and then made such a mess of a film is ridiculous. The only reason that this movie makes it out to be is because there is a lot of Korean soldiers and a few Korean cop killers in the movie. Even though the film looks like a documentary, the video is a complete piece of garbage. I just can't believe that this was the only thing that came out of Korea in 1980. If anyone ever had any intention of making a film like this, I would be sure to give them a call. And if they do, I am sure they would never win anything. This is a terrible movie, not even worth investing in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am usually a positive person, I like to see good stories, however, this movie does not fit. This is the worst movie ever made. It is very predictable and very slow-paced. You can't predict what happens to the actors or anything that happens. We have nothing to bring you. It's boring, and stupid. I decided to write a negative reviews about a terrible movie: I didn't like it at all. I thought that it was stupid, and the plot was very predictable. I can't really expect my life to be anything like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not quite good, but it doesn't really come close to the level of quality which the original series was. As a result, it's rather disappointing in terms of what I would expect from a series based on the same title. The acting is bad, the story is bad and the storymaking is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years ago I rented this movie in the summertime when I rented a lot of movies. It was never been out at the local store with my wife, so she decided to rent it, and I think we got a lot more popcorn boxes in the basement, and she was always annoyed. This is a horror movie. I tried watching it, but I just was too tired and really bored. This movie had too many predictable scenarios and no payoff to make, so I ended it with a very low score. It's not like I can blame the story. There are too many scenarios where the protagonist ends up in the garage, and he has to figure out a few ways that make it so that he doesn't get killed. I thought that the best way to make the story happen is for the protagonist to be killed. It is impossible to do that because the way the characters are killed is so random and so unpredictable. The story is so poor, I think that this is probably the worst film I have ever rented. It could have used the idea of horror horror horror movies, but it doesn't have any horror scenes, and it isn't good either when it is just going to have an action-based movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was terrible. I was really curious about it's "feel-good" feel-goodness and it just didn't quite fit for me. I laughed at most of the dialogue and I think there were some of the lines that made me think that the characters were really hot. If there was a plot to that movie, I think I'd have been tempted to be disappointed.  In the end I had a small bit of hope to discover a little bit of real-life goodness and even though it was a little disappointing to say so, I still found it interesting and I didn't understand most of what was happening. I think that this movie should be shot like a movie made by a man who isn't afraid of being criticized for not making a movie: a man that doesn't understand the real world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm guessing the only reason that this film even exists. A "scary" movie about a little girl who just happens to be in a "new" school. That's all the same, except for the fact that you can't really see the girl as a person. All the "new school" characters are in their underwear, and they're in their bikinis. And the movie itself is totally devoid of any sort of plot or story, unless you count the big explosions that were the "scrapped" school (which obviously had to be at least 2,3,4...  If the film itself was so much as a horror film, there would be a lot more people in it. In the first hour, the girl does her first test, where she gets into a dorm room of the school, gets her hair pulled into a hat, and gets her name written in black ink. A few days later, she decides to go on to another school, where there's also a girl named Alice in it, and that girl is at the school.  The film is full of sex acts, rape and nudity, but it's not scary at all. It's just not scary. It was terrible. All in all, I'd say that you would have a good laugh if you would see this film. But if you didn't see it, then don't see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a big fan of the original series, I really enjoyed the first episodes of the series and thought that episode of episode 2 had quite a catchy theme. However, episode 2 of the second series (The Return) became the most embarrassing episode ever filmed. A total piece of garbage!!! Even I laughed at some of the scenes in the episode. I was expecting to be on the side of the story line for the first episode and just left it. That would have been fine. I really didn't want to stay away for some of these scenes. It was so bad I had the nerve to laugh and laugh at the scenes and only just to try to put it back on. I don't think the producers had any idea of this when they made it, because it looks like they actually spent some time thinking of the storyline. That was also the only way I got so mad. The story line isn't good enough to stand alone. I'm sorry for all the fans who bought the DVD and then decided to rent. It's the worst season to get a DVD and it is the worst movie ever made. Even as a fan of The Return, I can't believe they put it out in the stores. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie on rental on a Sunday evening with a friend and we began it on a really bad movie. I am pretty sure that these two people could not have given more than their time, but I still have hope because this movie is a waste of money. I was expecting a funny movie and it wasn't quite that. A lot of it was stupid and the acting was weak, which was bad enough to make the movie disappointing. The plot had an absolutely terrible pace, making me believe that the director intended to make a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am an American who lives in the southern states. This movie is absolutely awful. This is not a movie for people who enjoy something with them. I rented it at the video store in Los Angeles and it's a piece of crap that I didn't really even enjoy. The premise is that some local gangsters gang will kill the people and make some money and steal drugs. After killing those victims, they get into some weird place where they decide to shoot people for entertainment. This really could have been much better had it be a horror movie, not a horror film.  I will admit that the fact that there are some local gangs with a penchant for killing people is pretty good. However, they do not act like a gangster movie and that would be the most interesting thing in that movie. There are some very minor characters in the movie. The villain of the movie is the one who was killed and the cops don't seem to care about it. This just goes on like a lot of crap, so it is no surprise that it didn't win an award.    The first thing that this movie has was bad, the second was bad. The third is actually pretty good, but I would never recommend watching it. If you are on a vacation, this is not the way to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I would like to see the point in this movie where the filmmakers are thinking. What they need is just the right kind of show it to their audience to see how they feel about the story line and how it can't get any better. It's just a few minutes and a few seconds to pass by. I don't understand what they're thinking about. I know what they can do with this story line but there is no good reason that this movie is even remotely good. I just thought that there would be some good dialog in the story and something to make it better. Well, if there was something to add and nothing that helped this movie, I don`t know why I chose not to do so. There are few lines that are good but what does it look like it could be?  The problem is that the story lines are just like a normal "TV show" episode. There aren't really any real characters that are involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a lot to like in this film. The acting was horrible and the dialog was terrible. There was no plot development, no development, and no interesting characters. The supporting characters were either so dull or so wooden they all made no impressions.  The movie had the same idea as "Sisters", but I'm sure they would have made a more interesting film with much more detail.   The film was so bad it was almost worth a "Dramax" score, and it was so boring it was no longer worth watching.  Avoid at least the "A" category (as I had expected, anyway). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Star Trek" is one of the worst movies that I have seen since I saw the original Star Trek series. I watched this movie on HBO, and it was painful to watch. The acting was terrible, and the plot was just silly. Some good things that appeared were not there. I never paid so much attention to the plot (the reason I wrote this negative review was because I couldn't believe that the cast acted as well as they portrayed themselves.) The film seemed like a movie made purely to entertain children. And I couldn;t believe the acting was so bad that I gave it two stars. I didn't get any enjoyment from this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm one of those kids that can't keep their eyes shut. This film simply doesn't want to be a movie. It's not a documentary, it's a "numbers" style film, and the acting is bad. There are some good parts but it all seems to come down to the same kind of plot with a stupid woman falling into the basement and killing something. The ending of the movie is pretty ridiculous. Why? A lot of people have seen this film but we've never seen it on TV. There is a great documentary about the movie called "Keeper to the Grave", but this one doesn't even make you believe it's real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this "Funny Movie" because it seemed like I was going to lose the whole of my brain. I was disappointed by the fact that they put a few of their original characters in the movie and then came back to it with their characters who are not original at all. Also, there are very few original characters here and a lot of recycled scenes that are very boring, very pointless and very pointless. I will have to admit that a lot has been written about this movie and I would like to see the finished movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie on the Internet, and I saw it 3 times on the IMDb site before I saw the film. It's got some good parts and some funny moments, but the plot just isn't that good. It can't manage to get across a lot of the details without a lot more explaining than necessary. The ending is not very good either.  In the end, I couldn't quite feel too afraid. It is just really terrible to watch a movie that is so poorly made.  The first thing that struck me was the dialog. I'm a huge fan of dialog, but most of the movie was just dialogue that sounded like a bad version of that. The whole thing was just boring and stupid. In the first 20 minutes of the film, the dialog sounded as if you would be getting sick. The dialog seemed more like a sitcom in the way it sounded.  Now I have to conclude that the film is actually pretty good. But it's just so poor that it keeps getting me wondering, "what is going on". It's just a waste of time to waste time watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have ever seen (or worked on). It lacks any real purpose. What makes a film with all of the ingredients necessary to make a decent film is, not to mention entertainment (see the aforementioned "Jodger"), but without it, it is nothing. There is too much money wasted on it to make it interesting. It just doesn't even bother to watch. And the characters are so far removed from each other that you don't feel like you're being forced to look for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't watch this movie at the weekend. I just watched the episode on YouTube and I was totally bored. The movie just seemed like an out-of-context, pretentious, boring piece of trash.  A few minutes in and then this plot was supposed to be something interesting. Then I thought "This is like a movie I watched at an elementary school. A pretentious movie with a little bit of a plot." But, then, after this episode, I couldn't figure out why. I think it may be good for a "TV show" if you can't even figure out that this is a movie, so it can't really be a movie.  This movie was only in the very early stages of its development. Maybe the studio and director had more time to develop the show. However, it seems like they couldn't have made it a "movie" with all the bad elements of the movie. It was simply a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not the first or even the last of John Carpenter's masterwork. In what was probably the worst film ever directed and directed by Carpenter. The ending is simply terrible. It was obvious that the first time in a John Carpenter film would be the best. Unfortunately, the sequel never happens. We just go on in circles with little more substance. It's not that the film is bad, but that it is bad to see Carpenter making this film in the first place. It seems like they don't want to make an actual movie and just try to put together two minutes of nonsense. It is truly the worst piece of cinema ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there's any doubt that I'm a morsel of the arts and media of this world, I can assure you that I am not. I cannot stand that kind of piece of junk. I am the kind that has a sense of embarrassment and dread. I had enough of my nerve to avoid this.  In other words, I'm pretty sure I'm one of the few guys whose talent I think most deserves to die. And I am sure I am one of those in the same category.  And in the end of the day, that's not a bad thing.  This movie is one of several terrible films, but I can't go into how many there are because it doesn't exactly make sense to me. You might as well just watch a horror movie and then leave the movie alone.  The plot, though, is pretty good, because it has a sort of supernatural element. It doesn't really get much better, though. At times, I felt that it had its roots in the supernatural world; I think the plot was "fascinating." But the story was not interesting. The acting was wooden, and the script could be much worse than it was. And, most of the characters didn't seem to be particularly convincing.  Overall, I would've wished to see a bit more from this film. It has some interesting glimpses, though it's too bad to call it a classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just found this film on "The Ultimate Movie Challenge!" And I was very surprised that I've ever seen it.  The plot is about a guy who kidnaps the guys of a group of people and starts an invasion of the earth to make fun of them. He then steals other people's property in order to make a joke at his own expense. There is a bunch of guys with giant robotic robot suits that have the same plot, except they are made out of the robot suits, not the actual robots. It isn't all that bad, but when the robots are in the hands of humans they aren't real. That can't help with the plot either, but it adds a pointless "story" to it. This film was obviously designed to be made by a group called "The People Found In the Shadows," but the idea of "The Men Found In The Shadows" is so ridiculous that it is actually unbelievable. I'm not going to insult the guy, but his name is stupid. There are so many wasted characters, and they just have to make more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just because the filmmakers of this movie are, like me, not interested in making movies like this one.  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. The acting is wooden, the story is ridiculous. And the plot is terrible, too, too much is involved. I can only conclude that this movie is the worst comedy ever made. In fact, it's one of several, many, bad comedies I have ever seen. The most annoying thing I ever saw in a movie was the "Muck-A-Hole" gag. But it's funny, and funny would have worked for most of the actors in this movie. The worst thing about this movie: "Mucky Mucky mucky-mucky-duckoo-cuck-dollops!" (The joke has to be in the name of the movie, of course, because I'm going to say the same word) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people from my college got this movie because of a funny movie. I didn't understand why. It isn't interesting or original. It didn't even make a lot of sense. I felt like I was going to die at the end of it. I knew it was bad but I had just started to watch it and I just wanted to stop watching it.   I'm not one of the type that watches movies, but I have seen many of them and this one was one of them. I don't think I could watch it in the morning. This movie had too much going on that it didn't have enough in it. In the end the story had nothing but a bunch of people. The fact that these people are the way they are (as I've mentioned before) is just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is based on some very predictable lines and no more action than a normal action movie. In the beginning the film seems pretty interesting. But soon after the first few minutes of the film, the plot is totally predictable. The story's first line (with a very predictable ending and a very annoying ending) actually worked out. But it quickly lost its attractiveness. There are only a couple of scenes (not much more than an hour of movie) that are presented without any substantial dialogue or other action.  The biggest shock in my mind was the ending. The film ends with the scene where a bunch of angry people have just gotten caught up in the middle of the day. They are trapped, and all of them are screaming for their lives. What happened to them? What happened? The ending itself had nothing to do with the characters. It had nothing more important to do, like a story or characters. What does happen? What was it? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst I have ever seen in years. Not only is it completely illogical, and totally illogical to boot. It's just a collection of over-hyped films and pointless clichés, without any actual plot, plot, or a plot. A lot of the things in this movie that are true or only just barely true will just keep being repeated throughout the entire film.  The plot is ridiculous. They must know what they're doing, or something stupid would have come out of it.  I wish I didn't rent it. I mean I'd rent it for an hour, and a movie with a plot to make would be more entertaining than that. The ending really disappoints. It just takes you out of the movie for nothing. The "real" story of the "big break" is unbelievable.  Please go with the cheap, boring, over-produced movies and avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible and it wasn't even funny. It wasn't the way I expected it to be. But at the end of the movie I thought I was laughing at the movie.  This film is so bad it's hilarious that it makes me feel like punching someone.  I cannot believe the guy who made this crap wants to get in on this. The guy who just made this movie needs to stop making movies for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Wild Road" is another movie from David G. Robinson that is so terrible that even I have watched it twice.  I was surprised and disappointed that this is still being released in this year. For a movie about a real horse race, I expect it to be as cool as it is to see the horses in their natural habitat. But this movie is instead an exercise for some circus or dance or something to have your nose stroked with at the beginning of the movie. And even then, they are in their own way, for the sake of a story. I had to find out why they even had to go out to the woods to build it.  The script seems to be ripped out of a photocopy. If I hadn't caught my own copy, I would be paying for this movie because I thought it was an interesting story but it just ends after it starts. And I don't want to see some "the greatest" horse race ever, because it is not.   I've rented the first part of "Wild Road" twice on several occasions and I can only laugh at the fact that these movies aren't in my television sets.  So if you're looking for something interesting to watch, pick a movie that isn't so terrible and just hope it never gets better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple who have nothing but money to hire the actors do a "modern movie" about a crime syndicate run by one of the victims in the film. But, when they have the money, they fail to do anything about it. If you're looking for an anti-drug video, this movie is not for you. If they have a good story, let it stay as a murder mystery. It doesn't work. You don't get anything. It's just stupid, pointless garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed a bit when I saw this movie, mainly because the storyline is dumb and stupid. I felt that this is a movie made with very little talent and wasted a lot of money on this movie. The actors did not act well, but they at least tried to make the movie appear more believable than a movie with a very talented movie director. It does not have that much more special effect. And I can't believe it was made without having a budget. The story could have been done with a much lower budget. I didn't even see much of the movie in a movie theater, it looked as if it was shot in a room. There was only one woman that looked real. I could even guess she was the original actress who left the movie and made this movie because she could not find one. I will give this movie a 1. However, it's a disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the movie. But this one just wasn't good or enjoyable. The story was not great and it was slow. It just felt like they should have had one more shot at the beginning if there wasn't one already. It had some decent funny bits, like a huge fight scene where you could see the huge monster-like eyes of the monster in the water, but it really wasn't.  I gave this movie one star because it was interesting. But I couldn't really like it, either. I felt the actors in it a little too much and I didn't care about the story. I can't see the monster as an interesting story. It was just a bit bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible film about a woman that is about to die to a horrible disease that can't kill, but that is a pretty depressing conclusion. The plot is a fairly predictable, though not completely predictable. The acting isn't that good. The story is too predictable to make it much more than predictable.   Overall, though. I couldn't agree with the first few parts of the film, but I do give it this rating because the film is at least better than this one. But the rest just doesn't even make me care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's no way to tell you what a movie this is, except that the director and writer are apparently one of the people who actually made this movie. The acting is awful, and the plot is bad, and it's not even that it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a completely stupid film of a bunch of nerds sitting around a computer and playing a computer game. It's all about computer hackers who get a little bit involved and then try to make it a hit, but is only successful when the other hackers get a bit involved, too.  The plot is fairly good but its weak and badly directed by a weak, amateur director, so the film could have been better directed by one who knows how to direct and shoot a better movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I can tell you that I have seen a lot of horror movies. But this one does not really have an atmosphere to them...you know, the actors are just really, stupid-looking morons. I guess it's just the direction that makes you sick. It's not hard to predict where the next scene will go. A lot of the acting is done in one way only, and it can be annoying if it's repeated over and over. There is one scene in which they're shouting for their life, but then you can almost hear the scream coming back...  This movie isn't really scary, it's not scary, and you can't make sense of it as much as you want. The only time it is scary is when they're running for their lives. Even this one isn't scary, even it's a little bit disturbing, but this is still a bad waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is no more than an episode of a drunken drunk and horny college boy. The "sex" is just not even that good, but it is a poor excuse for that.   "Waters" is a very disappointing movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like an old, boring and very predictable plot. As a consequence, it is not very good to watch, because it is very difficult to follow. I can't even say that there are two characters, because I was one of the few who kept the show alive. The plot is bad, with the most predictable plot elements possible. However, even in this episode, it does not have any storyline whatsoever. The story revolves around a group of people that are looking for a woman to help them and are given the choice of marrying her, but she chooses one who is married to another husband. The woman (played by Annabelle Basset) decides to be killed by her husband's friends, and is later killed by the father of the group, after which she is supposedly dead and is found in a grave. They are then forced to bury her body. However I think the real murderer (guess it is Mario Caputo) was actually in the wrong when he killed the woman. This is very confusing, because when you watch the entire episode, you are suddenly introduced to another plot element, but the real killer is actually one of his enemies. I think they were looking for something else than that the killer should be killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Good Movie: A Christmas Story" is horrible. The idea is that these two guys do one thing each year without ever getting the right idea. The only redeeming characteristic of the movie was the appearance of Jeff Bridges. This is just not good.  This movie contains many things that are the opposite of smart. There's an unnecessary plot (which really should have been a lot of the characters) and a lack of humor. The film had a ridiculous premise, which required no effort from me because I was just watching the other movie that has "The Only Summer Movie:  I thought this movie was an insult to the whole "Summer Movie" genre. I just hope that you don't ever sit on your hands on a movie that isn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie: a horrible idea. Well, what can one expect from it. It contains absolutely nothing but stupid characters. The director (Kiyo Kurosaki) is apparently a genius, but the casting is too shallow and nothing special. I really didn't like "Satori", but they added it to the movie. I believe that that if the director was a great director, he would not waste such lousy characters and not so wasted money, but in this movie all of the actors look like the cast of a sitcom.  I believe there is something interesting in this film, but it lacks humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the book and I knew that was one of the biggest dumbest movies I have ever seen. The plot is boring, the characters were stupid, the idea was bad and most of the plot is stupid.  I think if I saw this film a lot more times than I would like to see it, then I wouldn't like to watch it at all. I can't blame this movie for bad actors, but I'm not the only person to see such crap. I think the movie has more entertainment possibilities in it if the movie had a cast like the cast in this movie, but the cast did little, if anything, except for the one good line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is full of cheap plot twists and a lazy script... but it doesn't make a lot of sense. It was only a few minutes of time, so it could've made it more interesting. The acting was OK, and I think the movie is pretty good, but if you don't believe in a supernatural movie (this one is obviously not it), you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, wondering if you are in it for the good or bad. The only reason I can describe the plot is because it is a very predictable. It's not interesting enough to be part of the movie-making. It isn't really a horror movie, and the ending is too forced to be interesting. I think if I'd had the film in my hands, I would have given it a 7 out of 10. Unfortunately, this is not one of the better examples of film making that I've ever seen, and it is definitely not a horror film. I'd give this movie a 4 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script seemed to be made up in a hurry, with little thought, effort and effort. But at the end of it the characters act like they are the characters in the movie, and the viewer just sit on their faces watching them in their homes and staring at them as if they're the characters. The "movie-making" of the movie is no excuse for such a bad production. I laughed at the scenes, for example with the killer stalking around a local house and watching him play a video game. They were just stupid, and they were not interesting enough. The killer was just a pathetic, pathetic character.  The cinematography was bad, the photography was bad and the story was bad. I could not even see the killer and make out what I felt the movie was going to be about.  I'm not going to waste my time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish i'd give this movie a rating, because it sucks. It's not funny, really not even an attempt at humor, and it really is the worst comedy in the world. It doesn't even bother me. The main characters are pretty predictable, it's not very funny, and even worse than the other movies. Also, the dialog is absolutely awful. Some people just got caught up in the whole thing because it's so funny.  So if you like a little comedy with some interesting jokes, don't waste your time on this movie. It really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie at a local movie store. It is extremely poorly filmed, so I couldn't care more than what I was watching. In fact, I don't know if anyone in the theater had ever done anything like that before, I just happened to be sitting in a theater and I decided to give it another shot. While I was doing that, a few more people came to the theater and started talking loudly in a row. At this point, I decided not to leave the theater to avoid the rest of the theater as well as the movie itself. Although this movie is a simple, but completely pointless, it's very entertaining. The plot is so bad that I can't imagine what they were thinking when they made it. I give this movie 1.5 out of 10, because it is plain bad. I would recommend the movie to avoid. It's not bad, but I thought I was the first person to see this movie. I can see that it's not about to be watched. I had no idea anyone else could actually make such a bad picture. The movie is so weak that I felt I would almost have been able to forget what it was about to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is no good.  The premise was good, but the plot has been completely ruined. This movie starts in an office and sets it all up for you to be on the plane in 30 seconds. The end of the film starts a little too late.  I mean the plot is good, the characters are good, there's some funny people in the movie. But the plot was a mess. I'd say if you have seen this movie then you know it's a bad deal. It doesn't even have a plot that's going to get us from where we're going to the destination in the middle of the movie, the plane crashes, then a car hits someone and we go back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think there's a movie like this one for the public to see. Even if it's some kind of movie for kids, it's really not. This movie is horrible. The movie is just dumb, extremely bad. I just don't know how someone can make this movie. It doesn't make any sense, and I cannot believe someone could just pull off a plot so badly. It's just like the rest of the movie was just dull and meaningless. That's the way I expected things to be. I thought they were fun, and not predictable. They were just horrible, and there were no plot. There was nothing. I hope they get rid of this movie at some point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie seems like a knockdown "Beverage". When the first three films of the film were released, I thought, if I could just see it again, I would be transported to other galaxies. The other two films are good and so is the movie but this movie is an utter failure. The story revolves around a female prostitute who wants to break up the marriage, she does so by making a man in a basement...  When the story is told, a man is given the job of getting some fresh fish eggs and being "discarded" by an "outraged" husband who wants her to stay alive. When the husband meets up with the "husband" and tells him that he wants to destroy a house of bad creatures, a female is introduced into the relationship...  The "husband's" attempts to make a girl mad is quite ridiculous and this girl soon decides to take over his role, not only to make her mad but also to destroy the house of monsters. This girl is the only girl in the film that gets anything out of it. The monster, along with all the other things in this film, doesn't pay any attention to the female's attempts to destroy it, and also fails to make the other characters mad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be absolutely useless, the story was lame and the characters weren't developed in a good way. The acting was also bad, if not the film had been so, it would have been fine. I guess I could rate this as a 'B-Movie' but since it was obviously an exercise in trying to make a few moments better, it isn't an 'B-'Movie' and if you want to watch something that is better, go ahead and watch something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete waste of fun but only one good thing. If the producers had to put the entire movie in reverse form, it might be interesting. If they had to change some parts of the script, maybe the movie could get better. If nothing else, a really awful, pointless action thriller about a deadly hit. If you are an action fanatic, you'll like it, but unfortunately if you're not, you're dead. If it's been so much trouble, what the hell? It's time to admit that the story is bad. Don't waste your time looking for a movie: a classic film, but sadly not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an insult to the movie industry. It is nothing but a bad attempt at a romantic comedy. It has nothing to do with reality and nothing to make up the time you see in the script, except that you have no idea what the joke in this film is.  The premise is a little "I'm a married man," and at the end you meet someone at a nice restaurant. The wife's parents are in it (in the last scene), and you meet a couple who, supposedly, live in an old house. The father (who's not in it), gets a little annoying vibe from the couple. There is some sex, a lot of kissing, and some a carousel. In this scene, he takes off his shirt and turns around and gets a massage, which turns into a murder. There are some scenes of kissing and kissing, but there are more sex scenes. This movie is really stupid, especially the scenes of the carousel, and the naked girl. In one of the scenes, she is kissing lots of people while a car falls. The car falls onto the man's body, which is obviously meant to be an out-of-the-way way. This is so bad that it is completely unacceptable to take this seriously. It just takes an embarrassment to even attempt to make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i can't say this is bad - it's very good. It's just bad. It got into trouble on the set and at the premiere, the sets went very, very dark. My husband and I got the DVD with the only part that we rented was at the same place in the theater - and that is when they rented the other part. We don't know how it got into the theater... Maybe, just a big mistake. Maybe it's supposed to have to have been part of the theater, but we can't get there for sure. But I think it might have been, because it was in the hallway of my house. This is not even the least disappointing part. There was one of the guys who said it was going to be one of my husband's projects. And we didn't even see it - but we were in the movie theater all night. At the end of it, there was some yelling and screaming. It just seemed like you were in a car with an extra seat. In addition, the movie's name is the same "TALKING WITH MARILYN" as the other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that gave me nightmares.  This movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a comedy. The scenes are just painful to watch and the plot is completely incoherent.  But the film itself is fun, as usual.  The plot was so bad it gave me a headache and I felt like I was being assaulted with a big stick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just terrible, even in that, it is based on a pretty simple premise, that is the first three hours. The plot is decent (some of it is good, although the characters don't do much). But the acting is terrible. The only reason this is bad is that the "gene" of the movie is, for which I don't understand why. I mean, if the people that made this movie could be the actors, why not a lot of them? And then there is the weird premise of the story, the idea that the characters will take a life, and how the characters from their lives will act, I mean. I don`t understand the logic of it. It is just unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most disappointing film I've ever seen. It just feels like it is all a one-trick film with only two stars (that's what makes it funny). It seems as though they wanted to make a movie about a big family of people that can not only understand the plight of living people but also be entertained. And they can't, because the only thing that is fun is for the actors (and a few others that are dead). If you want to be entertained by the stars playing their characters in their film, forget about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a 2nd or 3rd grad class. It was very poorly directed (as usual) and had a very poor performance (despite some brilliant directing from Nick Stetson and the beautiful Diane Keaton). The acting was absolutely awful and the music was bad. I thought it wasn't even decent enough to pass (especially the acting of Nick Stethon).  If you watch the movie, try to buy this one: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie about a big-ass, dumb teenager who, by force of his parents, attempts to get his mother into a good position (the old man) and then tries to rape the young woman, while the girl falls in love with him. This has an odd title, but I found it interesting anyway, as I think my teen loves a little boy who is more prone to his father than his father, so I didn't really want to see the whole thing. It is not all that bad, but as I mentioned in the comments, the plot itself was pretty good. But it was a bad effort to put the movie into perspective (which we haven't heard enough about, either). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a waste of my time, and I was very disappointed when the movie ended. The plot is boring. I've seen better, better movies, and more, I think. But this was the worst movie I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew that the movie was bad but I didn't care much if it was bad, but this was the biggest reason why I turned the other off from it.  As the trailers made clear, it is a pretty boring and boring movie. A lot of things are extremely boring and some scenes that I could easily write a negative reviewer about. It doesn't really give any value to the film.  I was expecting this movie to be much better than the original. I was wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked most of the actors in the cast but sadly none of them got that much better than these three actors. The movie is so boring that it cannot even call this movie "Bunkin A Love Story" since the storyline is so stupid. The actors are pretty horrible and there is really only 2 good actors in this movie. I just laughed out loud whenever I watched this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what happens when one of the most incompetent producers has ever written a movie. I had to look at the "jokes" I've read some of the comments to get the full story.  The movie was a big waste of time. The story about the dog-killing that was obviously meant to be a joke and I think it was too obviously meant.  But I have seen so many stories just like this, where it's just a big joke, with a big premise, and just an excuse to be stupid. It's like the movie "Shootin' Lemurs".  The plot was pretty good, but I couldn't believe this was a joke. The plot wasn't terrible as much as I thought it was, but the movie was not funny at all.  I give it a 4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was made with a totally pointless plot to do anything with the characters and I don't think that was intentional, I guess they were trying to make an action movie like 'Mad Max' or some of the 'Fantastic Eight', but the film is so bad, it is OK to lose a few hours anyway. As a very old man, and like me, I have read this movie several times, but what the hell?  The acting was awful, the characters were very uninteresting and the only thing that made me angry were the horrible "vocal" music, the one person in the film actually acted with any character he or she had.  The only reason I actually gave this film a 2 out of 10 was because of the fact that it had so many terrible scenes. It is OK for a movie to have a cast with some great acting, but the actors should make some more believable scenes. At the same time, it should have been a little more interesting, but that would have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie on the TV channel and was expecting a "real horror" episode of a horror movie from "Scary Movie" fame. After watching the entire thing, I just decided it was terrible. A "real Horror" would be like a real horror movie, but this movie was like a cheap movie that I would normally rent with a rental. The only reason this movie wasn't a rental was because it was so horrible and bad that you can't tell why it was in a theater. It had so little dialog and characters that were forced to act so badly. I felt like I had seen nothing in this movie. The acting was so bad and the writing was just OK but they tried to make you believe it was a real movie. I mean, come on, if you want to watch a movie that has a plot, you aren't watching a movie called "Mafia Night." This movie was only a little bit better than the other movies on TV, and I think it was only possible for a TV set and maybe a computer.  If you can see this movie, I'd really recommend to skip it and rent the cheap rental. It's no way that this movie would have to be scary. It was bad enough that it couldn't be good, but it still had more value. This movie did a horrible job of writing and editing. The beginning was OK but the middle was bad. The ending was bad and you're left confused for who's going to save the day. If it wasn't bad, I wouldn't recommend buying this movie anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie, if the film was made out to be, it would be bad at the level of a film that can barely be considered "good". The movie itself is about a guy who has fallen victim to a virus, and is taken into a bunker to fight it out. The film is poorly made, there are only a few glimpses that show glimpses of life as an adult, and the acting is not good enough to warrant it's release.  The film had so much potential, that the movie actually was awful, with a script that was not even the slightest bit good.   I found myself laughing, but I couldn't finish watching it. The only thing that I really liked in the movie was the character of the "real" "Mr. Grasco".    The plot, the acting, the cinematography, and a few moments that were good, that I actually didn't want to see more of the film, and so I just decided to stick it and just watch the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a waste of nothing. The only reason why you might even care is to see the ending. But there are no more interesting things to see and nothing interesting to see, and there are only one more person than the other two in the film and a really annoying sex scene.  But in the end the film is supposed to have something to say and so it does. I'm sorry, the two actors are so bad that they make us like them again. The movie is awful. I had a very hard time watching it. It seems like they were in the movie making something. It was like they had just decided to put some random scene in a scene and then it's all about putting it in a film. What do they do with making a film about one thing and not be allowed to do anything else? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a disaster. The plot, the acting, the plot, and the special effects failed to do any of the above. The acting was bad, the story was bad (as usual) and the movie was bad to the core. The only good part in the movie were the "jokes" scenes. The joke scenes were hilarious, even for a small moment. Some of the actors in this movie are really good, but it was too hard to find them in a lot of their movies. I am glad to say that the actor who played the 'Bass Fat' had a good performance, even though there was no chemistry with the 'Fat' character. There is a 'Joke' scene with the actors that I remember watching because I had never seen such a joke before. I guess, I'll be getting more of these movies in the future, but I hope it's not going to be the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the review of this movie and saw it as a comedy. Well, it's not a comedy, and it is not funny, but it was pretty bad. I don't have an idea what happened to Kelly Brooks and the rest of the cast. Maybe they just wanted a laugh, maybe they thought there was a lot of people going out of their flicks. I think the cast is good, but the acting was really bad. Not like most movies you'd see. I could've seen it as the real world, with people with funny accents and making a believable performance. The problem is that this movie is not about a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess the first question might be one of those who have no idea what is going on or how it's going or what it is. It's a bad comedy that relies on some pretty blatant self-inferential twists, which is just not the most effective, and I think that is the reason it's been so poorly filmed. The opening scene is a bit like a joke, although it seems funny.  The movie is also full of cliché (like the name of the movie), which I felt was distracting and the ending was predictable. I didn't know what was coming next after it stopped. Some parts that were funny were so boring, I felt my heart beating.  I do admire the direction, but I did not think it had the same feel and energy as the rest of the film. And the movie has a lame musical score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had no storyline or story. I am not an expert of the media. But it does seem like a typical movie with a bad, dull ending. It has a ridiculous amount of violence, which should be taken seriously. It was not even amusing. I don't really feel the actors. It's just boring. I think the makers should be ashamed of producing this crappy film. If you like movies, do it with people you know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As always, I do get a hunch when I'm watching a movie like this: "Honey, they should be ashamed of what they've done," and they most certainly are. So, this movie was an exercise in stupidity and stupidity.  There are so many terrible twists to the story. In the first episode, it takes place in a hospital, where there are several people that have been murdered in cold blood. In this episode, there is one person that's killed for real and it is the only person who knew the murder was happening. And then, it is announced that the killer had a tattoo and there is a person named "Wendy," who also is killed in cold death, but the killer has a tattoo. When the killer comes back to town, he was wearing his tats and it doesn't look like he has one at all.  This movie is really bad. If the writer had the nerve to do it with just one character in his entire movie, he might have done better. But the ending of this movie makes me question whether the movie was planned at all, and why. This movie was supposed to be funny.  The only decent part of the movie is the ending. For example, when the murderer is sitting in a car on the road where he is shot, there are two people that are sitting there. One of them is sitting there in a tree, and the other is a body that has been set on the ground. The murderer takes the body and lays it down on the tree as we see it.  What is the story?  Well, it isn't going to be a typical Hollywood story. It is a classic "jumping off" situation where a killer jumps off a body and sits at a car, and tries to figure out why he died. But I guess it's not that kind of movie.  Why did he jump off? Why was he dead and then killed? Who killed him? Who was the person that was killed? Was he a serial killer? Who had a car in the car with him? He got into a car? He apparently used the car? Maybe this car was stolen? Who's behind him? Was the killer a man that used a car for killing his victims? Who got into the car at a gas station? He was in the trunk? I guess the car was a stolen, but I have to wonder if that was the killer's idea. I guess he killed a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really just a pretentious movie of bad taste, even by a veteran of the classic "The Adventures of Superman" series. It was completely ridiculous and predictable. There was no action for me to enjoy. What I did was spend about half the movie looking at the cover. At times I thought the whole thing was a story to have only ONE idea. In other words, it was stupid and childish. I thought it was nothing but an unbelievable attempt at trying to make some kind of "supernatural" or even psychological effect.  I would recommend not watching this movie unless you have something else to do or even to watch it. It is a really horrible waste of money. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a huge fan of classic movie, i can't believe that this movie is even this bad. As I'm sure I'm not one of the actors involved in this movie, but I'm afraid to call. You have so much wasted time of a great actor (all of which is wasted) that a person like me, a real fan of the classic TV show will always leave the movie disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is like watching an episode of "My Dreamland", and you wonder if there is some crazy plot or magic. The dialog is too stupid to make it even worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, as the title says, it's bad, but so are the rest of this movie. The characters have so little dialog and they're pretty much the only people in this movie that have to act. We see a girl who is crazy and a guy who does a lot of stupid stuff, but when are two guys having sex? That's just not good, but there's nothing to blame either.  I give this movie a 10, but if you're looking for something more, watch the "Ladies of Paris" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is somewhat amusing to the point that it's supposed to be. The movie is absolutely terrible, it is no more. The only good parts are in the beginning and the end where they make their own rules for how a woman can act, and you think that some interesting ideas are thrown in there, and then you have some horrible characters. I was really disappointed because this movie had the potential to be a very interesting movie, but when it was out there, it just didn't happen. It is not worth watching at all. The end is awful, but I guess it was a pretty good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the biggest disappointments of my childhood years, as it seems so. I wish it were better. A couple of years before I found out that this movie was a satire of bad things. This was the last film I would watch. I have had so little time to learn this, but now I need to get over it. It's too late now, I'm getting too old, I have too little money, and I don't understand. I've been looking for this movie on DVD since I got it on my DVD player years ago, and to tell you, it's still one of those movies that people put up for, so I've decided to buy the DVD over and hope I can buy my old copy before the others see it. I am sure I can find it in an acceptable setting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i never saw this movie. i am not a fan of this film. The script is bad, the acting is bad. the music is bad even though they are trying to recreate the "Journey" to their own standards. this film is garbage. i never watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a rip-off film this movie is. The movie was awful and bad! For real movie-making I would recommend this film because of it's ridiculousness, stupidity, stupid lines, stupid dialogs, stupid jokes, stupid sets, stupid costumes, stupid shots and stupid, stupid action scenes. The only thing that this movie does is make a ridiculous pretend to be something that it isn't. It's not even fun to watch. There was a bit of humor in it, but it was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been quite so miserable.  This is the worst film I have ever seen. But then, you have got to see the first one and you can watch the two sequels. The first one is terrible, and the two afterwards are terrible.  I do believe in the concept of "horror" as an interesting subject but what is horror if it comes out in the most gruesome and disturbing ways? Why do this movie make you think that it will be scary? Where does this movie take place and where is it in your head? Who is the director? What is it going to be about? Who can I guess that is involved in this production? Where are the people? This movie is completely un-real, and it is completely predictable and predictable, and there isn't much in it.    The plot was good, but the plot really had nothing to do with any of the characters. The only character involved in the film that was developed by the director was Dr. Von Stadt. He was a man named Von Stodt.  The other characters involved in it were Dr. Ebert Stadte and his wife, Dr. Riffi. The movie was about a couple of parents that tried to bury their dead son and it's a mystery murder (of which there is no end) when their son finally comes back from the grave. We're not sure why she doesn't know about it. This is completely devoid of any real meaning to the film, but it does have a lot of plot elements.  How did they go so quickly? I guess it was written for the benefit of the director and she had a creative vision for the story, and she wanted to convey something for her film. However, she had to add some unnecessary details to the story to keep things moving.  One thing that I didn't see was the fact that the main character was killed in a car. There were some odd people, though, I do think that she had nothing better to add.  There's a lot more to this movie that didn't make the story line any more interesting. The way this movie does a lot is to say that it isn't a movie made to entertain. It's just a film that will be poorly made, and that really takes place no where near the point.  Also, I don't think it was good enough to make me think she had an urge to live in one of those places. It was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. In fact the movie was so terrible that we actually got sick for it. It was so bad, I felt my stomach grow nauseous. At least the actors could make some real-gamey, clever, funny jokes that I couldn't even watch for a second. I was bored to death for the other actors. There is nothing in this movie that I would even call remotely good. The only thing that made me laugh was the music. I really didn't care about what they were doing. Just the basic acting, which was bad, the music was bad. A couple of scenes in which the cast and the girls were totally fluffed. And the acting was just bad enough to make me want to throw it in the garbage and then throw it on my trash pile. I am not saying anything about this movie - it's a horror-movie but this movie was beyond my normal expectations. If I had to pick 1 movie to rent and I didn't do anything, I'd choose to rent this movie over anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a brief cameo from the "Rorschure", in which he is obviously, at least, a big star in this type of film, but what can I say? I'm not sure. It's not that bad. But I'm also unsure whether I can say anything positive about it. A simple synopsis is that it isn't very good. It lacks a real storyline, and it is awfully predictable. It just doesn't have much in common with the films that are generally considered, "B&B" or "Songs". I don't think I'd be able to watch it anyway. But there is some reason to watch this film anyway. It features a lot of what you could expect from some of the other B&B movies; it is well made, sometimes it's entertaining, and sometimes it just isn't good. But it's not the best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see an enjoyable movie, you'll have to get a car. If you're stupid enough to sit through it, you have to watch it with a glass of water. If not, you will watch it as a movie about some stupid car stunts, the one that made the movie (The Car Show) is the only one. As a car owner, you are expected to see some car stunts that make it look as if someone is walking around doing a race. And since you're in a car, you're probably expected to drive around for a couple of minutes. It's not surprising that some stupid cars were put into this movie, and some stupid guys from Pittsburgh would probably try to sell it to you. After watching The Car Show, I decided to take it anyway, even though I knew it was just a cheap Baja Jaguar stunt. If I had known of The CarShow before I saw it, I never would have laughed at it. It was just as stupid as it was supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of all I couldn't help but think that this movie could have been so much better than this one, if they had the same story. It's horrible, so bad, and is such an embarrassment that I felt I couldn`t say anything more about this movie.   Well I shall say that this is a cheap movie, I mean it really was bad, that really doesn`t matter to me anyway. The story really isn`t much, and although it is funny and it looks good it lacks any real substance, so don`t expect a great plot.  Oh well that must be the worst movie that ever made. What the heck? The plot of it really isn't that brilliant, but a lot of the jokes are not great at all.  It may be a comedy with a plot, but this could be better, better than that, or if it was better I guess it didn`ll be, it just isn`T good at all, that`s all it`s! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always been fascinated with the genre of melodrama, but I can't say I have ever seen one that is "better" than this one. The story, at least in terms of the dialog and the acting, is very old and very old. It's just a predictable, predictable, cliché-ridden, over-rated movie. Some may have seen "The Day After The Last War", but it seems to be very reminiscent of "The Walking Dead". If it is intended for a genre of war, it must be better. Otherwise, it is pretty bad.  The only reason this movie has an opportunity to remain in the hands of any major mainstream outlet, is the presence of a talented cast. In fact, it's probably better if it isn't played in such a way. In an odd way, "The War" is a failure to make any sort of statement on anything. It has an interesting storyline but nothing I would care about. The problem is the acting. It is painfully predictable. The whole movie looks like a typical melodramatic melodromatic "glimpsize" movie. I think I would rather have some more talent in directing, directing, and acting. The movie is bad in that regard, especially for a non-American, single-gimmets film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not really sure if the actors are supposed to be so great that it's in such bad form, as they are so in it. They are not very funny in that way. The plot is horrible and the scenes are completely absurd. You can almost hear that someone is about to kill everyone before they get started. The actors seem to be in perpetual fits of agony. I'm surprised how they make a big deal of the scene in their house. I wish they would just quit. It isn't as bad as most awful movies can be, but this is one of the worst. This film looks like it will have a sequel, but it will never be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about sex and a bunch of teens who are really just trying to make some money and get out as a porn star. The film is about a bunch in the film group, who make some stupid sex movie and try to make a movie to sell. There's a good scene of a teenager masturbating (or rather, "masturbation") - which really just doesn't make any sense. The main plot (that's really the problem with the film) is only the teens acting in a movie called "Maine Fish". The premise is that the group of college friends (including the teenagers) want to make music, so they start making a documentary, that's their music is mostly about sex.  The movie has this bizarre ending. When they go to Hollywood, they want to shoot a movie that's not about sex, but instead about a rock and roll video. This is so bad. There are lots of weird plot things, such as an entire movie about a video game, that are just not necessary. The movie tries to make something interesting, but you just can't expect anything more. There were many scenes in this movie, but the overall plot and characters are just weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say it was a little bit funny when watching it. It was just a lot of padding and the ending was pretty awful. If it was bad in a movie then that was the only thing that made me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big, but disappointing film:  I can't see this film as being much more of a film than the average, mediocre B and C film. There are lots of clums, bad direction and bad photography, which you can't even afford to make if you want to make movies like this. But don't expect the same from any Hollywood film. The film was a complete waste of money on both production and advertising. The acting was bad and the sets were bad (for the film's supposed big budget), but the sets and special effects were decent in most scenes. But this really isn't a documentary piece, since the only thing that made me feel disgusted was the acting. The story line was bad. And the film itself was terrible, the film didn't have much to recommend to anyone who has any serious sense of self-respect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast and a script with no connection to the book makes this movie a failure. The acting is terrible. The director tries to make it appear as a movie based on the book, instead of creating something new.  A man (I would say a man) is being pursued by a bounty hunter who is going to kidnap some women who have kidnapped children.  The story of the kidnaper is so ridiculous that I can't blame this movie for wasting time on it.  I recommend watching a movie of some guy walking into a house at midnight and finding the mother and her two daughters. If you think it's a good film, you'll spend the rest of the film getting pissed off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to be entertained, you will do yourself a dis-toy. As you might expect, it's hard to find the same standard of entertainment in a Hollywood production. Not only does the film not deliver a plausible story but also its plot is flat. For example, a "star" would be tempted to be tempted by an irresistible temptress. But that is precisely what is happening in the "star". The scene is supposed to be an event that the heroine (I'll call her, Sarah Silverstein) wins a prize in a contest in a game that she was forced to play in a few months ago because her husband has to attend it as well. If that scene is set up as a game, that is fine. But it is not an actual game. So if you have something to do with your time, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for Christmas and was really disappointed. I thought it looked like a very simple premise and the acting was awful. It's also not that funny in the way I expected it to be. The scenes were too much like the rest of "The Oasis" movie with its ridiculous story. A lot of the scenes were just a bit bad and this movie seems to be intentionally slow moving. There is some good jokes, but it just isn't funny. If you like comedy and a lot of suspense, you'll like this movie. But sadly, this doesn't make it. If it doesn't, I would give it 2 stars for a decent "Oasis" Movie that could have been better. If that is all you're looking for, then maybe go on a trip. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a decent performance in this movie, I thought the ending was good but the script was really stupid. At least the final fight scene was better than the rest. The ending just was awful. There was nothing else to it. The villain didn't even bother to fight the monster's monster twice. The plot was totally uninteresting. In fact, it was impossible to find any plot detail on this movie. It wasn't very dramatic and the plot lacked any semblance of authenticity. I was really scared the "evil guy" (that was probably the one who used the "machine" to get the killer into a fight with the hero) would kill the girl and steal her as well as everybody else in the house, so I had no clue if she was alive or not, nor if the villain was the man responsible for killing the girl. After the fight was over, I couldn't even get into it, because I was so scared that I couldn?t believe that this movie was even supposed to be a horror movie. The only good thing about the movie was the ending (after the movie, which we only saw in the "opening scene"). It was a good ending, but it was weak and had nothing to make me want to jump into it. I wouldn't even rank the movie as one of the worst horror movies ever made. But I wouldn?t give this movie a 3 out of 10 (since that was a very low score). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After a brief "preview" of the first episode of "Pip-Boy" (that is the episode), I decided to try the episode again. However, my expectations were already low. I couldn't believe that the characters of "the first two episodes" would act so badly on the first show. The actors were flat-faced, insubstantuous, and their performance had a miserable presence. They seemed to be incapable of moving with the characters through the entire show, even having the two characters act as the principal protagonists, in the first couple episodes.  I did not get what I expected. If this show was meant to develop a character or cast, then I could believe that it would. But I could not believe that an actor like Jim Belushi, a guy who is far too old to play a guy, would have to make it so badly. If the actor had been at the stage when "Pippon" was created, the acting would have been OK. In the case of "The Six Million Dollar Man" (the fourth episode), this was pretty disappointing.  However, I thought the movie had a good chance to be a movie "for fans" who are looking for a movie. But, I couldn`t believe the acting was good enough to make me care about it. It is like someone would have a small amount of money and a movie camera that they put into their hand and ask to make a film. They would make a great movie, but the problem with this movie is that it is not suitable for film making. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say that I was surprised when I watched this movie. I laughed a bit. Then I saw the movie was just not very funny...  There was some light comedy but unfortunately that is very common in most movies. I don't know whether to make the "one man" joke line but it was a pretty big joke when I saw it, and this is pretty rare, too.  I just can't understand the idea of the movie being in the "wanted to be a star" part. Even if a movie was made in the way that it appears at the beginning and not towards the end...  It seems to me that they would have been a little more daring if they put a lot of time in to it but I think you might find that the movie had many problems in making the movie. In the beginning there was a very cute picture of the main character. And there wasn't that much in it! The problem is that this was the only part that really worked. The ending was very bad. I was not sure how the ending was supposed to end and how they were supposed to find a way to get the main villain. I am very surprised that this movie was so close to a perfect movie, which is a bit sad. If you don't care for suspense, you might be tempted to skip the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that I have to ask you to do a one of the funniest jokes I have ever heard. But this one was the worst I've ever seen. The main story line involved the old man (Mr. Rock's real name) and his son (the man he had to get to as he tried to blackmail) who were trying to rent an apartment by a man named "Mr. Kalee".  There is nothing funny about a real man who kidnaps and evades young, sexually assaulted boys and rapes them into the basement as their "loophole" for the purpose of killing them.  This is a movie that can only be laughed at if you are dumb and have a sense of humor, like the kind that works only for one or two jokes. This is far below the standard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing more to say about this movie: that I know what to do. The only problem with this movie is that the movie is so bad, that even you, the true film-maker, would never waste it on this film.  I can see the story, but I couldn't remember what it actually was. I never once sat on my hand or in front of the movie. I couldn`t even see how I thought I was going to die in this movie.  After it came out, I tried to get my wife to watch it, but she said, 'I don't believe this movie'.  Then I tried for a bit, but all I could was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am surprised when I see this one, as I did with "Roots" and "Rids". I am not sure if it's a bad or bad movie, but I am pretty sure that it is bad. I have heard that it was good, but that it wasn't so. The plot is pretty simple. This movie is about some people being arrested for kidnapping and murder. The acting is pretty awful, and the acting is so bad, that it isn't even funny. I can't see anything interesting, nothing about this movie except for a few scenes in which the characters are supposed to have some sort of special qualities and they don't. The film tries to portray some sort out of a gang of people and a bunch of women. It just doesn't seem to be like anything else. I was very confused at the beginning with "Jitrok", and that made me quite confused. I'm surprised when this movie gets a good name. The ending was too long and I didn't get enough. I don't have to pay much attention to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like a movie that is made for the little girl-who-sits-next-door-to-me but nothing resembling an adult-film. Sure, some good action, but really, really bad camera-work. The film is just boring, and the story is very predictable. But I do give this movie 4 out of 10 points, because it does a couple of amusing moments. There are some really good scenes involving the three of the main characters, but the movie is too slow to bother you. It could be interesting to watch the two kids, but it's not like the older ones were ever funny. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this movie over and away for days, and I'm sure I have spent some time looking for more hours of entertainment. I have nothing to complain about this film but I am sure that if the original, as I am told, was released in 1997, this would be a pretty good movie, but unfortunately this has turned into an utter waste of time. This movie consists of some ridiculous moments and the main plot is absolutely no. I wish I had heard this before but unfortunately I had no idea what it was. There is absolutely nothing worth watching. I found it a few days ago on the Internet and was amazed to find a DVD copy. I decided I would just order it, but of course I missed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a truly appalling attempt at a musical drama. In a nutshell it's an effort at a plot that is obviously not intended to be true but nonetheless is intended to fail. Even though the filmmakers admit to this, the acting is extremely poor. There is a very basic plot idea that is stupid but the attempt is never delivered. For example "The Bride" and the love story of "Dancing With The Angels". As I watched it I thought they were both stupid but when I sat through it I realized that the plot was just the opposite. This is not a good way to get a movie into a box and then watch them for something other than fun and entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie, even less serious than the average dumb movie. If I say I saw this movie, I will still have nightmares. There are no believable story, no believable chemistry, and no plot. It is extremely weak, just like everything else on TV in this country. This is the type that people watch with the worst comedy ever made. If you had any interest in this movie you would expect to see it for sure. But unfortunately, the people that made this film are completely clueless. This movie really doesn't want to be filmed. It's just a cheap imitation of the famous, so what did you think it was? Do you think this movie would have a plot? The funny thing is that it had a plot, but the plot was worthless, as usual. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the premiere I was expecting an explosive ending, I was wrong. The story line is the weakest in this movie. The movie does have some good parts and some pretty good special effects, but not enough to make this movie a worthwhile one. The acting is terrible, the camera footage is terrible and the acting is bad. If you're a fan of horror or comedy, you'll like this movie, but this movie has too many elements and not enough inspiration to make it worthwhile.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew from the first hour that "Sofca, the movie was about a person who is going to be turned into a monster... and it is all about going over to a certain part and then having some fun with it. But it doesn't, and I didn't care about the ending. What are we supposed to see in it: A couple who are going to try and break up on another marriage? This isn't even a "movie," it's a piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the entire show last night, hoping that it would be better. It was pretty awful. It didn't make any sense and they even went to the point of trying to make you care for the actors. I knew the first one was a pretty good actor (Sully), but the rest was really horrible. I've seen better and better actors. They didn't even get a shot, or even a chance to work again. I also wanted to end the show and see it cancelled, but I'm not sure if this movie will ever make it to that level of prominence. I give this movie 1 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to a film based on the "The Walking Dead" but I have to admit that I missed it. I saw the first episode but it was nothing compared to the original. I could almost hear the voices of the characters, but the acting isn't as good as the original actors, the sets are lousy, the locations are lousy and the scenery is awful.  If the first episodes were from the first film and then the second one from the second. Then it would be more interesting. But, I have a feeling that it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie I expected it would be decent, but not one of my favourites. The acting was bad, the direction was terrible, and the plot was ridiculous. I've never got so angry at something I saw in a movie in the last two years and this was no exception.  I'll be watching to see if someone has the guts to try it again, so that's my best advice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen in an independent film. It has absolutely no plot. I'm afraid I had no idea it was going to be such a bad film because of its "music". It is like they hired a musician to bring back the soundtrack to "Underwood", but put a different name. Well, it's better that it's just a simple action film of a guy who runs a big chain gang!  I know this movie was made so people could see it, but it's really bad, but I wouldn't want to see it. If I had a clue about the plot, I would take it and see it again, because it does not do any more than a casual action film, although it does manage to deliver. A lot of people, like me, say that movies have an ability to act, but this one does not. It does nothing but make absolutely no sense, unless you have nothing but the same talent that makes it work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a crap movie. It's obvious that the filmmakers knew what they were going to portray, but they still went far with the "gays". I was just a casual observer of the entire movie. There was so much in the movie that I could not take in all of the details. The movie was predictable and made no sense whatsoever! What a waste of time. I would have enjoyed this movie if it was about a real gangster killing people (as was supposed to be portrayed). Unfortunately, this movie was only about a murder of a person, and not the person(s) killing the people. Also, I have heard that it was just for "entertain" and was just some sort of fun. I don't understand it. Why waste your time on such a crappy movie? The characters seem to be the main stars, but there are no real plot lines. They just talk about a bunch of crazy people. The acting is poor, too. But at least it was not the same as a "real" gangster movie. The original movie was a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is horrible, no matter what movie. The script is pretty good, but it's bad when it comes down to the final punch. I was tempted to get it and I think that it was worth the money. But since you've seen the first one, and I'm not sure if it's even remotely remotely comparable to the second one. If the third one was great, it would be no matter how, not. It's just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of movie films and especially films directed or adapted from books, are filmed a few times and then edited to the point that the finished film is simply the "slips." A "slip" has some really good filmmakers--John Huston, David Blyton, Charles S.W. Griffiths, John Ford, Edward G. Lowe--but what do you really think? If you want to work a movie, you should work a story, shoot scenes, get scenes right. But if you want it to be more like the book, your best bet is to cut the crap out of it. This happens all too often. The filmmakers seem to think that the story would never happen the way they want it, and that the characters could never get there. It is almost like they want to make the book "true" so we can just throw the characters into a room and start filming. When the film goes in full-circle, it gets even worse. The characters are really stupid, the actors are really dumb and the dialog is really bad. I have never seen a movie with a storyline that made me so frustrated--it doesn't even seem like a movie--it is more like a collection of characters. The acting is flat and the scenes are not even coherent, the dialogue is too slow. The movie is really nothing like it is supposed to be and it looks like a big mess. You don't need to know anything about The Goons or the world of the novel to know that it's a bad film. I give this movie a 1 out of 10. But I did not know it was bad until I saw it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I like films that are different from the norm, and I think I prefer them to any other, and while this is no bad movie in itself, it just doesn't get me to watch it again. Some of the scenes are so clichéd, it doesn't even make me smile. This movie could have been better edited, as the filmmakers seem to be working on a tight budget. But I don't have to wait until it's lost its nerve. I've just seen this movie, and if I can't see it again I might not even understand why it ever existed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so terrible I decided to just give this one a rating:  The plot was so weak it had to be filmed by someone who is not a horror fan. I am an old school girl who can't even talk about horror movies. This was truly bad.  The only good thing was the acting. That was OK, especially in the scene that showed the girl's relationship with the person being attacked by the monster. I thought this could be interesting if it had some serious acting as well as some interesting special effects. The problem is that most of the special effects were used in this film, and they didn't even give the viewers a chance to see what the monster did. And the ending was just the excuse that the makers needed to continue the film as a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of the many sequels this film was, there were many subplots, and the movie ended on an empty plot.  This film could have been a brilliant sequel, but instead of going all out to get to the "climax" which should have been the main plot of the film, it ended on a little pointless plot. The movie did an alright job, but it is a shame that the sequels didn't go for a true ending, and instead go for one that isn't supposed to be the main story. I think that if we are going to get involved in this film we need to find out why a bunch of people are suddenly going to die. The first subplot is more interesting. The other one, sadly, was even more disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this film, i thought i'd have a good idea of what i was up to do to help my girlfriend. I was wrong. For the first 2 minutes i thought this film would be a fun way to watch "The Secret" while being watched at a movie theater. When the credits finally came out i thought to myself, this film is just like "The Big Wheel" without actually letting the audience know anything about it. For those looking for entertainment, this movie would be the absolute worst. Not only is it not a movie, it is a lame excuse for an excuse for a movie: It is just too much like a movie. The plot is too convoluted. The characters aren't even like the characters in "The Simpsons" for that, and the movie just screams for attention like a 2nd grade textbook. The fact that this movie was about a "secret" that "stole" everyone who saw it is laughable. The funny thing about this movie is that all of the actors in the film are actors in a bad TV show. The only thing that works is the dialog. It is obvious that this is not the way to write a movie about the subject. They just want to keep everyone else on the track by making a crappy film. If they had some decent actors, they would have put some good movie going on. In fact, they didn't. In this case, it was bad enough to be a movie instead of a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not going to get into the specifics, but the idea that there is no real difference between a good movie and a bad one is a poor argument.  I will give this brief summary; "Good" = good (for this film), "Bad" = bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a movie to get my mind-set set for, but I didn't find one. I went into it, and I decided to watch this one to find out if it is the right movie for me. I couldn't believe it was horrible. The plot was the worst I've seen in my entire life, and the characters had no chemistry whatsoever. I knew that they were the kinds of people who are too stupid to get into an exciting movie. I don't know how I managed to get through the whole thing, but the acting was OK, some good jokes, and some interesting (in an evil-jerk-like way) moments. But the story and dialog was so bad that I didn;t really care about it. I ended watching the movie at my friend's house and I tried to save myself. I had the same feeling during the whole movie, but after I left it, I didn`t know what I was going to do with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really horrible. I had some fun with my friends during the movie but I just couldn't care much for any characters or plot lines. I have the idea that most of the actors in this movie will be in their new movie "The Avengers" - it's so lame. I would really prefer "The Hulk" if it was a sequel to this movie.  If you're going to see this movie, avoid it. If you liked it, you might enjoy it more. But, this movie is just a waste of time. The only reason I gave it a 1 is that it was so weak and predictable that you would really enjoy it as a TV movie. I didn't find any good actors or characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a waste of the story. In fact, the biggest issue with the film is that the story is really dumb. In some way, this film is better than some of the movies I watch and love. But the filmmakers really fell asleep on their job. If they had the opportunity to develop the story with the actual story, it would have turned out better than it is now. The other movie actors might have been better than the characters in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just discovered the badness of this movie: its low-budget, low-plot, low budget, and no plot whatsoever. I've seen more action movies in a day than this movie, so I don't know exactly why this is. The acting isn't as good as usual, the plot is lousy, and the movie is so slow it's hard to keep watching it. My guess is that this is a horror movie that was made in a big-box of a bunch of people, and there was a big production company involved, but that also means the movie might have not much money. The actors who do it are so unappealing as it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I have ever seen that was awful. This movie is a complete waste of time, if you're going to waste your time, avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a total d - if the producers wanted to keep something interesting. It would have been more interesting that this would be a comedic film with an old fashioned story. However, with no humor, it is not a comedy film. And with no humour is a bad film. I would have rated this one 3 out of ten because it is a completely cliché-ridden film. The story does not develop. There is no story but instead a bunch of jokes, which makes no sense. The film is an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a theory to explain how this film was created. Firstly, the premise is stupid. The man on the bridge is actually one of the characters, and he needs to have the rest of the cast act as "he was a killer of sorts". Secondly, it doesn't really have a storyline, except for the fact that we know who is the main character, which is a huge relief. The film isn't a true horror film, it just panders.  There is a strange scene where the actor is playing a carousel, and the camera is actually moving around and filming everything in front of the carousel. When we see the car, we are looking at everything, and it looks like he's moving around like he wants to stop moving, and when he sees another car in front, he just tries to stop that car. I think it was just one of several scenes that couldn't make it look as they wanted. Perhaps the editing is bad, because the movie is so horrible, I'm sure it was done to make the film look like it was. If you are watching it on the DVD, do so, don't bother with the editing. This film has absolutely nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife was the co-owner of the show and as the co owner of it. I can't say that it was bad but I can tell that it wasn't. It was a poor show, but I do admit that it did improve with some of the elements of the shows that made it so great. Some of the scenes made me laugh like a joke when they occurred and the plot was bad, but the cast didn't help anything. We were looking forward to watching the show again when it was made and had nothing to do with it. The casting was terrible and the acting was worse than mediocre. I would stay away from watching this show and avoid seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies that are out of even the most violent of us. If I hadn't heard from any other person than the one that tells me to shut it down: The movie is a big rip off of the movie The Expendables. It's not even close to the original. The main character, Luke Skywalker, is pretty much the villain from The Phantom Menace. This movie has nothing to do with the original film, and the plot is just about as shallow as it is with that one. I am surprised that this film doesn't get a good rating from either of the "comics" forums. I'm very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad, it tries to make all the characters in the film sympathetic and then comes back to the badness after the first 30 minutes of the movie. It is a terrible way to show the relationship between the parents and the kids. We know the story of one of the parents in this film, so we can see how horrible it is that one of these characters would ever have the chance to have a loving relationship with his children. The movie is just about being a family with kids who are in need of some sort of human interaction, so that it can't be real. It's an excuse to let a man get an abortion and make his wife have a son who then lives with him, but it doesn't really have a happy ending.  The ending of this movie is disappointing, because a lot of people who are normally nice will find it difficult to live with the family. That's not the ending of the film though, it is the end of the story. A lot of movies are about showing a couple who have so much money to spend to buy nice things, but that doesn't happen, because it doesn�t have any story to end. That is a fact of life, it doesn.� 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As much as I can afford to watch the movie, I'm willing to throw it into the garbage bin. But I am having to put it out. Not really.  My first point is that I don't understand the plot of this movie. There is no plot. I know that it's supposed to be an action movie, but it's just an excuse for a little show. The script is poorly written, it just looks like it was written by a couple of friends that decided to play together. There are some lines that are pretty funny, but the rest are just a lot of the same clichés that were in the first movie.  The movie is about a drug dealer who wants to get high and get involved with some very famous famous names, like a couple who can score some money but is not quite the ones they want. So there are some pretty ridiculous scenes and a really bad one with a naked male hanging on the dock. It's really not very creative, but just for an hour's fun.  Also, the female acting was pretty bad. Not all that difficult, but still, it does not make a convincing case for a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is completely stupid and disgusting. It's really not a comedy, or a comedy. Even a few minutes of watching is making me uncomfortable. You should be a proud person and watch movies that are better than this one. Why did they put so much of the cast in the story? Why couldn't they use one of those actors that worked on the film? If they did, you would probably be more satisfied than the rest of the audience. It should have been written out of a novel, not a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just so dumb. I mean, I don't really understand why anyone would get this movie for a release. Even the cast is too little.  The plot is so stupid, and the script is just SO bad, the acting is bad, it's just plain bad, not even the fact that the movie is about a family of four young kids.  If you get to watch this movie, just sit on a boring hour and watch yourself blow the whole thing off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found out this movie after seeing it on the MTV channel and thought that it would be interesting to see a female comedian who would talk to a reporter who has nothing to lose in the fight, but in the end is nothing special and just another piece of waste on this movie.  The plot is bad, the characters are predictable, and the end ends are disappointing. If you have to see it at all I recommend you avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love watching this film but not for what it is about. I think if I wanted to see a "classic" comedy film, I would go on a tour and pick out a movie on my list that does not suck. But this is pretty bad in it's own right. I can't understand how a person that has such a bad ego would be making such a movie. I am going to call it the "worst movie ever made". No one ever got that much money or talent for a big play. I would have hoped that it would have been more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a complete waste of pretentious Hollywood pretenses. The main characters are either oblivious or dead, leaving the viewer oblivious. If you wanted to watch a movie by that premise you would be on your knees. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was nothing to like. The plot was predictable but the plot failed to deliver. It's the only movie I have ever seen that was completely pointless and uninteresting.   I have to wonder if it's any way that these filmmakers felt this movie. It was the most bad part of this movie I've ever seen. This movie is about the one who stole the money for an apartment and got to own it, so this is about how he goes down. He doesn't actually kills the wife and he doesn't really go into a relationship with her.  I'm sorry I couldn't see all of the action, but I do agree to watch it just because it's worth saving the $25 and it wasn't even that bad! I'm glad I didn't have to sit through the whole movie to see it but I can see a couple more episodes later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Great Experiment" is a typical attempt at a "supernatural" horror film with no plot, no plot and no special effects. The plot is about a woman who is taken by the scientist who claims to be the reincarnation of "God" and a pregnant woman. She tries to resist her new God who wants to take her mother's body and she tries to persuade her not to take it. After she is possessed by the god (the "superman") she wants to destroy the body of the mother, but she can't get rid of the God's spirit because of the way it used her. When the women dies it is so slow and weak that we can only wonder why they went through such tortuous motions.  This is the reason this film has been so terrible. The writer (Sauli) used this film for a few years until it was not scary anymore and was simply a "wack of a good film". When the sequel finally came out, Saul's production team had so much fun making the film and decided to throw out all the bad things. They just didn't want to waste the original movie. They tried so hard to make the film an interesting film but the only reason they gave a negative rating was because they used this awful film as a mere appetitive way to sell it. The only way the film turned out was to be incredibly shallow. It had so little to do that I think the filmmakers should have kept this title until it made it worthwhile.  I am sorry to say I have never bought this movie: I bought it and I just couldn't put it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad, really bad. It's just horrible. The acting was OK, but the story was bad. The story was really bad and the storyline was terrible. The movie was a big disappointment to see.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only in the history of movies with such much heart and talent but it has been a huge waste of money and a waste of time. It is stupid to even look at a movie that is so terrible in this matter. It doesn't have any value because the only thing that it does is just to make you angry. The story is not even good and the acting is so bad that you will even wonder why people are even trying to make films such as this one.  In the case of movies such as "Dancing with the Alien", the acting was so bad you wonder why it was possible to actually make a movie with such low talent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are times where films just keep going and going and never stop. They're not good but they do a few moments that have gone past what I felt is the essence of the movie - some sort of a tragedy that someone is dying and having a family that couldn't help him in the end. The story of his friend - the one who has come to understand that he's suffering as well as he is - is obviously no different.  The film's central theme of the relationship between a person and a person in love with another is not done well. There's too much going for it without any substance. And, unfortunately, there are times when you just decide you have to get it and make it better. You get tired watching the two friends. And when you get tired, there's nothing to take away from you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story has many confusing elements, especially in its final scenes. It's only in a minor area, but they do not fit well in their surroundings. The acting is substandard. The idea of a group of people having to work to bring back the child has nothing to do with the fact that the group has to work for months and have little to do. The fact that they have to build a community is unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a horrible film in the "B" category with a horrible ending. It was painful to watch as the characters suffered horrible wounds. The whole story seemed pointless. A few scenes were extremely annoying and in some others were too boring to keep the audience, which would have been better if they would have added a couple of interesting scenes. The acting seemed to have an effortless feel of a film, and there was little to recommend.  This film had nothing to recommend whatsoever. The movie should not be recommended, and if people are lucky enough to have the "X" category of films, it's definitely better to avoid them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an utter failure. I was very disappointed to find this film to be on the list of movies on my list. I mean that's about the first time I have ever watched a film that was truly bad (the only time I've ever seen). This is simply not funny and is simply a ridiculous movie about a bunch of stupid people, who are forced to stay in their hometown (an island in a town that is obviously not their hometown, they must not see this film in the future) for a little test of their ability to overcome not making themselves a better version of the dumb town people from the 1960s and from a horrible car-to-car, low-budget video games, and the old fart of the world. If you see this movie and you wish it could be used as a joke, then go and make your own movie. If not, you will see it as an extremely boring "movie". A waste of money and time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bunch of friends are having a "party" at the local bar that evening (they've turned into a bunch of weird punsters) and one of them decides to go naked into the bathroom... (it's an embarrassment to watch!) This is, to use an expulsive, dirty word, not really funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed so hard when watching this movie. I had no expectations. I would not expect this to be a hit, and I didn't care about the other actors. But I guess it wasn't, because it was only a dumb piece of work, which was bad enough to deserve an Oscar. The acting was bad, even for a child actor. The directing was bad. It was just a bad attempt to make a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is based on the same basic plot, that of a school principal who wants to teach his students a lesson on racism. But instead of doing the job, they send the kids to a black inner-city school that teaches how to humiliate black people and use this new racist idea that has never been in place. As a result, the kids are taught how to stop people in the wake of racism (e. the anti-segregation of the 1930s). This is a horrible piece of garbage that doesn't even exist in America. It makes no sense to say this, but I suppose that's not a comment on it. I don't know how it got to the point where it would have to be a movie, but the way it was released was pretty damn terrible. In the end I think they just wanted to get a little money on the DVD with this awful piece of racism. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I was new to the movie world and I was a big fan of the movie "Fool the Boys" (1991). I thought I would like to see a movie that was directed by a talented director like Jim Carrey. Well, I was disappointed when I went into the movie. I thought they wasted their time in "Fools 2". While this was a totally disappointing movie, it still made me laugh a little bit because I felt like I was being treated like an idiot. I think "Focks 2" was just plain dumb. It wasn't even funny. I just couldn't care about it. It was just an over-hyped, pointless film. It had absolutely nothing to recommend. The only real point in this movie was the lack of any real plot. The plot was horrible, and it didn't even have a sense of "plot". The only reason I saw it was because I was so obsessed with it that I just had to go and see it. I was completely left out of any sense of intelligence, and I didn't think it had any substance. The fact that the movie was so dumb is because I honestly thought the actors were great. I gave the movie 8 out of 10. It's just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad I can only manage to find my way through it and to tell you, it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. At least one of the actors (Lorne Michaels) is a good actor and she is funny, the other actors (Natalie Wigg) were good but when the film was released I was disappointed with how many actors and people was involved in the film, I was really sick when the characters got cast in it. It's OK for a small independent movie (for example I can't understand why people are buying this movie) but a lot of the people involved are terrible actors, I can guarantee this movie will only make the top 5 list because of the bad acting and the horrible director. This movie would have been great if the actors were much better. I don't know how anyone else could have made such a bad piece of junk. I thought this movie was just a little bit better but I think it's OK if you are a person that likes movies but I donít find anything else better than this crappy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the early 80's, the film had a very strange look and sound and special effects for a bad film. The only way to keep a positive mood from this movie is to turn it into a horror film which I would NEVER see in a real film.  Most of the acting is pretty bad and the only plot elements that actually made it work were a monster and a little girl who turns into a monster in order to help a mad man (this is the film where the original 'Mummy" is shown, not the original Mummy) or a 'deviant' monster. That plot and the fact that it is a 'thug type' makes it sound even worse.  I'm really sick to think about how the producers were so stupid to waste so much time on this film. How they got a decent budget is very difficult to tell.  If you are in the mood for something that only makes you mad and have some decent gore and gore, this is probably not a bad thing. I would suggest watching a horror movie as a kid, and if you are under an age, watch a horror comedy instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the characters in the series had more substance, the story would have developed to something more compelling. Unfortunately the lack of dialog proved to be quite annoying in the way it was written. If the series was a documentary with some decent camera work, the situation would have been far more entertaining. As it stands, the first series finale, has much more substance and could have been a lot more entertaining with much more compelling dialog. The plot lacked the necessary depth to make the scenes more meaningful.  For example, the infamous 'Dori' is a completely pointless character - he never shows his true colors! The scene where he meets the 'Dejadi' is just so ridiculous. I didn't even get into it until the end. The story is so incredibly predictable, I couldn't even enjoy it for two hours. The ending of the first (unstaged) series is also pretty poor.  I did get the sense that the main plot would have added quite a lot of new material with some better direction. However, the rest of the series is absolutely horrid and it simply doesn't have any purpose. A lot of characters from the first one can only be considered as a mere carbon copy of the previous characters - i.e. 'the bad guys'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been following this film ever since it first aired. However, I decided to see it after seeing the film on Showtime with a friend. I couldn't believe that this movie is one of those stupid yet popular movies that I've never seen. The acting is bad, the plot is terrible, the story isn't even consistent, and the entire thing is just stupid. Even if you're a hardcore viewer, you will not be able to enjoy this film. If you watch the original, you'll realize that this was a cheap copy of the original. The movie is so bad that I won't be watching it again. I will never recommend this movie to anyone and I'd rather spend a few hours watching something else, such as The Shaw Brothers, and be insulted by someone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to confess to myself that I have no sympathy for the plot, its characters, any actors, or anyone else involved in this film. I am totally ashamed of the casting choices, and I am ashamed of any of the movie-making team's lack of talent. The fact that this movie got past the small budgets of the film industry means that no one could have possibly made this movie. And I wish I hadn't, so I can't forgive it's failure. I'm sorry to see that this is yet another of the awful, boring, and stupid "blockbusters" that we need to protect from.  If you decide to go see this, do so, do it early, and leave it alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is, like, another example of a movie that's made, with no plot, a story (a story) and a plot, with that plot completely lacking, no connection, no reason to anything (more on this point), and no actual story.  What we get is just a bunch of ridiculous scenes of ridiculous, ridiculous acts, with people, for example, running a gas engine for more than a couple minutes, or shooting a gun. Why do they get to that point? There is no story, they are completely out of control and without reason, with nothing to connect anything to anything, and the ending seems to be completely ridiculous.  I was watching this with my husband, and we both agreed, they were completely ridiculous and there is nothing to explain.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed by this movie: it was nothing new, but in this movie you get the feeling that it is a low budget movie. It is nothing new. It's not interesting. It was very predictable, and very boring. It never really made any sense. It didn't even make any sense, and at the end it felt like a movie was over, and I had really gotten a little bored. This movie does not really take place in the world of "normal" films. It just tries to keep you busy with pointless material and tries to force you to spend some time in this one. It tries to be funny and it is very predictable... but not much of any humor. I had no real reason to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest problem with this movie: it isn't good enough to even make it a movie. There is no dialog, no character's dialogue, no plot, no real conflict. I'd have to imagine an action movie to capture what the characters in this movie can do, which is the only thing that could save this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are many reasons for this movie to be a disaster. The plot is so poorly written, so the story is so bad, I am unsure if you really believe the story. The movie was horrible.   The ending was just horrible, so they must've filmed some of the scenes so they can try to bring the movie to a better ending. Unfortunately they didn't. They made the ending more complicated and just made the movie worse. The idea of the movie is stupid, but the ending was so bad it made me watch it twice.  There's absolutely nothing good to be found in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, the movie was bad and the ending was good, but the characters were the worst in any of the movie. The only good thing I got from it was my favorite love interest (the guy) and the other guy, the guy from the high school. However, I felt sorry for the actors and the actresses in this film, because they didn't have the same kind of talent as the characters in the movie because I feel like they didn had nothing. The movie had a little bit of humor, but I don't think it was that. It just wasn't that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a boy who is involved in a serial murder plot, who kills his friends and is now believed to have killed a lot of people. The rest of the characters are pretty good, but after every time they make their way back to where they're hiding the man is dead...  I felt that even the best actors would be too much trouble for this movie. And even the scenes where the characters were trying to escape in the snow had nothing to do with that. They were just stupid. The story had some good moments though... for example the scene where the guy is explaining his story in his cell is pretty good and funny, but it just takes some lines out of place and just ends with a huge shock when the cell is locked down. There are some decent characters in the movie, but they don't even make it look right for a movie. They all look ridiculous and stupid. Also the ending is really bad. There was something about the villain's scheme that made me believe that he was going to blow up a tank and that was not the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the biggest slap in the face of the whole movie genre. In this movie, the female actors are the most shallow and uninspiring actors in the history. This movie is so bad that I felt like throwing out my hands to make copies of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was the worst horror film I have ever seen.   The director apparently cannot conceive life. I don't know why he made this movie and it really shouldn't be a surprise that he can't. He's got an excuse to show to the world that there's a reason why people go to horror movies for entertainment. You get to see this sort of film and you just watch it and it just ends the fun. Then it just leaves you empty. The actors are bad. They don't make characters like they're supposed to. They are flat. The plot is bad. The story is bad because there is no suspense. It's so bad that there are no actors that make you care about the characters.  So you get what you expected from this film and then you just wish you never get involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was awful. I had a laugh in most of the scenes but when the characters died, I was laughing for half the time. If there was any reason to watch this film, it wouldn't be good. It had nothing to do with any real plot. I really just thought I needed to sit there and see if this movie had any plot. The idea of killing people in a big house would be interesting if it was realistic. I felt like someone in a small room and I was told not to kill people. I think they might have to have filmed in a room or a small house. If this is true, then a lot of people should be ashamed. I'm glad I will not watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first got the idea of "The Secret Life of Children" I was disappointed but the idea was so awesome I was not very disappointed. I thought the entire premise of the movie was "unbelievable and ridiculous" but it turned out that they did nothing except for a few few scenes. The plot is just the same as "The Monster of Red Scorpion" and it was not even close to the level that I expected. If I had the opportunity to re-watch these movies I would have done so many times, but I didn't. I do not believe in the concept of this movie and I do hope that this will not be a horror film, but it does need to make some money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just about a week in when I had a movie: 'Leverage'....I watched it at school when I was 14, and it's a terrible, bad movie, about a little girl who goes into the town to find a strange woman who wants to kill her. What she does with the little girl is just plain stupid. I've watched it twice, but I can't really say anything new about it. It would have been a pretty funny movie, had some elements that could have worked in a movie of this type, but it just didn't work.  The acting wasn't great, although most of the movie's actors were decent. And the movie didn't much match reality. There was no real plot, which made this movie a fun watch. It just made lots of noise and lots of people angry. The director obviously thought he needed a plot, but there wasn't one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like to see a nice, fun movie that can include a number of hilarious jokes and lots of sex or some of the characters doing stuff that makes you cringe. But this movie does not provide enough humor, there is no good joke, nothing funny, and no fun. It's just too bad that this movie was the biggest movie to fail at. I couldn't even laugh. The plot is extremely predictable and there are no twists. The characters are a lot of stupid stereotypes that are in fact stupid. I don't even know what these people mean. I didn't know why a big company would release a movie that's so bad. This movie isn't even funny but it isn't bad either. You're just wasting your time watching something that is bad but also not funny. A movie that has to be at least 30 minutes to watch will always be missed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's the difference between this movie and a "classic" movie like "Fantastic Voyage." It's so bad that even a movie with all the ingredients of a great movie (like "The Naked Ray" and "The Lost Zone" which could have made this a movie, if they had done it the way this one is filmed) and made this horrible movie. If you want a real movie, "The Island of Dr. Frankenstein" is the best choice. This movie was not even good in its own time (like this year's "Majorettes"). I'm a real fan of this movie, but it didn't help much. Also, it can't help with a movie like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't see this film in America until I saw it in England. What a shame, as I've read this movie over the years, that this movie was released without a "modern" screening. The title was a blatant attempt to promote it by claiming it was a "classic" movie. Well, in the end it was not. The original plot was very simple, as you might expect. You have an old father who comes back and a kid who comes home to visit her, while the old woman is about to go in to her husband's care, and the little girl is a kid, and this is so typical of a bad film to even begin to realize that it's not that bad, it's just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing more than just plain trash, with no plot, no story, no characters, no storyline. I have to admit that watching this film was really disappointing, especially since I've done more with the movies than this one. The acting was pretty bad, mostly because the acting is a little bit more than decent (though this is the case for most movies, anyway). There were a few amusing scenes, which was the most disappointing part of the movie. The two girls and the family were funny, but then they were all in the same garbage movie. There were some scenes that were pretty good, but the lack of action, as much as it would not take a genius to figure out what was happening in the film, was bad. I give this film 2/10 because I still think it was better than the movie they were trying to make. At least it was pretty funny, though there are few scenes worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had read about this movie and was interested to see it. I went on a trip to the city and caught it on TV. I was disappointed and left it on my DVD player, and I left it after a little while, so that I can't watch it any more. I'm surprised that I actually bought it, but I decided to watch it just for the lack of any entertaining factor. The plot of this movie, I couldn't tell you how exactly it worked. It's like the plot of a horror film. What do you expect from a horror movie? No. You'll see a lot of gore. What did you expect? No, you'd just be sucked into a really stupid movie, and that was the point. Oh my gosh, it wasn't scary at all. This movie was actually very stupid. There was an interesting plot, but in the end it just boiled too much down to a really bad movie. That's all the movie was. Nothing really worth watching, except for perhaps, for those who wanted to learn more about this. I am very disappointed that I didn't see this movie on the video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What the hell!?  I rented this movie because I've always been fascinated with documentaries. But this movie just doesn't fit any of my past ideas. I had the same idea as the guy in the movie with Steve Martin's "The Devil Wives"--that documentaries would have made me angry. I laughed for several minutes while watching the first 2 minutes of the movie, then just waited until the end when the film abruptly ends.  The plot is totally predictable and just plain stupid--all the characters do nothing except talk about the same dumb topic ("how dumb the world is" "The movie was an example of that). It was OK at the end, but the way you can laugh at a bad documentary is pretty simple--you can laugh because you're not in the mood to laugh. This movie has got to be a "cathater" (I have no clue why the movie is so hard to laugh at). If I hadn't paid, I would definitely watch it once, but I couldn't care for all the crap that came after the end.   I give it 4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well I didn't really think the movie would go for anything on this list, but I do consider it "a very poorly filmed, badly made, poorly acted movie". There was nothing special or outstanding about the movie, except the plot was weak in some spots and the characters seemed extremely shallow, especially the female protagonist. I can see what the writer intended when she decided to "write the book", though, it didn't work out, even though the ending was very well written, the characters were only average.   I thought the ending could be interesting with a story like a real person, though, the main thing I don't like is that it doesn't really happen, so there's nothing to make this movie stand out. The acting and acting was OK, though I have to think that a lot of the actors had their hair in the movie to try their acting, which I'd like to see in other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There are only some jokes and a few funny scenes, but the rest of the movie is about making people mad with a bunch of people.  This movie can't even keep a straight face, making people laugh at the horrible things that happen to us everyday. The plot is only a couple of scenes about a guy who is attacked and almost killed by a huge gang, and then later on a guy is killed by an ape who is threatening some guys in the cave and later on by a person who gets the upper hand with a bat and decides to eat it and then kills his partner's girlfriend, then tries to kill everyone in the area that got it from the ape. And then on the next day it is about killing a guy that is killed on a movie set by a giant zombie and then killing some guy in a house and then raping the person that made the zombie zombie and the monster that killed the guy. So it goes and repeats all the same things, except for that this movie doesn't last long enough for either of the actors in the movie.  I would like to say that this show is going to get canceled, but instead of going to production I think you should take it as a test to see if it is good or bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just wanted to rent "The Surfingers" from a video store after seeing it in the "Mysteries" segment at The Blue Night Pentathlon TV program, and I thought it would be interesting to see a real movie of this sort. But, I was disappointed after I went through it. I really didn't understand the script. The story is basically meaningless--all the characters are the same, but the characters aren't involved in anything, and they don't even make an appearance in the movie. It just doesn't add up to anything except that it is stupid. And I thought the ending was totally stupid, too much too quick. What I thought was missing was a lot of nudity. If you're a sexologist like me, you'll never find this movie. There were a few scenes of a naked woman in her underwear, and one scene of a bare woman with her underwear so she was obviously dressed in underwear. And there was one scene where the women who was getting penetrated looked like she had no underwear, so she could see her nipple in it. And it looked like the guy was sucking her nipple! She didn't look like that in the scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why people are surprised about this movie. I didn't care for it, but I did. When it was shown in America in 1979, it seemed like a great piece of film making. It is absolutely nothing like that. In fact, this movie was only for two years. I watched the first film at a charity, and had to watch the second in an airport lounge. I have nothing but contempt for this movie and its effects. This movie was really bad. This is just the kind of movie you see every year. If it could've been an actual story, a real story, I would have said it was good. But it is really nothing, nothing. When I watch it, I don´t want to see another movie about something like this. In my opinion, this is the worst film I have ever seen. I know what this movie is about and I can´t to wait to see it again. I wouldn´t recommend watching it and watching it again again. It didn´t make much sense either. It´s no way it does not have a meaning to anyone but me. This should have been removed. It shouldn´t have been made the same, if for all. This stupid movie must not be shown again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to agree with the idea that this is "hardcore" acting, although it's hard to do so as a film about contemporary urban life. While I disagree with the statement that "the director's vision of the audience is that of 1950's" as such, it seems to me that this film is no such thing. I don't think this is any more original. I just can't sit through this movie. I really don't know whether director Martin Scorsone will have any more films after the fall out of "Crazy Taxi". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie a little difficult to take. It's so bad it keeps me wondering why I would see it again. I've done one of those three movies in my life, so this one was like that. I had to turn my eyes toward the subtitles and I watched every minute in it. It wasn't even entertaining for the whole movie. It was almost like watching a movie starring a dog. The actors were flat. They barely seemed alive, but they kept repeating the same face over and over. There was one scene that really caught my attention. It seemed like a dog biting on a dog that was a big one. And I don't want to know what happened to the dog. But I had the same thought with the dog-bit scene. It just happened so quickly that I never even really paid attention to it.  The characters were so bad I really didn't care about it. In the scenes I did look up to see if it was funny or not. What the heck?  I don´t see the big-name funny guy to see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this movie is that I felt like it didn't take place. The movie would have to be an anti-gabola film and I think it is. It's just a few minutes of action but not much. There were some very entertaining scenes but they are completely absent from the movie.  This movie is a bit disappointing. It was an interesting premise and I expected it to be interesting but it didn`s just a bunch of people. They don`t do much except they are some sort of alien or one of the aliens in this movie. That is just boring. I also found it hard to understand. It really isn`t that hard to believe. The film is just the way they want to make a film and they did that with a few jokes and a few weird moments but nothing special. There is nothing that stands out. I think they should have done a better job with making the movie and it wouldn`t be a worse film if they just tried to get money instead of giving away money. The whole movie is full of garbage and that was made abundantly clear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just finished watching this movie at midnight (after 4 or so I guess) and couldn't find the reason why it was awful. The plot is pretty bad, the dialogue is pretty dumb, the movie is way better than any movies I've ever seen, but then we learned the ending...  I thought it was a bit ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an effort to show how a person with a big name and a huge body can be a loser in life. It's nothing, really, it doesn't work. It doesn't even seem like it matters to me and I didn't even think twice before seeing it. For starters, the movie is obviously not set in the world of the original film. It focuses on a single character and the movie revolves around a few moments of a real person's downfall. So if the original movie had characters to look at, I'm glad there were some in it to make the point. Unfortunately, it really just goes on in circles. A person named Mr. B. Berkley was one of the characters in the original, and a man named G. Berkie was an extra. They don't even talk about the events of their lives anymore. They talk about a bunch of other characters, and the main character is apparently a man who fell off on the beach, apparently because he was drunk and used his fists in an attempt to take advantage of his situation. And they do some pretty terrible things to the others. And when Mr. Berk-Berley falls off, it does look like there is some more to it. And to some viewers, they will see that that the person who felloff is a loser who was kicked in to life by Mr. G. and was made to die by Mr.. Berkley. If they liked it, they might not think that it was bad.  In the end of the movie, you get some more interesting things to do, including an attempt at making a couple. You get a shot at getting into the "big boys" locker, and you do some sort of game with the couple. It seems like you are doing the same thing, but when you finally make that connection it just doesn't make any sense. They are simply not a real couple, and there is no real connection to the other character.  It can't make up much of the other things you're doing with the character(s) other than what we already know. They can't be real relationships with each other, and it's just a buncha hickies who go around the whole time. There's nothing but scenes to show the characters as human beings, even if you want to make a case for that movie's authenticity.  But when the characters are supposed to be in charge of saving the day, I don't think they are. They
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm the biggest fan of horror films from Italy and that's why I would like so much of the rest of the cast to make it a movie. However, this one doesn't live up to its reputation. I have never had a negative word about a horror film in my life, but this one was the worst I have ever seen.   If you were to see this film, you would have to spend hours of your time making it. While it has some good moments, it does not come anywhere close to the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a disaster. It was a film that had bad dialog, bad scenes, bad acting and a horrible plot. I couldn't believe that the director, the writer and the writer cared enough to make this piece of trash. It's bad enough that this film is a remake of a bad horror movie in a lame attempt at satire. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I'm scared of seeing him in this movie"  After this little film was released, I'm surprised that so many people had to see it. I'm not sure that I missed it at all. The acting was horrible, and there was no character development. The fact that the story was based on a real tragedy is interesting, but there was only a ridiculous amount of backstory.  I didn't like this movie, but for those who liked it, I have to see the sequel and give them credit. I just can't believe that people would pay money for a movie that has such awful writing and bad effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a film, "Sleeving the Edge" starring a fictional character named William Ewold (I didn't realize until I saw it) who was forced to jump into some supernatural creatures. But when it was finally released in 2010, I couldn't wait to see it in the theaters, so that I tried to watch it alone. When I watched it, I didn't care for any of the characters (except for the lead, William Ewart).  I decided to watch the film because it looked really bad--I didn'n even care for the characters in the film. The film just felt like a typical horror film--the camera movements were poorly faked and the characters had no discernable human features. The plot had some good points, but the characters were completely wooden. The characters were just there to make the audience believe, not any human characters. I thought that William Ewin was the "villain" who stole the girl's body. But it didn't really seem like that to me.  I think it could've been a lot better than a cheap, low budget horror film about a mysterious monster that kidnaps a young girl. But the plot is OK, it has a decent storyline. The acting was good, although the acting was bad and the story was pretty boring. The story lacked any real suspense or action and it didn`t really go far.  But the movie also failed to have any real meaning. At least one person (the girl with the mask) was killed. At best, William, William had to stay alive and she didn`T have to die.   I can't really blame the producers for making a movie like this. They should have known better. They obviously wanted to portray the story of William Ewing more effectively. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first time watching this movie was when I watched it at The Book Store. Then I watched again when I was in the theater. What happened to this movie? The plot was decent, but the acting was terrible. At The Bookstore, it wasn't that bad...at least, I didn't think bad. At the movie theater, it was a piece of garbage. At home, I'd much prefer the movie with a storyline.  The plot is so bad it's really depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that this was some sort of low-budget movie of some sort. This was really a terrible film...all of the dialogs were terrible. It could have been a decent film if someone decided to make it a "classic". It wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first exposure to this movie was quite surprising. I thought I was going to be able to get to know the characters. In fact, I wasn't. I never found the character to be anything more than a flat girl who was very stupid, and, of course, she got to the point a couple times. There are few girls who have that kind of character in the world. Even a handful of the truly talented actors can't manage to do so badly.  When the actors weren't so good, the movie seemed to lose some of its charm. The acting wasn't great but it wasn't awful at all.  The plot was pretty dull. It didn't come together as a coherent movie with plot lines, in fact only a handful. The movie didn't seem very effective, and the ending was pretty predictable. And the end was a huge waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a movie that does not deserve to be called "I'm A Serious Movie: In A Nasty Time". I can guarantee you'll see the movie twice. As far as the plot goes, the whole movie was predictable and pointless, and the ending was painful to watch.  But this was the first movie I have ever seen that I didn't even finish.  The acting was awful, and I don't think the actors even tried to get into a character that is supposed to be more intelligent than the movie itself, and this movie is no exception. It had no clear direction, no real plot, and even though it is an Oscar nominee, the acting is bad enough to not deserve such an award.  If the ending is a "one of a few minutes" and there's a chance to save the movie (and maybe a lot more), this movie simply can't hold your attention to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband was so angry to see it I couldn't even pay attention. It was like watching another person try to tell you all about a film made by people who have nothing but the good old instincts... I couldn´t understand why it was called "A Nightmare of A Nightmare: Nightmare for a Dream".... A Nightmare for A Nightmare was the worst movie I've seen since "Porrotta." "A nightmare for a dream" was one of the worst things I've ever seen. It would have been better to call it "Oscar of Omen" or a sequel to "Omen.") There are only two things I would have liked to say about this movie. Firstly, my husband and I have never really liked "Olympus." (And this film would be better if they named "Olamus".) Secondly, it's one of those movies that has some very serious acting that isn't even from this generation. "A Night to Dream" is one of our biggest failures as a film series. (In the case of the other "Olimpus" movies, "Lobes" has more serious acting than the average "Olivus.") This is just a bad case of a bad film... If you want to make your own independent horror movie, do yourself a lot of reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of time and money. It is only 2/5 stars in a bad category. It's a waste of talent and money! If you saw it coming from any film: don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The idea behind this film is that if the plot is correct, a movie would be an effort to save the lives of the people who were killed on May 17, 2001, by a new monster. I don't think it was intended to be that, and the way it plays out is so ridiculous it's hilarious.  The film is horrible in terms of plot development. The characters are so horrible they don't even try to act the parts they have been trained for. The fact that this movie was released by Universal doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those films that I am tired of having to watch every year. The movie is nothing but a pile of garbage. It's so bad it's hard to say.  It is bad not only that it's bad, but that it doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sure it was just the wrong movie. It's not like the movie I remember it being when I watched it in 2004. There was no chemistry, no interesting situations. The idea of making a movie about a man that killed his wife and daughter and then killed another couple of women was simply stupid. There wasn't much in the way of development in either direction. What was interesting in this movie were the supporting cast, but they were woeful at their job. There is an interesting scene where an officer comes onto the scene with the family to be executed, and while the family is getting ready to receive their bodies, there are the police officers. Not only was there no chemistry but they seemed to be making some real points. There seemed to have been an overall theme and a plot, but the story was too shallow and not interesting enough to continue to care about the story. This movie is simply too dumb to be watched. Avoid this movie at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have a small sense of sadness that this was the only film I saw that made me cry I was wrong. I've always enjoyed watching a movie with very low, almost non-existent characters and when the director made this film, I decided that it would not be an example of that. For that reason I did not feel compelled to like this movie. What was the movie about? Well I do not know. I did however see two scenes which were obviously based on the real life of the actors which had nothing to do with the movie except that they had a good time and there was a fairly good cast. However, the plot failed to make any believable. There is absolutely nothing to make you believe in the story except for a couple of scenes which may or not have had any importance to the movie but I would guess they were just the sort of scenes that I made in my old house or another local movie house and have seen many times in the real world. This movie was so bad that I had to leave my own house and turn to the local movie theater where the actors are sitting and see if it could have been filmed in another location. When I left I could not believe how bad it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few minutes into the film and the first time we see a car falls off and we are surprised to discover that it has been stolen and has been brought back. When we find out that they were stealing and what they were doing in this world, we are horrified to see that they had been doing that for 30 years. I have just read another movie where a car is stolen for 20 years and the next movie shows them taking the car away and putting it back again. I am a pretty serious fan of sci-fi, so it would be nice if somebody could work some magic and put a time-travel movie to the genre that doesn't involve car theft and is a bit more believable. However, this film just does not fit the genre. I thought the car was a very interesting way of talking about the car, but the fact that it was made only made me want to skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was a bad film but when I watched it I didn't notice it until I looked at it closely.   The plot is very simple and predictable. There is no plot. It contains the usual stuff that is so annoying for teenagers in the US to see on the TV. There are some of the usual clichés, such as a girlfriend's sister's boyfriend killing her and the boyfriend being killed by his sister's girlfriend. But I would have to agree to assume that these are clichés to some of these teens.  But the plot is still pretty stupid and the characters aren't interesting. At least some of them have some good lines. But what are the characters doing when you don't have any? I was very curious and curious to see how they interact with each other.  The girl is pretty good at talking but only has a couple of scenes. I thought she had some good parts but only a few scenes that I thought were a bit interesting.  Overall the film seems to be missing some of its intended targets. It is probably a poor effort to make sure people know the basic story and some parts they should know from. If you are expecting a film of a true story, like "Losing Wish" with the ending and a lot of interesting moments, you might be better off with that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not an action movie. It isn't a romantic film. It's not a thriller. It doesn't even have the most rudimentary plot, nor does it even manage to deliver a plot. But it has a few moments that are quite hilarious and utterly useless, namely when it makes it appear that Bruce Wayne is going to turn into an a cop. There is also some of the annoying moments that seem to be directed by the writer of the film. I can't find any movie that I know of that is this bad. The plot is almost nonexistent and the directing, cinematography, and acting is bad enough that it would make me sick. I really think the only thing that is good is the acting and the cinematography. The only thing I can say is the soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are some good scenes, but this one didn't go anywhere.  There is one scene where the characters interact with each other in a very clichéd fashion, with everyone trying to be nice. That might be a bit off-put. And there is one more scene where a woman is killed. That scene is about half the time, so maybe they got the idea that it would make more viewers "happy" and have them think it was good.   Not really interesting at all.  I would give this a 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years after the movie "Mash", I was sitting in my house when I got the idea that I might just try something that would be "real" and make a movie about a "real movie", but it couldn't quite make me believe it could be such. After doing it I'd have to wonder why anyone, who would never be involved in such a movie, is so stupid.  This movie is so bad I felt like I was "trading it with my friends" for days, and I'd "spoon" it into my phone to have it delivered.  A.K.A.A "Shark Wars" and a sequel of it, and "Lion" and "The Cabin In the Shadows", and other such crap movies.  The movie is about a guy who gets a bunch of money (he has a few) but then he decides to keep making money so he doesn't lose money. It is a movie that is so badly designed and badly filmed that it should not even be shown in a movie theater in a normal setting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What did I like? I am pretty sure that I only watched the first 15 minutes of this film. The film starts with a fairly good-looking lady(I am looking for a woman named Betty Ann Lane) and her friend (that's Eric Masterson in "Stand by Me") from the old South. The good part about Betty is that she was very good-minded and was a mother and was the first person in her hometown to go from being a girl to a wife. I suppose that I didn't really get to see Betty's old friend's mother. I felt nothing for Eric Mastersons character in this film, which is an insult to his role as a mother. He has to know Betty's mother was a widow, his mother-in-law is another story. The worst thing in this movie was the ending. It was a really sad ending and I felt like some of the characters in the film had been dead or was dead for a long time. I just can't get that right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first three films made of this film but I quickly became averse to this one. First of all, what about the actor's performance? Why does he say what is in this film?  Why does it contain an unknown man in an unknown location? I cannot imagine that even the most naive actor could do such a thing. I'm glad to say that this movie was canceled after the first 2 episodes were shown, but I'm sorry to say I didn't even watch this one because I felt no connection to it whatsoever. The acting was pretty good overall, but overall it seems to be overrated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "My Dream Life" doesn't have the same ending as "My Dreams of Jean & Elle". In both of them, the characters end up dead, and Jean is the only girl that survives. That makes the two feel even worse. What's even worse is that even after she has killed herself, she remains on this earth and starts taking over as the CEO of a company that is run by the person who was killed. I have the feeling that this is another of these "MyDreams" stories where the protagonist dies before the end. The best I can do with this is to read this story, and then ignore it. This doesn't make sense. The plot and direction is the same as the first one. It's just a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was extremely bad, the story could have been so much better had it been a much better movie, so much smarter, so more entertaining.  What was the point? This was really like a "movie" with too much action and not much drama and should have been one of the better movies. But the script wasn't very good, the acting wasn't great, the scenes weren't interesting or funny...  The movie had too much in it. The movie was a lot worse than the movie that came from "The Day After the Shark", except the movie had a lot more action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is predictable and has nothing new. The characters are so, no matter how much they try to make the story. A few points that should have been dropped from this movie and more likely to be lost. The story is about a girl whose father has fallen into Alzheimer's disease and, after giving her an apartment, she returns to her parents and begins sleeping in her apartment. She discovers that the man who gave her apartment is sick. After a couple of months, the man decides that she has the same disease and decides to give her a new apartment, thinking she might have Alzheimer's or something more common like pneumonia. When he finds out that he's really sick, he removes her from the apartment and takes her to the hospital where she's going to be kept in a secret. It's not just that the doctor there is not a doctor, but that the hospital is a hospital of morrison and she is kept in it without explanation.  If the movie had to have something new, I would say that it has to do something. I would like to see the woman's father find out her mother's condition. Maybe there will be some sort of story with her father finding out what he has done to her.  I won't give this movie any more attention. This is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on a TV show about the horror film genre and not a positive review of the movie. Well, it is not good either. For example, the story is terrible and I have never even heard of a horror film that has the same concept. The acting is terrible, the gore is also terrible. The plot was a joke in itself and I can't stand for this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am surprised to find this one as a comedy. It's not funny, it's not amusing, it just boring. It had so much promise, I can't see why they didn't stick with the basic story, the characters, the jokes, and the laughs were bad, and I can only explain the fact that it isn't. There was absolutely no real plot, a man was arrested by a mysterious gang with no explanation (how they brought him to a hospital, I don't know what they meant to bring him home), and a woman who murdered an innocent person before turning out to be a serial killer (an odd twist about the serial killer who kills a woman). In conclusion, there's no real reason for this one, so you can't expect much from it. A really terrible way to sell a movie: not even the story is entertaining enough. I mean I can see some people that like this, but that's it, the same old crap that sells movies with real value. It didn't make a difference on that level. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I'd recommend this film was for the fact that it is a really bad movie that had a ridiculous plot. I'm pretty sure that it will be a hit with the audience the next day. I didn't enjoy it. It seemed like an excuse to put a kid in it and put it on an excuse for a movie. If this is meant to be a "movie for kids", I would have to say that you really can't go into a movie like that. The first problem I had with the film was that I knew I wasn't going to like this movie. It was obviously about the same thing, but it seemed like it was about as big as a horror film as I could find. The movie wasn't much like a horror movie like The Last of Us. The story was bad, the characters were pretty bad, but I felt like it made the movie an excuse not to be made. I felt that the acting was weak, the cinematography was amateurish. The whole plot of the movie was just weak. There was absolutely no reason to make this a horror flick. It just seemed like they knew that this wasn't a horror or horror movie, and they just put it out in hopes that it might be made, and then they threw it away because they knew they didn't like it.  So I guess I should just cut it down. It has to be called a horror story to be scary, and it's not really. It's a bit predictable, so really bad. It is too boring and uninteresting, not much of it, but still had quite a good ending. A lot better than "The Other End", but still a pretty bad movie.  I give it 8/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. The movie starts with a car falling into a lake, and ending with another car falling down the road. The ending is not even suspense. It doesn't give much plot or suspense. Also, the characters are extremely stupid. They don't act like real people and it becomes a very annoying thing when they act like they're real people.  The plot is not all bad. I enjoyed it a few times. But after about ten minutes of watching it, I realized I don't really like the ending. It's not as bad as the other entries in this series, but it's not perfect either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw it just once at a movie theater in San Jose (which it was advertised at a discounted price) when I was studying for my degree in philosophy. I didn't know what the heck it was. So, I rented it without seeing it first (which was a terrible waste of money considering it could have been a comedy). I did, and I tried to laugh through it. I had hopes that it was a decent comedy or a film made for a low budget or a TV series (it was not either). I really didn't like it. When it finally came out I said I wouldn't like to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just terrible, but somehow it does seem interesting. I couldn't make it more difficult. The acting is dreadful and the plot is stupid, and at the same time, it has boring scenes and it's boring. If this movie was released when I was just about to buy my car, I wouldn't even watch it because it is nothing more than a bunch of junk junk movies with very little substance and a very limited plot.  This is just the movie version of the famous "A M of F" series, but unfortunately even that was worse than the original one. If you have an older copy, you might enjoy this one a bit, but this movie is the worst of all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film, there is no suspense, and no drama. The acting is so bad that the movie is a comedy, and the story is simply a big waste of time.    As a film-makers, it is better to use a good story to create one of those jokes, and then use that story to joke itself. When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be interesting. But I couldn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never really been that impressed with "The Living Room" on HBO and the first I ever heard of "The Walking Dead" on AMC. I thought the premise was ridiculous and after watching the first episode of "Fringe" I thought it was about as dumb as "the Walking Dead". The show just got past the first 2 hours and then it blew. If they'd just keep making the same episodes, maybe they'd have a life! The show was a little too slow to develop and at times, when the characters were given life, they seemed more like a cartoon with no storyline. Maybe if you liked "The Dead" and were used to watching the show and were so much in it that you really got into it, you'll appreciate it more. But I was so angry when the show was canceled, I couldn't watch the second part of "the Living Room". I would like a movie about how bad it was, but it didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad because you want to learn more about the history of the movie: the plot, storyline, and the characters. You will find yourself bored by the lack of explanation. If you have a taste of historical humor you'll laugh at everything the movie tells and believe it is a story of rape, rape is, a true story. If this is meant to be a film of the rape, then you should be prepared to laugh. Instead, this is more about how the women are treated and used, not the rape itself. The plot is so weak, the women in the film aren't even shown anything. This movie was supposed to be about how a female victim of rape got into the system, but this film was a complete failure. They should have a real dialog with the female victim and it should be at least as dramatic as a horror movie with a real rape scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Unfairete" is a horribly flawed film that tries to force a movie into submission that is neither original nor interesting. The movie is the usual formula of a cheaply made Hollywood spoof, which is nothing new. It's just a collection of stupid jokes. The characters are obviously talented, but the writing is poor, the acting is bad, the supporting is bad and the acting (as well as the director) is bad. If you're looking for a movie about a little man who can make a lot of money, and you think it's got some good story, you're going to be disappointed. "The Van" doesn't have good chemistry. The story is weak. The dialog is bad--so bad that I can't believe that this movie has an intellectual focus at all. I give this movie a 2, but it's an insult to anyone's intelligence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst episode of the entire "Deadly Beauty" series. The cast fails so badly that it's impossible to say whether they're even trying to make jokes. This episode was so bad I'd just want to kill myself. I don't know if it's possible to get a laugh at a movie: "The Devil Wears Shoes", "The Eye-Liner", etc. In fact, it's just not funny. This is bad enough to deserve a 1.2-hour cancellation, and this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story about a man who stole money from a bank. He has a wife and a mistress who are so horrible and so stupid that they can't act.  The acting is so bad that the movie was rated on a movie.   If the original plot had a good plot and a good idea, the story would be good.  However, the characters in this movie are so poorly acted that you won't want to watch this movie. You will most likely feel some sort of sadness when you see it.  You can't tell how bad this movie is. It really is just stupid.  If you like a real man who can act and is very witty, then this movie will be a good one. But you don't really want to see this movie unless you want to.  I give this movie 2/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't believe what this was. I had nothing but shock and horror in this movie, it is very disappointing. I couldn do something more to make it worthwhile and I found nothing, nothing. Nothing really stands out except for the creepy look of the protagonist, that was pretty funny. It just seems like someone just got bored. I am extremely tired of these terrible movies. How about this? It starts right after the introduction of the killer at the airport, he is attacked by a sniper, that is a shame. I think he is a guy who would get a little bit of sleep at night. The protagonist and a girl, are at an empty movie theater after the killer kills them. That's what we get in this, when he's not in one of those two-headed movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is no fun... a poor performance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Jupiter" is about a little girl who discovers a new girl with special powers. However, there are some disturbing aspects that make this movie a terrible attempt at creating a sci-fi story. After the girl is introduced by some sort of evil aliens, the girl gets trapped in the futuristic world, where only she can kill them. This is not only bad, but also makes no sense whatsoever.  First of all, the story is a flat line. It doesn't change anything, as it goes from a female trying to save the girl, to a girl trying to kill her boyfriend.  I really didn't like the story much, and I think you could just skip it and watch a better one. While the movie did its first job perfectly, there were a few flaws that left me wondering whether the plot was supposed to be more. I'd really like to see a more interesting film, like one about the little girl and a little boy who want to escape their little prison.  But unfortunately, I couldn't just stand in wait to see the plot. I went into this movie and wondered why they bothered to put so many characters in it. It just seemed to be like some sortof magic movie and some people just got lost. I don't know why. It also seems to be a pretty pointless plot. Even though the girl was a bit stronger than her male counterpart, I found myself thinking she was a stupid girl. The acting was OK, but it was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie is made solely out of a desire to appease a "liberal" type of person (a movie is to have a liberal-like director, after all), then you will be sorry. You will feel no sympathy, in fact you will feel downright bitter at the waste of all the money it cost to make a film. This is a bad, bad movie. It is so bad that I didn't even want to sit through it, but I did it anyway. The acting was awful, the acting was bad, the dialog was bad. It was bad that, because it was so bad, it gave me nightmares. I'd rather have to sit and watch something that made me feel better, like something I'd never even remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an utter waste of the imagination. In fact, the plot was terrible. It seemed more like a movie called "Bubba Booboos" than a movie about a murder spree. They were trying to mimic the events of the real murder. The script was weak. The dialog was weak, but even worse, the killer didn't come off convincing, at all. The acting was terrible, and the direction wasn't very good either. It was bad enough that the whole story wasn't even good enough to make me believe that it was supposed to be a murder.  This film just doesn't have a sense of humor. It doesn't even have a plot. It has a ridiculous plot, nothing more than a cliché. The whole plot is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a serious fan of this movie, but if you see it it doesn't really bother you. I can't remember why I agreed to this film - it was the worst film I've ever seen. It's just boring and stupid. I thought it was a bit funny, though. It was just really annoying and the storyline wasn't particularly good. If you're a person who loves movies, you'll be very disappointed. I don't think anyone really knows how much it was made, but I guess it's worth a shot if you're not looking for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just like every other piece of trash Hollywood films out there - i.e. no plot or story, but more mindless over-ploting and pointless melodrama than anything else. If it were any good, it would make some sort of intelligent dialog about some sort out of a major event or some sort, but this was very feeble. In my opinion.  The story has some semblance to the real. The characters in this movie are all pretty stupid and obviously aren't meant to be so smart, although they obviously weren't to be completely stupid, but the main characters don't have anything to go on - the police is supposed to be smart and can easily figure out the people involved. Unfortunately the movie tries to bring all the characters into a plot, but really nothing.  the scene where the protagonist meets with the killer is pretty good and it actually starts out to be interesting, but that's about the only thing.   The ending was a little vague, but at the end I can't say anything else because I was unable to figure out where the killer was hiding. I really don't understand the rest of the story, because it's so simple it's impossible to guess anything, and I didn't see any sort of message message or commentary about anything except that the movie was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the fact that the movie was set in the very bleak world of a post-modern America. I just couldn't help but to be disgusted by the direction. The acting wasn't even nearly good. It was just too much like the movie and The Girl with the hair had been set in a postmodern world with no dialogue or plot. I mean, the acting was completely childish. The dialog was almost like the film The Girl With The Hair, except that it didn't have as much dialog as the dialog from The Girl in The Hair.  The story of the girl's adventures was a typical story line of a boy, the daughter, and a mother, trying to solve a situation, but the conflict is actually a bad story. The parents, even though they aren't in this movie, are just stupid, shallow, and incompetent parents who really shouldn't be a parent at all. The end of the movie is really bad. Some of the characters seem to have a sense of humor, and that isn't even apparent in this horrible movie. This is probably a case of a brain-pigeous, dumb guy who was brain-raped into a basement by the police for no reason. This movie is the only movie that I have seen that has failed to make me laugh in the past two years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so weak it's hard to describe how it has ruined so many good films. It's really bad to see such a movie without an original storyline. But the director really should have the same courage to make a decent film. Instead he can only manage to make some mediocre films that don't bring much value to either its movie or the rest of the world. If the director is as stupid as this guy, what the hell is he doing? This is his only real attempt at directing a decent movie. He should really be a master with a good story and an honest director. If you can't appreciate movies that are worthy of their own, I recommend you not give this one a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that can't even make the slightest impression in the mind of a viewer. It looks like nothing more than a very pointless waste of space. There are two scenes where you just watch two guys running around in one scene - then repeat it so many times until the scene is finally finished. The story revolves around two "guessed" brothers. They have a big rivalry to build a huge house to hide a huge family who has long hair and is actually some kind of monstrous creature. They are supposed to get to the big house by murdering a lot of people, while at the same time they are supposed just to get into a big mansion and build a big family. It is quite impossible to figure out what is really going on with these two people. I suppose they just decided that some kind way, to make a huge mansion for everyone that has been so stupid since it was made. When they finally reach their house, they just start acting like they don't know how it is supposed to happen and just try to make up the story by saying things to their victims and family. I mean, how would they know so much about the murders they committed. I was actually wondering what the hell was going to happen to them? They are talking about how they killed their father so the family could get into this big mansion. And how they had to be killed because the family had a house that big brother had built and was just like some sort of a monster. And they are all saying their brother had to die for something they didn't know for weeks. And the main villain is their father. He was just a monster, not even a monster or anything evil. The ending makes me wonder whether the filmmakers were watching some kind the movie, and it's just so ridiculous it's difficult to believe anyone was actually doing that. I also think the ending is really bad. They had so many people just hanging around and doing something to everyone... It really seems like the people in the family were just having some fun. How can they do that? It's only a couple of people that are there, but it really seems more like a bunch of people who are having fun for no real reason, but the killer in the movie seems to have a specific intent. He seems to just have an urge to do something really silly. They're doing this all the way, and then having fun, but that's all the people do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst of several bad movies I've ever seen. I've never heard a more depressing movie, as in a depressing, anti-American, anti American, and anti-septic way, than the "Redneck Road" story. Even the "redneck" part is really bad. The movie stars a black female who is in a relationship with the mother (an older white woman), who she thinks is a mad person, and is very cruel. I was bored when I watched it, and didn't have the guts to see it again. I had a hard time watching it because it did nothing but reinforce my view that this type of movie is awful. If you want to be a movie with a real message, you don't need to see this one. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a lot of very predictable and boring scenes, and I don't recommend watching it. I couldn't even tell the difference between the actors and the audience in this film. I was wondering how the scenes in the film were filmed. I don`t think it was worth watching, and there is some really terrible acting. But I don´t blame the filmmakers. This movie does a few good scenes and it is worth watching for a few minutes to get a few laughs. But don`T watch it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie is directed by the same person as the director of this film, it makes absolutely no sense. Although I would love to see more of him, it would be nice if he at least gave more time to the movie and let us know how it goes down.  Well, I would have to say that you are quite lucky to see this in a movie theater: The theater is literally empty and empty (that's why this is the name of the movie) with a small handful of other cinemas, all of which are just looking for the next title (i.e. the director) in order to make a full film. However, I will say that this movie only fails to make the case, for whatever reason. Even if you are really interested in movies and not interested in the director, you will find no more of them.  I would be extremely disappointed if this movie ended up getting a title that will receive a large number of views. Even "Pitchman: War" has gotten the name for most of the people, even as one of the best movies ever made, although the box office numbers of the box are so far, not much.  The only thing that was really good in this movie was the very annoying soundtrack. The soundtrack that makes this movie could not have been created for this movie. This is the first case I have ever encountered where a film soundtrack ends up ruining the movie for you. The best thing in this film is the absolutely despicable acting. A lot of actors have turned into a pile of fools. They act like they're playing a lot more than they're supposed to and you have no idea what they are doing.   A negative review:  I really dislike this movie (the same one made by John Clemons).  This movie makes absolutely NO sense. It doesn't even begin with a positive review: The acting was the worst I have seen on a movie ever. The story line is nothing worth writing about. I can't imagine anyone in this theater even being a real person. If you're looking for a film that can be interesting, you'll find nothing to take from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the only thing that ever made me regret watching. It contains some of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. They are usually made to keep your attention away from the movie and just be fun. There is no mystery. No chemistry, no suspense, no mystery, and no suspense. All of them are predictable. In this movie it's just a plot that has no plot and no reason whatsoever. There are a lot of very silly things. When one of the characters died there are a bunch of skeletons. They just keep appearing until you can't believe it, since there are no explanation for anything.  The most disappointing part of this movie is that it ends at the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend of mine said that if you knew this movie it would make you mad. The plot is very weak. I mean, how can a guy do a whole "show up a few years later?" There are too many pointless lines, too much wasted time. The story is about a guy who is addicted to heroin, and falls into a drug addiction that is so pathetic, that he does not go out for another week, and ends up getting caught.  I've seen the last couple shows, and they all don't have that same thing. And I'm really worried about that! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really doesn't make any sense. The story is totally incoherent. The characters are just completely unappealing. The plot is obviously made up on the back of some stupid TV show. All in all I would recommend watching the original series as a way of learning how to suspend your mind. But this is really a bad place to watch a movie. In fact, I don't think it even stands. If you are expecting a documentary, this movie is like watching a big, cheap copy of a dumb TV show, and then going into it. Even if you're just watching an episode of it, it's just going through the motions without any real point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The scene when the girls were in the basement made me very uncomfortable. Not only was this scene a waste of the film and the fact that I couldn't see what it is when it was cut down, it was a bad waste of money. I just went to the DVD and watched the first half of it so that I would not get distracted.   As I said, the acting was good but at least not wasted in this movie. The scene of the naked woman being penetrated by the girl in the cave would not have been a surprise or a spoiler. The problem with this movie was that the girl, in a cave or inside the house was attacked by the creature. I guess there's a lot of holes in her stomach and not enough space to get down and take off the guy's dick. I don't know how that is even supposed to happen in a normal movie.  The only real redeeming feature in this was the fact the guy had a girlfriend in the dark alley that would help him fight the monster. It was not just that the guy could help his girlfriend but that was more important.  There was a pretty neat scene in the scene in which the creature was getting fed on his face and the only thing that bothered me was that he had a tattoo of the devil logo. If you have a tattoo with a logo like the devil tattoo and it is going to be a big problem when the beast comes to you for some reason or the guy was having intercourse with her. Then when the girl goes off alone she goes to the dark cave and does not care who she is seeing during the day. A problem for this movie is that it is not realistic. When the girl went off alone it is just just another excuse for the guy to be seen at night.  It just goes on and on and doesn't stop.  I think this movie will get a better review in a few years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie doesn't have any good plot or story and really just goes through the motions. I think the guy that plays the role of the "bad guy" is actually really dumb and you feel it when he starts being such a terrible person and then starts showing the viewers how he has to be.  The acting is really bad, and the script is so bad it actually got me watching the whole film in the hope I'd actually learn something about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The People" is the dumbest show I have ever seen.  The first three episodes had great potential. But the second one is just stupid. I don't understand the plot. It's just a bunch of men (the main characters) with one girl (Penny) trying to lure Penny into a sex act (she agrees to help them) and she gets pregnant (it doesn't work out for her). The ending is simply the typical plot of a sex movie. The "plot" was pretty simple. Penny and the other actors didn't have a storyline to go along with. It just showed a scene of Penny getting fucked. In fact, this is only a part of the movie which is supposed to show the effect of a breakup. Nothing more. It was pretty disappointing.  I'd give this a 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a very casual fan of the movie. I enjoyed the "Birds" in a very good film. However, I thought the BIRD was really bad. It really was just so bad I had to see the real movie...  The BIRD scenes had absolutely no continuity. The only things that were consistent were the two female birds flying away. I guess that is how "BIRD" had the two birds flying to the city. It made it seem like a real movie, but not actually made a movie. My opinion is that the original idea for "Bird" was just a way to make a joke about a movie and I think the real purpose of "BURD" was to make fun of it. The rest of the film was totally stupid and meaningless. It was just sad to see two very annoying characters on the whole. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In order to prove that the makers of this film have learned nothing, we have seen the actors perform for only one hour. This film contains absolutely nothing but an insult to the true faith.  The film is simply a waste of time.  As I said before, this movie was an insult at every single point. Some actors are good, most of them have some depth and some good chemistry. But this movie tries too hard to do everything but is not allowed to succeed.   One of the biggest culprits in this movie are the actors. The acting is terrible. The only two actors I thought to be the "good" actors in this film are the original "King" of the Kingdom. The first one was Walter Vanquack. He was able to deliver a brilliant performance. But his character was not great, and most of the characters in the movie were pretty bad. The second one was Gary Halsey. I had read some of the book and found him to be funny but he didn't deliver the same level of performance that Gary Houldy did. He seemed like an almost completely inept actor.  Finally, the third thing I thought was absolutely terrible. That is the supporting characters, they were extremely weak, and the film was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had an absolutely terrible plot, and I had flashbacks from movies I knew when I was young. It is difficult to find a movie that has ever caused me any pain like this, and that is all the reason that I can't give this movie a recommendation. What a horrible waste of your time. This movie is not going to win any awards, so please DON'T waste your time with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie was not a bad idea to do, then I would like to have it corrected by a well-informed film producer. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the "humor" of the movie. It's only two-dimensional, and only silly. And it's so bad that I cannot imagine the actors being too good. For example, the cast (with the main actors) had no chemistry. This film is a waste of time.  This is not a good film for anyone who is a big fan of James T. Long. I'm afraid that they will not get to see his best films: The Last Kiss, Fuzzy Dog, and The Last War. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to confess to say I didn't even enjoy this movie in the first place. I didn`t really understand it at all. I thought it was dumb, like most everything else on this earth. I couldn't even believe that it was just plain bad. However, when I did, I found that I couldn`t find it on HBO even. The cast were very, very bad, and the plot was so stupid, that it had nothing to recommend it.  I would have laughed at it if it wasn't for the fact that I had a childhood in a basement in the middle of a winter, when you really know exactly what to do to a poor teenager. But I wouldn`t have laughed if I didn\'t even realize the plot of this movie. I only laughed to see the acting in it. And the ending of it, which I guess was supposed to end in some sort of sort of closure. I have heard that this movie was from Paramount in Italy, but I really don\'t know which one. Anyway, the best thing that can be said about this movie is that there is no way to find it in the Italian library. I recommend you forget the fact it is based on a true Italian opera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible to watch, because i just went away and had no time to watch. It was just so boring, you know, that i just stopped watching it and went to the DVD copy and decided to watch the original "Goddon". At least the original version had some fun. However, the "Goblin" version didn't have any fun. All the actors were horrible, the writing was awful, the characters were really bad, and everything was boring, boring, and boring. I thought they should have cut the whole thing and left the original copy of Goblin to be with it. I give this movie a *1* out of 10, as a little bit of fun. There was something about this movie that was annoying to me. The only thing that was interesting was the ending. They put in some special special effects and they gave it a cute twist. But the point of the movie was that it had no plot. They used a huge red monster in a very simple and cheap ending. The story was not even a "real" story. I mean that the ending, like the one before, was OK. The main villain was also made so very stupid. But I have to say that the original Goblin story is just so, SO BAD that I couldn't find any reason to like it. Even the ending was totally over the top. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had a decent cast and a good script. But the script failed to deliver when it came out. The acting was wooden. The movie was weak. It wasn't funny. I was a little disappointed when I got to the point of having to turn to the movie because the movie wasn't so funny. The premise was so bad that I had no choice but to watch it over and over. It didn't deliver enough of a message.  The funnyest thing I saw in the movie was the guy who said he saw the "new" man, "The man has been around for years and all I had to do was to get a taste of it." I felt very embarrassed to make that statement, it was so absurd. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there's an example of this sort of movie that could be more insulting than the one I watched, this one comes to mind. I can't even come up with any words for this piece of waste of film-making. They've got a name, "A.M.S.", and you know what they are! I've heard it a few times. This was only two minutes of real life, but I have no idea what they're going to say in the future. It's just another one of those things that doesn't belong in a film: wasting space, having no story, being just a bunch of people screaming at each other. You know that sort of thing. I just want to put the word in that I think it's got to be pretty hard to watch. I think they had the idea of going into the "shooting" business and having people shooting into a car at some of the city's outskirts. I'd guess that they got the idea in the production, but the fact that they're doing that seems to have escaped them. I'm pretty sure it's just a bit more dangerous than the usual. When they first started doing it, I thought they'd put it to a lot more footage and have enough action to have something to recommend, but then the shooting starts, and it's not done, and suddenly you'll start feeling like you're going into some pretty crazy movies. So if they decide not to go into the shooting business, I can almost guarantee you'll be seeing some pretty violent stuff, but not necessarily a violent. But the story is still very confusing. They're trying to be serious about the "crime scene" on the car, but they can't make it any more confusing. There are some pretty standard shots, and the way they shoot, it's pretty basic, like a normal car. It doesn't include any new stunt-driving action. And you can't find it in the "special effects" in the film, either. It isn't like the ones you get from cars in a lot of movies. It comes just at one place, and that place is just a lot worse than the ones we've seen a bunch times. The only thing that makes this look like a movie is the really lame score that comes out of a car in a garage. A couple of actors who were in this movie are either not actors at all or got paid a really big amount of money and didn't act, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Punchline" is just bad and not even enjoyable. This is basically an excuse for a horrible, slow, and horribly predictable film. The fact that they used "PUNCH-LINE" to create a movie that is so bad that they actually created the show in the show is just pathetic. "PuppetShow" is not even a comedy movie anymore and is really only a collection of low budget, slow-paced episodes that you just can't stand. If there is a better way to describe this movie, then I'd recommend watching "The Adventures of Puppy Love" instead of "Puppy Love". I would consider "Puff-Line" to be a documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we were in the early days of the film industry, the only real value in movies was their ability to use and exaggerise. Movies were mainly made by directors, directors, editors, actors, actresses, and a select few artists. Movies are usually made like an artist's job, and nothing has ever been too clever. This movie is completely the opposite. It is not funny nor very clever, it is not thrilling, it has nothing to do except make some pretentious noise and then you find yourself on a trip around the back seat of some stupid car or whatever car you wanted to be on.  The story, the script, the acting and the special effects are totally lousy. The fact that this is one of those films, that it was supposedly made at a time when everyone in Hollywood believed the idea of producing quality filmmaking, has been a depressing truth. The result is that no one ever looks forward to see this movie. No one thinks it could be made at all.  I'd say that if I hadn't seen this movie I might have been disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, I've seen this movie, "American Horror Story", (or "Misko Story"). It's a very bad movie. There was really only one good part, the scene in the garage where the father murdered a woman. Unfortunately, it seems like they tried to keep the story a bit more interesting. The ending is horrible. How is it that this film does a story that doesn't connect with anything else? I won't say much, because I don't really think anything interesting is said in this movie. The characters are so badly drawn that they just act like a bunch of people who think their lives are strange. I've had to look at the "story" for ten minutes and see if there are any real characters that exist. There is one thing that was interesting in this film. I don 'think' that this one was about a story of a guy who stole a woman's phone and turned it into a weapon. The way that the guy had the phone was interesting, I suppose, but that was the only good part.  I have had a thought that this was the same movie that "American Vampire Story" had, but I was wrong. I never liked either of these two movies, and I didn't think it was any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is bad...all of it has the same plot and pacing, but somehow it comes on every time I've seen it. What happened to the original book? Oh, the whole thing was just very stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a girl who kills another girl and kills some people...  I felt like I was watching a movie from some video game and it was like a video game. That said, it is absolutely horrible... I found it so unbelievable that it was unbelievable. I also think you shouldn't buy this movie so you don't end up on a plane with some of the friends, it's just a stupid movie. The plot is so weak that it doesn't matter how much effort is put into the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for something to like this movie and I can't find it. It's pretty boring. The movie looks like the late 40's when I watched "The Rocky Horror Picture" for the first time. I can forgive a few plot twists, but what makes this movie a movie is that this movie is like a very bad movie. There are no real story, a story to make the story. It doesn't have any real plot, it's just a bunch of people trying to get money and having a great sex party. The story starts in the middle when someone dies and everyone wants to kill the guy, but then it keeps going in slow motion and it's like the scene in "The Shining Wizard" where everyone dies and we all get drunk. I've never seen one more bad movie, but I still wonder why people don't make movies like this one. This movie sucks even more than other movies: No plot, no storyline, nothing, no direction, no story, no real emotions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good movie: OK, that's just the best. But this movie is really bad. I can't even say that. But when it's not bad is like a cartoon (or even a cartoon).  This movie has absolutely no plot (at least a movie with some plot). I really can't say too much about it but I do know it's a really bad movie because of the sheer lack of plot (or any plot at all), so we can't really blame the writers for making it. So if you get to watching the movie it's really hard to get into it, and the dialog is just non-existent. It's just like they don't care how long a day is of course. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing to compare to the usual fare on this channel, so I will be very surprised if someone comes out and manages to save this from the madness that is normally common in the show. I have been looking for the last 30 minutes and nothing. There are some actors that I can see and I would like to hear more, but I'm not in a position to be a member of the show because I'm on the side of the spectrum of a man who wants to be alone. This movie is about an old woman who kills for money (probably an old man), as she is forced to work with her husband on a construction site. She is a woman with no feeling and nothing but her eyes, and no sense of morality. The movie is just not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, "Alabron" is a "Borscht" style horror film and a stupid attempt at a "slasher" horror movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't succeed in either. A lot of things are so obviously wrong in the world of Alabron that you can't even blame the writer. For example, the protagonist (Clemens) is supposed to be a "human vampire" (that's a human vampire but not a human zombie) and he's supposed to pick a vampire girl to bring back the dead. But this doesn't work. The vampire girl dies, but not in an acceptable manner. The way this is portrayed, in fact, is rather like it's supposed a "movie" with a vampire and a ghost and a zombie. I have not seen this so poorly before. The film doesn't have any suspense. A good way would be for the writer to put some vampire girl in a coma and make her live through her whole life. A simple plot is "the protagonist wants to sleep until the girl's brain is shut down". And there is a very stupid plot twist about this. The girl is trapped in a cabin with a female (Celteras) and she meets a "ghost" (I guess, according to a lot of people, this is one of the many things that the writer is missing from this story). A lot more needs to be put into this movie so that it actually works.  But that doesn't happen. The story is just about a lot more stupid things. I'm not exactly what I mean by this word but it's pretty hard to find out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not directed by any of the previous producers and neither of the actors. It was horrible, nothing more than a series of melodramatic acts by Michael Leiter. The story is entirely unbelievable and the acting is just terrible. My main view is that this was a poor, but successful attempt to keep the spotlight in the hands of the story for the sake of the storyline.   The end result is a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this was very bad and just plain bad. it is pretty much like that old movie with my son. I won't even talk about the bad thing that was in the film. It would only be a matter of time. I don't know why this was made, if it was one.  this is a very bad sequel to the original. this time around, it is bad by nature. the only thing I can remember was "Turtles" and this movie was better than that movie. I didn't care for this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Turtles" is about a bunch of kids who play a bunch games and are attacked by zombies. They soon realize that they can take a few more zombie recruits.  This has been completely pointless, as there has been an hour-long history of zombie attacks in the film. It's pretty obvious that the movie just isn't supposed to be a zombie movie. What's even worse, this new girl has more lines and shows up in every one of those scenes: she has an arm tattoo and is often the female "leader" of the group. She's not even really a zombie, but rather, she looks like a zombie.   The plot isn't exactly what the rest of the plot is about. The main premise is that this girl, who has a zombie boyfriend, is now stuck with him, and has to find out why he's alive and dead. The rest of it is only about how the kids react to their new "leader." They're not a zombie zombie, and it doesn't matter what we'll do with her, the result is a depressing story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So it's not all that bad, and I don't think most of the audience would know that, but the ending is the worst.  My guess is that there will be some other way of making a sequel to this if they've seen the first one. I do wonder what that will be. There was an awful script, I have to think, because of the character writing you can expect a sequel of a very good movie. I'll try not to say what he is going to do.  I can see how it was made. I've seen all the comments on it. It's bad. It just doesn't even make sense. I am very disappointed that it was even filmed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the above quoted video I'll say to all you, you're not going to enjoy this movie for entertainment. If you're a person that does enjoy this film, then you must be one of the sickest people who has ever lived. If there's any way you can blame someone for trying to make a funny movie, then it's your fault.  I had hopes that this movie would have been a little bit funny. Maybe a little longer than a movie for me, but unfortunately it got a little too out of hand. Even the actors didn't deliver their best performance. What was the message in the film? It's a very dumb idea that the first person to make this movie has to wear a huge coat with a name that he can't even pronounce, it's supposed to be a red hat with a red vis or a red face. In the case of the above mentioned video, the first actor to make it is obviously named Adam Sandusky. Sandusky is the director of the movie. There are many other actors involved in making this film who should have been in it more than Sandusky, and unfortunately most of them don't. The whole film had a poor plot. It was a terrible plot, which was made fun to watch instead of a movie that wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't believe that they filmed a film that couldn't even survive the director, the writer, and the screenwriter (also known as Jacky Davis, and who played a key role in 'Waking Up,' not least the character of a drunk old detective who is obsessed with a girl who he can't afford to lose her affection). When 'Wakening Up' starts, the movie is very convoluted and contains a lot of false information. I was never really sure if the film would have been a "film" in any sense. I have no faith that it has a plot, and even after I spent hundreds of hours watching it I am not sure if it was a documentary or a documentary. All of the actors are so bad that they almost have to read the book to find out how they look, especially the actors who look like they're in a movie. There's nothing funny about that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a really bad film, it is not even worthy of being compared with The Dark Knight, it just plain bad and nothing to write home about. The acting is bad too, not only the main actor (Alberto Falberg, a great actor), but also the whole movie crew. The only reason that this movie managed to survive was that the writer and the director were really clever, i.e. to avoid making the story too convoluted or too predictable. But this movie has nothing to do with that. It is just bad to watch the people playing the part. They are just plain boring actors, and not that special or special for the film. The first thing that is wrong with this movie is that the action is not really very well done. There are some scenes, like the scene where the characters are getting taken on to the ship, that are supposed to be set in a natural environment, but they are just silly and forced to perform. This is the case with the first few minutes of the movie, which are supposed be a natural setting, but the scene is not completely natural. Also, there are some very boring scenes, such as the one where the woman is kissing the guy, and then kissing him back, but that is more fun than the story! I don't really think it's funny in any way, if you want to see a movie set in natural environment in a ship, you will enjoy it more. The plot of the film is mainly about a couple of people who have no romantic interest, and were just there for a purpose of creating a story about a relationship. But that's only one of the many things that are just stupid in this movie. They're obviously not interested in what they're doing in the movie anyway. They just have some scenes that are nothing special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is completely lame, except for the fact that it has a good female lead, even as a woman. But the acting isn't good either.  It seems like there's always something else in movies that adds a lot of material. We just can't find this kind of material in this one.  The best thing I can say about this movie is that it's so bad that it still exists, if it ever does. The reason why I think this movie isn't like the other movies is because it's a story with a story but not one of the "normal" stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of a man who, while drunk, starts off in an abandoned area where he finds a cabin. In search of it, he takes up with the other resident, a woman named Missy (the woman he's sleeping with) and he starts a romantic relationship with her. It's all too predictable. The woman (the best actress she's ever seen) starts telling Missy about all of the things she's done while she's been drunk, and it's obvious that it's not all that she was doing in that time.  The ending of the film was only about a half-hour, but it does not much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is awful. The plot was not original and the acting was extremely poor. The "adulthood" and "stressed up" feeling of the film is truly disgusting. The director should have known better than to waste this money. Also the director should realize that his "fist" is not a real actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie a bunch of people are on a ship going to India to look at a floating island that they will be sent to find, and after they arrive the group (which includes some of the famous stars) get captured by a group of soldiers. What's worse? A little later there's also some part of the cast who's got a contract to work in an undisclosed government agency where they are going to try and keep the whole of the people of the island from being killed off. When they find out they've been made to pick up the survivors they try and kill off some people before leaving the island to find a place on land which they are supposed to get water and build a settlement but it ends up getting flooded as the army forces the people to turn into criminals and the police find them and get revenge on the people that are already on the island. This was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is a movie with a cast (which is what this is), then this is what. If you want a movie that makes no sense, or that has nothing interesting, you get a movie like this: boring, predictable, pointless. I was tempted to rent this movie on the free TV at a local movie theatre but unfortunately I couldn't. But I can't really fault this movie for being so bad. The best I can say about this movie is that I can only get out of it by watching a bad sitcom. (I have read a negative reviews about this on other web sites, but it's not the worst I've ever seen.) I can assure that most of the audience members will never watch this movie again, but the few who do will look at the screen and wonder why they should pay anything to see this. And I will never go into a movie theater that I'll see again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What really got me to see this film was when I was in a store in a mall and it came back as "Cinematic" film and I couldn't believe what was happening. The beginning of this film felt like a movie made out of a video game. Even the main protagonist is a gamer and the characters were stupid, it had no depth and the acting was so bad, I couldn`t believe they had any intent to make a movie. I think if you are expecting a game like this, you should avoid this one like the plague, it can`t make you feel sorry for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't understand why anyone is even bothering to waste their time on this one. I am sick to death that so many people have turned to watch this movie because the plot is so bad and the acting is so terrible that I am ashamed to have wasted time watching it. And as long as this movie is set in a computer-generated film, you can get away with all the terrible special effects and it's a pretty good movie. However, I think I'm only about halfway into it when I begin to realize that this movie isn't about a movie. It's about a lot of bad behavior and the characters are just simply bad-thinking, stupid people. I mean, you are supposed to love these two friends. They are so amazing! When one of their friends is a "goddess" who has turned into an angry, violent person. It makes no sense that this is going to happen, because I think we would have a different story with these two characters and a lot more drama to go out. If you're like me, you'll probably enjoy the first 15 or 20 minutes. But if you're one of those stupid-ass parents who think it's all about sex and drugs, you won't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not the movie that one would expect to see in 1994. I have been disappointed with most of the recent offerings, and this was not one of them. The acting was pretty bad and the plot was so bad that this film could have been made by any aspiring film maker. The only good thing I have seen from this film was the title, which was good. Although I cannot imagine what the actors had planned, or what they thought when they first signed contracts, I would have enjoyed it. However, the title makes it seem like they had a compelling storyline that they thought would garner a bigger audience. However this film is completely meaningless. There is nothing to connect with the title.  I give this film 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A new low budget movie has to be called "Wander" as the plot is not a compelling. While the movie isn't as bad as it is supposed to be it doesn't do much to make itself up. The first major flaw I noticed was the fact that there wasn't much of a storyline. The two main characters are either so bad off (like most of the rest of the cast in the movie) or they are completely disconnected from the movie itself.  What made the movie so bad was the idea that it would be a horror movie instead of a horror thriller. The premise of the movie was that there would be the main characters who would be in a big cabin surrounded by the other characters and in the cabin would be forced to defend themselves from the monsters while the main protagonist is being chased by the army of monsters that attacked them from inside the cabin.  The movie was too vague and the main character was too disconnected from it so that the plot lacked a significant meaning. You would never know what happened to the main person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a typical bad movie, not even worth a rental if it were made for a movie. It's so bad, I couldn't even think of the number of times I had seen it. The best I saw was the opening sequence at the beginning of the film. The only reason I gave this movie an 8 was that I would have to watch it if I had to. This movie has absolutely nothing in common with a movie from this genre. No plot whatsoever. No action. No good supporting characters. The story is pathetic, there are many scenes where characters act like they have been acting in a movie, but that's only because it's a typical movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was extremely awful and a waste of the actors' talents. Some of the acting was even terrible, especially the part of the parents. It also featured a number of "couchy" characters, who didn't want to be in the movie. What a pity. It's so bad that it can't even take place in this movie, but you can watch it on the internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply awful.  I just can't understand how anyone found this one to be worthwhile. A couple of actors and a bad story (i.e. the two of them) give this film a fairly decent rating. However, it does not give up its story or its characters - instead it throws into another horrible piece of trash.  This should not be on a film program or a DVD - it should not even be allowed to be shown in the public - it's bad enough that it should never be aired at the local movie and video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was horrible. The writing, direction, acting, scenery, music, and acting are terrible. The story itself was an embarrassment. Most of the scenes were made at the bottom of the world (including a ridiculous cameo by Jack O'Dee, who was really annoying in the movie). The plot was bad, but the acting was good! But I guess it doesn't matter if you're a horror movie fan and have watched some good horror films. This was just terrible, bad, bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A documentary about a failed attempt at ending a movie: the film is essentially an advertisement for a failed movie. The problem with this is that it isn't so much of a documentary but instead a pointless exercise, with a few interesting scenes and scenes but nothing much more. The movie is obviously aimed at a certain age group and is obviously not intended for children. The main problem is that the actors are the same as the main character in the first place. A movie like this doesn't help with acting as a children are supposed to be able to act. For the first 30 minutes, the film was fine in acting, but then the acting started becoming annoying and a duller than the first part. The film could even be written by a person with little skill in acting. The most annoying thing was the actors' constant use of the same ridiculous scenes as in "Rambo". The plot is unbelievable and the film got completely lost. Even though it was so funny initially, it didn't have much plot, making it look like something like a series of computer games. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good films on which a few interesting things turn up. But this movie is a poor one. It's too long, too boring, and too predictable. Even the most ardent fan of the original, Richard Cane, couldn't even wait for this one. What was the point? Why would they bring the two brothers in so late in the movie? How did they do this? It doesn't matter. The movie is the kind of movie that comes around at the end of the summer. Who was it? The story was too simplistic, too long and not very interesting. I'm not sure why they would choose this movie in the first place.  There's no real sense in it. It was just a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen better movies: "Honey Moon" and "The Moo Shoes" but not "The Best Hollywood Short Film Of Today". This movie is awful, full of stupid lines, stupid jokes, and really stupid. I'd never see anything that could be worse than this movie but I never felt the same for most of the people involved. We've seen "The Man" or the "Big Bang" and we've even seen movies like "Hobbit 2" or "Hunny, Al's name is 'Honey Bunny'. It's only after a movie like this gets released, that it becomes OK to do so. It's obvious the director and co-stars were just happy with a little bit of money and they wanted to get their message out there. They had to get something to the point of it. They weren't expecting to be a "classic" movie with a plot and great story, they just wanted to sell something to a crowd so they made a dumb movie out of some trash. They couldn't have made it into a movie that people would see. The whole movie is a waste of time. I don't think they got more than half of the movie screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of those things that just doesn't go to sleep. In one of the movies I rented from the Canadian Film Distributive. I thought it was pretty good, with some interesting twists and some amusing one-liners, but it got a little bit out of hand. It just had a weak ending. The cast lacked energy in almost every moment. A few people seemed to want to have the time to see if the person who killed his father had enough faith to actually have him and there were a few scenes where the person had no conscience and acted like they were actors. The biggest problem with this film is that the people who made it got that money from making this film and that they must have done some other work to get paid. This movie was poorly-subscribed. The story is nothing interesting. Most of the actors could barely stay in the acting and it was hard to believe there was any excitement or excitement during the movie. The acting had nothing to do with the movie itself. It's just another bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible, but I thought it was a fun movie. Its an obvious rip-off. The movie is pretty stupid (the 'fun' part is obvious) but unfortunately so much effort is put into it, the ending is lame, the dialog is lousy, the acting is bad, and the jokes are awful (especially the jokes with Michael Jackson) I was really disappointed with this movie. I expected more from Jackson in this kind of movie and I thought he would be better in it. I did not want to see an Michael Jackson movie made just like a Jackson movie and thus I watched this one at a rented movie theatre. I also thought he didn't seem to be in it and when he said in his autobiography that he had been in 'JACK' with the movie (which was not mentioned in the movie), it just seemed like he had missed it. If this movie could have been a comedy (or even if he would have made an entire movie in one hour), then it would have been great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just as bad as I suspected it would be. It lacks any coherent storyline. For example, the story is a big "thug on mom" story about a married couple trying to save their mother while the husband (the father) is going mad over the death of the wife. The story is then treated like a series of episodes that continue to develop. The ending is not consistent either. It doesn't really make sense. What did they do before? The story itself is pretty good. But after it leaves a long, drawn-out sequence in which no one dies, it does nothing to help us understand the situation.  A typical Hollywood slasher is usually a way to make fun of the male-female-sexual over-understandings of the movie genre, and in fact, that's exactly what this movie is. It's not that there's anything bad about the story, but I was hoping to make the connection with the character in a way that would help the audience understand the characters better. I couldn't. For a slasher, you want to make it fun for the viewer. I didn't.  I give it a 2 out of 10 because I do believe it is OK for a slander. Unfortunately, it has nothing to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a movie: it's a stupid show... the whole "I just started in the same day as it happens, and suddenly I found my way to go on the bus..." story is stupid...it's no wonder, because it's only a couple of times, and it's not interesting. I don't even have much of the dialog and scenes that I did. I'd like to see something more interesting, and I'm looking forward to watching it again. But I can't agree with everything that I had to read, see and say. I won't have any of this movie to show again, and just to say, I don`t really liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins to resemble a typical dumb sitcom. The only reason I got involved with this movie was because I thought it was amusing. Unfortunately, it is not funny. The acting and dialogue were bad, and the humor was dull. The dialog was not funny, and neither did the plot. I was looking for a funny movie in which the story would make sense (like "Rape Me" or "I'm a Teenager", or the "Fool the Blobs" or the story about the "curse" in "Waking Up in a Bed"). The plot was just boring. The ending is bad too. If this movie were good, it would make fun, which is what we want most. You need to make a movie with a story that is interesting, not just a joke.    This movie is not worth watching. Avoid this one at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know what it was when I watched it. I am a movie writer. I can write a negative movie review about anything that makes me laugh. I have seen movies made that are simply bad. This one was no exception. I couldn't find any reason to laugh. The plot was too basic and made no sense whatsoever. This was just another one of the few films that I was not surprised to see so much. The only thing that made me laugh was the director. It was simply another hackneyed, dumb, pretentious movie about a movie: a real movie! I think this movie could have been better as a "mini-film" rather than a straight-forward movie, so it was no surprise that it was not one of them. I could not see one more hour of this movie without feeling sick. The acting is also awful. I really wanted to see more of the film and was hoping to see "Punch Girl" as a real-adolescent film. It wasn't, unfortunately. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main reason the film was so terrible was the fact that there were so many "exceeds" or "hot out" people in the lead roles, as well as the bad "dramatic" characters. They couldn't act well as they usually do, and instead, the acting was pathetic. The bad actors were the only ones who were believable in their roles. Even the aforementioned Chris Bauer, who is a good actor, was terrible. The acting was horrible, particularly the acting of Richard Farrah, who was obviously in the wrong. The only reason this movie was good was the actors, and the "clues" that are evident throughout the film are pretty sketch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can watch this movie as a series of "snackily, stupid movies". While the plot is good in some respects, this movie doesn't make any sense. The dialog is lame, it's clichéd, it has no substance. It's just bad! For example, the story is about a real person, who's known to the local community as a recluse, who is actually a reclidant...and all of this leads to her being forced into the house of her old friend. The story is almost absurd, involving a real old lady. So, the plot of this movie is about her "breaking up" the old lady so that she can get to that old lady who has been sitting there for 20 years, and then has her thrown into the recline. She is supposed to have done something so many times that her legs are burned up, and now, after 10 minutes, she comes to an empty house. (Yes, that's how the movie is written). The problem is that this idea is used only to help with the film's lack of a plot. The whole movie is just a lot of mindless comedy that just involves a lot sitting in the chair. This movie lacks any real substance, but I guess it's because it's all based on the same crap story. A lot of people are going to see it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what to do with this film because the film is so stupid. They had to take a year off from school to film this one because it was too important. This was just a fluff-y piece at first but then they started to develop into a complete piece of crap. I can't imagine anyone making this one. I don�t know why they hired a guy named Dan Stowell to shoot it. It�s a shame because this film really does suck. It would be better if they hired somebody named Dan T.M. to do the entire film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I watched the first hour of this film. I was so stupid to buy it, even though I'd like to see more of these kinds of films. I have to say I'm glad I did not waste my time.  I watched it over a half hour, but my jaw was open. I could see only four things that made this movie. Those included a bunch of people in a big city. They were obviously very stupid, but the people in this movie don't really seem that way. And those were just some of the more ridiculous things I saw in this film, including a few scenes that I had never even heard of before. It wasn't like a true horror flick. This movie is only about one hour, and most of that is spent explaining how these people were stupid.  But, I am glad that I didn't buy it. The next hour was OK, although it wasn't as good as the first one. The ending was OK but I thought it could have been a bit better, although I don't think it was that good. It was about a 1 out of 10.   What I think is most concerning about this movie are the ending. It just ends. If the ending had been a little better, I would have enjoyed it more. But this one just didn't make any sense. The actors had it way up! And it seems like some of these people have some of their lives. They are such morons. I would rather spend more time and money to learn more about the people involved in this situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was predictable to some and made very predictable to me. And I think that this is the type of movie that makes you completely lose your interest in watching a movie. This was only the main reason that I had a deep interest in this film. I was very disappointed in my enjoyment of the movie. It was so bad that I never want to watch another movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a bunch of movies that were so bad and so unbelievable that I can't believe there was any purpose. This is the most horrible one of them I've ever seen. I'm sure you will all enjoy it if you are an independent and you're on the road. But this one will make you regret everything you ever did to this film. If you are one of those stupid people that think movies are a reality and nothing can be real, then this is the movie for you. The other guy, who's so much in a "I'm not cool" mindset, is so stupid. I was watching the first 20 minutes of this film with him and I kept asking myself why people would ever have anything to say about this movie. What do you do if you're not interested in watching? It's impossible to tell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. I have seen some, but not all of them. This movie has no story, no storyline, no thought, no direction, no dialogue, no effort to communicate. If there were any part of this movie that could have been fun, I would have laughed, so I couldn't! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but a piece of trash, a movie that sucks the blood out of every single one of its people.  Even the most intelligent people in the world do not know this movie, and nobody who cares to watch it gives any money to it. It is worse than anything else in this movie. I would love to tell my friends of The Bachelors that they should turn that thing off! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. It was extremely bad, it was bad, and I didn't really feel that the story could make it to make me like it. The best movie I have ever seen is "Saving the Queen". There are two ways you can avoid this horrible movie: Avoid it. Avoid it at all costs.  The acting is extremely poor. The plot is terrible, the cinematography is extremely bad. I have seen it on several cable TV channels, and when I see it on the DVD and DVD formats I just cannot believe that this movie has ever been done. You can't even see the same acting, the same dialogue, or the same music. I can only hope that you can see this movie on DVD. It is pretty important to make sure you avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Hollywood" has long since had its time as an entertaining film - until someone goes wrong, and they just can't tell us why. We've seen it twice, and it's time to get it back.  I've seen enough of these movies over the years to see they are worthless - sometimes only mildly amusing, sometimes not even a good part of the story, sometimes a bad one. If it had a plot, I couldn't think of it as an action movie - a story about a war between Americans and Canadians, a love interest between the two nations, that's about as much as it needs to be. And the best bit of the movie was when the characters were in bed, and the scene where they did the deed... if the actors and the director didn't have anything better to do than to let us know, we might have believed it was a movie made by a few people at the studio and just the two leads. If you enjoy it, you'll be left wondering who exactly did this movie.  So instead of being a good movie - I decided to watch it with some of the people who had already told me they had. We watched, but it wasn't that good.    I wanted to make my own "Hickalikes" movie...   What's wrong with this movie: 1.  The movie was made with the knowledge that this movie is bad. I knew this because I have done it before. This movie seems so much like a Hollywood film... but not - it's not.  2.  Well, you would be able to guess that it was made so they can advertise it. And now it's been advertised, so there really isn't a reason why this movie ever makes me laugh.  3.  Why would they have made this film after all? It's got a lot of "Hawkalikes!" in it. But if it's a real movie, it's got nothing. It's not a real "Hailstarter" movie, nor does it have a plot. You'd think that it is a film about love between an American and a Canadian, but there's no real plot. It doesn't have any real plot, and I don't care how much you'll find that it does have a storyline, the fact is that the only thing that has a plot is the story. The director apparently didn't even care to create it. It seems like he thought that it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no excuse for a movie: * This movie is just a cheap copy of 'The Big Game'. Why is this happening?! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie a few years ago and it was so horrible that I just waited to watch it. I didn't like it, I couldn't stand it, and I thought there was something about it that made me go hmrrrrrr on and really hate it. The plot was so dumb, so bad, so slow, and then the "rescue" just went out of sight and left me feeling like I was going to jump off the bridge and start a fight with another guy. It just wasn't as bad as I originally thought, but I didnít like the idea of "rescuing". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an absolutely awful film to say the least. It was like watching a terrible slasher flick, but not really that badly. But since the "tactical" aspect of the film made the film worse than usual, it was impossible to watch.  The plot wasn't as bad as expected; but unfortunately there were some pretty horrific characters, which put the film in the same category as Saw XLX. This movie would not have been great if the characters were more compelling, but the actors were terrible. The dialog was too vague, and it felt like a typical horror movie, and the plot was too far out of the way.  All in all, it is a bad choice for comedy, but this is a comedy, not an action movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Adventures of Wyatt Rock" is the worst film I have seen in Hollywood since the days of "The Legend of Pig." The plot is completely ridiculous as the characters, in their attempt to capture some of the "big fish" in order to make money.  I don't know how but someone thought a black and Mexican fisherman had a special place, in which he could make a fortune. What was it? How long would there have been?  There was a plot that ran from one end of the movie to the other end.  The storyline was supposed to build a secret of some kind, but the plot didn't do anything but develop the story in a boring way.  If you like one of your favorite sports movies, then this might be OK for you. But you will probably be bored and disappointed by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The fact that this movie was made at all is beyond shocking. I know some people, I've been a die-hard fan of "The Wizard" for a long time and I would love to find out that this is not one of their other mediocre movies and one of the worst. This movie is a complete disaster and I didn't even know it was a horror film. The acting was wooden, the script was very poor, and I was annoyed by the fact that the director couldn't even pretend to be original. It just doesn't make any sense and doesn't even make any money. I give this movie a 1 and you can only see 1 or 2 of the films made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very bored watching this movie. This is the worst movie ever made in the history of human existence.  It was so bad I decided to finish the film instead of letting it finish. It is so bad and bad that it is really insulting to the world if it is not the first movie i ever saw. The idea that people can go back to the future is ridiculous. It's so hard to watch this movie and realize that there is no point in seeing it again. I thought the actors could act more and be more real and less pretentious than they ever do. There is no way of telling the truth about this movie so please leave it alone. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to write out the whole review in the hope that someone will finally appreciate this movie. Unfortunately I won't see this movie until a couple of weeks after it is released.  What a horrible movie this is. The story is about a guy who has a small car to help his family. In it they have a couple in the backseat with a cat, a cat in the front seat of the vehicle with the family in the car, and then there's an action movie and that's it's a big Hollywood action film. When the cat is asked to rescue his sister, he tells her to get on his car, but it doesn't seem like the car actually gets in on their car. When they get into a traffic incident they start hitting each other car, which they then all try to stop, which is the ending of the movie. In the last scene, the cat crashes into the car and then proceeds to try and kill everyone in the van. The only thing I can say is that I would have rated this movie much higher if they would have kept more money into it (maybe) and made some better edits, like explaining that these guys are not drivers.  This movie is basically about an old cat that hates people. It can't help but to be about a stupid action movie, and nothing but that was really to my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Tremble" is a movie that I watched on a few months ago and had absolutely nothing to recommend it. The first half of the movie was just plain awful. I thought I would be tempted to throw it off, but since I'd seen it, I couldn't. At the end of the film I felt extremely bored and couldn't care one bit more than to sit on my hands with my nose in the middle of the day and watch a movie like this. If you're interested in watching a movie for the sake of entertainment, you might want to watch this, but if you just plain want to see the crap, you would probably be better served by avoiding it altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't help but think that this movie made it seem like a "fun" film. I know it was supposed to be a "humor" film, but it's only an abomination of that kind. There is absolutely nothing funny in this film! A few minutes in my opinion could be the funniest thing that happens to me. The only two funny things I saw were the annoying actors in the opening scenes. This is a shame to see. The rest of it is just plain trash! I was looking for a "comedy" but after I've spent all my time watching this film I've realized that it can't be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the hopes that this would be a film which would be remembered by all the people, and thus make this a movie which has actually done nothing but ruin it. Instead, this film just ruins it. I can't believe that it's so bad. I have seen it in several other films, but not much. I only have seen a couple of comments about it that said it's not bad at all. I find the director's behaviour appalling. I'm certain that he cannot make this film into a cult film. This is simply a pathetic film. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mind is frozen after watching this film and I have nightmares about it. I'm a big fan of the old sci-fi series "space marines" and this one has absolutely nothing but two wrong things in it's plot. The first is the idea that the marines have to go into space (something that has never been done in the history of the marines' species) and the second one is that the planet is the Earth of the future. Why do these people think that it's the Earth to which they're going and why it's impossible to communicate? And then the characters can be so easily killed so many times that they can never stop getting away. And it's just plain bad. Even the acting is bad. The idea that a human can die in a gas-tank is pretty stupid and would be funny if it came from the TV series "Scent of Insanity". The movie doesn't even have any plot point and the characters are so shallow and uninteresting that it doesn't make any sense to get ahold of. I give this movie a 1/10 because it's no better than the mediocre "Space Marines: Alien Chronicles". I'll give this one a 7/10, if you don't have the patience to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a really awful movie (probably about a two year old kid) with a lame plot, a really lame camera (or the worst film ever directed in my opinion) and the plot has nothing to do with anything (I mean it's really stupid!). The movie isn't really that scary but if there is something interesting in the movie, you will get the answer.  The movie starts off with a murder and a murder on a bus at night (I guess its a bus a couple of days ago). Then the killer's girlfriend comes back to a house with a really annoying guy (don't tell me how) and kills the guy. Then she wants to kill someone for murdering and her friends are at the same house, which would make a lot of sense. Then we start on a big story that involves some young kids and some teenagers, and this is one of those things that is hard to tell us about. The movie is just a mess.  I gave this movie 3 out of 10 because I did like it. But I really didn't like the movie so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing like I can ever remember. I laughed at most of the scenes and did not even consider laughing more than once. The acting, in a case where the actors had no idea what they were supposed to do and the only thing that made me laugh, was the camera. That wasn't even the movie's most irritating part. The music was bad, it's not that catchy, and the camera looks like a bunch of old tape recorders. Also, what a shame to watch it at all, it seems to go for years that it is used in "movie movies" and nobody ever talks about it. When I saw this, I could only laugh because I laughed a few times and had to laugh in real life. This movie has nothing to do with the "story line" of the movie which only shows nothing. It really does not give a good story to the audience. This must be the worst movie ever made. The good actors should be put on TV, in fact, they should be paid a little money to play these movies. I can only make this comment because I've seen many, many movies since then. However, I'd like to see another one with better dialog, more serious cinematography, and better acting. I will be honest and say I never laughed more in a movie. I think I might have laughed more had I not laughed as much. If this movie ever gets better than this one, I would watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie at a local video store and decided to give it to watch.  The acting was so bad, I don't even remember how they did. The story was totally fabricated.  I have never gotten so low in a movie EVER.  My wife was not even interested in watching this movie.  Don't let this movie to be taken away from you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just a waste of money and entertainment. I'm a little more tolerant than some people have already been. They can make a good film if they're really so passionate, but this movie doesn't deliver. What it lacks in terms of plot, there is more in the script than a movie would, so what you get out is nothing, and then nothing, really. It's just a piece of garbage and you should leave it alone. Even worse, it's not as awful as I expected it to be. The characters are just plain bad. You just get bored. If you like to watch action (that's pretty entertaining) you'll enjoy this film. But for something like a movie, this movie is lame. I won't waste my time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts like a typical dumb movie with a stupid plot. In the beginning, it was unclear how the killer made a victim. That was probably because the characters were so stupid it looked like they weren't going to die anymore. At the end, it turns into a movie where all the characters are stupid morons. The movie is no longer a horror movie, but a slasher. The killer's motivation is absolutely ridiculous. At first, I felt sorry for him to have lived the life, but later, I couldn't care how bad it was. At one point, a girl named Maya was talking about a movie that it made. I thought she was talking to a guy that died in one of the scenes. A few weeks later, she finally said the movie made a murder. The next thing was to make sure it didn't make a person. So, it is a bad idea, if you really wanted to make a murder movie, then you would make one of those movies. Not exactly. The director obviously had the idea that one of us was a rapist. And he had to be that guy. So when Maya was screaming the rapist sounded like a rapist, so she could see that he was that guy who was doing the job as a rapist (laughs). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a predictable attempt to fill in for a boring plot, and it only made sense to have something to do. The movie felt like a bad attempt to make itself, but that doesn't stop it from being a bad film. A plot was good at times, but they got it a little too wrong. It had the opportunity to make a statement in some of the scenes. But instead, it didn't go anywhere. It felt like an old movie. The scenes seemed out of place and were really made to be stupid. That doesn't make them better, if they are supposed to be a comedy. When they are out of context, you want a laugh, but there isn't one to be offered.  I won't give it a 4/10 because that's not what I would recommend doing. It's not a bad comedy, like I think it is supposed to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem with this movie is that it is slow, dull, and has a very simplistic story.  To make a good story, you would have to get an Oscar nomination. That is not the case with this film.  Even the director tries to make it interesting.   But there is no actual plot.  A very bad movie is trying to make the case that this is a real documentary about an anti-drug war (even though the filmmakers know that the war is happening).  There is no documentary like the 'The War'.  And even the director knows that there is a war happening. He doesn't know that this war is not a real war, and there is nothing to make an argument to prove that it's a real film. There is nothing else that this movie could be so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not even good for a 'Family Christmas', and I can't even begin to think that it would be considered for a children's movie, much less a movie for adults. It's horrible. I'm even thinking about how the movie is supposed to end up, but you have to admit that the ending does pretty much scare you...   Please look out for the 'Happy Christmas' DVD and it would help a little bit of horror... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not sure why this film is so popular because of its original premise and what this is that it has to do with it. I never saw that before. This is only one piece of trash in the movie that should not have been in the film itself. The acting is bad, bad, worst I've seen from a movie, not the great film "Inception" that has made it all, and there is no real reason to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just cannot understand how such a movie ever gets made. The dialog in this movie is horrible. It can never get even a simple scene where the two leads are talking to each other.   As I watched this movie I watched with the knowledge that I had read the book this movie was based on, and this was the only time I have ever had any trouble watching a movie. I'm a grown up and very intelligent, and I did not understand the ridiculousness that this movie made. This movie is bad by any standards of reason and I will never forgive this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this movie is meant to be funny. I think it's just a big fat movie, just for someone that doesn't really understand what they're doing. It's not funny. This movie is a complete waste of any comedic value. This is simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, which is obviously inspired by a very simple, boring screenplay, has its roots in a very old plot and its end is a very predictable "caught in the jaws of the monster".  It has its flaws - namely, that it tries to cover all the usual vampire flicks, in which the director tries to make an excuse by using a movie made by Robert De Long to help the idea and avoid having to cover it again.  This is not an easy movie to enjoy - not due to a bad plot - and it is painfully predictable, which means that the movie does not succeed in any way, aside from perhaps satisfying the director and his producer.  But in the end it does give us a good, but shallow plot. It starts off with a good premise, but soon it becomes a predictable one - the vampire-killing-child vampire! But you can't expect to be involved in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't afford to spend money to watch this movie because I'm in a state where I have to pay $100 to rent. I don't know what happened to the actors that made this a masterpiece, but the direction, direction, acting, special effects, and acting were terrible. I'm a big fan of Steven Spielberg and the movies that he made throughout his career, but this was a bad choice to make. The last time I saw Spielberg was on the 70's TV show "Buckaroo"( I won't bore you with any more detail than what was on that show), and I would not say anything that has happened since then, but I'm certain it's because of his age. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a drunk girl who falls out with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, who is a famous musician, is cheating on her and she decides to try to get him to help her. Then, she gets killed by her boyfriend, whom she decided to protect by getting him out of the country for no reason.  This is the only film I have ever seen that I have never given the impression that I really think of "comedy." The main plot is based on a car accident, with another person's body crushed in an automobile.  I have tried watching this film for about a week and not only because I was disappointed by the fact that it did not appear to go beyond "comic" at the end. The plot is completely meaningless and the characters do not act like the actors.   I am tired of hearing the same movie on other video-games sites, such as Mortal Kombat. This is simply another excuse to be a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see how many friends got to watch this movie but we all know how many people are not capable of supporting it. What a pity it has to be in the world of cinema. I'm sure those who are able to do that will tell us all how good this movie was. It was very annoying that it was completely unbelievable. I couldn't even believe that I'd seen it from one perspective. I did not see it at all. I don't have an idea why I'd be able to say it was actually an incredible movie though, what a horrible film. This movie is bad, bad, and bad for acting and bad communication. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only film I have ever seen that I've seen put out in years. It was obviously the worst I have had ever seen. The script is terrible, the acting is bad, the plot is bad. The camera is terrible. The story is terrible! What the hell is that supposed to be about? I know, I know I'm trying to put my own thoughts into the mind of anyone who watches this film, but this film simply does not match that of this movie. If you really like watching a horror film, you don't care for this one. If anyone has read this, they should probably have thrown it in the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at my local movie theater when this movie came out and it wasn't terribly impressive. The first I watched was an awful movie: it was very weak and the acting seemed really stiff. The second I watched it didn't seem to have any special qualities. I didn't understand why this movie was made in the first place. It was like watching a movie made on a wooden box. The plot was slow and the characters were bland and the story was weak. It just didn't feel like a movie. The ending was completely predictable and the ending was lame. It seemed very strange for a movie to take over the entire plot and then just leave the main plot alone and then have a plot that completely revolves around the main villain (who we are supposed to love) and leave the characters to do nothing. It is extremely disappointing to see that a movie like this is not intended to be dramatic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not one of my favorites, even tho the movie itself is pretty good.  But this is a horrible movie: it is like watching a dumb TV show where the writer is a dumb person! Seriously, it's just plain bad! I was looking forward to watching it for two weeks, but I finally stopped watching it. I've seen several movies where the person who does the movie plays a good part but fails at the beginning and ends the movie because of that! This movie was no different. The only saving factor is that it's a low budget movie.   This movie doesn't deserve to be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I think the writer's intent is to create something as a shock scene of a big evil monster, but this is a total waste of the material. The creature's main purpose is to abduct children so that its army can invade the human world...but they have a lot more complicated methods, and the monster only uses his tentacles to suck away victims. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have written this review about five movies:  This is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. If you like dumb jokes like this, don't wait for it - or watch this one, and then you won't have seen the movie before. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with a decent plot, characters, and even scenery, which just is a waste of time. I didn't even like the "Hailgate" movie. And for me, that was the highlight of the entire movie. The premise is stupid and just as dumb as the movie itself. There was nothing original. I thought that the first time I saw it was a joke, because the movie is so convoluted. I guess that if you're interested in a movie that isn't boring, you'll enjoy it, but you don't want to watch anything else. And the movie doesn't seem very funny, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very disappointed that this movie was made and released, I have read the book and it was far better than this movie. The acting is extremely poor, the camera is bad, the plot is bad but it does have a good ending. But what the heck does make me to see one like this? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are two reasons for my comments on this piece. I will try to explain the first. I love the art in this movie, but it just can't get the right message. If a movie could deliver an accurate representation of the real world, perhaps a negative one would have been better. I mean, there's plenty of nudity in the movie, as it should, and there's a lot of sex in the film as well, but the only real plot of the movie was about how to help the two sisters who were struggling with a very serious addiction to meth. That's the only message I got. The ending to the movie had an extremely disturbing ending, not quite a movie that could be shown on TV, as this movie did, so I was expecting a happy ending at the end.  The other reason is the acting. The acting is bad, very bad, especially the supporting cast. I had no idea who was supposed to be the girl with the big ass bodacious body. The two sisters are both so ridiculous, but I guess they had one day of filming to make sure their actors weren't showing the same hideous qualities as they were supposed to portray. And what is this ridiculous "ass?" The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's not that bad, which is a word that's usually reserved for something more serious than bad. But I guess I didn't have the guts to see the ending with the "ass" on it. I do feel bad for those who watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After viewing the previews, I think I'd be inclined to let this movie go, because it was so much better than "The Bourne Supremacy" and was much less offensive. However, I still don't understand how this movie is supposed to make it.  The acting is painfully bad, with many actors being in bad positions. The plot is, as usual, not very coherent. It would have been better if there were a lot more intelligent people in it. However since the movie is essentially about a bunch of people who are having sex with each other, there's no real plot.  This movie is not about how stupid people think. It is about a car with a couple of people. In fact, the characters in it are in the wrong position, as they are having an affair that makes no sense, but then have sex with people that make no sense at all.  I think it was a stupid idea to create a movie about car and sex that was actually made. It's not something I would enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that just does not work. The acting is awful, the dialog is bad, the plot is bad and the story just is bad. I have no faith whatsoever that this movie will even be able to recover any of its elements. If it ever does get a chance I might watch it, but I doubt it. This is just a very, very bad, very ugly, very mediocre comedy. I'm glad that they're releasing something on DVD, though, I don't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been in one of these movies in a long time. It is one of the worst movies I have seen. The whole plot is just awful. It's too confusing and we don't care about any of the characters. They just don't want to exist. They even throw out the female character.  The only thing I can find in this movie is that I guess it isn't as bad as it looks. The ending is just good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen, if you know me, it's the movie I had nightmares about. It's absolutely unfunny. I know that a film made about a young girl would make me laugh, but that doesn't happen in this movie.  My mom and I thought it was funny at first, but after I saw it, I was totally un-entire. It wasn't that funny. There are no good jokes in this film, they don't stay funny, and the story didn't even come close to the beginning of the movie. If you watch it, you'll just keep going.  What is the point? To show that the girl is stupid and that she is so dumb and stupid she is in so deep that she really isn't even that smart. Maybe she'll have to think on her feet to get better at her job, but in the end she has to have a think on who should be in her job. That's it? It's not good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie would really go against the spirit of the 'Jodhpoo' movie, but it doesn't go anywhere. A lot of the characters are just stupid and obnoxious. The story is a very bad and pointless one, nothing resembling the original 'Joo' is present in this movie. There are a few highlights that were good and worth watching, but this movie was horrible to watch. The script would have been better if it was done by a regular writer. Also this movie is extremely cheap in all of the things that make 'Jawalie' a movie. The acting was horrible, the acting was bad and the dialog was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed for a few minutes. What a waste of time... you'd think, in your best movie, the scenes would be more exciting and creative. But, they're all as boring as the whole plot. I'll be honest, even the "hits" were more interesting than the whole movie. And, if you want to watch a story about how a girl gets into a college, I recommend reading some books and a few non-fiction books.  The first part is about a girl named Kate (the movie's protagonist) and her husband, who are in this college together, but the rest of it is about how Kate spends the next four years going through school and having her boyfriend with her while she tries to "get him back." The film's title is "Cidery's Dream," not "Cincie's Dream" (Kate and husband are married, but they are not together). I'm not sure what the hell this is supposed to be, and I'm surprised that it was even given a title.  If you want more film-based films with a title that is so meaningless, you might better be looking for a title like "Gloriabide"; "The Dream Show" was a better title. The fact that "Cinerie's Dreams" is actually a story that actually exists is laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really find this movie. It's bad, and the only way I could see it was to compare it to The Unterrible War. The reason the movie was awful was because of all the weirdness of the plot, and because of the unbelievable camera work, as if the film was made by someone who was the biggest idiot in the business. I didn´t understand why the director could make such bad movies. There were a few scenes that were good in The Untermrible War, and I liked the first one in which the little man ran past the white wall in the subway and was finally caught.  The scenes that made The Unviable War were really good - the first sequence, in which they were trying to figure out the story with each of the characters. The first one was done so poorly as to give me no idea what they were going to do. The second one was really good, but the story only ended when the camera finally got to work on the characters and I guess it only ended because the director had a heart-in-the-mouth, the reason they had to work so badly. I think the last scene had to have been edited out for that reason. If you get to read this movie, I would recommend that you see it when it's first released. But don't do so you'll have a better impression of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like that "Taken 2: The Movie" but unfortunately it is bad. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the history of cinema. Some of the best films I've seen in my life have actually made it work. These movies were really entertaining. This movie is nothing. You would think that "The Road of a Million Man" would actually make this a movie but you would be wrong. If this movie were made today, I would never watch it. If it was made it would be better, if not for the fact that I wouldn't remember anything else from it. I mean, if you want to see it like this I would watch it, but if you don't, then this is a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has some of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever seen. In one of the more bizarre scenes, you can almost smell the garbage that was being dumped on the floor. The acting is flat, the directing is lame and the script is pathetic. In the case of a film like this, the best example for a bad film would be the movie The Boondoggle. This is basically a movie that tries so hard to make you laugh, but it's just not that funny. I found it to be a total waste of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just got finished at the premiere, and I thought the film was pretty good. But now, it really isn't, it's a waste of money. I'm really getting tired of it. I just want to be told my wife and friends that I need to go with the movie instead of watching it on TV (and tell you the reason that I'm having to go without watching it again. I mean the last 4 hours have been very painful. And this is just a bad example of the waste of time in the film industry. There's too many other movies to watch and watch and laugh at, and this film just plain sucks. Why are this called "The Castle?" (or "The House?")?!?!?! How about that! I didn't see anything else like that, and if I did, there would be some pretty decent story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am afraid to ask who's to blame for this film. It has taken two hours longer to find out what actually happens. I had the chance to watch one and then I was on to the other side. And yet I find myself in the mind of the writer. What were the things that were in this film, and how were they portrayed in the first place? I was left wondering if she had just been forced to write it. I do believe that her writing is the reason for this movie's failure. But if she wanted to write a movie, her talents certainly don't come in handy at all. And if she has the talents to write such a piece of garbage, she certainly didn't waste any time. Why? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read many negative comments about this movie, but I find it to be the most disappointing film of the year.  My opinion on this movie is,  I don't understand the plot, and I donít care about the plot to any specific character, but the characters do not seem like people that one would consider as normal. The ending seemed to be a bit contrived, and some of the dialog was recycled from the previous two movies, such as 'Climbing Climaxes', 'The Great Movie: Back to Earth', and 'Pete Ross' film. I also have read a positive review about this film:  'Crazy Days', one of the most underrated horror films of the 1990s.  It is painfully predictable, and even the story, while the actors are excellent, it is not a movie that really makes me scream. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, for a horror film, that is what they normally call it - and not even the films in the director's own name! The premise here revolves around a very simple, possibly simple idea - there are demons and their army of army of zombies, who destroy everyone and put them into a new city where there is also an airtight lid on the building to seal the city out from the demons, making a new life in the dark of night. A pretty standard vampire film with some supernatural elements, but since it's so obviously stupid and silly, I can't really fault it with the original concept. There are some nice scenes in there, though, and some interesting and scary scenes, but this isn't much.  The characters, although they are quite good, are generally not very good, and only some of the minor characters are actually likable. It's also pretty plain to make the viewers feel that the story is about sex and drugs, and not necessarily about killing people. There were two instances where the characters were completely naked, which made the story seem more interesting, but also made the characters look sexy. In fact, it was quite predictable and not quite good either way. The biggest problem with the film is the way it came across as a vampire film. Not only that, but the plot does not take itself. A lot of the scenes are pretty generic. There is a lot of weird sex scenes, and a pretty boring, predictable plot. The monster-thief-thump-thug-thomander-thumper is the only bit that was interesting, as was supposed to be what was going to happen.  Overall, it's a bad zombie movie that comes across as something for people who are only looking for a little entertainment, and they get so caught up in a bad way. Even if you liked it, I couldn't find it interesting at all. I've seen some movies that are better than this one, and I wouldn't really be in that type of territory. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very boring movie, consisting of some very predictable and predictable lines, which are about as clichéd as a cliché as a movie. Most people would have preferred to spend hours and get into the plot of this movie and to have some funny moments. They were sorely missing. For me the biggest disappointment in this movie was the fact that it lacked humor. For most people in the theater audience and for myself there was too much effort put into the script, even when I did have to laugh and laugh out loud and in what was usually the only thing I did. But when I see it again I know it is a good idea, but when it doesn't, I think it isn't that interesting to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Avengers" is a film that has been repeatedly shot and edited at an excessive level in order to make a "spending" film. In other words, it's a waste of precious time. There is no reason for this movie to be made as an exploitation. A major reason why I'm not giving this movie a 1-star: the script is bad.  A major problem with this film is the fact that it is essentially made for "sometick" fans, and I mean that. They should be making "movies that are entertaining, and that are fun to watch, not made for anyone who cares more for a mindless piece of trash like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie once on HBO and then saw it on the "Best Screen Show" DVD channel on the channel (I think HBO is too large) as a rental on a weeknight. I then watched it on DVD and then watched "Buckie Ray" in it once on TV (or at least my local TV broadcast station) while I'm watching "BUCKIE Ray" on HBO. I thought it was a movie about a drunken teenager who does nothing but act like a complete moron who likes a lot of booze (as we all know) and a bunch of annoying chicks who can't even get laid (as they say that.) The movie was horrible. The acting was very bad. The music and the acting was terrible. I gave it one star because it did have some good parts. The characters were OK, although the movie was not all that great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i didn't like this movie so i'll give it 2 stars:  I watched it twice and I thought the first time was dull. The second time was OK, I thought it funny but the first was boring. You know, better than a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to say that I was one of the first people that saw this movie, I thought it would be good to see it in a decent, respectable movie, even though it is obvious that it has nothing in it other than a bunch of junk shots on a bad set. But seeing it wasn't good. And I don't understand why I gave this movie a rating of 8. I mean, it has no storyline, no characters, no real reason to be involved, no reason to believe anything, nothing interesting. In fact, what made the movie even so bad was the fact that it had no reason whatsoever to be in a movie, and had nothing to do with the real world, and it doesn't even really make any sense. The movie was a total waste of money, and this was the worst film I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was made in the US, but the US doesn't seem to be very good at that kind of movie making. I didn't really understand what the heck they were thinking. There were no plot, nothing, nothing to make the movie interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies that really only makes sense if you're going to watch it for some reason and have a severe craving for a good movie: a bad vampire film...I am just being dumb for watching this one.   The plot is, at minimum, stupid, but it manages to be mildly amusing throughout. Unfortunately, the characters are so weak and made-up, and so one sided, that it doesn't carry the plot for a long period of time. The film just comes across as a mindless exercise in an attempt to get the plot into focus and make yourself a vampire. It just doesn't bring enough to it, like it attempts to be a vampire film that actually works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As much as I know that the actors in this movie are good and so is the movie, but not quite good enough. You will miss so many great actors that have been in films of some kind or another throughout the history of the world. Most of them will be in these types of movies, but I won't even try. I'm glad to see them available to rent, but if they are available in the main theaters I don't even rent one. The acting is not too good, but the story is weak and the plot is weak. I don`t expect a great performance by anyone, but what makes this movie a disappointment is the plot. The movie was pretty predictable, but you can make some people understand things pretty quickly and easily. You don`T expect some great actors and some great performances but you don`D expect a decent story but there are no surprises, because there are only some very bad surprises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of trash...it's not worth seeing... if you are in the mood for sex, nudity, gore and some humor, then this movie is the wrong movie for you. The story is bad and the plot is bad but you can laugh at some of the parts and you can think you're laughing at the parts...you get it because it's very silly...and you get it when you're bored...there are some of parts that are pretty fun and some of it is pretty good but not too great. The plot is pretty bad and I do not think it will get much attention from most people.... you can find movies like this more than anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is the type of movie you can find, I would suggest you avoid. You'll need more than a dozen of friends to get along on your trip. If you manage to get together, you will be disappointed by a pretty bad movie. It's not that it's bad, but just bad. It tries to be edgy and funny, but it just tries to come off as ridiculous. The dialog just doesn't make any sense, the pace is too slow, and the story just sucks.  The only way this movie works is that it is a "thrizz" (and I believe, it was the only movie in that vein to be a "movie" in that sense). It's a bad genre of movies that you would only really see on one of those big "cult" films. This is no exception to the bad genre. It is all the same crap you find in every genre and movie out there. Avoid these types of movies and try anything else instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not exactly what I had imagined. And that's OK, because it really isn't so. As usual I have to go out on a serious mission and not take the easy path and say anything stupid. I didn't need any more details than that, really.  My take on the topic was, "why are they bothering us", and it didn't help me in the least. The characters are either dull or worse than their usual.  Oh, the plot is good, the actors are good, but the other parts are a piece of garbage.  I have never liked a "one of them" movie that was obviously a derivative of the original, but this one isn't even that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie. There's nothing really interesting. I couldn't care more than what it's about. I have the slightest hope for the real message of this film. What I saw was a really bad movie, but a really horrible way to show the power of a person. But I do believe that the real lesson of the film is the power over others.  This movie doesn't deserve to be shown at any level. If you want to take a chance at watching it, do it in the most awful way possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a big, bad man who steals a bunch of people's money to live in a cave with some annoying wife, a big-tooty wife, some annoying minions and a big gun and a huge mansion and a lot of hideous food! This movie tries to keep it all together, but it doesn't work. The villain is also annoying as hell! He was supposed to be a rich man, so it's important that you don't talk to him at gunpoint. It's OK to say that the movie is bad, because that's the movie's theme. But if you see it, you'll probably laugh at the villain more than you will laugh at him.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was really the worst movie I've seen in a long time, it's the one I've ever seen that was probably the worst I've made. This movie was mainly the stupidest thing I've had seen in my time. The acting was terrible, the story was terrible and the special effects were bad. The premise of this movie was that one of the boys, named "The Kid" has escaped from jail and is trying to sell a big collection of toys in order to make money. The Kid is pretending to sell them and pretending to get his head on. We never see him fight the mugger who has stolen his body and then proceeds to beat the boy so that he won't get hit so hard, which is why he kills the mugged boy. The ending was way too predictable to make this movie worthwhile. I can't believe it was even written. The only reason I watched this movie is because it was directed by Gary Walsh, who I think also directed "The Karla with the Glasses" with Bill Masterson. I don't know if his name was the writer, but if he was involved with the movie it's at least the least the only reason that I watched it. It seems like he knew that "the Kid" would be a hit and it proved that his idea was OK. I am pretty sure that Gary Walsh didn't realize he made this movie. Gary Walsh is obviously just one of his guys, so it's not his fault. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely terrible. There were some good things here though. I guess the ending was a little interesting. But this is really, really terrible. If only for the fact that it was filmed in Germany. The script is stupid, especially the plot (which is entirely unscripted) for something as a comedy. It's about a German teacher who has some bizarre sexual encounters, which turns into a sort of cult. And the teacher gets drunk with some scary people and he is killed by a bunch of crazy women. But the actors are good, but there's no real story.  My rating:  Very, very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first impression of this film was that it would be the best example of bad genre, bad writing, bad acting, bad film-making, bad-writing, bad script, bad movie-making and bad acting (especially the first half). In retrospect, I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. This is not an isolated incident, but it's pretty much bad in every way.  The plot is very predictable and predictable. The ending is too predictable. There is nothing in the story to make you care.  This is a film that just doesn't deserve your attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst movie ever made in the U.S. Let's see what's really a film about! A good movie like 'The Omen', is actually made in a very different genre.  This is the dumbest movie ever created. There is absolutely nothing good about this movie except for the actors and the acting. The fact that the movie was made is only the result of a bad script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no plot whatsoever whatsoever and has absolutely nothing to do with the genre of horror. And while it has the occasional comedy (and the occasional laugh), it lacks any sort of intelligence that would be required to make such a movie. A small girl, who's so insecure she's even scared to death, is being tortured by a big man who is hunting her for sex (which is more than the big man's appetite) is getting killed at the climax of the movie by a giant, blue-haired zombie. The characters are pretty bad, although they do have some good jokes.  I recommend avoiding this movie. The good part of it, as it is, is that the movie is surprisingly funny. This is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but the movie, without any plot, makes absolutely no sense. I gave it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was boring and uninteresting.  A poor story, badly written dialog, and extremely dull camera-work in a very predictable sequence. Even the most predictable dialog could be predictable. The good stuff was so horrible that the audience couldn't stand it out for a second.  This is no good. The movie should be called a B-Movie from a movie with nothing but a good cast and a good director (who perhaps won over the viewer for her courage, but was still just as inept as a director and a camera operator).  I did watch this because I'm usually a little bit involved with movies, and I usually find them more entertaining if they're from a more serious genre than a humorless hack-and-bash. But even the most ardent fans of the genre can't make this movie fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the director was great, and she showed us to the right good role, however I can't seem to relate to "this" type of movie. The movie seemed like a rip off from a movie about a documentary (with some documentary footage). The story of a fictional character with a big ego and a small ego was just flat. I felt like I was watching a documentary and when I saw it I expected something similar from a true documentary (which I have seen many of these). The movie only lasted about 15 minutes and the director showed some good actors and a decent script but they were totally lost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really bad. The main plot is very predictable and predictable. I was very impressed to see a very interesting and clever and entertaining movie. Unfortunately, it didn't end well. If your watching a movie, you'll probably miss everything. There are no story lines that will surprise you. No story line, no characters that are surprising.   If you're willing to buy this movie, it's a waste of a lot of money. The characters are pretty dumb. And the writing is only very decent, not great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest failure of a filmmaker since 2001, and it really gets worse every year. Even if you're not an fan of Michael J. Reilly or James Stewart, it's a shame to see this mess of a movie.  I give it 4 out of 10 points. In fact, I actually saw it, and I'm not sure what I was doing with it. I was watching the whole thing over the weekend, but I didn't like it. Not only did I not enjoy it, I was utterly bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just like the rest of the movies, this is bad for the first 50 minutes.  My personal opinion is that the film is about as bad as movies that you can watch in Hollywood.   But I like to stay away from all the worst movies ever made, since I'm not really interested in them.  But this movie did have a redeeming feature. While the other films were just ditany-like or mindless, this one actually got a lot better.  The director's acting was OK. But unfortunately the movie is boring, as it tries so hard to make it fun.  And I can't say much about this movie, since it wasn't all that bad. But if you were really looking for fun and entertainment, you wouldn't spend any time in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping for this movie to be good and great, and unfortunately the whole movie turned out to be a plain trashfest. I think the director and the casting team should have a full credit in what they put out in the movie, because it was truly bad. There is no way to predict that this film would be a hit. There was no storyline, nothing interesting. It's just a bunch of gimmes trying to make up a movie that doesn't have a plot. It was completely predictable, and had nothing going on with any storyline. The only reason the actors felt so strongly in their characters was that the director tried to take his own personal personal interest in his character and made a really bizarre movie. The first scene was just about a teenage girl that gets her boyfriend pregnant, which is probably about 4 years old, and the ending is where she is married to a real person, who tells her that she has to make a movie about her life. The movie was pretty bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. I can't say more than that. It's just a big, slow-moving "film" with no chemistry, no comedy, no plot, no "real" story. The plot was very predictable and the characters were bad. This was very confusing, especially when it occurred in the main plot line. This movie was basically a "trading a couple" situation with no ending. The ending just felt like a re-taken for the purposes of a film. The movie just wasn't quite funny, it wasn't scary, and I was very bored watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame, I suppose, that in all this time I have seen so little entertainment. I am a movie lover, and I would like to see a good one. Unfortunately, it isn't one. It's simply a stupid movie that can't carry an interesting plot. It has absolutely nothing. I found it interesting when watching clips of it at a movie theatre, but I could find out anything else by reading it, or watching a re-edited TV show. For example, it made a mistake when it showed the number of women who actually had sex in it. It should have been one of the men in the movie. It was the man, but he was the woman. It didn't make any more jokes.  I don't think it was made for a TV show (it's not a sitcom), so I don`t give it much of a chance. However, a couple of good actors would be good in it, and the plot was pretty good. Unfortunately it never really had a storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointing plot, I'm sorry to say, it is only the least of the worst.  A lot of the characters in this movie are so annoying and so unlatable, I won't even try to guess. I am a big fan of Mr. Pines, unfortunately, his only two lines in the film are pretty good. The rest of the cast is pretty terrible. I can't blame the guy, but I wouldn't recommend this to anybody. The movie was pretty good, if you want to watch something that would be better and had a more plot. Unfortunately, I found out about this movie a couple of days ago, and I can only assume that it was made for a purpose other than to make me dislike. It is a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's a bad joke, a bad sitcom, a terrible plot.   You can see that it is, a poor comedy but it isn't bad to me. If I was a big fan of it I would have at least laughed a little bit. I have nothing else to say except what people who have nothing to say say but say nothing but what people say.  The jokes are awful. They just don't come together in the way that they want to make funny jokes.  I just can't seem to find this movie anywhere on HBO, HBO channel, Showtime, Channel 4, etc. They don't have something to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of time - this is the first film with a decent performance by any female (and not even decent scriptwriter or good director, so far). The problem is that we are put on it's a little bit too late in the film to bring something to the audience. The plot was too basic and the story, as planned, could be played. This made me want to throw in my own seat and say "NO, THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE". It was an utter waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is pretty bad, and a terrible movie about a really bad movie. I don't know how one guy gets an apartment and a house. That's what I'm thinking about. The apartment is too big, too old, and the house has a kitchen that is only about 1 inch wide. If someone gets a $1,000 to build this for himself, I hope that guy does the same thing. There are many people in the house who think that they're so cute and funny that they can laugh at a real movie: You can laugh in a big room of a flat. You can smoke in a small room. You will not even have a chance to find a movie where the plot is the best. You have to see someone fall out of a window after having sex. I'm scared that he'll sleep in his underwear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see a little bit more information about this movie and the fact that it was released in '1995. If you can find this movie, then I'd suggest you see it when you're in need of entertainment. It's absolutely painful to see such daffy, empty and meaningless film characters. This is the worst of the b-movie crap I have seen. If this is a movie, I'd say 'Stop it.' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First, let me state how stupid this movie is. While the plot and the characters were decent, the whole movie is a collection of dumb things. If you don't like stupid things, you'll hate this movie.   The plot was fairly interesting but it was slow-moving. There are some moments that you think, if they were real people, they would be so stupid, but I guess the plot was just that, the plot, which couldn't have made it into a much better movie. The movie was basically just an action movie. There were some good parts, but it really wasn't that interesting. For example, the actors (Kelis etc.) were great but they never connected with the characters very well. The scene where he meets someone, or anyone else, is the only good thing in the entire movie. That part alone could have been much better than what he actually said.  The ending of the movie was mediocre, too, which has been done just a few times. I think that the ending of this movie would have been better. But I think the ending is just terrible. It just doesn't have enough substance to make it worthwhile to view it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like a little bit of adventure and I like that it's hard to predict. This movie was just an awful waste of money. It should have been so much better. I am going to say this is bad movie, but the main problem with the movie was that it doesn't really make its message. When I first watched this movie I was really confused as to why it was trying to be so convincing. The "loyalty" excuse was a huge plot hole in the story which I was unable to figure out. I was not able to figure it out.  I ended up watching it just so I can continue to enjoy it, but I just didn't think I could get to the end of it. It just doesn't give you the "loy" feeling of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "A Day In The Boy" is so bad, I have to admit this because the acting is really bad. A boy gets bitten on a razor by some monster while we are on the boat.  There are no good characters in it, neither the characters nor the settings of the film. The plot is very stupid, you have to know that it is a very boring movie.  I recommend to watch this movie only if you are interested in this movie, but even after watching it you don't feel like any of it. If you're a bit serious about this film I would recommend to stay away. But don't expect to get even more than 2 or 3 minutes to watch the whole movie. I recommend staying away if you didn't like this movie and you like stupid, stupid, scary movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a little bit disappointing that the "new, innovative, original, non-commercial" story of "Star Wars" is about the movie's greatest flaw.  As much as the movie itself was supposed to be about the original, "Star Trek" is just another excuse to waste your money on one of the worst movies ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's pretty bad and I was expecting better from this genre of film to be at the level I'm at. This is just a pretentious film in its own way. It's just not an entertaining film. It doesn't really have a story. It just shows some scenes that are just not funny. The story was probably a very simple, yet predictable.  I can only recommend this bad movie because it does some very good acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not as much as what you would expect from one of these horror films. There is little dialog, few images, and a few scary moments are left out of the movie. While some scenes are supposed to show what the person has become, the rest are just dead grunts and a zombie (the latter) while an unknown woman tries to pick up a bunch of demons.   It also lacks a storyline, a little bit of humor, and many of the actors seem wasted. Some of the characters even don't seem to act like the characters in the rest of the film. It's a poor excuse for a movie.  The acting is good but the script is bad. There are some of the creepier elements in the movie but there is so many of them that you can't really find it.  I also think it is probably some sort of zombie movie or a horror movie for a group of people. It would be interesting to add some bit of suspense in it but there really isn't any. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointment. I just discovered this movie on TV and was completely horrified to learn that it was made. It is so bad, it is so boring, it just is bad. The plot is unbelievable and really stupid. Why couldn't the makers of this movie be honest in the storyline? You can't learn anything from the movie. There is absolutely no story in it. The director of this film is clueless and totally clueless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had hoped this would be interesting but it quickly became boring and boring, just like so many other movies in the past two decades.  I won't say the movie was bad because it was quite good. But it was boring and had nothing to do with the whole story, like most other movies, it just consisted of the story, and the camera movements, like many of the actors. It seemed as if the people were filming on a computer with a camera, like the actors from the movie, were walking around in a bus. It also reminded me of a bad episode of "SCTV." In it's "Storytelling 101" it made some pretty good movies, but they were only about the "storytelling." It didn't have much more to do than what it had already done.  The characters, the plot, and most importantly, the characters were not even good, the story was boring, and you couldn't feel like they even had a purpose.  This movie just does not fit. I'd like to see a better one from the past, because this movie is about the movie itself. But I think you can call this movie a failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was no fun whatsoever, the only thing that got me to look at it was the story line. Even as I was initially a fan of it, I quickly found myself bored. I was glad when it got to the end - a sad woman who wants to escape this fate with no regrets - but then I didn't understand what happened to make the ending up.  There is only one person with a copy of this movie and that is the producer. He is not paying attention to developing this movie. What he is doing is putting his script down a lot of times in order to write a "proposal" and then watching the rest of it only to make it look like a bad film. At the beginning of the movie I felt like I was watching a movie: it seemed to be a straight, even in the ending. Then I wondered if a director had lost his way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a horror story of an ungodly and unhelpful cast, with the characters the worst thing I've seen, and the worst piece of video games ever. I don't really remember the plot but the story was not good. The video game is boring but not a lot of games have this kind of thing. The only thing I thought was good was the graphics. The voices were OK, I guess it was funny. The camera was weak, there were few lines worth commenting and the editing was decent but nothing like the actual movie. The cinematography was horrible. I would expect to see a movie that would take more than 10 minutes to watch. I recommend a movie: 1:1 "The Dead" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this movie more than 5 times, but I'm tired and tired after 15 hours. After this film I'm left feeling nauseated and disgusted that any decent human would even allow them to make this film.  I'm not going to give this film a 10 because of the utter incompetence of its actors and the sheer stupidity of its script. It is almost painful to watch it. Its predictable script and characters are simply ridiculous. For example, a movie where a bunch of murderers are hanging out for life. It would have made more sense if they were just throwing off some murders, but there is no real explanation for how these murderers are responsible for the crimes in the film. They are just guys that look for and kill bodies, or are just in the habit of killing people. The plot, the camera-movement, etc., are just ridiculous. No real story is presented. The story is about a man who kills people for a night (the man is not even named after the name "Kip"): who can not only survive in a cabin where a group of thugs do the killings, but does so by killing the person responsible for many murders. This is the kind of movie that is not suited for any genre, such as a documentary or even a movie: its just a horrible waste of time, but it can't stop the low budget filmmakers from wasting a good time on making cheap, awful, cheap, mediocre movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had to be made without this "horror" tag, and it wasn't. The film didn't take the time necessary to create "horore" characters and really scary things, the characters themselves, or the way we find ourselves. The story is a waste of time. The characters are too generic, the dialog is too long and the acting is stupid.  I watched it about thirty minutes before it was sent to the "Horror" category. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the same as most bad movies of the early '80's that have been made at the expense of a major studio (Lincoln). The story line is pretty poor and nothing happens. The acting is poor, the cinematography is awful, the story line lacks drama and the overall acting was bad.  What i did was to ask my friends and family to do a movie that was obviously intended to be for a children. The story and the story were OK. But they were not what we wanted or wanted.   I thought it was just bad (it was the equivalent of "Tetrapa 3"). I had hopes after it came out that it would become popular with young kids. After a few months of playing, i realized i had wasted a lot of time and money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The only reason I have ever seen one is that it can be funny. But, you can't laugh at yourself when you're laughing at another movie.  It doesn't even have a plot. No one's going to be fooled by this; you'll be bored and think you'll have died if you're so dumb! I tried to find one that was interesting but I couldn't. Maybe I could turn it into a short film which could give some laughs. I'd like to know how to make it up. This is just the last film I saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen many movies that are very good but this is one of the worst ones I've ever seen. The plot is absolutely ridiculous. Even the movie's opening scenes are so poorly written it's actually embarrassing to watch. It's just the same old "my old dad" scenario where it's only funny when it's not funny at all, like most things nowadays. The movie tries to make a joke out of all the silly things the main character did to make up his personal life. It just doesn't seem like the way it has to be because this movie was poorly written from the beginning. I won't even recommend this one to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just like those movies i was so scared of i won't finish even if i am in a movie. Then i saw that it was rated only 8.4, that it would be shown in a theatre only 3 or 4 times. I watched that 2 hours of it and i was out of my mind because the story is nothing like a real story. It is just mindless plot that the writers tried to create. There is some good lines, but this is not the way to go. I want to give a 1 1 1/2 stars because it is a waste of your time and it will make you angry and frustrated. The story is lame and stupid. The only reason i am saving this film is because it was a hit in the late 1980's when it was released, so people saw it as one of those movies. Now it is only in our late 30's. It doesn't even have a chance to win 1/3, but it has a funny ending so don't waste a moment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a typical teen girl, who is forced to babysit for her parents. In the end of the movie, it turns into a rape scenario. It does not, which is surprising. It makes no sense whatsoever. It is just awful. Some scenes are so bad that I have to wonder if this movie even manages to keep itself together. It contains a bunch of gimped scenes which you are not supposed to know what they are. The first scene is a bunchof scenes of guys making out on a girl. The next scenes are like a collection of pictures and only they are supposed to be in a room where you get laid down. If you get into this movie, then you will spend two nights feeling nauseated with just goshawkings. Even if you have a good sense of humor, you can only watch for the worst and be horrified by the rest of the thing. It can't get that bad. I give it a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are people in the world that need to be taught how to behave. They can't wait to get into a proper movie experience. What are they doing? If they wait until the movie is over, they will miss out the experience of watching The Godfather. There are also people who want to know more about it. Well, I'll tell them to stay away for a bit of time, and see that they don't get any better treatment. You can't tell how the movie was made, because you don't even know the cast that was involved. I suppose the movie would have gotten better by switching to a movie called "The Big Cheese Fish". Well, that's the only way I can think to explain it. I won't repeat my opinions, but it is difficult to read. If the person watching the movie has any sense of what he is saying, he will lose. I say that this movie is not to be taken as a complete piece of entertainment, and you are better off taking it as a story to learn more about. I wish I had this kind of knowledge! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, so bad that I'm willing to write this negative review:  If you're going to see this, please read the first part, because that's all we've got.  Well this movie has nothing.  What's it there? There is no plot, nothing like a plot, and no acting. Just, you know what happens.  Now, if the director had the idea to make a comedy film, what would it be? Well, no, he wouldn't. But if you're willing to watch an unfun movie, I guess there is some pretty good humor. But there is no real plot, no real dialog, no acting, no plot. I can see that this film tries to get across something new, but it just doesn't have any.  I've seen this movie for the first time, and I'm a little bit bored, and it's so bad I don't even care if it's a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts with an incredibly naive couple, a mother who wants to marry his son, a man who was married to another woman, and a girl who is married to a doctor. The doctor is the one guy who can turn the whole family into his own. The woman is the father and father, while the guy has the idea that marrying a man will make him a real man, and he hopes to make up his family by marrying a woman he will never be. The only reason that I have to read this, is that I think it's an incredibly ridiculous idea for a film: marrying a girl (the husband) who can help make up the family, but not married to her husband. It's just too silly.  In addition, there is a very, VERY stupid story with two really stupid characters. You have to find out that they are the friends of the couple. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those films I thought would be really enjoyable, but I couldn't stomach it. The plot was boring and the acting had poor direction. The "story" wasn't even worth it, and I would have rather paid money for it than to watch this movie.  The plot is about a young boy and his teacher who are about to go to a bad school with an ex-cop pretending to be a principal. There is also a bunch of teens who just got into a big gang, and the two of them plan to go in together in their high school, and we are all at the very beginning of the movie. But we don't even get to see the teens' friends anymore. We only see some of the big boys, and then some of their neighbors. And the school principal who apparently cannot figure out anything about them. It's hard to find anyone in the school except a pretty woman with a big blanche.    I give this film a 9. That's all, but it's also extremely bad, and this was just awful. There was nothing interesting except for the bad acting and the bad soundtrack, which made me very sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't funny, it's slow, and a lot of it revolves around a certain character (a woman who was attacked in a small town by a mysterious group of thugs) and her death. This is a shame, since the storyline is pretty good and has some nice surprises in it. Unfortunately it doesn't really come together in a great way. The actors are terrible. They are too one-sided, too predictable and their characters don't even have any lines in their script that make the viewer laugh. There is nothing funny at all. At least you can assume that this movie is for serious audiences. At most there will be some really funny moments. But if you are just looking for a quick laugh, you might be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I can point out the badness of this film, it is not very difficult. You're not going to like it. I can't believe this is where they decided to make a film about the real phenomenon of suicide. It is ridiculous! It's a waste of time to waste this movie! The acting is terrible, the storyline is not good, the story is not even good, but they could have avoided this mess. I give this film two stars because of the failure of the plot. I gave it a 1 because of how terrible it is. I don't know if that's true but I can definitely say that the acting is a disgrace. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie based on a poorly written book, but an extremely disappointing one. The story, supposedly based on the "My Dream Life" book, is nothing more than a "BEGINNING" movie, and unfortunately isn't that much more. The plot, however, contains some amusing bits that I might consider as a "feature" in a movie, but the story itself doesn't work.   This movie is about an older woman in Italy, who has a son with another man (the younger man), and is married to her husband. She wants to get rid of the man. A few years later, the woman has an affair with another guy, and the resulting family that she was living with, as well as being married with the man, is also married to the man's wife. They begin a relationship with each other, and she becomes pregnant with another child.  In fact, the only thing that saves the movie is the scene that depicts the boy as a baby. There is nothing that could save this movie, since it revolves so much around an elderly woman having an affair, and getting her pregnant.  I'm not sure if the author had read all of the book in advance. And if I didn't, I can't imagine what she was plotting. If so, then I am still sorry for the horrible plot, but as it is, I have no idea why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are bad, the plot is bad, and the story is poorly done. I liked the first movie and I enjoyed the idea of the idea and characters in it, but it feels like a poor imitation of other movies. The script seemed weak and the characters were weak. I can't say much more, but I just can't take it seriously. This movie was only made in a few days, so please look at it when it comes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the only reason I have been disappointed in recent years. The acting is not as good as usually seen in movies such as "True Time: The Fastest Money You Can Make." The music is mediocre, as well as the storyline.  This movie is no good in the "B" category, unless you like the actor, as the film was obviously about the same actor and the movie itself. It does not have the same look, even like when the show aired. The plot is terrible. The pacing is slow. This film makes no sense. It just seems like somebody took it out of "catertainment," with no purpose.  I was hoping to see the first time someone created a good movie with "B." This one is bad, not even close to the "A." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a shame to waste this wonderful piece of entertainment and so much effort to make a bad-movie. This movie would have been a great piece of film. Instead, I'd say I had the same trouble with this movie. I tried to find a positive review about the movie: It had so much potential but had so little of it. And it did not deliver. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie. I have seen the previous movies this year and they are just as terrible as this one. Even a good movie can be interesting. This one is not. It is just a total b-mole! Why does this show up on cable? There was a similar movie that came out a few weeks ago with the same plot but with a better plot. I didn't know where it was but I thought to watch it because I didn`t have a lot of TV channels and was wondering why it was not able to get broadcast on FOX or other stations. This movie is so bad that I want to rip my hands off and punch myself with a piece of plastic! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the equivalent of a horror film for the kids. There's nothing to be won by this film. It's just another excuse for children to be forced to watch this crap. I have a hard time coming up to sleep and watching this stuff. The ending is just stupid, I mean, for the ending, and I think the plot is just so dumb!  I don't recommend this for kids. For adults it's OK, for a kids, but this really sucks! I had the opportunity to see the first part of the movie and I don;t even finish the movie!!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read about this movie being "re-released" in a few months, and I was skeptical to even rent it. The movie was terrible and I don't remember seeing it when I was a teenager. In fact, I didn't want to see it. And I thought this movie would not work. The whole thing was really poorly written. I did not like it. It was bad. I didn''t feel like watching a typical high school film, and it was just a waste of money.  The only reason I was able to rent it was because of the extremely low box office cost of it. However, this is just one of many horror movies in this genre. Why there should be another movie with this kind of bad story? This film had no plot. And it didn''f have a cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are going to see this movie, be warned, you'll be left feeling like you are stuck in a loop. The acting was flat and the story was too much about the kids (who was in this story) vs. the parents (who also was in the story). In a nutshell, the kids had no chance whatsoever. And I would agree with them.  There is a huge amount of material in this movie that I do not recall seeing for very long. The film was a pile of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When this movie was released, I was very intrigued with this film. As I watched it, I couldn't believe that this was a serious plot. How, for example, is a person able to put together a collection of twenty-five different objects that are supposedly kept in different houses that are at odds of being found every day by a woman with a long, thin, dark hair, and over thirty years old. There are four couples that are supposed to be in the same house, and a woman who is supposed to have killed the wife and eight people who are supposed that belong to the family, in a very, very, really stupid movie. That isn't my fault, that's not the film, that I'm sure that doesn't matter to this movie, that it was just a movie made by some people who didn't know what they were doing. What's more disturbing than the fact that this movie doesn't make much sense to me, is the fact the only way it was made was to imply that it made any sense at all. There's something to be said about that. One thing that is so important to this film is that it is obviously a terrible film. It lacks any real point. The only reason why this film made it was so terrible was the fact it was bad. I mean, I'm very sure that someone had made it that way, because in America, you've seen many movies that are like this. There aren't too many people who can make that point. It's too bad that this film did, and I'm looking at the beginning of its production to figure out why. Why there was no real point to make? I'm going to guess, that was the reason it was awful. My guess is that the writer was just messing around with the project. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just another in a series of atrocious movies, nothing new, nothing unique, and none interesting. I had to laugh at the fact that it was set in New Orleans, in the big city that is the heart of the South, and there is absolutely nothing about the city that can make me like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just rented this movie and couldn't believe it. The first thing I saw was a ridiculous "Dennis Wilson" character that I thought was stupid. The rest of the movie was unbelievable trash. The story wasn't even remotely true. The plot was so bad that I had to assume that the acting was done at a school set because it was so obviously fake. The best part of this movie was probably the fact that the cast was so horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a much better movie, but this one isn't really worth one. A couple of bad acts, a couple of stupid situations, an awful girl and a whole lot of wasted acting in a couple. But, I can forgive it because it was pretty good. The acting was terrible, the story wasn't good and I thought the ending was really bad. There was only one girl that appeared in it and I didn't understand why she got so involved in the story, and that was only supposed to be a lesbian, as you know.    All in all, a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You are good at creating movies of suspense and entertainment. But this one just sucks, even with a decent script. If you're watching a comedy, you'll enjoy it. But if you're expecting a laugh or a laugh, you won't. I wouldn't even watch it with any knowledge. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible! It is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Even if it were made in a similar style, this would be a complete waste of money for even the cast.  I would be really curious to see this film, because it is so poorly made that I really couldn't care. The scenes in the theater were just about as bad as the real movie. The acting was extremely poor, even though some of the actors were good. Some of the special effects were extremely poor. The editing was terrible. My only positive comments are that the video is so awesome that I never want to see it again. I hope you will make a movie that is more worthy than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best thing about this film is the fact that it is nothing like a film I had ever seen. Its no more than a waste of time. Its just boring and very dull.  It is the worst film I've ever seen since the first "The Scentes" movie, and I think it was a bit of a better thing than that movie. It is worse than this crap and I would have given "Scentes of Mind" a score higher if they had turned it into a really funny and clever film. The "SCENTES" film is just terrible, I cannot say that this is any better than the rest of "The Chronicles of the Seven" or the other "SCE-Scent" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just went away from the movie after seeing it in Japan and had to put in a positive review about it, which is why I decided to give this bad movie 4 out of 10 because it was a good one. However, I couldn't even finish it...  It is just plain bad. It is simply no way to communicate a story. I have to wonder if this was the first film made back in 1998. It's simply a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that this was one of the worst films I've ever seen. It was very low on plot, sometimes over the top, but it had some pretty good special effects, but unfortunately was totally inconsistent. Some of the scenes were very good, like the chase in the woods. But I can't say anything about this movie. Some scenes were OK, but they were also completely inconsistent. I really couldn't figure out what was going to happen in this movie, and at times I was just looking at my own camera when the camera started recording the scene, and it didn't even finish filming, I thought it was a complete mess. I have not seen the series, so I don't really know what was the story, but I think they had some good special FX. But what the hell was going in for this film?! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the sequel to the first two and is really bad.  It's not original, I can't believe it was any good. It's basically just a simple, mindless movie with one character and one supporting character.  They get back into a little bit of action and then you realize that you are about to spend your entire time in this.  If you're watching the first one, you don't mind wasting hours.  The third one is a bit better but only slightly better.  This movie has nothing to do with character development, except the plot. It does have a couple of interesting plot elements but they are not developed, there's nothing that makes the story interesting.  I just can't blame it for not having a good plot. That's the way I think it was, and this movie seems to have that same feeling.  Even the characters are pretty annoying and boring. There are only about six or seven that are actually interesting. I guess it's better that some people would like this movie so they can watch it for the laughs and some suspense but don't really enjoy it.  You might enjoy some action and fight and a good storyline but you really should not be watching it for it. They are just poorly developed and it doesn't really add anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really do not understand why this film exists. It was very similar to some of my previous films, but the film was boring, not very funny and the acting seemed dull. Not that much more interesting to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole plot revolves around a secret laboratory in the backseat of a car which was used in the earlier films The Air Conditioning Laboratory and The Space Force (a much better ending). It was just another excuse for a new car which had nothing to do with its name. And, just as much as the previous films, the film doesn't really come alive. The plot's only interesting elements are the appearance of "The Flats" (a robot with no real face), and the existence of a secret army, as well as the occasional hints about a future that includes the presence of "Hobey's" technology. And the whole thing was really bad, as it seemed like one of the biggest goofs ever. The characters are all stupid and uninteresting. The story seems to have been cobbled together, and it really takes a lot of effort just to get to know the basic facts (at least the parts that are left for us to learn). The scene where the Flats find out that there are no more cars for them and that they have to find another one, is only about a half an hour. The scene that revolves around the car being crashed is a horrible waste of time and is followed by another scene that is only 30 minutes long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just goes on another direction. What was the other direction of this movie? The only thing I can conclude is that if the director had made more than one episode in the first story, he would have made them far more dramatic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I saw this film the other day, and I am sorry to say it was not very good. But at the same time, I do not think the people involved in the production of this film had any real talent or understanding about how to make a film. It is obvious from the synopsis that this film was not meant to be made. I am afraid you will spend the entire life on this movie... You're going to miss out on the most spectacular moments in it, and you'll spend the rest of your time being boringly entertained. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Thirteen" (or "The 13") was absolutely terrible. It had no substance, nothing new. The plot was so weak, the acting was weak, and the movie was really dull. It's not as bad as the original "The Nine Hour Man", but it was the biggest failure of the "Thirp." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the first "Puppet" film in a theater, I was expecting the sequel to be much better than the original. Unfortunately, it was only about half as good. The first film was far superior to the sequel, mainly due to the fact that it was a better idea. The sequel is essentially one of those stupid and stupid ideas that you have seen before. If you don't want to see a movie like that, watch a movie that does better than a dumb movie: The original, and "Puppets 2: Fats a Dog" are much better to make jokes about the two puppets.  I think the idea of using the 2D Puppeteers to "save the world" is probably a bit stupid. The Puppeteer should be the one in charge of the global cleanup of planet Earth. It would be really hard to be more stupid than to use the two Puppetees as a "global cleanup" which is basically no different from the first one. This is not only the worst example of bad film-making in a film franchise, but also of bad movie-making overall. The plot of the "Pets 2" is nothing interesting or interesting. The only thing worth mentioning was that the movie's plot seemed to have been conceived by the producers as a really good idea. Unfortunately they didn't have the same effect as they had when the original was made. I was looking for something new to see "Punch 2: A Dog". But I did not find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to bring a fictional series of a bizarre serial killer that can't find anything but the main character. It is, perhaps, the worst example of bad movie making that has ever been released. The acting is poor, the special effects are weak, and the story is flat and insulating. There's nothing that can keep this low-budget slasher from going into my brain like a hot cup of chocolate. You'll probably think of it as a straight-faced film from some old film magazines (there are those), but even for that, it is just too damn dull.  The only way this movie is made is by turning in a huge budget to the hounds. We're looking at a new series of movies in the US, and it is clear from the trailers that the filmmakers had to cut out some of the parts that the fans know would be boring to watch. Some of the shots just aren't even interesting. Some other special effects work well, but this doesn't even have the same. It's just a pile of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a really terrible attempt at a comedy film, but even if it wasn't, it is no longer funny. I mean, sure, a lot of comedy is going on and the jokes are pretty funny. But the jokes do not come up as well as this is.  I would give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i'll call it The Evil Clown's Ball for short. It was bad and extremely bad. It's like a film made by kids at home and made by children in a group of people who should not be in front of the camera. I just don't know how. The characters, in this case, are very stupid, stupid, and very annoying. I know it's because of the low budget and the slow pace. I'll give this movie a 10 but it's not worth it. It is a bad attempt at a film that I can't believe to have happened, but I believe it's very difficult for the actors to make it interesting. The actors in this movie do not have enough talent and the whole thing is very poor. My opinion on this film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may as well have read this, if not in the first paragraph. This film is simply a waste of precious time and money, a waste at every other level. When you are so wasted by someone like me to say what you had to say (which I believe this is), I will never forget it. I'm really not sure why someone can take so much time and space to write this garbage, but I think it was done on an impulse, that somebody, not me, decided to make a movie about a car accident.  This movie is not worth watching. It's not funny, it's not like a real film, but it does not really develop anything. I do not believe anyone will ever talk about this movie as a movie worth watching, except for maybe a few people in Hollywood and maybe one or two people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise was so predictable it just seemed to work out to the worst. The actors, the actresses, the supporting actors in their supporting roles, the "came on" scenes were just poorly done and there was not enough dialog.  There was not a convincing story, not a compelling message about the plight of the old woman or the people who would be affected by the movie. There was only one plot line.   I will admit that this movie would have been a better story if the writers had a bit more development. The idea of it could have been something like a documentary or a series of stories, and the movie ended with some semblance of an ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors are pretty good, but the story is utterly awful. The fact that this movie was about a boy who is going to fight against his wife who hates him is quite hilarious. He also had a very strange looking face and a really annoying face, which is hard to make fun of. I wonder why this movie is so popular only to have one episode released on DVD. I've seen the episodes and they are generally pretty funny but not great. The one exception was the big laugh at the end, where the actors pretended to act their parts by pretending to be actors.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like movies to be funny but this one is the opposite. The humor, which was OK at the beginning, is not funny anymore. The movie was over half the time. The characters are not funny and the only funny part in the movie is the teacher. Even the teacher had a ridiculous face. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't even begin to talk about how poor this movie is. I'm convinced it was a documentary, and if there was some truth in it, it wouldn't have been much more than a half-hour of an hour.  It was simply terrible. It had no character involvement or any plot. It was completely predictable and utterly ridiculous.  I'm sure I could tell more about it, but I couldn't. I couldnn't even tell who was in it. I can only laugh at the lack of an idea to make the film.  The other main plot was a female actor who was involved in a gang of thugs that made off with the person who stole a stash of heroin. He didn't go home and get some heroin, instead he was sent to an apartment in downtown to make his own family take over the drug operation for the mafia, and I guess you can guess how it went. I guess they had some plans to get into a drug operation in San Francisco and take over drug operations in the Bay Area. I didn't find out until after it's all over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am going to make a simple observation: in this one, they tried to break down the characters to make it look like a movie. It didn't work out. It isn't that funny. The plot does not even make the case for itself. The jokes were about things that were not funny, and the film made some of the worst movies ever. The only way that this film could make it better was to have some real action. Nothing was that good. And the ending was really bad. It doesn't matter that the ending is funny. It really didn't help the movie, even after having some of its jokes be removed from the film. I didn't really understand that they made the movie. I thought that the whole movie was going to be a laugh at a movie: a guy gets a belly stuffed full of magenta slime that fills his belly. His girlfriend is the little girl with whom he had left behind. She tries to steal it, but he tells her to go back to him so she doesn't get a belly full of slime. When he goes in, he's going to eat it. He tries to make her eat it and say he's mad. It's just that the joke was so terrible that they couldn't see it. They wanted to use a lot of jokes and a lot more action to make this movie funny, so they used the cheap trick of making a film and then making the ending funny. However, they made it a joke only so stupid that they can't get out of the trash! I was really, really hoping that they would get more people to see this movie but I was disappointed in the lack of people who had wanted to see it! This movie is so bad that I decided not to bother my friends and I've never had much sympathy for it. I am really disappointed that I did not even give this movie 2.5 stars because it's such a waste of time and time to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't understand why you would get this film in this new format. The plot is really stupid. The acting was very bad. The ending was bad. There was nothing but lame scenes and scenes of sex. The only thing that made this movie good was the soundtrack. I will say that the soundtrack was good, but it was very little over the top. This movie had some of the best parts of the movie, but unfortunately, I was too sick to see it and will never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're interested in "the original series" I can't blame you for reading and watching this film. Unfortunately it just isn't to be a serious part of "FANNING" and I'm not sure that it was. It lacks the creative flair of a true "FULLY ADVANCE" movie, in which you can imagine yourself and the characters reacting to a real world. It doesn't even have a plot or a story to be true to itself, instead it has its own agenda to make money and gain status in the wider world and to try to "make a mark". It's a movie that can be shown on TV but lacks any sense of being "finally great", the result is that it's not actually worth doing. The acting isn't good, and it doesn't have a clear story to start with. The only good thing about this movie is that you can't really tell whether you're going to like it or not. They do a little bit of justice by including the original series to help the fans stay interested. But by the end of it you have nothing but a lot of unnecessary baggage, nothing more than fake story and bad actors, that ruins the whole concept. The ending is the worst part of this movie. It was good that one was good with the final film but the rest just makes you mad and annoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this film features bad actors, the worst casting I've ever seen. I'm not sure if the director knew what they were going to do in the rest of their movie, but when watching it it was only a guess.  this movie is one of the worst movies I've seen this year, so I'm giving this bad movie an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has only four (five!) girls. It is a bad film, with very bad acting and story. Some actors will play characters which are not good; others will be good (or not so bad) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big mistake to be named the best action film of 2015. It's a sad day when we find out that films about the worst types of actors and actors are the most popular. This movie was awful, the plot was poorly conceived and the characters were not in a good position at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I stated above, this film is so bad, it's almost funny. The idea is that a little girl is obsessed with her body and is looking for a good husband and a little boy is just looking for another one. The whole thing is wrong. The girl is just a desperate little girl and she goes for his dick, not his baby daddy. This is just ridiculous. I think it's OK to have a little child, but I was really tired watching it and really didn't understand what it was going to do. At least the kids would make more of a positive contribution, which I can't say about the boy. I have to confess, though, this movie is at least good for the actors. At some point it could have made a bigger impact with a good cast. But I don't think that would have helped the film. I'd give this film 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a bad, but what an awesome idea. It's bad! The idea is that the people in charge of the US will build a big underground bunker. This is a really bad idea, because it has to include the United States military, which is the real reason the whole movie is in the title. A bunch of people will be in charge. It would also be nice if the people would build a giant underground bunker, and not just include some guy sitting on it, or some kind of robot. So basically what are they doing? They'll make a big bunker, because that's what they want, they have to. And the idea that they will build the underground bunker is stupid, because they want to build another underground bunker that will actually create the apocalypse. In my opinion, the title really ruins the movie for me. There are people who actually are building something like that. They are not building a huge underground bunker in the middle of the desert. The whole movie only revolves around the idea of people building something, and how they build it. But if they had the actual building, you would see the building and then how they actually build it, so there would be nothing but just one building for one month, with one guy sitting in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In fact the film is a completely moronic, un-informed piece of trash, which fails to be true either the truth or even the truth. The film has a plot with a little, slightly clever premise, which leads to a predictable ending, which never quite completes the plot, so much like a movie of some sort, that is just boring. The main reason to watch the film at all is that it is not even a true horror film. It looks like a cartoon of itself, without a plot, with little, and often annoying characters. But it looks good to look like cartoon. A truly silly piece of nonsense. You can find that in the "Halloween" and "Hedon", although it is better for that. It does not have the same feel as "The Wolf Man", the more powerful, and arguably better, version of "The Monster", which features a real monster in a hospital (that is no more real than a cartoon).   The film tries so hard to be a horror film that it can't even make its own statement, and tries so desperately to be more than a film about "horror". This is the way of going into a movie: make a film that has nothing to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had really little plot. I don't think that they have the same budget as "Game of The Dead". This movie really has nothing. Not only one of the movie's co-stars, Jennifer Aniston, is in it, but it's not about her. She does her best in it but I don; her acting isn't good. If you like Jennifer Anota (her in the movie) don't give this movie a chance. If that is true I'm not sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a movie: a plot, a story, nothing else.  Oh, I guess there was some witty scenes, but, then they were ruined. The actors were stupid, and the humor was terrible.  I didn't really think much about this movie except for one scene that got it right. I didn´t care too much about it, but that was the only thing that made me think "oh, I was glad to see it."  This movie is nothing but bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What's the best movie: This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I cannot say that it's worse than a few dozen other movie I've seen. But I do know that it is very hard to find something that would actually make me see it. For instance, I just didn't like any of the other movies that I liked. This movie, I've just not had much sympathy for it. It just seems to be a little longer than I expected it to be. This is mainly because, as with many movies, it's just not going to work. It doesn't even have the "jivet" that makes a movie great. I don't know how the director could actually do anything so easily that is not going out of its own way to get into the mind of the audience.  The acting wasn't particularly good, but the acting was good enough that I didn't even think that I was watching.  So I did not want to finish this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that if you watch this film, you will be bored in many scenes, and they will have a very uncomfortable laugh at your expense. In my opinion, this film is the worst film I've seen in the last 10 years. It's the only thing in my lifetime that has made me laugh. It is a bad idea to try to make something out of this...   What is the point of "Injustice"? Who was the man who was involved in the murder of the girl? How was she killed in a few seconds? And why was she murdered in such a way? How do we know that the man killed the girl. How do they have to be responsible for the murder? Who cares. I've read somewhere that the woman was in prison for a month. How did she make it there? What was she talking about with the man? And how did the man catch her? Who knows? And who was she going to go with at a job interview...? I'm a bit worried about the fact that the guy was in jail and the girl was in a drug filled room. This is really too much to say. I just wanted to say that the film was an attempt to try and "paint a positive review about an awful film" but I was so tired after the film I couldn't even keep watching it... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's so many problems to get to the end of this movie. The acting is really bad. The idea that the hero will try to save his girl is completely absurd. The plot of this is just about as silly as it is. This film does not even go as far as the "Lord's Blue". If you watch this film with the intention of watching it for its entertainment value then you'll never be a part of this film unless you're expecting the end. This movie is really disappointing. If you like "Lord Redacted" then this is the movie for you. Unfortunately it won't even try to make this movie if you're actually watching "LordRedacted". This is only a waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely terrible, not even a bit good. The ending is horrible, as well as the plot. As a viewer of this film, you can't expect to be able to save the life of any of the main characters. The whole premise is unbelievable. The most unbelievable thing in all of this movie was the horrible plot. How did they even decide to go this route? The movie is called "The Other Side" but was actually not the other side of the film. I had to watch this movie because I was curious about this movie. I was disappointed and it made me completely miserable. If I hadn't heard the story before, I would have never guessed what I am in for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, when I made this film I was convinced that the guy in the movie had a story to tell. I guess I thought I'd be tempted to use him for a big plot to his life. But I couldn't really think of him as such. In spite of the fact that I had been given the opportunity to use all of the characters from the film and with them to make the film, I just wasn't convinced that any of the actors had such a story.  The only story I had to use from the scene was the love-sick guy, who I had already met, and not really his own father (who is in a coma) is the real culprit.  When I finally had to put my finger on the screen and show my husband who had always been a happy husband, I tried to make him look angry by doing something which would cause him to become a sad man. He did this a couple of times but by the end of the film the scene is just a simple scene that has some music and it's pretty boring.  Oh, and what a terrible comedy this is. This movie really isn't funny at all and I couldn'll see this in a proper horror movie. I think I only made it because I was looking for a movie with an interesting plot. Sadly it wasn't that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director has now managed to land on a cast and a script, but even the cast is weak. A bad writer is so bad that he doesn't know how to get it off the ground. Some actors, like Tim Robbins, are good, and others, like Jeff Goldblum, are OK. But they are not the best actors in the business. Tim Robbins is the worst. Even if you are a great film producer and a talented writer, you can't hire them for a bad script. That's where it's really hard to find someone capable of doing mediocre movie scripts.    So far, a good director is allowed to make pretty films with the help of a talented cast, but that's not the case with this one. It's a shame that so many of the people involved in this film can't even make a good movie, and it's a case of bad writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a sad day... If the people that were responsible for this film have any sense of humor, you can rest assured that they will have none. If you read any of the comments, it's clear that most of them have never heard of Richard Nixon. As we get to the end of the film, it suddenly becomes a complete joke.  I couldn't tell who the 'victory' of this movie would be, but I can tell who it was and what kind of person they were. They all seemed to be a bunch of people who had never actually worked in the government or the military. If I'm wrong about this movie, please explain how it was made and how I know it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful, I can't believe anyone would want to see it:  As we were watching on DVD, I thought it was OK until they showed it as an un-numbered episode.  The film is about the love of a black woman and some bad people in it, who, by the end of the movie, want to sleep together... I am absolutely sick and tired of this crap, and I wouldn't want to have put my feet in the mud.  I hope you are able to find this out and save yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a few moments of interest in this film but lost the point. My interest was the title of the film. My hope was that it would be good when it was released. I am so sick to find myself in this situation once again. This is a film that has not even a single redeeming feature that it delivers. It's just a collection of clichés of cliché, one person saying, one thing is done, then another. The ending is meaningless and it's a complete disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "B" is about as a big fat chick in a sex fantasy, so stupid that it really made me jump into it (in a way), but I was too stupid to go into it. I found the "C" as much boring as the "B". That really, really, is about a big lesbian porn actress. The only redeeming quality of the film is the scene where the "F" is on top of the couch. I didn't like it.  The acting is bad, the plot is not that interesting, the camera is not great, the direction is poor.  I would love to say that "B", the film was better than the one that "F", but I don't know what to say, because what we saw was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really is horrible.  But i don't know why i saw it. Well i don`t think that if you watched it, you would think it was a great movie and not horrible,  But if you saw it, it's not what i thought it was.  The acting is pretty good, but if you want to see something good, don`T watch the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when it was first released in 2000 so I was expecting it to be an extremely good film, it obviously was not the case. It wasn't even that good, it was bad, it really didn't bring enough value to the movie. It has some great acting but there is no way that this movie can deliver value like that, at least not to me. There is absolutely nothing in this movie worth watching. It's just a completely empty movie. There was absolutely nothing that made it interesting. I don't know what to say about this movie. I was the only person that I saw who even gave it a rating, and I gave it 1 out of 10. I wish that I didn't have to waste this horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film for a couple of weeks because I watched the movie at a movie convention. I thought it looked good, but when the plot started I saw the movie was totally predictable. I was very bored and left the movie after watching about 3 minutes of the film and just said to myself, "This movie is bad, it's terrible".  I can't say it's bad because I actually liked some of the scenes and the movie had lots of character and storyline. Unfortunately the movie didn't stick with the original book and the plot was completely random. The story started with a man who was killed by a giant monster, but after a few minutes it was about to change and then a girl who had killed the guy by being killed by the monster and then was about a man killing another man and a man attacked by a monster and attacked the creature at the end of the movie.  If it had stayed to that, I would have loved it. But this movie just wasn't interesting or interesting. It was just plain old black comedy. It felt like you were forced to watch it to see if the movie made it, instead of having it be just another boring movie. I think there are some movies that are better than this one and this one wasn't one of those. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Adventures of Ricky McCarthy" is a painfully boring story, with few interesting moments. A story about a young woman who lives in rural Kentucky is nothing remotely interesting. The film is only fun if you're stupid and have a low sense of humor.   The story is basically about a bunch of misused college students and a bunch with no discernible reason except to avoid further trouble. The characters aren't good and the characters are boring (I think they should have been cast in a more serious way). There's a decent scene where a guy tries to break up with a girl by throwing her out of the house only to find he has a very good sense of humour.  The plot was pretty good but I think it was pretty dumb. Some of the characters were funny. Some were annoying but only as annoying as usual.  I can't believe how the plot was made. The scenes are obviously cut down to a minimum.  Overall, I give this film a 8 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just like the original, this movie was really stupid. The plot of this is so bad that you can laugh at it. I don't remember why I thought to watch it. Probably I would've gotten bored after 10 minutes of watching.  The acting isn't much better than the original. In some respects it's very similar. In other respects, it's terrible. The fact that this is a comedy means that it's a bad comedy. The jokes are just predictable and extremely annoying.  Even the story has pretty good action sequences, although there are some funny parts in this movie. And it's just not funny.  It's hard to find the movie on any video store, even though it's rated by a reputable person. The DVD copy I bought from another store is much better.  This movie was terrible for me, because it looked like a bad Christmas movie, and I really don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie i've ever seen. It was boring, and its predictable. I thought of watching this movie as a kid. I couldn't even finish the movie.  The story was way too predictable, and this really shows a huge lack of imagination. If you want to watch a movie, try watching "The Oasis" or "Lord Of The Rings". The only redeeming factor in this movie was the actors, because the movie didn't seem like they wasted their time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie I watched was The Devil in a small town. I couldn't find it after I watched it the first time. After I knew that I had watched it, I looked it up again, and I thought about what I had seen. I tried watching it, and it didn't work. It had a few plot twists that were completely predictable and not interesting. There were some funny things, but not funny enough to hold my attention. The other part of the movie had a really good idea--that you could be an old lady who lived in the town and would help the devil find out who she was. I can't imagine anyone wanting to make a documentary like that. It was very poorly developed and was nowhere to be seen.  The story starts at the hospital with a man in a black suit, a hat and black hair. You might as easily have seen him in a car and then suddenly go out on a highway to meet some guy who was on a street corner and find out that he's really a devil. But if you watch it, it seems like that's just a case. He gets the old lady and does something crazy and then he disappears. In the "real" ending, there are many scenes where he gets back with his wife and tells her that they should get rid of her. The thing is that it doesn't seem that he had a good idea. He seems to make no more of it and it seems more like he was going for a big time off when he's in the hospital.  I am curious about the premise of The Devil, but I can only conclude that it's probably not supposed to have much to do with the premise itself. I have watched a lot of movies with The Devil and it is hard to believe that one can make such a story without knowing the "truths" behind it. So for example, there would be a lot more things like that would happen to you in real life, such as what your parents would say or do to you if you were in hospital. If a movie has a big idea but doesn't develop that much, you might be surprised to find it's really not true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of "Housecarl" for its comedy, so I thought I'd give this a go. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how it would work. It was way too confusing and the jokes were too predictable.   Unfortunately, "Housecat" is no comedy. The premise is simple, but the jokes are completely unbelievable. The jokes are either dumb or over predictable. And worst of all is that it's about as stupid as a joke.  I would have liked a more serious take on the theme of a funny cat movie: a little humor, a little drama, and a little romance... but this is a bad genre film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just about the worst thing i've seen for a movie. I've seen some movies that are pretty good. I couldn't figure out who this movie is based on and it doesn't matter. The movie does not make any sense to watch. The plot is bad, the directing is bad and the acting is bad. And the ending is bad!!!!!    The acting is very bad, and the movie is about 4 times worse than the movie that I just mentioned. If you really want to watch a movie, you might want to check out the movie "The Love" on the Showtime channel. This movie could do much better than the original. This is not even worth watching for the fact that it is a good movie. It just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film, even though it's clearly supposed to be a comedy, is a bad film about the effects of extreme torture. It doesn't do anything interesting either. It's just a bit about a torture operation. The actors aren't good either. There's a few amusing moments, but nothing interesting, and nothing that is really worth watching. This film would have been much better if it was a documentary about torture. Even if you find yourself enjoying it for horror, it's just not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is stupid. I couldn't get past the first five minutes. When I finally decided to watch this movie, I didn't even know what I was going to say. There are about a dozen clues about what happens, but no actual information. The ending seems like a piece of a piece. The only reason I went to see this film was the very disturbing and disturbing ending. I wish the writer had that kind of ending at his movie. It's bad enough to let it linger and not get past it. The first act in the film was good, but there was absolutely nothing that made me feel for anything in the movie and I can't blame the director for not being a "real film". The film was not very good. I was left to wonder if it is actually a "movie". There's a bit of a scene where a woman dies. It was just as disturbing as it should be. If you decide to see it, you might be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie stars Mark Farrell as a "jock-jock" ex-cop, who wants to investigate the murder of "The Last Son of Adam" (Tom Logan). Mark Farrell is forced to shoot Adam's wife while also killing himself. In "The Final Truth" version, Mark Farrell was the first one to do the deed. The other version was filmed in the UK and has a slightly different ending. In the British version, a plot has to be put in place to bring the guilty murderer back to trial. In our version, neither Mark Farrell nor the victim was even killed in the first place.  The title of the movie is a really silly name. The title is not about the murder nor the conclusion of it. It is about Mark Farrell and his ex-partner (or wife). In both versions, there are two separate scenes that start in scenes at the beginning of the film (and in the final scene) and end in scenes after the murder. These scenes are completely un-related to the murder itself. They are not in any position to do this, but they make no connection to either murder.  I do not want to discuss the plot.  If you have seen "The Sudden Kiss", this movie is not a good one. This is only a movie of Mark Farrell in which he looks like a Jack Ryan. He was so bad in this film that he couldn't even talk about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What the hell is going? It is not even funny. And if you liked the first episode, you'll like this one, too. The second episode is horrible. How will they get the actors back? What a ridiculous premise! When they cast Tom Westfall, Robert Downyer, and Michael Cerni, they can't tell that they're actors. I didn't even see Michael Caugie's scene, and I was bored, as I sat for half an hour waiting for a cast announcement. But at the beginning I thought everything was interesting. But the second episode was just awful. Some scenes were fun to watch, but then you can't even find the characters. It's obvious that these actors did not get the job. What a story is. The characters are terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts with very, very ridiculous character, especially the first one. The dialog is bad and it goes on like a "horror" movie only when the plot was done. This is the only movie in the world I'd consider that I have ever seen that isn't about being a complete piece of trash. It also contains very disturbing scenes which are totally unnecessary for the story of the movie and that is really sad to see. It makes me wonder if the writers even had the slightest idea of writing this movie. I'd like to think that the people who made this movie were simply a fool or they had the wrong notion about making a horror movie. They had to do a movie without having to waste the precious time on making a movie: "The first few minutes of The Witch" were just a few minutes too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about a drunken carjote college freshman and a bunch of college students is just plain stupid. There is no real plot, which leaves the film looking like a comedy which could have been developed. But the movie is so awful, that you really wonder if the film's director, or writer, wanted to create something more intelligent. The supporting cast is decent, but as the movie progresses it becomes almost unbearable.  If you like to see the kind of action that is supposed to be realistic, then this is the bad news for you.  But if you want to see some real action in which people act with each other, this movie is no big deal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a surprise when I found the title of the movie: "The Secret History of 4 Secret Games"! And by'solving the secret of 4 Games', I was so relieved. Well, I didn't really expect a really good, but I was expecting a good one. After seeing the title I couldn't quite find the same thing as a movie of real history, or even a documentary, about 4 game games, with a special message to the viewers, but the result is actually the opposite. And it doesn't work at all. The film can't tell us anything about the 4 Secret games and doesn't make the story of how it was used to be to help the story (though I suppose that the'secret history' was used for something similar to the 'factories'). The film tells you how 'the secrets of 4 games' were used, but it doesn?t explain what it was being used for. The real story of 4 game development, if there is one and it exists, is very simple. But you don't get much about it. In one of the more interesting sections of this film, they explain about a different aspect of the '4 games'. But this is just a bad plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't good but does have some charms to entertain. It's bad but badly written. What is this film?! I give this film a 1 out of 10. I mean that in terms of acting, I don't like it. Not a lot of good acting. The actors seem to be a bit over-hated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about a girl who is going through a sex fantasy, and she does what she wants, and ends up with a bad ending. The whole thing is the girl going through sex, but the main thing is that she falls in love with a boy that is so horrible that he never wants to see her.  The scene that is the main focus of the movie is the one where the girl is getting fed. How is this possible? For starters, it is hard to keep that person alive. Secondly, there are more than a few people that are willing to film this movie, and some of them even have very good actors. In spite of that, I think it is just bad to waste any time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In order to get into this convoluted convoluted world, I watched this when I was in college. I am a major fan of the show, and usually like the show very much, but this is unfortunately not even that. I've had the whole thing confused. What really happens? Who we are? Why are we? Why do we fight to survive? How did we get into the world of a secret society? Why can we be attacked by other people and we don't see people we don are fighting? How does it even happen in the real world? Where did we find the car? How do we stop? Why is the car in a car? When are we not actually in the world we are in? When do we make a lot of noise in a desert? How are we going to escape? Why does we have to wait outside the forest? How can the car we find a car that has a tail? I don't remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented the DVD of this film on DVD and on the same day I found the sequel to "Rapture" on a video store in the U.S. I bought it and then I saw "Ripture" for the first time when I was younger. I didn't see any similarities between the two films. The plot is very simple and obviously not terribly interesting. But it is also extremely predictable. I don't understand that this is some sort of a horror film with a few twists. There are some amusing moments, but it does nothing for the viewer. In the meantime, I have to agree with the reviewers who have said that the film is very disappointing.  I think the movie is too slow to finish and the way the story is supposed to end is very poor. The movie is not interesting. Even a simple scene or two just doesn't make any sense. In general, the production is too dull to stay interesting, it doesn't have a storyline and doesn't move to any interesting parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see my opinion of this crap, read my "reviews" for this movie: 1: You want to make a movie about the history of the zombie virus in the zombie outbreak of Mexico, you'll do it better if you've seen one of the other zombie movies.  2: This is the worst film I've ever seen, except maybe the first time I saw this, in "The Walking Dead".  3: Even if you liked "The Undead" or the "Zombie Bodies", you'll like this one much worse.  4:  I'll warn you this movie is crap, but I won't watch it ever again.  5: The most interesting aspect of this movie was the Zombie-pig. This was, unfortunately, the only one that worked for me. The only way this movie worked for a good portion of the time.   6: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love to see an interesting movie in a bad country, but this one really had no idea. I have read a few books in this genre, and this is only about a quarter. I cannot believe it is the best movie I have ever seen in a movie. The idea of a "good" man with a "wicked" personality that can get anything wrong and yet, there is no motivation for him to do anything. This movie was no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending of this movie was extremely disappointing, not only because of the lack of any payoff. It was nothing more than a plotless villain. The acting is so bad, you just wonder why they decided to put so many characters into the movie. The premise is stupid. It's not like I've seen much comedy over the last couple of years. They are only slightly fun. I can forgive that as long as they stick to the plot. But the ending is so unsatisfying.  If you're not a horror movie fanatic, this movie will not be your best choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing worth the time it took to create. The story isn't interesting, the story isn of no interest. The acting is horrible. And the story wasn't even interesting. I couldn't stand watching the movie again. I felt sorry for people who actually bought it because they were able to get it after the reviews, and I'd give the same verdict. The movie looks like a cheap movie that has a couple of stars. In the end, the movie is just a piece of plastic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing good in this movie, the acting is terrible, the action sequences are the worst. It's extremely annoying that the characters don't talk with each other. I've already read this movie and the first thing you'll notice is that the scenes are really slow and really only one scene takes a few minutes of real time. This movie is just one of the many slow films of this type (like 'Locked Up', 'The Last Bite', 'Staircase' or 'The Devil Wears a Mask', etc.) So it's pretty bad that it looks like you've seen these movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film on YouTube and I was expecting a good performance from Richard Sarga. However, I could only see him as a "climax" for the film. I couldn't think of anyone else but Richard SAGA and he can't be any worse than that.  I couldn hardly tell what he had done in this film. The only thing I saw in this movie was the music he was playing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't think that it was the best of the last decade or even the last 15 years. A lot of this movie was filmed in the 1990s when it was called "Kitty" and there was so many people at the studio. I never thought they would make a movie like this, because it was so stupid, and bad! I saw this film at a movie theater in the summer of 1990, and it was awful! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of old, ugly stereotypes. It is just a collection of horrible jokes and bad acting. We can only assume that this movie is made to promote some sort of stupid movie entitled, a movie of a sequel to one of the other dumb movies this year, this one was no exception.  This is one of those movies with bad script, bad directing and bad dialog, but the real stars are really the actors that make it. Unfortunately, I couldn't really enjoy this movie because it just wasn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most terrible, non-animistic, and ridiculous piece of film ever made. Please watch it at least once, and then delete it forever! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the original and first season, I tried watching the show, hoping I would like this one more, although it failed miserly. The show had some good qualities and was interesting but, in the middle it became too predictable and only a few were good. As it is today, I'm more disappointed with this new "spinoff" show, and it's clear that it has nothing to recommend except the fact that it is made by somebody who doesn't know his subject (TV, in case you didn't read the book). Some of the better parts are in the first season but the rest of it is either awful or the worst. I know that this show will probably be cancelled within the next few years because of its failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After this movie I was just glad I was able to get my hands on the V8 DVD. I was disappointed when I had been in the theater to see this crap. I guess the theater had taken a day or so to film the movie so it couldn't release the "movie" until after the movie had been filmed.  The story was completely pointless. The characters acted like they had just come from a movie, rather than being part of a murder scene. The movie seemed like a real horror film with only one person being killed. There was only one scene in which the murderer's girlfriend and father would actually be in the film.  This movie was really bad. I didn't understand anything I was watching. I don't have any sympathy for the person who made it. But I do have to say that this was not the worst movie I've seen, at least not one with a killer who murdered a lot of people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bruins" has a really horrible plot. It is so bad that I can't just write a negative positive review about it.  This movie is, like "Hulk" or "Pig", another in that category, which is the best example. However, "Brugins" is too badly made to warrant an award. So I won't list it as a failure.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the title of this movie, and I thought that it was a comedy. It isn't. It's a stupid, stupid movie. I will confess that I found the story extremely disappointing and uninteresting. In my opinion, it is the worst performance I have ever seen, it's the worst film I've ever seen. It is absolutely pathetic. I was expecting a great, fun, fun movie, but this movie doesn't. The story is so lame that it is actually laughable. The acting is terrible. The fact that the people who are in it are so stupid that they can portray it with such crap that you can't believe. The only reason this movie exists is to make it a comedy, and you can find it on "Free the Country" and "Late Night Noodle's" at every movie theater. The director doesn't know what's going on. He should put this movie out again so that we can put it into our minds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was only mildly funny and it wasn't bad, but it had nothing to recommend. The characters were flat and uninteresting, even the main character, the villain. The plot was awful, but there is at least some humor to be found. The movie is not worth seeing, so don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I'd rent this is because I was one of the two friends who wrote the book. I'm the one who can't tell us how we both were writing, but we both have done this for years, so maybe we can make the same mistake as other people have. I just want to be one of those people who doesn't have any idea what they're doing and why they're wasting their time. If you were one of them, you'd have a real clue how to proceed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an insult to the series "Gather Up" because it lacks a plot. It's just another movie about some kids being attacked by something and going to someplace to find out the truth. As a former TV host, I find it extremely disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first few minutes, "The Secret History" is a slap in the face of the 1990s sitcom "Saved by the Packard" in its own way. But then it turns into a parody of the original 1960s sitcom, complete with the aforementioned "crawling" of the main characters. A couple of scenes are amusing but the whole thing is nothing but bad. The "real" cast (the main actors, the supporting stars and a handful of supporting actors) look awfully fake, especially when acting is performed by a different actor. I would give it a 10 if it wasn't for the acting alone, but in the case the cast is pretty good and the story is interesting. But it's just really bad, it's terrible and really silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains a truly bad plot. If I had any hopes for a new twist, I would have taken a few minutes to watch the first few episodes, but when they came out, my faith was lost. The storyline is so weak and so stupid, I had to turn my back to the movie with a frown. The actors were good, but they just looked stupid; the dialog was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is a very, VERY weak movie. It's not very original, and most of the movie is predictable, but it's not that bad. I'm not sure that it's any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is too predictable to be convincing - the good things that are happening and the bad ones are, too. There were very good moments when the characters were really human and in charge, and there are not so bad. However, what made the rest of the film horrible was the dialog, especially when the main protagonist (Giovanno) was explaining the story to others.  In the case of the movie, the dialog was really bad - not all the dialogs in which you would expect a story. The characters are not portrayed in the most human, humanized, or good way.  There was some fun moments where the characters in the movie were humanized. This is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only film that I've ever seen where I actually thought to see another actor in his face to see how he really looked in it. I think it would have been fine if this movie had a clear ending. The acting is bad enough to keep the audience from getting bored. The fact that this movie was set on a fictional island (the real Island of Ireland) should keep everyone up for the movie. A couple of people from the movie got to meet me on the island, but it wasn't very interesting, so I have no idea how they came to set the scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went into this movie expecting to like it. It's like some movie was made for kids, that's why I went to see it. Well, no surprises there. But I left that impression to remain. I just can't see any reason to believe it's any good. I mean, for example, it was an interesting episode. And it did a bit of good comedy. But in my opinion it just wasn't good enough to carry it to the final score. And I believe it was bad from the beginning to end. It doesn't even make the credits. For example, the actors were so wooden that it doesn't make you laugh. The scenes are so badly made. This movie was no good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film, with my wife. (I rented a copy)and I really didn't like it. I felt like it was an anti-sad on film. If I could see the script, I would have laughed at its stupidity. I wanted to give this film a 10 out of 10 for a "lucky move". But to me, it is just a cheap copy of a stupid "movie". In my opinion, it looks like a film in every way except the first 15 minutes of the film. The director is clueless, he has no talent at all, and his story is completely meaningless. I was very disappointed that this movie was allowed to be released in the US. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just awful garbage from the standard set, with an annoying plot and a very weak ending. In my opinion it was a waste of time with a mediocre plot. The director gave his own unique twist on the fact that a young girl with dark hair in a strange hoodie is kidnapped and raped by some guys while she is raped by the big gang. If she is in the hoodie, the cops try to catch the guys, but they end up helping the gang instead of being attacked, making her mad so she kills them.  I would like to watch a movie that focuses on a very real and gruesome assault and rape on a young woman being raped. This movie had a lot of blood on the clothes, but it looks like she had the victim dressed in only a few minutes. It was hard to watch the movie and even harder to find a movie with blood on it. There are a few very weird moments with the guy and the girl getting their asses raped, but what's the point when he grabs the victim's underwear in a big ziplock? If you have any idea how to remove the black hoodie from the victim, don't waste your time watching this movie. It's so bad I have to be honest, I cannot forgive this movie because I have seen more movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing like "the Spider" in a way. There's nothing about the movie that makes it remotely enjoyable. The fact that this movie was made and released is no guarantee that it is a good movie, or that it's an enjoyable movie. If I had to guess that the Spider is the same kind of thing that we've seen in a couple of sci-fi movies with movies that have to make you jump off and think, "How could they make a movie about this?" It really seems to be that little bit of a rip-off, unless you're lucky enough that you're willing to suspend disbelief. I just think that the movie is bad. Maybe it's some kind of Sci-Fi porn, that it was a way for some people to learn about. Whatever the real answer is, you have a little more fun with it. But there's nothing like that in this movie. Even if you find out it's a bad thing, you should try to find something more entertaining and more educational about it. It's a big waste of time to see something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains absolutely no story whatsoever, except for a very annoying and stupid plot. What could have made it work as an entertaining film is, I don't know. In this movie, every single word is a word that someone could tell a joke. That's the only problem is that the jokes are so terrible, and you can watch the entire movie without the story. The only way you can save this movie is to never watch it and to spend your money on something that will make it worse. I will see this movie at a video store, and I won't be buying it, because it will surely make you sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the most boring movie I have seen in recent memory, EVER.  Please let me pre-emptively be serious. If you are not able to sit through this flick then you will not enjoy anything.  The acting is awful, the storyline is boring, and the cinematography is awful.  I have never seen anything so bad I've had to watch it over two times in the past two months. I would not recommend this movie to anyone that is not a serious film lover. It is just a cheap, pointless, pretentious film made on an over-priced budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't remember how i missed this movie from the first time i watched it, but i can recall it from the beginning of the video store, I was one of those children that was on the parkour to make the trip home to my parents. I was always a fan of "The Roadster", but it had gotten really tiresome with a bad acting. The opening scene was a little bit confusing, but I think it had to be in the first minutes, but what really made the movie so disappointing is the fact that the actors are playing characters they shouldn't have played. The fact that they all have different colors makes the entire movie boring, and I thought the whole movie was a waste of time. I know this because I was a fan the entire time, so i have no idea why I didn't buy this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you haven't heard of this movie, it's a bad little movie starring some of the worst actors in the history of cinema. The cast is terrible. The first half of the movie seemed to be about how we needed to bring a new girl to New York so she would be a little bit more successful in life. There is no point in having the girl with the new girl (Kate Annabel Evans, who has already won an Oscar in 1996, and made one of the funniest Hollywood couches with Ben C. Reilly) have to put in her own movie about her, a movie that would be about a real woman having a crush on Ben Reilly. That is obviously untrue. There isn't any point in this movie. What is wrong with this movie? If you are a movie fan, you know that you need to know that movies are no where to be made. This is the reason that some of people on my list like this movie is left alone with their minds completely shut down from watching something like this. The only thing that is worth saving is the movie: If you don't know how to get into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is no surprise that a movie like "The Adventures of Jonah", will never reach its purpose. The film tries to glorify the story and makes no effort to tell a compelling story, it simply tells a typical 'ludicrous little bit of life', of course, is OK but it doesn't.  The premise is true, but in the rest of the movie it is too simplistic and the characters, even the characters who are supposed to be a typical person, are so insufferable, so utterly ridiculous, that you wonder why they would ever even have been in a situation like this in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the first few minutes, I had the sense that a story was going to be about the life of Robert Pattinson (Robert Pattinson). The story's central theme is a "Bag of Blood" of a young, married man, and the main character was in the same place as Robert Pattison. Unfortunately, this was not the case. A major plot twist was a sexual encounter with a younger woman who was so incredibly violent and abusive as to leave him virtually naked. Robert Pattisson is portrayed by Robert Patterson in the scene where Robert Patthurst sleeps with the woman, and he sleeps with another man, who is played by Richard Mann as one of the two. In order to portray this scene in the best possible way, the scenes were filmed in an abandoned cave, and it was difficult to make the actors into the scene. In short, you just don't care about the characters. As a result, the movie doesn't provide much that was really original. It does try to be clever in some way - but there are many things that are missing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie I've seen that I had no idea what to look for. Well, I didn't know what it was like, and I didn: if I was in a movie theater I would think it was made by some madman in a costume with a camera. But I wasn't that kind of madman; instead I went into a movie with the intention of watching a movie for someone who was interested in it.  The characters in this movie aren't particularly interesting, but if you're bored watching some movies with actors you would probably enjoy having one with a cast and a screen. In my opinion, this is a movie that is at least one of the worst of the recent release releases. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a woman who loves sex. Although I was really excited to see her for the first time, I was extremely disappointed when I sat down and waited on the entire movie until I found out that there was nothing new, nor new. I found it to be quite boring.  The whole thing was a little ridiculous. I had to look and wonder how I could possibly know that this movie would have to be so predictable. I've never seen this movie in more than a half hour. Not even a good movie.  My rating was 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how to defend this movie, as it is made from a bad script that has nothing to do with any real plot except some bad acting and bad acting. A couple of lines and a couple of funny jokes are in there, but unfortunately, the film is totally without any plot or any interesting story or message whatsoever. A story about a female teacher and a teacher is absolutely nothing, and there are only two or three characters. Why did the male teacher ask the students to help him in being a teacher and then give them some money? The guy's got two female classmates in his cell. So why is he giving them money to help out? I can't see where this movie is going to work. If there is a plot, I guess the male classmate would try to get his girlfriend to help the teacher but, why did he ask her to help? The only plot thing I can say is that this movie had a good cast and if it didn't have a good storyline, it probably didn't want to get much attention. In the end, the director obviously had a lot of money. I guess if he was taking out a sex story and doing a sex scene, he probably wanted to make some money in the end. In what ever country he is, it would be stupid for him to spend that money on a sex script. I really wish he got some more money to produce a good movie like this. If that would be the case, then the whole movie would be interesting and better. And if the director thought he needed that money, then he should've got that money and spend it at a movie theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented the movie after I watched the DVD and I was left quite bored. The plot does not take place in the novel, so why was it there? Did the writer really do a job like that? The only good thing I saw in the movie was the casting of some pretty good actors. However, I don't believe this movie was written to be a movie like "The Expendables" or anything like that, so you don't need to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's all too predictable. I didn't care about the actors in it, but I didn%C think that they made the most interesting and entertaining parts. The only thing I remember that was interesting was the opening scene where they were in the big hotel. It was like it was a piece of junk and they were going out into the dark alley and killing people.  Well, that was the part that was disappointing. I really liked the scenes that were set in a strange place.  Also the only thing that was amusing was the monster in the first scene. The monster was a little bit funny. It should have been scary in its own right, but the man went on all day and killed people. It wasn't scary enough for him to be in a casino with all that cool technology and gadgets. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so terrible, i don't think i have ever seen it like this, the only thing i got from it is a sick and ugly plot, so bad i don t even have a chance of liking this, a lot of scenes are bad, and the plot is totally pointless and is only a bit better than a bad slap in the face with a few minutes of funny at the end of the movie.  The best thing i have from this movie is the "B" - which i have never heard before, but this movie reminds me of when i was a kid and i thought it was really funny, but when you try to imitate the cartoon, you can do it only a few times, and then it starts to get worse, but anyway, you're not going to miss this if you're a casual anime fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't get out of the theater in my local store, and neither did the local film store. The theater was so crowded that you could have stood on a chair and was going for 50 minutes on a cushion, with a small amount of space in the theater that could have been a stand.  The ending was the most horrible thing I've seen in a movie. The "screens" and "wires" that were used to describe the film were only used for the closing credits, and were not used in the movie itself. There is not even a logo in the film.  I'm afraid that the movie will be remembered as the worst film ever made in the history of cinema, but that doesn't seem likely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was a big letdown in terms of quality and overall development. The scenes felt rushed (like they were scripted by a bunch of people) and some of the dialogue seemed awfully rehearsed. It wasn't even a plot. The main supporting characters felt wooden. Some of the supporting players also felt like they were doing most of the stuff themselves, like talking. There were a few minor missteps in the acting, but not a complete disaster, in which we never felt like anybody had any idea what was happening.  There's also some questionable performance by the actress who plays the "witch" and "witch's hat" in the film. I'm not quite sure why she was chosen for the lead. It just seemed like her performance was too forced and forced.  Overall, I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie: i was in the middle of my high school, my parents were in another country, and i just decided to spend the summer with a group of friends when we were at the airport. i watched a few movies and it seemed to me that these films would never make me cry. i couldn't get even that far.  However, the ending of this movie does make me Cry. I mean, it isn't the ending the other movie was supposed to have, but this one does make you Cry.  This movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in the history of movies, because it has a story that is absolutely no good. It does not have a storyline that makes the viewer laugh. And the actors who were supposed to act in this movie didn't even get the plot in. This movie does have a plot though. But the plot is too bad to bother to watch over. In fact, the plot was pretty good. The way this movie played, and the fact that it was so bad to watch at all. The ending of the movie is bad enough to make a few people weep. I won't let that go. But I hope I will NEVER watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a pretty huge fan of the first movie and even after the film's initial failure I still think it's a pretty good film, but it just doesn't have much of the charm that the original movie had. For the sequel it's not the same. So, I decided to read the book from the book cover and my opinion was that, although I really liked the book I was left utterly confused and just not that bothered me. I was also disappointed by the sequel, not even because I like the characters in the book. It just seemed like they were trying to copy the book's story and instead the original was a completely original story. I did not really enjoy any of the film and was just a little upset that the writer tried so hard to recreate the original story and try and re-think it by throwing it out at the end. I'm glad to see that this film was not as bad as the original one. I only did this because I liked it better when the book was released in the mid-1980's and didn't miss anything from it. I am afraid that it will get forgotten and not as famous as the book it was originally. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing about the film that screams, "Oh my God, it's so good!" It's a bad waste of an effort and a lousy film, in the most obvious way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I couldn't believe I'd put this movie into the hands of any "caterace" group I have ever been a member of. And I think that, as I'm sure is the case of many, I should really regret my involvement in it. If you've read any negative comments about this movie: 1)  Well, what is life if you were born, and what is it if you die? If you're dead, your body is where you're sitting; your eyes are open; you are smiling; your body was sitting; you have a smile; you're holding a conversation. This is bad; it's bad for the actors, the writers, the whole cast; it ruins it for the movie's own viewers; it just isn't worth doing.    This movie seems to be the only movie in which "theater" is involved. They have so much money and so many people that have nothing better than to sit around and watch some horrible, horrible, terrible, bad acting. It is no surprise that most of the actors and actresses in this movie, despite it being supposedly a "Caterace," have nothing to do with their work in it, which is their life, in fact, to their very own detriment. You can expect more of them to be involved in this one than any other movie. I mean, if the "Catersace" could come up to film this movie after everything they did in the previous two movies. That was just one reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What was this? I thought it was some kind of movie about a small town or a town in the middle west. But instead, the town is occupied by some gangster(s) who wants to protect a small group of people. You know what kind of town would have that kind of behavior and a guy would be named Jack from one of the gangs and not know who he was. But this is not the kind of bad movie I thought the movie was, though I could think it might have been. There are some scenes that are quite good and in a couple of spots, but they aren't in a movie where there would have been a storyline that was quite as compelling. In one scene, there are some people that have some mysterious connection to some other gang, but you never really figure out anything about them. In another scene, a man has a hatchet and you just can't tell how it worked.   So if you have a small audience, you might be able to get it that it is better, but it isn't that. You might like it because there are a lot of very cool sets, but the sets weren't very good. I am not going to repeat any plot, because this movie is so bad, that I don't know what to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So the plot of this movie revolves around this bizarre and pointless story and the horrible camera-set images of the actual life in the village of the village's leader and their daughter. It is a sickening waste of some extremely mediocre actors and sets that do not include any plausible plot, which is extremely low in the case of the movie itself. Some very good actors and some good supporting performances (I don't recall which actors were cast) were wasted in this movie, though I suppose that this would have been easier to carry if they had the whole film in one piece.    As to be expected, this movie was well cast, some actors were really good and some excellent sets, but the film does not offer a compelling story to which you can relate with your friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my second disappointing movie. I've seen a bunch of comedies, and this is not even a big one. It's a pretty bad collection of a bunch that does this over and over again with characters that are very flat. The most ridiculous thing is the ending. It was ridiculous, but the story seemed like a complete rip off. A lot of the scenes were like a comic book with a bunch more characters. It just seemed like they were watching a film in another dimension of the universe. I was just watching some terrible scenes, but not that much more than a movie.  I would give this a 1 1/2 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the only film that I've seen in a very long time, and it is the last film I have seen of the era. It is extremely disappointing, and extremely weak. I was just wondering how in the hell did they find a way to film a "sex" film when most of them had done nothing more than make "sex"... If you ask me, the reason it was a "sexual" film was because it made it seem like it was about "sex". I'm not kidding. That was the only reason I had seen it. What a bunch of people do in films is so "serious" and stupid, I have no idea why anyone thought that a movie about sex would have a sex scene. I think they had to find some girl in the movie to film the sex scene that they wanted to film. And they didn't. This film is about as useless as a garbage film...as they can get. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a horrible waste of a film. It seemed to have been made in a few months, in a rush of seconds and nothing that made any sense. Even the actors were awful.  I thought they'd put out the show.  The acting was OK, but if they weren't really actors, it just lacked realism and the whole thing was just made like a comic book that has a cast for a joke.  If you're looking for something more serious, you can rent movies from "The History of the British Royal Navy", which has been going for ages and has been an interesting look at the British Navy and its battles. It's just a shame that this film doesn't even come on at a good movie set.   There's another movie about a girl, so I'll be expecting a similar quality, but nothing. Even if you can buy the movie from the video store, you won't find anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just bought the DVD when I got this DVD (when it was released in Europe), and I thought it was excellent, but it wasn't good. It's just too slow, and there are no real story. Some parts are good, but the dialogue isn't that great, and even the plot is too predictable. Some funny scenes are good (I didn't even notice the scenes from the first season, but I'd have to find it to my eyes after a few years), but there are too many dumb and annoying things that just go off in the film (like the scene in the hotel room with the people shouting and screaming), which is really not the reason to watch this movie.  If you wanted a "real story", you would watch something like This Year's Dog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If your eyes were not blind when the movie was released, the fact that you have absolutely no idea what you are going to watch is hilarious. The movie is a complete mess. It is like sitting in the living room of a movie theatre...with people in front of you, and all you have to do is watch your friends struggle to put the actors in their mouths, or watch the actors struggle to deliver their characters.  If you want to see a movie, just get the DVD copy, then throw it away. If you do that, you will not get the full story of the story. You will not even be able to tell what you've seen. I recommend you not rent this movie, and if you do, do so only for the sake of your conscience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a poor movie, so bad it is, but there are other things worth taking notice. If you've seen the original, you know that it's the funniest, most ridiculous, most unbelievable film ever. But if you've never seen the sequel, you have no excuse for not watching it. It has nothing. It's not funny and it doesn't make any sense. If anyone else has watched it, please let them know, because it is an insult to all who's seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had the opportunity to film this film, I would have liked it, but it was pretty bad. In fact, I felt the "Hail" line was quite good. But this film was terrible. I can't believe the producers had such a stupid idea to waste money on this movie. It wasn't the least important, as the main plot was about a young girl who has fallen for a girl who is on the run, but rather than that, the main storyline was about getting the girl to fall for another girl, and then that girl would turn her relationship into a marriage pact. It's a bad idea, but at least an entertaining one. The film was probably the most boring I've ever seen. At least I would not think that it was even intended to be a comedy. When I first saw this film I was glad to see "Hails", as it's something that a movie was meant to be. But I was disappointed when it became an actual comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a true believer of the genre that's in this movie, you might take this movie so as to be an actual film, but the idea of a movie with this story is utterly stupid. The story is nothing special, it has nothing to do with any story of any other genre (which are really all in the genre). The story itself contains no plot, it's just an excuse for the writer to tell a stupid story. It doesn't even come up to the point that it deserves it. If you want to see an actual movie, it should be this movie. Don't even watch it at the local video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching the "Deeper Darker" movie (which I didn't even consider to be even as a film) I became aware of the fact that this movie was just a bunch of scenes that weren't interesting, that weren`t original, and that the film could have been made better. This movie didn't deliver. It was bad. Badly, badly written. I couldn`t even concentrate on it, I can`t believe the way the actors acted. There weren`T any interesting parts, not the way it felt like that they were supposed to be. The plot was bad, the direction was bad but I still think that this was a dumb movie. I`ll never know why this movie even became a Hollywood movie. It`s only a bad film, nothing more. Bad. It would be great if this movie would actually turn out to be something that it`s not. I wish I could have avoided wasting my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was like a bad joke. There was not enough acting for the whole movie to keep you entertained. It was no wonder because it is simply a pretentious version of the "The Matrix", made to look like that. We all knew that would not be what it was, because it would be like a Matrix movie, but it was a boring, mindless piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The script seemed like it was a "I Wish" script (though there were some really good jokes and the acting was good, as usual) but the story was totally disconnected. The ending just really left you with shock that you didn't even think was happening in the movie.  The plot was very vague, and the story itself seemed to be entirely pointless.  I mean there was a huge opportunity to tell a positive story about the old woman in the old man's mind, but you really had no idea what would happen to her after it was over. In the end, you just got a shock when they finally decided to kill her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie entitled "The Last Castle" starring Robert Fizzer, with a very weak script (though excellent) is actually about a castle in Italy (where the castle is being used for the war between the Italian nobility and the Turks.) The story is based on a really bad book (which can only be a spoiler) about how the castle was used as a military barracks in the late 1920's. A few scenes are interesting but the rest of the movie seems to be just an exercise in making fake costumes. I have never seen a movie with so much unnecessary stuff in it.   I give this movie: 1/2 of the lowest ratings for a movie I have ever seen. The first (unrated) movie I ever saw (Facing Facing Fear) had more guts and guts, guts being made out of plastic that is a waste of real guts and the last (Unrated) had guts that made my eyes water. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had the worst plot, acting and special effects. Its is really not good, I gave it a 10 but I really hate the idea of creating a big villain for a great girl, who you can imagine falling in love with and then having to kill her boyfriend...  The plot was the only good thing I didn't like in this movie, other than the original character. The director of this movie should have a sense of humor. I felt like the writer and writer wasted the effort to try to create a character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like all the crap that I have seen in the past few years. I couldn't even get into this thing. It's really only the stupidest piece of crap on the planet. I have just come to find this movie a little more disturbing than the other things. The plot is like a piece of garbage that has nothing but some good lines, some good dialogue and the fact that the production company can get away with this garbage is simply disgusting. The main character is a guy named G.O.J. He's just like "The Running Man" except G. O.J.'s in a bad manner. He has been sexually assaulted and raped by his wife and father before the murder. Why there is no proof in it's supposed to be a murder. There is a little bit of nudity in it but that's the only thing that makes this movie remotely interesting. I've seen more sex scenes from this movie than most of the big films of 2013. This film isn't the best in the world but is probably the worst. In fact I'm wondering if the director is going to try making a movie like this again. I'd watch it if I didn't believe the director was the only person to do this. The best of all waste: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had a ridiculous plot, but the acting was awful and the movie itself had little plot. Some might say that the plot of The Man in the Shadows was simple, and that the movie was better in the beginning, but it was too hard to make to connect. It didn't have anything to connect with the rest of the characters in The Twilight Zone. The plot was not really that interesting. The storyline that made The Man, and the whole movie was a waste of time. The most annoying thing about the movie is that you need a plot, and they had no plot. I don't understand how they got the "secret location" they used on the rooftop, but they used a tree, which could fit in easily with a normal tree and a car. Why did they do this? And, if they wanted to create a movie for teenagers, they might have used a car in their movie, but I don`t know why they chose that. The camera shots were horrible. The shots could be used on other locations. The movie reminded me of some other movies: i remember a movie with a tree that looked like this, and another one where it looked like these. I just can't understand why they did that. I guess it's some sort of coincidence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply horrible, I couldn't even laugh. It's only an embarrassment to the movie "Puglyn", which I have always seen for much more than 30 minutes and this is only two-three minutes away from being the funniest movie in the history of American cinema. The plot is just the same, with the same "stalker" and now two "stalkers" (one more than any other protagonist, and none of the "puglyn").  This is simply the worst movie I have ever seen. If you want to see something with a plot, like "The Ring", then you can watch that. However, this movie is, and I will say, one of the worst "movie" ever made. It is simply pathetic. If it were that bad, I would be insulted to my God for even calling it a movie. What was the reason, I hear it was made?! If it wasn't bad, it might be a decent picture, but the script is so bad, that I just can't believe it exists.  This seems to be the only movie to be shot by a producer that is actually made. If that is the case, I suppose it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing the "movie", I had to laugh. What the heck, is it? Well, it's like all those other movies I've seen that are either boring or extremely pretentious (and in that same vein, "Killer.") If you have a mind, you'll get bored with the movie. It's like watching a very poorly played movie: no storyline, no dialogue, no character development, nothing.  The only thing that makes this movie even remotely interesting is the fact that it makes no sense. I thought I might have done better with that movie than the other movies: it isn't really an action movie, but it's supposed to be a comedy. It doesn't work for me. I can't say that because the acting was good, but I don't care. The plot is terrible. Some parts were quite good, some were even funny (like a "KILL" joke), but none of them worked, and I really can't put it down as being a "movie."  Overall, "Locker" is a horrible movie, because it doesn't have any real direction (all of which can easily be seen on a regular movie). In the end, it just ends up being a pile of a bunch of people screaming. And I was just one of the stupid, ridiculous lines in the movie that really got me. When I saw that one, I decided that was the best line. The end of the movie was boring and unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like a piece of crap film that was filmed in the late '80s with some extremely bad lines and a very predictable plot. I can't fault the directing, it is all but one-of-the-worst movies I have ever seen. The story is extremely lame, the plot is pretty predictable and the acting is extremely bad. There are some great scenes - the movie was probably better than the original - but it can't really help this film. Overall, this film is the worst I've ever seen, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with more respect than myself. I just couldn't get into this film, it really is an awful film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie has been so low, I think it is the worst I've ever seen, it is bad to the point of no return. I can only hope that this is one reason and not the reason I gave this movie a rating because I was so disappointed in it. I thought this was an extremely weak movie, it was so bad that it made me lose hope for the future of horror movies. Even worse than The Cry World. I really think this is a bad episode, if I could rate it 1, this is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie thinking that it would be good. But, even after knowing what happened to the "Lost" TV Series, I couldn't believe it was just the same as the original.  A brief recap of the plot: the three guys that get the two new girls, get the best of the girls, and finally get a job in a laboratory that is actually the equivalent to a murder, and even with their new girl, they don't really know anything. If I had been a little bit more involved in the story, I wouldn't have cared too much about it. But if I'd have even just walked along the street watching it, it would have been horrible.  But the story didn't have a plot that would have seemed to make sense. I guess that was the only reason I stopped watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You'd be surprised to find this on any video site. As a writer and a writer, the fact that it isn't a "feature" or an "exclusive" production is laughable. A film with no actors in a large enough time frame doesn't make any sense. A few actors have been in this film, none have had any scenes with any recognizable actors. It looks like we were forced to cut a few scenes out for "special effects", which would have been an inconvenience to everyone, and if that is true then I would be surprised. The acting is so bad that there are hardly any dialog scenes - this is more than half an hour of film with almost no characters. Some other movie people have been working hard to get a fair picture of this "gene" movie and have turned this to a joke at the end of the film. This movie is so poor that it really isn't even worth mentioning. I can't say how badly it is because it isn`t a "quality movie". But it isn´t "gemit". It is a bad attempt to show what a "documentary" could really be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i would like to point out the silliness of a film that tries to make it out to be edifying, even if you can see the plot. The movie tries to create "cults", and tries to be scary...but it just can't manage to succeed, and its characters are just a bunch of mad people.  I don't think this film really gets anywhere.  The film itself is so unbelievable that you almost wonder if there is some kind of a secret plan to film it. It is also so dumb, that if anyone sees it they would have to believe it was some kind crazy movie. I also don't believe that it had to be this low, and such a bad film...all of them... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had some interesting and interesting parts, but I just couldn't understand how the plot played. You know, a movie like this was just so dumb that it actually worked! Oh, I didn't think I'd have guessed that much, but the only thing I was disappointed by was the fact that there was no payoff in any way whatsoever. And just to give you an example, there was a good part in the movie where a guy was getting ready to get a job as a policeman.  The movie was so bad that I couldn't believe that a guy, and a guy who was about to go out of his body, just randomly decided to walk away from the scene and jump down a ditch, and then there would be some dramatic action sequences that brought the actors to life, but just as much as the movie would have been an action-film, the scene would have had nothing but the "end of the film" ending. I have to confess, I don't think you would like it.  I mean, even though the plot was good, the characters seemed lifeless, and the action sequences seemed contrived, I still couldn't buy the idea of "action" or "suspension" to an action film. I guess what happened at the end is that people just decided to quit acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main story line is about a female named Lucy from the New York area who wants to marry a younger boyfriend. The main character is a very dumb man named Adam who wants a younger female to be his next bed, which is just a plot-line to a stupid sitcom. This is just bad-bad. I can't believe this is real. My rating is 1.3 because the acting was terrible and the storyline made no sense at all. I will see it at a later date. The idea behind this film is probably a good idea if you are looking for a laugh, but unfortunately it has no hope in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never even heard of "Rinas", or "Dasala", or any other actors that can get past the basic plot of "Trouble". This film is so boring and poorly acted that it's really insulting to the intelligence of anyone that watches this movie for any reason whatsoever. The first half of the movie is very predictable and it does not help the story, especially the first 2 or 3 parts. The second part of the film is completely pointless as well as the plot. The final part of "TRULIES" is so bad it's beyond the imagination of even the director. The ending is not much better. The movie does have a bit of romance to the final part, which is a good thing to help the storyline, but then it's just too many scenes to deal with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend except for the idea of a plot in which it can not possibly make any more sense than what it actually happens, and that alone. It is one of the worst movies ever made in modern Hollywood, in my opinion. As a matter of fact, this was not a movie for the sake of entertainment but more likely for political reasons. I won't try to explain that. As it's a big budget, low budget, big, multi-platform film, I can't give this movie any more than that. Not only does it have absolutely no plot, but it does so terribly badly. They wasted all the big budget and the money and time to make a big, spectacular action. You don't get that for cheap! It's sad that the director was able to make this movie for a small percentage of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate this movie, it doesn't even come close to the movies of the early 70s. The acting is simply terrible. The storyline and the characters are flat. It feels like a film from the 70's, not even from the 50's. It just doesn't make much sense. The only reason I give this movie a 10 is that it's a remake of "Wagowski", and that's all the same. They just can't figure this movie out. I'll give this one a 9, but it really doesn't do anything in the early 40's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely awful. I found that the acting was terrible, the story was bad, the cinematography terrible, and the story wasn't even a decent part of it. I was very disappointed. The first two times I watched this film had the option of turning it off, so I waited to see if I could get more. I watched a couple of parts, but I still felt there was nothing to this film that made it worthwhile, but now that it's finally available I really couldn't turn it off! I do feel sorry for this movie, I'm sorry the stars of this film, I don't want to see the actors play their parts again, and I just wish I had enough time to see this movie without getting bored! Avoid this garbage at all costs! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of material to draw from when looking to answer this question. To answer this in terms, the answer is "yes". Why do I feel such a vehement desire to keep this movie so bad? I mean, if I knew the people involved in the movie, I'm not kidding you. They are obviously in the wrong profession. They seem to be the most talented and the most well-known and prolific filmmakers in the world. That is what matters most to the question. Well, for starters, I think they all knew that this was a bad story, that the movie is not going to be a success, and that it is going to make me feel so sorry to say that I've seen worse movies that it has to. So, what do I suppose it has? There are four people who act like their roles and then say that they are the person doing the story who is "acting". The rest of the cast don't seem that involved in it. Maybe the "original" family had to be involved. How was the movie actually made? My guess is that the plot was conceived in the same period that this movie was released. So if the movie was actually made in that same period, I suppose that the script writer may have seen it. How much is it really involved in? I'll never be able to say. However, I will say that there are some people who have knowledge of this story and the actors who act in it, I believe. I don't know if the actors involved had some sort of connection to the movie. All I can say is that they had a pretty good idea, as a small town, so why would they get involved? The movie would seem like a pretty bad movie, and it wasn't that. I can't see who knew something about the movie and it's a pretty disturbing thing to say it to me. A really bad movie about a "normal" town and the people you are supposed to root for are like their characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best thing that I can do is laugh at the stupidity of people who waste their time on this movie. This is not even worth a second for me. This movie is so bad that I will probably not even bother to watch it. The actors should stay on it and keep a camera low. The acting is a joke. It is so stupid that it is just painful to see the movie. They put ridiculous lines in their mouth and it is not funny. If this movie was a real film and they did a good job, then this movie should be shown on a tiny TV channel. It does not make any sense and you should NOT see it on TV. It's a waste of time, but no matter what you may say, this movie is bad. Don't waste your time on it. It sucks, but that is the norm, right? I do not recommend viewing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a big letdown.  It is horrible even for the most ardent fans of sci-fi. It is bad. And this is especially bad. The film is so bad that you wonder if you could even recover the memory. This is easily the most horrible film I have ever seen. If you want to see a great Sci-Fi film, you should have this one. Unfortunately, it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie extremely tedious. When it's announced that it's a movie with a very dark story and very slow dialog, I'm wondering why.  What does make this movie a movie that people watch is that it contains the same bland script of the original film. I found that this movie is not even remotely original. It's like having seen a movie about a car crash with a young girl, in one episode, and then watching another episode about a wrecked car crash.  How do they expect people to go into this movie expecting that it has something to tell you? I found it to be utterly stupid. It has one good laugh when it finally starts, but I was bored, even after it finally ends. I'll never buy this movie. The plot was too shallow to make any sense. I just don't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie as a little kid and I hated it! It didn't try to make it any interesting and it was just plain boring. I am not a fan of this type of movie. In the end, it just was like some people just trying to put in a new "group" and I didn't really enjoy it. My other 2 movies were "Eleanor Can You Believe" and "The Good Life." The other one was a pretty good story. The other movie was completely lacking in action. I think there is some kind of value in these kind of movies, but this one is really nothing but a waste of time, unless you have a lot of faith in the director and the actors.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Halo 3" is a terrible movie. It is not funny. It contains nothing of any interest or quality to make it interesting. It's just a bunch of guys who are forced to live underground and take on the role of the hero. I didn't see the actors properly. And they were very predictable. The actors were horrible. The action was weak, and the movie was bad! The movie could only be funny if there was some good talent. Not the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is a convoluted and incoherent movie that's made worse than a simple joke. What's wrong with this? It's not funny. What does this show that is supposed to do with the best story ever? Why do they go on to repeat this crap about every movie? It didn't come out of a bad script... What does it do? I'll admit that. If your film is about a family, you might want a movie that is about families. You want a story that is more than a story about people. And it doesn't have one. I didn't even care to find out what happens when you go to your friends's house for a movie: there are other reasons why it doesn`t matter whether or not this movie is about the people, it is just the story of a bunch of people. I'm guessing that the actors aren't as good as the characters in the movie to portray the story. I don't know why they would decide to make this movie, but I think it is pointless. Maybe it could have been a better way of making a comedy movie. It just doesn't go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not really original. The acting and the performances were pretty bad, but the movie was pretty good. Probably not the best. But at the end the dialog was pretty bad. I couldn't believe a guy like Richard Lee had to act this movie. I just laughed. Probably the worst of "Darkman" ever. It's OK for those who can identify "Dark Man" and "Dark Knight" in the same context to think that these two movies are about the same thing but they seem to be completely different. In "DarkKnight", I had to think a lot and just wait for it to get there, and in "DarkMan", I expected everything and just waited for it! But it got there and it didn't. I don't know how that's possible. The movie was so bad I couldn`t believe it was even made. I'll watch it the next time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is completely pointless, but it tries to do a good job by casting an obscure and bizarre character. However, instead of creating a memorable character, it creates a bad character with an absolutely ridiculous story, which would normally be entertaining if not for the fact that it's stupid. The acting is bad, the acting is the only thing I had found that went right this movie. The script was bad, and the ending was completely predictable, not surprising either way.  The movie is an embarrassment, and if you've ever seen this before it is worth a second look-in. But if you are even mildly interested in this sort of garbage you'll wait forever for it to get better. If you want a truly interesting, funny movie, go for a one-man's adventure instead of buying something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As for most of the films that I watch, they are not so enjoyable. This is a prime example, and it isn't so bad - like many movies, it's not so bad as they claim. However, as most of them are, it is about as good as they say. What's more concerning is the fact that most movies, I watch anyway, are a poor imitation of something. In the past, they can really deliver something unique. This just isn't. In fact, I think there is a kind of "B" level in which this movie is at the level of its pretribed name. I have to admit, if they had the skill to do it properly, they probably would have created a decent film. However it does not. The acting is bad, the movie is simply bad, and the film isn't even remotely decent. Some of the characters in it are just awful. There is absolutely no connection with any one person. It's like a bunch of guys in a bad bar trying to break a lot of people up by being drunk. That's the point. This movie is nothing like a movie. If you are one of the most talented actors in the world, you would never have such a bad film, and you would be right to say it is simply not even a movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that was set for release when the "American Sniper" first came out. In fact, it was set to release in 1996 when it was finally released. After several years of rumors, the movie never made it out. We'll be here for an hour before any new movie comes out. As an example, the director and writer make some jokes about how the Sniper used to work. For example, he and his sniper were supposed to be on a job, and in the end, he didn't have to use their sniper skills. We were supposed think that the sniper was a retired gun instructor. There was no way they were supposed a retired instructor who used his sniper skills in the "real world" only to get a paycheck.  Why does it make people see movies this boring?  This movie is just bad, but at least in the beginning. The ending has some action, but there are also a lot of stupid humor. The beginning of the movie is so bad that it's almost impossible to sit through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is too slow, too predictable. And the camera is so weak. There's no believable performance.  The first two scenes, at the beach, are extremely slow and predictable.  Then the scene when they see the girl on the beach is ridiculously fast and too much behind. It seems like they only did the first two minutes because they had to wait.  I give this movie a 6. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with a very odd plot. The villain has a very weird haircut and is also a little boy. This is not a good thing. There is no reason for this except that it is an odd story and I just didn't like it. The boy has two strange girlfriends, but no explanation. The film is over 50 minutes long, and it is very weak.  Overall, this is bad, and bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In fact, I don't know if this movie is supposed to be called the worst film ever made. This is bad at times because it contains some of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen.  As for the other part of the movie, the first 2 hours are OK. I liked this movie, though. But the end is terrible. It really isn't much better than a low budget "Kochia" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is not good, but at least it had some good scenes. but in the end it was too boring and stupid. the only redeeming feature was the fact that this movie had a couple of cute women (not the only female) who would really have turned it into a romantic story. the bad things about this movie were not subtle, it was just terrible, and one thing was annoying, i thought he really was showing himself to us as a complete loser. the characters were annoying, the plot was predictable and the acting was not convincing. I really wanted to buy it because i don't get too many movies, but this was the worst one. I hope everyone else sees this one, because I don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poor movie, and very slow one at that. Not sure why anyone paid any money to this, but then you must have seen movies like this.... so if I have one, I'll gladly let them put it in front with all the other trash movies out there.  This movie is a total waste of time to watch. The story is very bad and very poorly written. If you want to see a movie that has some real plot, you can watch "Ricco Riots", which was made a few years back.  I have seen many movies like that. This movie can only hold its own if you are not a fan of the cartoon. Also, you are lucky if you actually like "Rilipania", which is hilarious and amusing at times. The movie was very bad, and the actors didn't appear that they had in the cartoon, and they weren't even great. It should have had been put into a different movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to make a political comment on the lack of success in Iraq. It tries to pile up a bunch of stereotypes as opposed to fact based on the characters and the story. This movie fails to deliver on its promise because it is not a satire at all. It just tells you something about the war and its failure. If I knew how much I could learn from this movie, I would just tell me that I was wrong. The main villain of the movie is a big-shot terrorist named Hah-zoo-zooooooo! This is the opposite of the way I expected to go. The movie is just one more example of how stupid the Iraq war was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty dumb, I didn't even see it as a child. It really isn't much longer than a standard sitcom, it's pretty bad, and it doesn't seem like a movie or TV program would want to go out of the bounds.  I watched it in I think just before the TV broadcast. I thought it would make me have nightmares. What happened to me was that I thought the movie was a normal movie. It just seemed like a normal day at a normal business with a guy pretending to be a man. It was really dull, and I really didn't care about the story, the acting, the direction, the sets. It seemed like it was going to happen right before my eyes and nothing happened to this movie. I had nightmares in that little of the time I saw it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing more than a piece of trash. The premise is nothing but a bunch of people sitting in a room who are in the midst of making a movie. They have a big collection of friends who keep them from killing their friends by killing them. They're having a ball.  I guess this would make some sense if it was something that was worth the life of a human being. Then, after about half of the movie we are talking about and screaming and screaming, and we are not talking about a movie or a movie at all. At best it would be more of a horror movie, and not at all a movie about friendship and love.  After you are done with that crap, you can check out a movie: "Bodies Of War". This is only one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a few places that really have something to say about the current situation, and, in many cases, they are right. Unfortunately, there is only one. This is not the only movie this year that had such a dire, pointless and pointless title as "New Girl's Dream."  This film has the following message. You need to be in a "New girl's dream," a "dream" that you are "in a dream" or an "dream," that you need to make a "real" (real) decision. And, because it does so, you must die. This film's title could not be clearer. It's so bad, in the end, that even the words are almost illegal.  The only real problem with "NewGirl's Dream" is that, by definition, it cannot succeed. You cannot succeed if you are not "in love." In the end of the movie, you cannot succeed, even if you were a "girl." This film is a piece of garbage, even for the sake of its title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watch the first episode of "Game of Bones", I didn't like it for its premise of being a movie, it wasn't dramatic enough, its very weak and didn't do much. The characters were wooden and lifeless and their characters looked like they were acting in a'reality show' (as they could easily do). But the most irritating thing about this movie was the fact that it had no ending. A lot of the scenes were scenes that I couldn't remember happening in the movie, I only remember the two scenes that weren't in the original "Game" script.  I've read the book, and it had a very interesting storyline. For example the episode where the big-buddy of the movie (Dennis McShane) was a little too far, like all of the episodes in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, it's really the most bad movie I've ever seen. I watched this at the theater last night, and the movie was at the bottom, although I didn't get much screen time in. It is not just bad, but ridiculous. It's just so bad that it doesn't have a name. If you're expecting the sequel, this is bad, if you're a big fan of Cranky, you would feel like there would be a lot of plot twists and characters. The plot was pretty good, I guess I would rather be watching this in its original version. The ending was just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very disappointing film about a really bad movie. I really think they should be ashamed of what they did to themselves. I mean really ashamed, if you think "Bad Movies" is a bad film then you will find yourself in an even worse film: it's pretty bad.  I'm not going to list the 1 good things about this movie: the acting, the script and the directing. But this is an overall bad film. It's just not good. I just wanted to put in some words I might learn something from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this is just some sort of a movie about a bunch of teens trying to pick up a runaway sex offender and try to get him back on the good side. it is so bad it isn't even funny at all. I thought it would be funny if it was about a guy getting out of a car at a gas station and letting himself out of jail so he wouldn't get caught again. I'm not going to see this movie until it is actually called. I think the producers are just on the run. I am not saying anything but, if you think you might enjoy seeing it, go ahead and rent it, and you will not even laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of pretense and nothing happens. In fact, one of the funniest lines I have ever heard comes from "Dennis the Duck"--if the movie was released today--this would be like making "Halloween: Crawling Up Evil". They just throw one line, and it's a laugh-fest--all about two kids running around, making stuff up, and eating food.  What's even worse? This movie was one of those dumb films where it seemed like they could actually be serious. The whole thing is just a collection of bad ideas. It's just bad in that people don't seem to have any real lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked "Locked On Dead" in some way, but it seemed like it was very childish and unadvised. There was a lot of dumb jokes and a lot that just got old. This movie is not the way to get started, but to keep a course. The plot is lame and it is very predictable and no good humor. The ending was not funny either, but the only thing that made this movie interesting was the fact that a lot more people in the audience had to watch the final scenes with Jack. The movie was only two and three minutes, but after the first few minutes of the movie the film was extremely painful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes to see a sequel to "Battier" coming out this year, but unfortunately this movie was one that was just plain bad. I really think it would be a better movie if you'd just read the book, as most of the jokes are the same. It is impossible for a "Batter" to tell what you read about it, which is sad to see.   It's unfortunate that so many people who are well versed in the book are so oblivious to this crap. This movie is just plain evil, and this movie is the worst film I've ever seen. The actors should be embarrassed to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like SciFi, but this movie proved to be just that - a pointless exercise. It was so bad I nearly broke my eye. It can't get better than that. The only good things I can say about the movie are that it is a fun, pointless exercise; and that it's pretty good. But it has no point whatsoever. The ending is pretty much what the movie is about; it's about to lose its life, and I think it's more fun than the movie it is about. I don't think you will ever be amused by such a pointless movie. If you like Sci-Fi, then you will not be disappointed, even if you like movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't help but comment on the awful film, the ridiculous plot, and the stupid characters. Not even the actors did anything but utter stupid acting, and with this the actors actually act like stupid children. That's about the "first rule" rule of making an idiot and a mad woman. I'm not expecting much from this film, but after seeing it I couldn't care much more. The ending is truly a joke, and if I was watching it, I wouldn't even care for it. It is very bad. Avoid at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a bad one, with bad acting, bad story lines, bad dialog, bad writing and bad, bad photography. This is bad and there's no plot. It's just a movie that tells us it's the best movie, and it's bad. It'll get your attention and I'll shut my mouth and say "No, it's really good and it can be interesting but, it can't be interesting". We've all seen movies that are as bad as this. The best movies are interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen worse, more serious movies than "Treme", but my first impression of it was that it is like a low budget, amateur, and ill-made, but dull, and boring movie. That, I guess, is because the movie is directed by David Gregory and one-half of the plot is about a gang of young men in the local gym, who want to get on with the guys who want nothing but to be involved in something. There is no real plot. The main villain, who wants to kill the rest of the guys by killing their mothers, is also an incompetent guy.  David Gregory's character is the only good thing about the movie, which was just a bunch of guys, and not even their kids. He has a very annoying face and sometimes makes a very convincing impression of a guy who could've done better in an earlier movie. He is also so old and pathetic that he is unable to act any real-life action, even though he has some nice stuff on the side of the camera.  There is also a huge female character named Sarah Jane (a hot chick who I think looks like she was a real person with a great sense of humor) but this guy is never shown to act. His appearance is very close to that of a woman who is going to college for college. He looks like a young guy that is going out on a bachelorette party.  I had to see a couple more episodes of the movie just to see the end of the story.  "Tremacy" was completely disappointing. It didn't seem like the story was moving. I have heard rumors that the actors had filmed the whole movie in a studio, but that is the case that they did so and we have to wait a few weeks to see it. They probably made some money, and they are not paid a salary to film it. I would like to wait to see if the movie had been edited in a way so it could not be shown to anyone as a complete and staged copy.    The first part of the "Teremas" movie was about to be a real "Tropical" (or one-of-two) part with all of the stars.  The movie has a plot, but I think that is far from the case of David Gregory. It's all the same movie that has been done many times in the world, and it's only interesting to watch. I don't even
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "B" is just a big fat trashy film about sex in a few people, some of whom don't even know about it. It's just a collection of a bunch of people who have sex and do something together without even knowing the rules of the game. It also lacks any real message. A lot of sex is done with people who are in a position to be their girlfriends or partners, rather than by people in situations that are not in a positive sense (or for you, in a negative sense). There are also a lot of scenes that are so obviously intended to make a point, like the two-charmingly sex between a couple who just finished the season and that is the first scene of the film--that just can't happen. What are the writers trying to say? The way this film looks at it is just appalling, and I'd be sure to stay away from this film. If you want to know the plot, go by "Beauty School" and see "The Passion of Beauty". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not a movie for my tastes or for anyone else's. I really didn't care for the story. It wasn't funny, there wasn't any real characters, there was nothing to make me feel sympathetic. The acting was really bad, I didn't get to feel anything for the whole movie, just a few laugh lines and a little bit of heart break. If you really wanted to see a story, you'd watch the first episode of "The Office" and call it a movie. No idea. The cast was good, the script was good but the script lacked real depth. I gave it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Weird" is a derivative plot, with a twisty plot, as usual, but when it is cast in an almost totally meaningless plot, it is difficult to make this film. When I first saw the film, I thought it was good. But after seeing it, I couldn't believe it was bad at all.  I am a horror fan, and this is the worst horror movie I have ever seen. If I like it, it shouldn't be like this! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this film on the DVD a few months ago and I just was a little concerned after watching it, because of the very low acting of the lead actress.  I couldn't believe it was such a waste of actors - I felt like they wasted the money.  In fact, the only reason I gave this movie a 3 out of 10 was because of its weak, weak production.  This is a bad film because it isn't about the main character(which was the main focus of the film), it is just a bunch of scenes and stupid plot. I'm not going to see this movie for the reasons stated above, because if this movie isn't based on real stories, then you will find it a lot easier to find, if it isn` even made that way.  If you are a fan of a movie, you will probably enjoy the original one more, and if you aren't, you might find it boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like this movie. But I've noticed that most people dislike it. They usually hate it. But if you have a little bit of common sense, you can see that it's better than anything else.  The plot, I guess it's an alternate to the other one. There's a lot of action and stuff, but nothing worth talking about.   The script is stupid and awful.  How was it even made? I don't know. But at the end the characters were very nice and there were some decent supporting characters. But the movie is really just lame. And the acting is bad.  I think it's just OK for kids, but I've seen the other movies better.  If you like the story and the action, go pick it apart. But not for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie without even having heard of its original name. I couldn't believe that it was even a film: just some stupid scenes with a guy and a little girl. I felt like I could have made some of the scenes with more people, but in fact I didn't. The plot was predictable. I can't blame the plot, because I like movies that are so great, but you can't have an idea when it's not really about you. The story is about a woman (who really is not the girl, I'm sure) who was trying to get a man to do something for her. But all she wanted was for her to have sex with him so that her husband could be satisfied. I knew, from the first line of the script, that if the man wanted to do that, he would only do that in one way. But I just couldn't take it that far. It is just something someone said about sex in some strange way. It wasn't even a sex scene.  This movie was about a man who killed his wife and went to some place and tried to see if she could give him what she wanted and I don't believe he did. In fact I don the man, and then after a few hours, I decided it was OK to guess the woman's identity. The woman, though, wasn't very satisfied with that and she wanted him to kill another person. After killing the person, she wanted to go to that place and kill him. Of course, she couldn't kill him there. The man's girlfriend (who was a woman) and his father (who I guess he didn't like) didn't get along with her plan. She didn't want to die in the hands of his new lover.  Now I want you to know what this movie was. I just don't think I will ever watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that keeps this film from being a true masterpiece is its laughable premise, which is, a ridiculous excuse to the original film. This is probably the reason the movie was so poorly acted. The storyline is a huge waste of effort - the whole "what has happened in the past" narrative is meaningless. The director, Ben Silverman, made himself a fool in this film, and it's just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a huge waste of time for a "B" movie. I have to be honest, this is the dumbest movie I have ever seen in my lifetime, it's very predictable and predictable and it doesn't make much sense either. It doesn't even make sense from the beginning to the end, like this movie will be about the death of a little child. We don't get to know all the characters, or the "plot" of the movie, and they only play a small part. And it's completely predictable! I just want to sit there and watch my dumb friends sit around and do nothing. I was the only one who stayed for that brief 2 minutes! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a disappointment. Even after 15 years of watching this movie I could see this piece of crap and think of myself as a complete idiot. I'd love to find out that somebody in charge of a movie studio could get the idea that a movie like this could work. But, that doesn't stop me from having a little laugh: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with the hilarious title: "Hot Summer" which is obviously an extremely stupid title, but it's OK. If you'd like to stay in a summer camp you will enjoy some cool summer activities with the boys. But they would not go for it. The boys spend their time all day, and even if they weren't doing anything, they'd not be spending the summer in a school in the summer school.  They even have to sit on a big-ass pillow in their tent, which is just an excuse for a shitty movie. But the boys don't talk about the girls, they just spend their money instead. They spend a lot of money on a lot that doesn't even belong to them. The acting is completely unbelievable and the only thing that can be considered is the plot. Even the big-name cast members are so awful that they even can't tell the truth about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is not interesting, no story is interesting, and nothing happens in a matter of fact. It seems like it was the very worst film I have ever seen. Even the best films, like Dr. Seem, and Air Raid, are interesting in the least important manner. The actors need to show more action than this.  I wish it would have been a "feature" film, or at least a film with more action and action. The acting is so bad, I have to believe that this movie was made just to make money. If anything was about to be released at all, I would want it to be pulled from the shelves and never even made public. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have any special interests (or a negative opinion about a terrible movie: a bad slasher film or a cheap horror movie) you might be disappointed. But if you're one of the thousands who enjoy cheap horror, this film is not for you. In a horror movie where it stars a bunch of teen vampires, you'll watch about five minutes of an hour of non-explicit violence. And there will be dozens of blood splashes. If you want to see some of your own blood splashed out of your stomach to see you have the blood in your face for two minutes.  This film is horrible even for a budget. It has no concept of suspense or acting. It is so bad it is funless and pointless, even though it is not supposed to be so. If the makers of this film wanted to make a horror film, they would have put a lot more money into their budget.  A lot of horror films like this have some kind of plot and a movie director that sets it up to have suspense, and in some kind. This one does not. It does nothing but is mindless and dull. A film based on a dumb plot would have made a better impression than the two thirds of this movie. Even a better movie would have been made by a team that knows better, and didn't spend more money to make this thing worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You can find out anything about this movie: it's the kind of movie that is made for teenagers that is so horrible it keeps you thinking it's a documentary and that it's going to make a lot of people sick. This was horrible. And when I watched it, I saw that this film was going to be a documentary, instead of a horror film, because you really can't put it into any categories like gore, gore, shock, suspense, sex, and so on. And I found that I don't even find it to be very interesting when I watch it. I wish I could get my hopes back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just another low-budget comedy about a stupid family of brothers and sisters trying to survive on a small farm.  After the family of three sisters, all of the family (the oldest sister) is dead. When a few months after, a little kid finds it and steals a little thing from a few parents. This kid is now trying to rent it, but there are some kids in there who don't see it.  How does this movie make it a comedy? The plot is a little bit interesting, but it lacks enough comedy to make the movie funny.  It starts off with a nice plot (the main plot of the movie), but when it comes along, it tries to be scary and then tries to make it funny. This is the worst of two movies: bad comedy and bad comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first movie I have seen of the kind which was believed to have been produced by "big" Hollywood studios and "big bucks" from the "Big Four" production studio...that was the big studio back at the turn of the century. When we think of "big picture" movies, they normally do a little bit of work in which we get to know our audience, get a sense of who we are and what they think we are. For whatever reason this has a really terrible story that is almost completely unfathomable and just makes it seem like it is the kind of movie you see on television where people are trying to get people to believe something they don't really believe.  If you have a chance to see this movie with a lot of friends and family who have absolutely no idea what's going on...you'll be sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very nervous to sit through the film with other friends. The acting in particular was awful. The scenes involving the killer had absolutely no place in the story, they were just some dumb jokes and were just bad. The story seemed to be about some weird and creepy person who got into a sex gang and turned into a monster. The whole movie was only a matter of time in fact I thought the story had little more substance than the rest of it and it only seemed to really be about the killer. I'm glad to say that I actually found this to be a very weak film but I did really wish my friends could have just walked away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife watched this movie with my wife. I felt like I was a kid in a circus (an idea I hadn't had a thought about) watching it. I was angry about it.  My husband laughed the hell out of the story, as a kid would.  The last thing I want to say is this movie is so stupid I can't even watch it for myself. This movie is about a group of people who kidnap a little girl (I guess) and force her to stay with them. She is a child who was raised on her own in a village but is now running around again and causing mayhem.  It is obviously just an excuse for the fact that this is the only movie about children in the world that isn't about kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was absolutely pointless and should have been a film worthy of being an "Mommie" or "Muppet" film, but I suppose that is not the case.  For instance, the idea of the title of the film is completely artificial and it comes down to "the big evil evil guys" (probably just the "evil guys"), and it seems to be directed in that fashion. I am not going to get mad up about that. It's a shame to have such pretensions on a film.  The movie was obviously so bad, that you have to be on the lookout for it to keep your eyes off.  I really felt that it was silly and silly, and not even funny. It had no charm. In fact, it was an almost-impossible to watch. I cannot give this movie an 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed to see that the producers thought that the movie was to be something worthwhile.  This movie is an appalling waste of time of my time. I've already seen The Secret Message and The Naked Ray. And I've seen a bunch of movies that have to be seen at the end of their run, but you can watch one of the big stinkiest, most ridiculous, dumb movies, and I don't have any sympathy for them.  I'd like to see some films that are worthy of standing out for a second try, but this is a bad choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've always wanted to be one of those "classical family films" in which a couple of people make a lot of money and decide to spend it for the kids, but this film is not one of them. If you're looking for a simple "movie" it doesn't have any real plot, the characters are the only thing that you can care about. I'm still a little bit disappointed because the acting and photography in the film are pretty good, but it's not funny or clever enough to redeem the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible, I don't know how it came to be made, but it appears to be about the big, fat, white guy named "Randy" and another named "Mike" that are pretty much the two main characters (the white guy and the black guy) in the movie. The main character(the white man) and the main character (the black man) are both very creepy. The big fat white guy is clearly the big white guy, but the black character(s) look like they're just walking in their underwear in the street. The film can't make the connection between the two characters is even more confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so terrible that I decided to go and see it at a movie theater on Sunday to avoid having to see it... but since we both went and saw it, we can't fault it. The acting is terrible, the storyline is pointless, the acting is awful, the cinematography is horrible. This movie seems like a real ripoff of "The Terminator" (and now "The Mummy"). I think "The Killer Killer" is better than "The Master of Terror". They're worse than "Terminator" because of the movie's storyline, but they're at least good enough to pass from. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really hoping that I would enjoy this movie. However, the production was very weak, so that really left me feeling really frustrated. The movie has the problem with a really bad plot. The premise is pretty much what the plot is. You see, when you see the first scene in the film, the whole thing happens. Then you get caught up in it. Then when you go into the film when it is about to be released.   And now the film shows you, "You see that guy." And the camera focuses on it. What happens next? Well, you just see the guy as you get to know about him. So, you can never really see it. So it's no wonder why this film made me miserable. If you think you can make this film, you could at least be able to pull the camera around and make it look like normal cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is just a lot of crap. It's just a dumb movie. In my opinion it is the worst horror movie that I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a good ending to the movie but this just doesn't live. There was little actual dialog with the characters, the movie was not interesting as a whole. I do not care for these guys. I found the acting to be lame. However, the action is good in some way and the story isn't bad, but the ending was bad. The only way I could blame this is that it was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really sucks, it tries to make fun of "evil" i.I.s monsters in some way and not really getting the best in terms of a comedy film. Most movies try to make comedy of this level. This one does not try so hard and gets really far away with the premise and then starts sucking... The jokes are awful, they're not funny, I don't have a good feeling about this movie and don't want to see it again. The characters are really awful and it doesn't make sense at all and it's just a movie with very low effort to make a big deal, i don't like it and I'm really not sure where it's going to go next. But at least the original cast will be back with new stars. I don the same for "The Monster With Two Faces". This movie is a total waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a ripoff this movie is. It's a waste of money and no redeeming value for anyone who watched it. Even worse than the original "Softega." It doesn't even pretend to be a real film. It should be called "Pilot Life." In the end, it's just the story of a failed, old couple trying to have a happy ending. It fails, it doesn't reach it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason that I'd be tempted to give this film this much more than 5 out of 10 is the fact that it is a horrible film. It's full of crap and the acting is terrible. While the acting was good, it's also just plain bad. It isn't hard to get into someones' mind to avoid watching this film. And yet, I'm willing to concede this film might not have been an easy choice in the first place, even though it's only 1/10. But then I also have to assume that there will be some kind of Oscar consideration for this film (which I can't say with certainty, seeing as this is a low budget film). If it ever manages to get to Oscar, it will be like seeing the first episode of "M*R-1" - but even that episode would still be awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What happens in this film? Some sort of torture. There's a little plot to it, I mean, the torture would have worked if they would have gotten the right people. It's obvious that the torture is fake and the people who have been abused get punished. If the torture were real then the people would be punished also. I've never seen that. So I feel like I have seen a torture movie that doesn't even have a storyline and is so bad that you feel like you're going to cry. Some of the torture scenes are so bad they don't make their own film. I didn't even see that until I watched it, and I was completely disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the movie that is "The Last Movie"--which I'd like to say, is the "The Best Movie Ever"--with The Last Movie being the least awful. Even if you've read the book, you know it's bad. This movie is all about "The Other Guys" and that just is bad. I'm a little bit weary because I actually have seen this movie, but I don't remember it much. There's absolutely no plot, there's a plot, but it all goes and stays very, very, VERY wrong. Even the actors were OK--they were generally OK-for-normal people, but they all weren't the right guys. The guy that they were playing in the movie is so dumb that I think he could make a movie about himself. I guess he just doesn't have a clue. This film is just a waste of time. It is absolutely no fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After watching this film I felt sick to my stomach. What a waste of time it was....it would have been nice to have an adult film in some way....but there is so little, I wonder why people bother to go out for this crap! I also feel like it would be good to have a little more film for it, but then there has been nothing in the meantime....it's really really not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found the movie a little disappointing. It really wasn't funny as I remembered it in the book. The writing was a little bit confusing. I have read the book so I had faith that the writing could be funny. I don't think it was. The acting was very weak. The cinematography wasn't as good as the book, and the script was awful. I felt like I was watching a very poorly written movie.  It is worth mentioning that I didn't see a lot of the credits in the movie. I was able to find the movie's director, so I will continue to keep it in mind to check it out if I'm ever interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is just a pitiful little movie that pretends to be deep.  When the characters are in it, it is just pointless. The plot is not that bad, but it is awful, and the acting is flat, predictable, and utterly predictable.  I found this movie at a local video store, and I am not sure why this is an exception to the movies that are so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of all, I love Star Wars because it's awesome. But I don't like it enough. I just cannot believe that this movie is supposed to be a Star Wars movie. It is full of mindless filler and bad jokes. It also lacks the action and the plot of Star Wars has always been very good. The first movie was pretty fun to watch, but even with a better story than this one, it just didn't take place. The second one is absolutely awful. The fact that this was made a sequel is just stupid. They needed to make an action movie, a sequel to the first one, because they got so much money back then, and the movie should have had an action, a storyline, a story, and something like a story. It doesn't. They just put something out that makes no sense. There is no storyline, no direction, and no plot. The only thing that this had was just a lot of people in a room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so stupid, that I wonder if anyone was involved in it. The plot is very weak and the dialog could have been improved. Also, there are quite a few scenes that simply could not have been done in any other way. If we weren't so stupid we would be rewarded for this movie. The best way out of the stupidity is to leave the movie altogether. I'm surprised to see some people actually liked this movie! The only reason I would recommend watching this movie is because I have never even watched a movie I like in years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen most of the big movies in the 1990s and I've never seen anything like this. The acting is very bad. The story is bad. It is so bad, that the actors should not be given the time. If we had something to be proud of, we would have done something different. What is the point? The idea behind it is that one of the supporting characters kills another while making love with his girlfriend. I think that if you've been a good lover of one of these characters in his or her partner, you will find that when the relationship is complete and you should not turn off. For that reason, I don't give this movie a rating because of the name. If it was the best, you would surely see it again. The only positive thing I can say is that if it is the best movie you have ever seen, it should be a DVD for your collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not in the mood for this piece of trash. But, as I was at the theater, my body had a little bit of apprehension, the feeling that something else was coming up between my ears. I thought I'd be too paranoid to watch this movie if I hadn't known beforehand. I ended up watching it and immediately went to the theater and put it in my watch. However, when I saw the last five minutes of the movie, I said, "I'm dead!" I am a guy with a brain, and if a movie like this is out of my mind, I don't want it. For now, I'm glad that I didn't spend money to rent and own this movie. At the very least, if a person were to get into this movie, they would just go off into a dark pit of death. But I am quite confident that no one will actually read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So i'm going to get out my money and spend money to see it. But i'm so far away I don't have a hope of doing anything more than just buying one ticket. It's got an awful and bad name on it, so i just want to make a small fuss in my eyes to encourage them to stop making movies like that and just watch it on a big screen, where the characters are in a real jail. If only they would make some more effort to do something like that. So if you are going to see this please not waste your time, you don't want to be one of the most horrible films I've ever seen, because there are some decent, good movies. I would just hope people will look up this movie and see it at a good cinema like the one in Paris and not a crappy one like the other one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a film this is, that is really what i thought it was. I have no idea why people go to see this film at all, but we have to have fun. They should not see this piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really understand the story, or the fact that it is a very serious study of the human condition. The story isn't that impressive, but if I do want to read about what is going on in the film, I would get a "How did they get in?" to-do with a documentary and be able to understand it. The whole plot is extremely simplistic and I felt like I was being spoon-fed. The acting was awful, and the acting in the first few scenes didn't even make the audience laugh as they should have been expected to. In the end, I guess that the filmmakers were trying to build a story around the tragedy and how the movie would be released. But I don 'feel like I've seen a lot of bad movies since, I know that these are not intended to be thought that way. If that is the case, then I'll let you go on with a positive review about the terrible movie: no 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed at this movie because I saw it for the first time. I thought it was really funny when I first saw it, but then it became so annoying that it just didn't make sense to me. And then I just decided that I couldn't believe the actors were in it. They were pretty terrible.  I really wanted to be more disappointed. I didn't see "that" movie again, even though I did like it a lot. This movie was just awful. The only good thing that I noticed was the plot. It was interesting and suspenseful. But that was all the movie had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think I would watch this movie. The acting was quite good and the story was somewhat good but the way the characters went on was awful. The way the acting went was horrible. The fact that the filmmakers wanted to portray the relationship between the two brothers is unfortunate and I find it hard to believe that this movie would have been a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a waste of the original "Star Wars", but was still a bad attempt to recreate the franchise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really bad. It was not funny at all. I thought I'd like a lot of laughs. Unfortunately, it isn't. There isn't any humor whatsoever. And the ending just isn't great either. I would have rather seen a movie with jokes like "The Only Friend" for my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Wanted" movie is just a slap at the end of the road, you have to see at least 4 movies from beginning to end. Don't get an ending. I hope to see "Wants" on other platforms or in other genres. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought it on DVD, and saw it with a tiny cast. It isn't like I'd give a positive review about something like this (unless I've been told by my wife that she has to see it anyway), but it just seems like there's some kind of self-evasion going on. I won't get into the plot, but I know that I'll be watching it on a separate channel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the urge to watch the first episode of it to see what it was.  However, after the other episode of season 2 I decided to stay away. And I am glad to have had the patience to watch this garbage for the sake of others that didn't watch it either.  This movie was pretty bad. It was like something out of a B movie or something like "Wrested Love" that would really have been better in this format. It felt like a cheap, crappy movie. It even had some pretty good parts, but the overall plot was very poor.  I would love to see something better for this movie. I don't blame the actors for being able to make something to save our lives, but this movie should not be in the top 10, it should only make the bottom ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are several things I can't seem to get into without describing how horrible it is, and I'd like to see if you get it. I think it's a waste of time of your time to look at my collection of movies: there's nothing to compare, nothing to connect, nothing even to do with any of the "people". I watched this show three weeks ago and I couldn't believe it would get worse. I have to say that it's an insult to the "human race" (and the "race" in particular) that people such as me would allow the "film to waste your time". I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first real movie I ever saw that I could actually be embarrassed to watch. It was a terrible attempt to portray life as it is portrayed in the movie. Most movies and series are either very predictable and predictable. This movie was one of those things. If I hadn't even heard the ending in the words of my brain, I would have thought it was about a small, annoying town in Canada that is surrounded by a gigantic slaver gang of killers. I thought it would be a silly plot. If you want to go straight to the movies and try to learn something. I recommend doing this one to avoid it. The story line was pretty good, but unfortunately, no good movie like this is made anymore in Canada. The acting was awful, and there was very little chemistry between the characters. I'm sure it was an attempt to make a comedy, but most comedies are so bad you can't take them seriously. The scene which showed the real face of the Slaver gang was so ridiculous and ridiculous that I had to turn my eyes to the end of the movie and just watch a lot of this movie in a bathroom. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just a little joke and an over-rated "Horsay for the King" type plot. It is just not good. If anyone of my acquaintance has seen this movie, I swear you, it will turn your stomach to mush. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A documentary made in 2002 about a cult that believes it will bring them to Valhalla. But the film's plot is utterly unpromising. If this was meant to be the story, it could have been very entertaining. If it was truly a documentary, I think the story would be more interesting. Instead, it turns out to be about a bunch of people who want to build a UFO. The only thing that does is an empty story - lots of people, and lots of bad actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film features a "B" who is a bit of a dick. He was a dick at his last college, but this is not the case in this film. The "B", who we are led to believe was a real guy, is stupid. He tried to act like a little girl with a big nose and large tits, even while filming this film for all the world. This film is a complete embarrassment of the filmmakers who have so much talent in this movie. When a character (in this case, a "R") gets a "C" haircut, that person's eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair become permanently scarred, all from the fact that that the person was so stupid that he was stupid enough to try on that.   My opinion about this film:  It is stupid that the protagonist (who we're lead to believe is a man named "B") tries to act as the little girl. He is clearly attempting to try to emulate the kind of person who did this in one of his previous college classes at the university, and there are only a couple "B's" who actually do that thing. When he is alone and sitting at a dinner table, the only people who are at the table are his classmates. He starts singing songs off a record with some stupid song, but when he starts singing, he tries to make his name into a song because he has a few songs that are not written about himself and it is clear he isn't one of the people who does that thing! And so if you want to try that same thing, you have to find a girl that was a bit more intelligent than the guy in this horror film.  This is one of those "B movies" where the actor doesn't want to act. It's just another bad movie, nothing worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very disappointed after watching this movie as it's very bad. The acting is so bad it is hard to find the time to watch any movie that isn't crap.  It doesn't deserve the 5 star rating because it should be one of the few movies that has ever been so bad. I don't even care how much a movie is made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that I found this a bit annoying. It has a lot of the usual low-budget comedy that can come from. But this movie is just bad and bad all around. The plot is bad and the characters are bad. Oh, I am just a little bit tired, but there's plenty of interesting material to enjoy. But I can't even see this movie's actors anymore. They are all so bad it's almost impossible to believe that they are funny. This movie doesn't even have the slightest bit of humor that makes it laugh. They really need to find some humor in their films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had planned on seeing this movie as a comedy when it is released. It has all the worst jokes in the history of cinema - so many clichés and one laughless performance by one of the most predictable actors ever to have ever appeared in a comedy. The jokes just don't make any sense. And since it was released in 2008, it was impossible to see it in theaters. I was forced to see this in 2D (I didn't get the original in which I knew it would be released) because of the lack of quality. I'd even go so far as to suggest that it was one of those movies that was made about a video that was rated by a "foolish crowd" and then forced to be released in 2 D. I have not seen the original version with the original score on this one.  I did, on average, watch it until the last few minutes. The story is flat and predictable, which is a bad way to make comedy. For instance, the protagonist is a guy who can't even make a joke. The joke in this film revolves around a situation that is pretty typical in comedy movies. The plot is very simple. A couple that have been separated from each other (or separated from themselves) get together, and the wife gets pregnant. This happens to be a fact that is completely unrealistic. I can't imagine why this scenario would make a movie so absurd. The movie seems to have some sort of "climactic" in it. The woman who is the main protagonist is supposed to be the mother who is pregnant and the husband can't get to the baby until she is killed. The mother is then taken off the road and the father has her baby while she is in a hospital, with her being separated from them by a car. It just doesn't make sense. I cannot imagine why. The characters in the film are either stupid, or completely naive. The acting was good but badly directed. It was bad enough that it doesn't have any comedy value. It's like watching a horror movie that doesn't even take itself seriously. It doesn't do any interesting things except make you laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts off with a good premise, and it does some good things in the beginning, but then the premise becomes meaningless when it becomes a plot that simply follows the plot.  The ending is a pretty lousy plot, not good either as a story, or as a movie. It lacks any interesting parts, and most of the characters have no redeeming quality.  I'd prefer a movie with some real actors, if the director can find one.  You could also see this movie in a film festival: It's too bad to see something like that, because it doesn't seem very interesting in itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, the movie is alright, but it just lacks some charm and the acting is bad enough to make you jump through the story line. I would say the acting was OK but it is bad in the very end to make the actors like themselves look good. I did not care for the whole plot line, but not because it was pretty good. My favorite parts of the movie were the parts where they are reunited with the other characters from the movie, or they appear in another movie. For example, in "A Millionaire", they are in the same scene as the actors in the movie. I think the movie would have been better if they were reunited in the end of the story. The movie could have been made a bit better if all the actors had had a different story line, a different location, a new location, something else.  I don't recommend this movie to anyone, because it doesn't add up to anything. This movie is not worth your time! Don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are several movies, one of which I have never seen, that make fun of a man's worst instincts in his life. This one had only a brief, 45-minute plot. In one scene, an unnamed character, the leader of a cult, tells one of his recruits to have a new friend to whom he considers to be his friend, and the man is not very happy with this new friend. I mean, really, it was just a little bit bad.  A lot of people who worked there in the movie saw it as the end-of-the-plot of the movie, and what a great plot was it? There were no real reasons for the movie: not enough in terms of character, not enough money, no real reason. The director wanted it to be like a movie: but it just didn't make any sense. It wasn't interesting. It had no story, and a horrible dialog. It was just bad for everything, and I didn't want to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you've seen this movie, you're going to be sorely disappointed. It's about as bad as anything I've ever seen, but I still managed to finish it, and I don't regret that I did. If you see it in the theatre, your first instinct would be to leave quickly, but you won't. The story is nothing but a lame plot, no story line, no direction, no dialogue, no supporting characters. It just relies on the old story of a man who has a girlfriend that he has to find in order to get out of a bad situation (see above). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is pretty bad, it's about an army of mercenaries that wants to kill the villagers of a village to build a new settlement. But it's interesting, with some interesting characters and some pretty cheesy scenes. But the story is a little boring and just lacks action. The idea is pretty good and there is some humor but it's pretty dull.  I guess I'm supposed to care more about the details of the movie (the fact that the army fights against a giant army of demons in the forests of the village); but it just seems like a bunch of people in a bad castle who can't stop talking about the people in the village and having sex with people and eating a giant pig that they killed.  Overall I give the movie a 3/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "My Friends" is an effort at making an excuse for a sitcom with a female cast who plays her husband in an absurdly dumb manner who is completely oblivious to his wife's constant meddling. I found it a little strange that there are several scenes featuring women with absolutely ridiculous amounts of skin covering their bodies. I think they should stick to only the most ridiculous women in movies. I wouldn't be sure that the producers intended to pull such stunts. I also don't see why any female actors in this film could possibly have the level of talent which they appear to have in their acting. The rest of the acting seems to be mostly in the "humble" direction. The fact that the female acting is such a poor and unprofessional is an indication of the terrible quality of the script. This film is probably just a way for the producers to get a few more money to make up the budget. The acting could have been better had it done in a movie with a more talented cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't stand that movie anymore. I don't know why they chose to make it. I had a hunch I just walked into and pulled.  This is the WORST example I've seen. The only thing I didn't like was the storyline. The characters were not believable. I'm not one of those idiots that would say something like this.  The story is ridiculous. I mean, what did they shoot for? The whole thing is completely unbelievable. That must be why they gave this movie the opportunity to make this movie.  I don`t understand why they made this movie out of such a cheap budget. It isn't like it would have cost $5,000, but it cost 8 or 9 million dollars for you to make.   Also, the ending wasn't very funny.  You know, if I'm so stupid that I don't get that much sympathy? The fact that I watched this movie, I thought I was going to catch up with some big celebrities and they would surely be playing an important role in this movie would make me go and look at my phone and make some phone calls. And I thought that this was a "great" movie would be a "wonder" for this. I didn`t like that at all. I think that the writer didn` t want to make fun of that movie because it is really a big waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is simple - you have a hot-blooded, hard-nosed man who is obsessed with his wife. He kidnaps her, takes her for a ride and then attacks her on her. But then he proceeds to abduct her. We're not sure what he was trying to accomplish. How does this work? He's got a beard, and a tattoo on his body. He also has a gun. He's also got a huge red blister, but he doesn't go in the front lines like other guys. He has a hard-bitten wife who really got the only power he had over her. Of course, she's crazy. The film just drags on and on, until we're given an actual scene and we're just left wondering if there's anything we can do to save this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is just awful and really bad. you are going to like it better if it had some plot and some interesting images. But it lacks those things, even tho it was a pretty good idea in the beginning. I give this movie the lowest rating I've ever given it. It is awful, absolutely nothing good, and really uninteresting. I wish I could have been a little more fun. I have to say this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time, but not one of the more awful ones. The ending is terrible, I know, but I'm not expecting it to be pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't a film that deserves much respect. Not only because it is so awful but has absolutely nothing to do with the characters nor the plot. This is an extremely disappointing film. The characters are completely unloseable, the sets and the characters look like cardboard. I'm wondering if I'm the only one that understands the meaning of the plot and the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, it's not only that bad. It's not even funny. I don't think it's funny to start with. I have always felt that this movie has been done to an extent. This movie reminds me of a movie I used to watch years ago and was very poor, and it never bothered me again. So it's probably the kind of movie that I'd rather avoid. But, this movie only makes sense in a few parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just the worst kind of movie I have ever seen. I'm not going to watch this movie because it is a rip-off of "Star Wars", but if you've ever seen a movie with a very similar plot to the last two movies and you didn't like that one, you probably didn't care for the rest of them. They actually give some fairly good performances (except the villain, that is really the only performance of quality here) but the story is utterly stupid. There are only two scenes where they decide what to do with the guy they rescue, and they still get away from him, but they're not punished for it! That's OK. But the rest is just silly. The only reason this movie made it was because "Star Trek" was so much fun in that it's funny. I don't know if they'd even have any plans for this movie after "Star War", since "Star Ways". If you like Star Trek and have a friend who didn't see it at all when it was popular, I would encourage you to rent it, but otherwise it's just a bad attempt at a movie and a poor attempt at "Star-Ways" (if you can think like that). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So it is that. It's a movie with an utterly boring story. I don't know why I was watching this. I really thought that this was going to be a documentary about the war in Afghanistan. I found it very difficult to stay awake for long. If I got the chance to see the footage on the TV channel, I would probably be disappointed by the lack of a "real" documentary. I was thinking that the film would be good if it showed the stories of real people and how they made it, but it is a pretty boring movie. It seems that this is the first of two British films that claim that Iraq is the real war, and both of them are terrible.  The story is about a bomb attack on a convoy of UN helicopters, which I can't believe it happened. What is the story of the attack? A woman was killed in the attack and her husband was killed, and her brother and mother were injured, and the family of the victims have to find out why it happened and try to make the survivors understand that she was killed. The girl in question is a British soldier, who can be in the U.S. Army, and has not been in a war area at all. The fact that the attack was launched by an American helicopter is supposed to help the family make their way to safety. Why are the people in the convoy, who are supposedly there for a rescue operation, flying their personal jet to a base for her mother and uncle to help them? This is a poor movie that should be filmed as a documentary and not a story. It is a real cliché. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off very hinky and predictable. It can't get a decent story to start on, but at least this does provide some sort of context for the situation. There is no good chemistry between the two lead characters, the two main characters do the least or most that is expected of them. The "sex" scene is ridiculous and the "relations" scene has nothing to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. There is no plot. It is just a bunch of people, the director, and a bunch more people that go to some random place to get on the show. There are two main actors that act. They act like a bunch, but there is no movie. It just looks like a TV show. And the ending is awful. I didn't even get the chance to see it. I'll have to rent it to see again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie from the video store just as it was released, hoping it would be a bit better than "The Terminator" in which I have only seen two minutes. The problem is that it's just terrible, not good at all. While "The Last Movie" was a decent picture, it never reached the same level of quality that "The Matrix" did. The action was pretty good and the plot was intriguing. However, it lacks the special effect needed for a film that will be rated as a movie: "The End of the Matrix" has that effect. It is OK, but it really doesn't have that effect, which is the reason I'm leaving it as a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is so terrible, it just does not go for much to save your brain. it's only a matter of fact that they decided to leave this one off in the bottom of a movie - or so it must have been. the only thing that saved this film was the absolutely hideous soundtrack - and the absolutely unbelievable acting - i thought this was the worst film I have ever seen. this is so bad, i won't even try to explain this - but instead let me tell you what it was really like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie features the most predictable characters that most of us don't care to see. In this case, it's the guy. He has a big mouth, so he can't stop laughing at all. It's so bad that you just expect a story to go somewhere.   There's nothing else to "have for me" here. It has two teenagers, but only a teenager and a girl who's older than she is. The only thing that keeps your attention is the blonde girl. She looks like she's in college, although she appears to be an average college student. Her face looks like a big college girl and she's so shallow and uninspiring that you wonder if she's just a typical college freshman.  The movie seems like a really cheap movie. The acting was poor and the direction was terrible. While the two teenagers are actually annoying, you can tell there's no real development.  Bottom line: Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the announcement that The Amazing Race, and now The Amazing Series, there's something that I didn't quite anticipate. This film was horrible.  As much as the TV show itself was good, this was bad at times. The story was absolutely predictable and the only plot I got was the plot of "How Does The Doctor Save The World?" The problem with this film was that it didn't succeed. I can't fault the producers for this. But this is the only way I can feel that this film has managed to reach the box in the past.  The ending was the biggest reason why The Amazing Racer was such a bad film. I'm really not against the idea of doing a sequel, but I was unable to take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a bad thing that a movie can be. If the film's director had some talent, I would be surprised if he made this movie because it is a slap at his expense to the film itself. The acting is bad, the acting is good, the scenery and costumes are nice but the movie is a failure. The story is bad. The movie's story revolves around a mysterious figure (as the title suggests) whose motive is to take over a bad-ass business called the Red Horse Saloon, and I was not prepared for more drama from it. A lot of plot threads were left blank in the movie, and it's like watching a documentary.   The movie was pretty good overall, but the ending is a little bit disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was only one episode, and there's some excellent writing in it but the plot was really stupid. The characters were really terrible, I mean seriously really bad. This is probably the only episode that has made me laugh in a way that I was scared to watch. The actors, even the actors, were bad. My favorite episode was the episode where it just said, "Laugh!" The actors just laughed! When one's in a movie, you feel like a huge joke! If it were a TV show, you would laugh at most of the episodes. In this episode, you're just going to laugh and then you'll wonder why it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical piece of trash - with no plot, nothing interesting and no plot to break up. The title is interesting, but I can't believe it's a documentary unless you're a documentaryist. The documentary (which I've read) doesn't have any real storyline, so the story doesn't go into effect and you're just watching people talking at a conference. The only reason I was interested in the documentary is because it is a documentary about a conference where people don't talk at. I know I'm not the only person to be fooled by these things, but this is not the first time it's happened, and this is the first place it's ever done. If your going to be interested in a documentary, you'd be better off doing something like a short film, so you don't have to waste your time watching something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really feel like this is just some low budget movie with a stupid story.  What does the writer know? What do they have in common? When does they make a movie?  It's just a stupid excuse to fill out the whole movie with some stupid story, or put something else in a movie: "Babie, I've done everything. It's really scary. I've seen my friends, they've seen me in this movie. I saw that. I want to go see that. You can see me sitting in my house and watch it but you can't see me in the movie. You don't see my friend sitting there and watching it. I didn't see that anywhere.  There are only two girls who are mentioned in the book and there are only 2 in the film.  When did the writer decide to put a girl in a really scary movie? When I think it's important that a female writer who can't think of the nuances of a scene or scene is putting out something that is just stupid or un-interesting or scary or scary is put out, I'm surprised to hear that they're putting out a movie that is so stupid. You know, I did some movies when I used to watch some scary movies. This isn't a good example because the characters are a little too cool. They are really stupid.  It may be hard to figure out the way the movie is supposed to make up some "experienced" movie-making but I don't think you can do that in a Hollywood movie.  And the acting is very bad, it's almost laughable. There's a guy who is very scary. There are three women who are very scary but she barely is able to do anything.   And if you ever read a movie, the only way to make a good movie: Put your own imagination out of your head and let it be all you.  But this movie is not that. It doesn't make any sense. It is stupid. It just doesn't deserve the same honor that a movie of a different genre or horror film deserved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is, simply a one-trick-scarper for terrible acting and awful direction. The supporting cast is a decent one. However, the rest of the cast should have been replaced with some more believable actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is easily the most disappointing movie I have ever seen in my life. It is so bad, it's hard to believe I've ever seen one. I mean that the "music" scenes have been totally predictable. It's like the way they were done in "The Godfather" for example. The plot is literally just the way the plot was done. Not even the actors are in it.  I'd recommend you stick with the original, because it actually shows some pretty interesting images from the world of pop culture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as much as I've got used to seeing in a movie in the most horrific way possible (not that I'd recommend doing such a thing, but, it's a pretty bad way).  I just sat on the sofa, wondering what I had just done. For those who, after seeing this movie, might have a taste of just sitting in the dark room, I would advise you to reconsider making your movie instead of wasting time on it.  I don't know whether "The Night Men" would work for you or not, but that's what I'm thinking of the most disappointing thing.  You will watch yourself sleep through the first 30 minutes, and then watch you wake up when you're done.  There is no way around this, it will just keep going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was, if nothing else, horrible. Its only redeeming was that it was funny at times. While watching this film was a case of the worst film I have seen in an English movie: horrible humor with nothing original. Not only that, but the characters seemed like a joke of the typical Hollywood characters, and that was a really painful thing to watch. Most of the jokes were simply laughable. I found most of the characters to be boring, and the film didn't seem to know where it was going with it. It really was an awful comedy that failed to establish anything.  The plot was really bad, but if you have seen a comedy that is more entertaining than this one, you will find it much better. For starters I think it is a simple case of writing that sucks. It was pretty good, but I thought the plot was too convoluted and convoluted to be interesting. It got into a bit of a mess and the plot turned to be a joke. If you watched the whole movie, you would have gotten more out of it than what was in the original movie.  I would have liked to see a different movie that dealt with the idea of writing a comedy. There is only so many comedy characters that can make jokes like this one. It just seemed like an attempt at a comedy when it wasn't quite so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have to watch this movie and not pass it to your friends, then you get the same idea as me, that the only reason you watch it is because you loved it. Unfortunately, this movie is not that, so if you want to see it, do not waste your time. The fact that it is not very good is sad because the good parts do not make up for the horrible parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sure there was a better movie to watch. It just wouldn't have been so bad. I was expecting more interesting characters and some funny jokes. This film doesn't. I didn't get to laugh at it. It was like a kid missing the magic. I won't ever forgive this movie for what it did. What a piece of trash it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the most terrible and disappointing piece of "Mature" or "Modern" horror film I've ever seen.  I will admit that it contains elements of the more interesting types of horror films, but unfortunately this movie does not deliver them. There are some beautiful and inventive moments (I would have to say "The Kiss of Death"), but they are unfortunately drowned in a few weak, cliché-ridden sequences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You don't need to know the plot if you don't care for the character, you don`t need to see the ending if you are a fan of Sci-Fi.  That`s why I decided to rent the movie... Well, I don`ve rented the movie, and I can`t remember when I saw it. The acting wasn`t interesting, neither the plot nor the direction were good, and the storyline just didn`t go anywhere.  The best way to say a bad Sci-Fie movie is: the director didn`T have any good ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I have seen in the world. A two-headed monster that has two heads and three tentacles is no more than bad. The acting is not even good enough. I'm afraid my old brain can't handle it. The monster is so annoying, you're wondering why anyone could have the nerve to watch this movie. The director's excuse to keep watching this is that it's a "classic", but, well, who can make a film that's that annoying? The fact that this is a remake of a film made 40 years ago shows that it was an awful movie that is in bad shape and no good, in bad taste. Not even a good idea for a remake. If they had a great story and were interesting, they would have made this movie about a giant monster. The plot isn't interesting. I expect better films, and even better ones, than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know. There's a reason I don'nose. I just don't remember anything. I don'd have to read all my reviews before I can say anything. Anyway, it's not exactly that bad. But I can't remember what happened.  I won't care if I missed "the good ones". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely not worthy of even being filmed as a film. It is an example of bad acting, bad plotting, bad dialogs, and terrible plotting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is simple, but it's not that simple. I've read many other stories and found them to be pretty good, but the movie itself goes beyond the simple story and makes the film worse.  The movie is either over-intended or poorly developed. I can't give a list of what is wrong with it, but you just know it's bad. It lacks any sense of any sort of humor, substance or even humor. The only thing that I can think of is that it's hard to tell what's supposed to be the premise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie on a couple of PBS Channel's shows and I found it quite upsetting. It starts out being a good comedy with a funny premise and the best comedy ever for kids, but as it goes on the movie becomes so predictable that you lose interest and start to see the story only to see if the plot is so predictable or not to see it. The end is so bad that you wonder if it was a movie made by a TV director. And after you know it was made, you wonder what other director's might be like. It does not have the same charm that you find in a great comedy, and I can't forgive this movie for having such a poor plot. Even the actors, sometimes great, did a decent job. But I can guarantee that every other person who was in this film could see more than half of the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor effort but not much better than the "The Unterrible Comedies" of the 1980's and the "Horrible Double Action" of "Bollevecios" and the awful "Panda" and "Ichabah!" of "Horse Dreams" and now, we have a new entry in the bad movie genre of bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about a young boy who is forced to find out that being gay is bad, but in the end he finds out that it doesn't matter. And when you find out this you are left wondering if he really has it in a serious way. If you've been sheltered your life is all right, if you're not the type of person that would be homosexual. The problem is that it has been made so horribly overacted and not good enough that it does not make the case.  This was an okay episode but I think it should not be a series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst films ever produced. I'd have given this film 8 or 10 points, but it's way too low to make me care. The story is nothing that any sane person would like, and the acting is so bad that the story is better as to put your kid. This film only lasted a few hours, so they have to put a disclaimer about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So bad it had to be made...  It is just a bad film. Its no better than a movie made of a very low budget film. But it is really bad to put anything into it. For example, we don't get to know anything, and we don�t see enough of what we need to see. We don�T learn what is happening to people from it. This is a movie that just makes things up as it does nothing, and is a very bad, but at the same time, it is fun, so it is interesting in that aspect. If it was made a good film, I would have liked it, but it has nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew what was going to happen from the first episode but I thought that the movie would be more interesting as it was going on. I didn't expect the actors would make it, because it was pretty plain to see that they wouldn't. I just couldn't believe that this was the beginning. The beginning would be fun. But it was just the same as every other movie: mediocre plot, weak acting and terrible directing.  After a few minutes of viewing, I knew that I was losing a lot of trust that I could trust the actors and director.   The end to this movie seemed like it should have been a really good movie.  Unfortunately, it wasn't. This movie was completely incomprehensible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the equivalent of a mediocre film with low cast, bad performances, bad plot, and terrible plot. I don't believe in horror films, but for horror-film that contains an absurd amount of nudity, gore, gore and nudity, it's hard to avoid watching. This film is the only place where the acting is particularly bad.  The plot was very predictable. If you saw this film, you knew it would be bad. The plot had some interesting plot twists, the scenes of the film were not just about a car and some people, but some characters were introduced with more depth. Then you saw the car was going to the hospital... but it also was moving in its own way, but at the same time, a car was crashing. The car had a car that moved in the opposite direction and a car with a big wheel. When there are two car models in a parking lot, the only way is to not see a car falling apart into a lake and ending up on land as it did in the previous film.   The fact that I'm going to mention this movie is because it's probably the worst horror film EVER. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm more curious than others about the meaning of the words "Obey" and "Knees" used in this film, and I will try to explain exactly what the meanings are. They both seem, to me, to be either meaningless or meaningless. To some observers, "Overemous" is a synonym for "good-will", and this seems to imply that the "Oremous", a kind of "good" animal, is the bad kind of animal that "Knew", or any other animal, be. I've read some comments on the Web, but they don't seem to be very accurate. The biggest problem with this film is the plot. There is no plot. I have to wonder why this was the only film that had plot. The only thing that I see in this movie is a dead creature, which, I suspect, is not at all possible to make. It also goes without explanation. I'd be willing to add the words to the video: "Ow" and a "Keen". Neither seem to make any sense, and certainly no matter why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie made about as a movie by some other people I've never heard of. There's nothing but bad (some of the worst movies I have ever seen, but not this one, not even the best of them). When I initially read the synopsis I didn't care too much. I just knew it was bad, and couldn't care what happened to the character. It wasn't great, but it was terrible. Now I don't know what happened when the actors involved in this movie had the idea to do the movie. But, when they did, they did. I couldn't believe it was just about acting and acting, I had to see the whole thing! How does one movie of this nature get made?? I had so long ago it had gone and I couldn it be as bad as this movie. I have to believe I should have known about this movie before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I guess the movie was set in a place like a post-apocalyptic "fantasy" fantasy. And I think I have seen enough movies already to know that it's not a realistic fantasy. But somehow I thought I would like to see a little bit more to the point of it being a "comedy" movie, so I gave it my two dollars. And what did it in? Well, what did the actors do? Well there are some funny people there, and, oh, they sure were funny. But I've never seen more of the actors than this pathetic piece of garbage. And it doesn't even have a plot or a storyline. The only thing that was in place was that it had a female named, and it was funny enough, but unfortunately she couldn't get there fast enough. Maybe the real name was a girl. The whole film has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the world, other than some stupid comments. I have to see that movie again because I think it's got to be watched, but it's so terrible I'm never going to pay for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films ever made, it's really bad. I think this is the worst movie EVER made, especially the female lead. The characters in this movie have very little to do except talk about a movie: i.e. the plot, the acting, the camera movements, the locations, the sets, etc.  If I have to think this way as a viewer i'm going to lose a lot of sleep. In fact i had to watch the whole movie with my daughter. This is the first movie i've seen that was worse than a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely awful.  Most of the things from this movie are a little bit funny, but you can't take anything from this flick. Not one of my friends enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just like a bad set of movies made by people with the most annoying name ever. The acting is pretty bad. There is some sort of "humor" but the comedy just isn't funny enough to make the entire movie interesting. Some good jokes, like the "Hilarious" jokes, and the ones that aren't so funny. I don't think this movie would have worked in itself, but if you are looking for entertainment, try something different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched this I had to laugh at the fact that this was such a horrible film. A bunch of actors were dressed up as cowboys and I was like they had brought some really cheap costumes to that movie. If I had the money then I would like to know what they are called so I could buy one right? If I was in a situation where I could pay the actors so they wouldn't make their crappy acting and let me down to see another movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My main criticism of this film: The main story is a simple, dull story. The film tries to make the audience believe that the story is the perfect ending. But what happens at the beginning is not the "perfect" ending. The story is weak. The movie was obviously shot and filmed by a novice filmmaker. I'm not sure if any of the actors was involved in the production.  The whole plot revolves around the mysterious figure who lives in an abandoned town and has the appearance of a "hippie" who has no face and a huge beard. The character is an old man, and the protagonist is his wife. But in the end, the movie has nothing to do with the "hippy". The movie just drags the viewer through the whole movie without much substance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not really a good movie - but the plot is interesting in a small way. The plot has some good points but they don't reach the big climax - which should have been the point of the movie. It seems too slow, not great. The movie should have had more action than it does, but it just feels like a dull "movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a horrible waste of film. There was nothing that made this movie worthwhile. I will try to be more positive, but there is absolutely nothing. Please excuse me, this is simply one of the worst film ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a bad piece of trash. It's too old to be a movie about the Titanic, so I think you should go buy some of the original Titanic movies. And I don't believe that this movie is made to be accurate. There is no reason to make this movie, I don`t know how the "stars" got involved with this movie. I don´t understand how this movie was created. There are two ways of doing this movie: a) Don`t watch it at a TV in England or a) Watch it in a movie theater: It is too much like "Lord" and "Deeper" and it could be funny, but it isn`t that funny. It is a waste of money! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say I thought so much of this. The acting is OK but the plot is poor, the director is obviously trying too hard to make something better. The plot is the usual cliche story with a female protagonist. The movie itself has lots of plot holes, which just do not add up to a good movie.  The plot features the typical black hatchet and hatchet gang but what happened in the original? That would never happen in a real gang-movie. What happened in it?  The ending of the movie is completely irrelevant. It just leaves you asking where it came from.    Not all bad. I've seen a few movies that have a plot that is more interesting than this one.  But you won't be left alone with a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really lame film with an inshadowed character on the screen. The camera, though, does a better job on the TV sets. It would be a shame to waste even more of the shots, the director should not try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main plot is good, but the characters are poor. When I had a copy of it in my hands I was almost tempted to turn it down. The film is full of stereotypes and it lacks the creative spark that makes the older films great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love Mr. T.C. as a guy with a great sense of humour, but i think he is too old for this type of movie. If you are looking for laughs, you would rather be waiting for the original "Dr. Bean" where his best friend is. Please watch this at your local video store or your local theater and hope it doesn't get too late.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of those movies made that shows people on some kind of stage try to play out, like, to be more successful than a successful movie that makes no sense whatsoever.  I was very tired watching this movie, and had no idea how badly this movie could have turned out, but I thought that I was the dumbest person who watched this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that made no sense, that is not even funny, that does not deserve to be on film. At one point where we find out the story of a guy whose wife is cheating on him, that really should be the funniest part of the movie. When they finally manage to bring the whole family to the house, where we see the man's mother just give some money, and then see the two guys finally in bed kissing each other, and the family gets together...all of that is about as ridiculous as anything you can say. At another point, they have the entire town's mayor in a coma (as they say) and when they finally find out that this is the big family in town, that's when we see everyone's face, and there's a bunch of people walking around in a cemetery trying to scare everyone, and what's it all about? I guess that it was going to be a TV movie anyway. Unfortunately, that was the only thing I can really blame them for. I think I only really enjoyed the first half of this movie, but it just seemed like they had lost some of their nerve. The third half had little more fun than the other half. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to admit that this movie is absolutely awful. They just don't make much sense and they are simply two actors in a room. That's all you have to do. If you want to make this movie yourself, you need to have more talent than me and have some real talent. This movie is horrible. In my opinion, it doesn't make any sense. If this movie has been made and I saw it in real life, it would be a much better movie. I won't even go into it because I don't know what to say. It's terrible to hear how this movie could have even been made. I am looking at it now because I actually think that it's a bit better than that. But it really isn't. If the story is that good, then you'll probably want to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not fun, it is boring, and it is an old-school cartoon. I'm surprised to see that, because it was so bad I didn't know about it until I read an article about it. I don't know if it was ever a film, but I do have an inkling memory of it. It has a story, a villain, and lots of bad dialogue, which is the worst kind I have ever seen in a horror film. It is absolutely no excuse for such a film to exist, because there are more interesting things in this world.  If you're interested in horror films, don't waste it. You will be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this movie I was very disappointed. The movie was terrible! I didn't understand why anyone was laughing or why there was no direction. I had heard a few times that the movie would be "set" for a couple weeks so "set' is a euphemism for that word... so that it can't just be an "set". The way it works is that the characters are placed in scenes and the "set", which is the movie, can't be the actual scenes because they don't appear for long.  I finally understood why this movie was written but I really didn't want to get to find out. And I just couldn't believe they were made for adults. The acting is terrible. The camera is completely wooden and the shots don't move much. And the fact that the girls are naked is just not what it needs to be. I don't really understand why this film is set to end is only a reference to the title, and I really don't know why it should be made that way either. If I had been an expert in the film I would have believed they were. It was just a bunch of people trying to get a little more money for the film. The best way is to avoid the bad parts. I didn the movie. My only comment is that I wanted a lot more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is terrible... I mean REALLY bad! This film was filmed in a very poor way, the acting was awful, the cinematography was terrible, the story was stupid, and the story wasn't even interesting at the least.  It's a shame that this film was made as a film. It was a shame to waste any money on it. I have the privilege of knowing that I was sitting on my couch watching this film in its infancy. This film doesn't deserve to be on a movie's shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've been in the theater, you'll know how the movie can begin to ruin the fun you have in Hollywood and the movie itself. For me, the best scenes were the dialog scenes (not the movie is full of dialog) and the performances were lackluster. There were few scenes that could really make your stomach turn to mush.  For example, it's so bad that when I watch the video, I can't help but think, 'Whew, maybe there was a special effect!' and just think 'what would happen if a magic being could actually take over the entire world?' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really sick of the "I think I might like a good time with Johny Jones." I can't believe that I have ever seen another movie with some good actors or a good storyline. This movie really just doesn't have any good things to say. It really only has a few good parts and no plot. But what really turns me off is that "Dennis's mom" is so stupid that you can't tell her it doesn't make sense.  I think she should try to find a good family who will be fun and fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not really sure why this is even made in the first place. If you want to make a comedy, do this for your own benefit. It's not funny. In a weird way. It just is not funny at all.  I know it's supposed to be funny to some people, but to anyone who is only human, it's only bad to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing funny to say about this film: "The Last Stand" is pretty terrible, with very little laughs. Don't even go there for the sake of your entertainment, don't even see the beginning of "The First Time". The story of the movie is predictable. There's one funny moment in the story that is worth a minute in the movie, but the rest of it is pretty bad. The director must take his time to make this movie so that the story can be interesting and enjoyable instead of being just plain dumb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to get away from this movie but I got a little nervous at the beginning. The film isn't even remotely close to the "WILL BE IN LOUCH' TO SEE AGAEN" scenes that you got from the films "Miles From Forever" and "Killer Cimps" which are the two main reasons I was so nervous. The ending is horrible, the storyline is terrible and the acting is horrible. This movie is about a teenage girl who thinks she should go to school and work instead of going for a sex change. It's only funny if you're a dumb, boring young girl. I've been thinking about watching it for 20 years and every time I have been watching it, I've seen more stupid, pointless lines and scenes as an excuse for a cliché. I'd like to see the real film before I turn it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This is one of those movies that was made by people who should have been so much better at making films. There is nothing in it that could make me laugh. There are only two actors that are even good, and they do not act like the actors in the movie they made. The actors in this movie are not the ones that made the films they made, it's just bad actors. The acting in this film is so bad, it just is a movie that no one really should see. Don't waste your time, stay away from it. Avoid like this. I cannot say that this was a good movie, but I know it was pretty disappointing to me. It does not deserve to be put on your Christmas wish list, if there is any way to recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm pretty sure that I read about this movie in the comments of several other reviews. This movie is terrible, though I didn't mind seeing it. I had no idea what it was going to be like; it's not that great. The acting is just terrible. I just couldn't stand the characters, or the acting. It just wasn't believable. The music was good though, but I don't remember it. The directing and camera work of the movie is awful. In fact, it was impossible to track what you were watching. It's just like watching a movie that had been made in different countries. I've read that people have criticized it for being too slow. In this case, I think it was slow, but it was way faster than normal. I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not a "Worst Film Ever" nor a "Best Movie Ever", and unfortunately it is not even that. I mean it isn't even an Oscar-caliber film, but it's awful.   The first person I saw (or maybe even saw) was a very sweet, sweet girl with a few "wets the dogs" line. She would make an awesome pair of twins. But then, when she became a teenager, she began to talk like she was a teacher and began to dress like she had a fashion line.  I'm a fan of Sarah Michelle Hartney, and this is the result of having a brain turn to see that she would make such an awful film. She is an immature, unspoken, unprofessional actor who tries to act as "normal" and that just doesn't make it work.  This is not an Oscar caliber film, as one might expect. But this is very bad because, again, it tries to use "normal's" image and "normal''s" expression of "normal". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is awful, I give it 2.3 out of 10, but I did enjoy the original so I'd like to see it again. But, instead of returning to the old fashioned style of action-based movies, the film devolves into a bizarro-spy action film with a few interesting characters who are usually absent from the rest of the cast. The original was pretty good, but it was disappointing. The cast had to be far too good to make the script sound as much as it does.  It had too much of the same dialogue and too much cliché and cliches as the original. There are a few moments that were very entertaining, and in certain situations, the original is good, and it has some plot points to use in it, but there are a lot of cliched lines and lines that are too predictable and just too slow to get to know the character or environment.   Overall, you're looking at a film that's about half of the time wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only an incompetent romantic comedy, but also a painful and disappointing film. It features a plot about a pair of people from different backgrounds (which are not all that strange), that's so poorly developed that it's laughable. This film is only a two-dimensional attempt to see the characters of the movie as real people who are themselves. Even though this is a fairly good attempt, the characters are not that convincing. The fact that the characters look at each other and make a big deal about their differences only contributes to the poor movie-making. If you enjoy something more like these two men than having characters that are just a collection of cliched expressions of similar things is a good excuse for a lot of films. But it would have been better if they had been more entertaining. There are other places in the world to have this sort of movie, such as a movie with an action movie. And if there was one, it would make it much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to be a family movie, but it's not one that can make one. When the protagonist is talking, you can't make the impression that anything he says will help you understand your situation. We've seen plenty of stories where this is not. The ending is just the usual conclusion to a story. This movie only has so many characters. The way the movie tries so hard to make you feel like the protagonist actually is the one that's really causing the problems in the world.  In conclusion, you really should avoid this movie. It's just an excuse to avoid an honest movie: a story that doesn't help you to move ahead to a better movie: an action movie that leaves you without answers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor excuse to waste a $100 or so on a movie of this one, but really should have been made a documentary, because this movie has no storyline. It contains many predictable scenes and a few predictable scenes that aren't necessary to make the movie.  My prediction for a sequel: either a repeat of this movie, or a sequel, but not both.  I can't believe that this movie is worth that money. The storyline is very predictable and the characters are not like the ones I used to know. A lot of the actors and characters just don't come alive in a movie like this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You guys can do better than just watch the first 2 hours of The Devil Wants To Kill 2: A Thief On A Plane. A Thief Of The Plane, and even the first hour of the first The Devil & The Woman are not too good. I mean, if The Devil wanted to make a better film he would have done something completely new or at least the film would have been made, the actors would have performed better than the film. I think that this is a true case of a bad story but unfortunately, we do not really know what happens to the guy's girlfriend in this movie. In addition to a few good explosions, like the scene where the plane blows a big, damaging cloud of smoke, I don't really know how they bring this up, I guess, that's just the way they were forced to do it. They seem to be a lot more focused on trying to create a new story and not so much on creating a new plot and it's not that great. The other movie of The Dangers is good and some of the best, but not this one. I have read some of other reviewers here are saying that the second part is much better than this one, but this is one of the most terrible movies ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was totally predictable and utterly predictable. This movie is terrible. The movie was about a person with a tattoo, a tattoo that has a small tattoo that, according to this movie, should have been tattooed, but it was obviously not. It is utterly disappointing.  If this movie was even good, it would have been good because of the great talent and talent-related talent that this movie would have featured. It would have made me laugh like crazy, because of this movie's boring plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a female with a brain, and i would like to see this movie if it came out about. It is simply a disgusting waste of film. The only redeeming feature is the very low-end performance. I'm sure I can do without a female like this. I'd like to make the same mistake with a movie that was so bad it made my own. If you wanted to be a big time traveler, you would have to spend the money yourself.  If you enjoyed "Climbing Everest", you would do much better at doing the same job. In fact, you might want a female to do that instead of a male. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst ever movies ever made - with not much more than a very stupid premise and a very bad directing. If you are looking for something to see - I recommend you look at a porn video and see if you have any value. This movie would have been much better if it had some intelligence and a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest waste of film history ever! They should have a message to the fans of "Lift to the Core" and avoid making a movie like this. It is so boring, I can't really complain. It's just a bunch of people doing something wrong with a story that no one could find. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a dumb movie. It has nothing to recommend. It doesn't matter what movie it is, it is really bad. It is no good. It's not fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a lot of things that don't happen in real life. A young couple that are having sex is having sex in the house, which is a problem for the couple who are having their marriage disrupted.  This was only one instance, but I knew a lot more detail than just the details and only saw parts that I don't think got to me. In the case of the boy, I think the man got a good part, but the girl was just a dumb girl and I was disappointed to see her get a part.   If you liked the plot in the book, you would want to see this movie, but unfortunately this is just the dumb part. You can imagine a lot better scenes.  It's sad to see a movie such a crappy ending for this movie. I don`t get the idea that I got a free book with this movie and if I had the book and it was the book I would have been writing. I will make this clear to everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. The first time the idea of a rockumental had any hope whatsoever. A lot of people who thought that the idea couldn't have been more correct than the reality were put on ice. Well, I guess you just can't help but fall victim to the fact that the movie will always be a mediocre rockumentary unless it is the only good movie. No way. No luck. No wonder. It doesn't matter that this film was conceived, it just doesn't do anything for the rockumenters. Why am I having to laugh for five seconds every time I watch this movie. I don't care. If I have to laugh every time, it is no wonder it does nothing for the rest of us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst film I've seen, even at a very low budget. You get the impression that the film is a 'totally made', but if you ask yourself, then, after you watch it you can easily understand what they do in their lives, and what they cannot do for each other.  You'd expect this sort of story to be about people having sex and getting in over with each other, but instead we are treated like the mumblest drop of a bad film with an incomprehensible plot and not that interesting.  In what I can only assume was the director's vision for the film, the plot was quite like a movie that's been filmed in black and white. The characters are not developed as characters, they are not like people that exist in real life, and they have not anything like a storyline.  The plot is not made any fun by the audience.  When I was expecting a movie with interesting characters I thought I was losing myself and wasted about 50 minutes watching this film. I was so stupid, I couldn't take it out to watch.   I just wanted to throw it away so I could take it to watch "The Godfather", I guess that's the only reason.  I'm not sure if this film is for those people. Maybe if you want to see this film I won't mind. I don't even like the way the director did this film and there is no way I'd like to see it anyway. The story is very bad, even bad in terms of narrative. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the movie for many reasons. I only have been watching it for the first 30 seconds of my life. If I had seen the movie, I would never have even seen it. I'm a pretty obsessive when it comes out. I can't imagine the reason I knew it was bad was that it was so terrible it would make me mad...  I have seen this movie twice before... I was not the biggest fan of it, but I can see why it was awful. It's just bad for the story to have such little resemblance to the original. When you are done with the movie you can't even find any character. It was so bad I could literally see it from my desk. When the movie is released for the public, I expect it to be released on video as a DVD or something similar. Why they couldn't give the DVD to anyone?   You can't get that "jail" that I used for the end of the movie... I really wanted the ending to be about the ending of the story. And then, instead of going to see it, they put a 2 Minute teaser in the end. If you've seen "I am A" or one of the other I'm sure you can find it on a DVD. I don't know why. I watched it so fast to get that impression, because I know they put the promo in to make it look like it was a movie. I was just so sick to see them put in the way of the ending... It was just the first time I ever got sick watching movies.  If you can just watch it in the beginning of the day, you'll see the beginning... but then you won't be able to find it after you finish it.  The movie is so bad, you'd be a little worried to find out it was just that. If they weren't going to put it out for the DVD market, they should have put it in their own video. The movie itself is only in the first 2 minutes of it. That is the best they did, the most horrible way it was put on the DVD. They should have a bigger budget for this movie, not like the way they did for "I'm A" because they just released it for free. If the movie were a movie like "I Am A", the movie would just be about "I AM A". The problem with this movie is not that it made me mad to watch it, I just
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely no excuse for not owning this movie, it's just bad. The story is completely stupid and there are no surprises, it does not even begin to deliver much of its value in any way. The acting is OK, the sets are OK, but this movie is just about some hot chicks, and not about the people of the town where the movie is set. The music was pretty good, but the story is bad too. The ending was so terrible that i laughed like crazy and i felt ashamed of it and i wanted to throw it out of my head and see if there are any people left in this world. I would like to see that movie with more money and a lot more good actors and it would be better for the entertainment market. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot to get from a movie: it's really a cheap, fake film, but in many ways it manages to make you believe it's real. The plot, although it could have been interesting, is quite plain. It's mostly about a man who has a sex with a woman in order to save a girl's life, but she doesn't even care about his "save" status because he's so dirty, and he seems to take himself very seriously. In the end, he kills another girl and is subsequently murdered. A very slow plot, but the story itself isn't so bad - the girl's a girl, and the boy is just an ordinary man. But the whole movie is just so bad that it doesn't help the plot either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a complete waste of brain cells with no real plot, no real point, and no story. The only reason I thought this was a comedy is because of the "joke" theme that is so painfully overworked. It's hard to watch an episode of this show without thinking the plot has been overdressed. The main actors are really bad, the jokes have been overdated, and it's just really not funny. It was terrible that the comedian's character was portrayed so many times. The premise of the show is that he can't take a shower because he's having fun. The jokes are not funny at all, they're just irritating. If the movie is about making fun of it's own time, this movie is only about making it more fun by insulting people who have it first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrible attempt at a comedy which is entirely predictable and predictable but has nothing to do with the movie genre - "The Mask Of Evil" which obviously had no plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the plot was good and funny in the way that it was supposed to be, this movie would have been one of my favorites, but it's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just bad. It just pretends to be a "noir" movie and tries to scare the hell out of me. I had no faith whatsoever that it would be anything else, so it wasn't a surprise to me. But for whatever reason, the actors should have a clue that something was coming up. The plot is weak and easily lost.   I can't say what they tried to accomplish in this movie. For example, we see a woman who is trying to escape her husband after going into her dream after getting pulled into a dream. And then we see that the husband kills his wife and takes away her life. The same with the "precious" time period. The only thing we see in this film is a black man who tries to escape his wife, and we don't see any black men who had "previous" lives who could've seen himself in this scene. It doesn't make sense to put him in a dream since there's no memory of people who had lived in that era.  The only other thing I can say is that the movie was just OK for the idea of the title, and the idea that it was about the time. I have seen many movies in that genre and that weren't like this one. But it's OK. If you're going to make a film about a period of time, you need to make sure you're doing the right thing. And if you're making a film where the story revolves around a couple who are fighting for their life and it only makes sense if it's the right type of movie, it's going to be OK. But that's where this movie has gone wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the first reviews on the movie and I'm disappointed to read that it was not only given an award. This movie is awful, with bad acting and very weak directing. The scenes are very poor, but then you have to wonder why it is being filmed in the UK and not the US. I couldn't understand any of the story. Some scenes were very good. But in a way the acting was better than the action scenes. The movie has some good scenes, but they were very weak. There is one scene that is funny and I thought that it made me laugh - the scene where he is in a hot bath with his wife. But there is not much there to make the comedy.  I hope that this movie will come to a closure as I'm sure the cast and crew would like to do it as soon as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read the comments here on other websites and the comments on it here.  There are many people out there who agree with me that the ending is awful, but what does I know that they actually know? There is no "magic" in this movie, it just looks like a stupid waste of a film that lacks a plot.  I didn't see it at the Toronto Film Festival because it was just too slow. I can't believe that it didn't try to catch the audience. I only saw a few scenes as I walked around with my wife.   It just doesn't make any sense. There was a lot of boring scenes and a few people in the house who were very annoying to watch.  If you liked the first movie, I don't see that you get much more out of this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like the worst kind of movie ever made. I have heard of it's before. I mean the only thing that can save the movie is to watch the first scene of the movie and then do some kind of CPR. If you are a cardiac arrest victim you will just start laughing hysterically, and you'll never be able to watch this movie again. If this is a horror movie you'll get angry enough to stop watching it. If it was an art-house, it would be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A friend who works for a movie theater was driving to get there for work in the theater when he was in a car that smelled a smell. He then turned in front of a group of people and made himself sick. The movie had so many scenes that could have been done in a theater in their own place, but they all looked like scenes that would have been in a movie in every place around the world. If you want to know how a movie made up a world of sex that you can't find in this movie, you would need to be in a place that does a movie with lots of sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply terrible in it's execution of the plot. Not only does it need to be funny to make this, it is incredibly bad.   There are several amusing jokes that are wasted on the script, so many that it becomes unbelievable to see an idiot say this.  For example, a girl is supposed to go to some guy's apartment and spend the night in a hot bath, only to find that she's stuck. After a long day, she gets a guy who lives in the same house, only he actually lives in that apartment. The ending is not even worth a second, as it only shows the two guys that are going to be in bed together.  I can't see any humor in this film. This is about as bad as "The Love Grope" or "The Pateau Brothers" or any other slapstick humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the book on which this movie is based, I had to decide whether to watch the film or not. I'm a fan of the film. However, when I watched it, I couldn't wait. The film wasn't that much good, and I really didn't like it at all. If you want to see a true slasher, it would be better for you to see "The Last Men of War".  What really got me to think I wouldn't even watch this movie was the fact that the "victims" in this movie can't even tell us where they were killed. They can't tell whether they were attacked by men and women or by bullets. The way they killed their victims also wasn't consistent with the story of the real war.  And when the war was real, the "Survivor" would never have been able to tell us how they killed the "war" victims. That's why this film didn't make the audience any more aware of the war. They just used the same actors from the real War, and used a lot of the same sets for the real movie, but there was nothing like the real thing. I couldnít stand watching them, especially because it wasnít like a real war anymore. It was so bad that I felt I couldnīt even do anything that would help this film.   This movie reminds me of a classic Sci-fi movie called "Star Wars" (which incidentally was probably the only reason why I rented this movie), but this movie isn't even remotely remotely comparable to that movie. They had little to do with the real battle scenes.  There are some interesting elements in the film, but the acting wasnīt worth watching. They werenīt really in a war. It had no real importance. They were just using the "Star Warriors" characters to bring out the theme of "vietalism".  The only good part of this movie, unfortunately, was the extremely good acting. However since I donīt want to spend the time and money watching this movie (for the same reason I never even bothered to rent it), I wonīt see the movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the first movie to get a release and it didn't make much money. I rented it when it was released. I thought it was good but then it was so bad. It made me look like I was mad or something. I don't like that kind of movie. So much time could have been spent on the whole movie but it's so terrible that I just stopped watching it. I was so embarrassed by it. This is the reason I have dropped it for a while. It's not even funny. There are some good scenes but they don't really add up to the plot. The first of the two films, one featuring a group of teens that is part of a "social experiment" that is run for the other film. The second film is a bunch of teens at an abandoned college where the teachers tell them to behave, even to some of the teens who are in their own beds. The third film is about a guy, who lives in a trailer with a man who kills people and is constantly threatening to kill his wife so she does it. And the third is about another person who's father is trying to kill himself. I can't think of any of the movies that I've ever seen that I didn't understand. I didn% like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I mentioned, I watched the first season of "Mad Men" with my wife and she hated it. She said that the writing made no sense, the acting made no noise and the acting was horrible. I decided to watch the second season because my wife wasn't going to miss it if she saw it. I think it was because they couldn't get the actors the way that the first was. The acting was terrible and the writing was terrible. The ending of "Dark Shadows" is probably the worst episode I have ever seen.  I don't blame the writers for creating the story. They didn't want to be filmed in a big studio like "MadMen", which is what these guys were aiming to get in. The problem is that this show didn't deliver on this budget.  The movie should have had been filmed in one of the more famous theat locations in the United States and there would have been no wasted material. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like an old fashioned, old fashioned movie with no dialog and a low budget. It is a bit on-parallel with my recent attempts to "make" movies and movies for teens. There are the standard movies, but there are some notable exceptions to these. This movie contains too many unnecessary parts, like a story about a car breaking down in the road. When this movie is released, it will likely be lost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this film was on an MTV movie, with no regard to the story whatsoever, but what was the plot, what was it about, why would this young woman suddenly go off on her life, and what was she in it for? I didn't get a clue, I only knew that it involved the mother of the group, and that her daughter had to be taken care of by her parents. They had some way of showing that these guys were responsible for this child, and if they weren't, I guess they wouldn't be involved in it. So, I went along with it, and I didn had the best laugh of my life from that film, but I still think this film is awful. I am sure I could be more satisfied with this movie, but the plot was bad and I'm not convinced these guys had any real purpose, especially given the fact that it had been in the theater for more time than just about 15 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the reviews I thought this film was really interesting, but sadly after having seen it I was afraid to watch it.  The first thing you must learn about this movie is that it doesn't work very well. Firstly the plot is very predictable and the only interesting scenes are when we are just talking to people. The other thing about this film is that the director is not at all a good director.  Although you can't really find anything out about this story, it is interesting but it is bad to see something so slow and dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot starts off well, and is quite funny at the beginning, but after the main story line is dead, it's a big mistake. I had to put a lot of time and money into the production to get it to happen. Even if it was a comedy it wasn't funny at all. The ending is awful. I'm sure it's funny if it's at a comedy, but this is just bad. If you were a fan of Adam Sanderson and had this movie with him in it, you would laugh at every line out of the movie, but the whole ending seemed like a movie to me, rather than a movie: it just isn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a poor attempt at some sort of attempt at "wack" action (which in a sense "Wack" is supposed to be). There are some scenes which are pretty good (and some of them are amusing) but most of the acting is extremely poor. The most common trait in this sort of movie is the use of drugs to create hallucinations. In one scene they are having a conversation, and in another scene they have been hypnotized by some "humanoids". There is nothing in either of these scenes which adds to the movie, and none of the characters even really seem to remember the event. The story is predictable. I thought this movie was about some sorta "horr" (i.e. "Athas" with "healing") that would make the protagonist think that he is now in a hospital. That wasn't my case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of this movie seems to be based on a documentary of an alleged UFO sighting in Texas which is obviously absurd but at least plausible (I didn't even watch this film, but this is the only time I have seen this movie.  I'd like to have a chance to see this documentary, but instead I rented this movie on video and watched it without knowing that it is actually an outrageous pile of garbage.  The movie itself is a mess. I am disappointed that they decided to let this film out to the public, and then put it out on the Internet. This is an incredibly awful waste of time, not only for producers, but for any real movie fan. I cannot see any reason for the making of this film. I can only conclude that this was filmed in a studio in a basement somewhere in Texas, which is not even at the level of a normal film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to agree that this movie is an utter failure to deliver the essential message of a musical or musical film. If the viewer wants to make music music, this must not be the same. This film is an extremely poorly made, badly staged and poorly written piece of music. Although the music is there, it looks more like a movie with a musical theme and a pop video than a musical piece. And as far as I can tell, there is no music in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this is your first experience of a mediocre movie, you may as well, be cursed by it! Even if you have read the book, the first "Sister" movie is so bad that it must be in the middle of the bottom. I will never have to see this movie again. I don't know why. The characters are flat, the acting is flat, everything has a flat twist. It just doesn't end up making any sense. I was expecting a real comedy and I got that, but nothing happens. I can't see that sort of comedy, I just wanted something more serious to make me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a local movie theater and it turned out to be bad to watch and even worse to sit through. The director, Mr. Karel is absolutely terrible, if you're even a true movie aficionado like me. I cannot believe this guy can direct a movie on a bad idea... the acting isn't too much better, but there are a lot of scenes that are OK (but not great, I guess), and a few scenes that can be very amusing (like a few of the old Batman films, like The Justice League) but the rest of it just can't stand. I'm really sorry that the producers had so much faith in this movie. I just couldn't help but see it because I don't want to see it anymore. I guess it is a bit better if it was the only movie for one person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just two words could sum up this piece of trash: 'no one ever knows that the world has been destroyed.' The people in the film, the film-makers, and the audience were left to pick up the trash on screen. The film is like watching old footage of some local slasher film (except for the fact that it is in a movie) and then realizing that the slasher was filmed in a real city with a real street and real traffic (which, of course, would not have been in the worst place for this film.)  My thoughts are simple: if you like the "new wave" (a genre of film no one in the world would call it) then this movie is crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had the worst acting I have seen for a movie ever. From the beginning and the beginning of the film, the only "real" story I can think of in this movie, is an example of a movie where most of the actors are in bad roles, and you could see how the story works if you could. The only redeeming feature of the movie is the ending. For me this was the saddest part of the entire movie. I thought the characters were great, but this was such a bad ending to a bad film, that I was tempted to see if they could recover.  I give this movie a 10: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing good in this movie is the final scene where the main man is surrounded by his men as they prepare to shoot down the remaining female pilot. This has turned out to be the worst movie of the century in terms of the plot. You might see it with other films, but you probably won't. There are some very interesting scenes and the ending is nice, but too many things don't stay for much longer. The whole story is just a flimsy one with bad dialogue and bad directing. The story is weak. It's just bad, even if you liked the film from the first time. It just doesn't really go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film on TV in June and was just about to put the brakes on to it when the end of the summer began to fall behind. I didn't know much about it. It didn't really have a plot. There were no characters, it was just a few images of people. The acting wasn't even that good. In fact, the acting was so bad that I really got away for two nights. It's a shame that a movie like this gets made in Hollywood, and we get a small amount of time in our lives to sit out with it and see it. We want better actors. There are some good actors, but the movie isn't worth wasting your time on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My dear dear husband's nightmares are growing more intense every day... I'm thinking you could just make this short of The Evil Neighbor! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie on 2 DVD's and 1 DVD through cable. It's not like the kind that the DVD rental list is capable of (or should be) making. It appears to be like a really bad DVD that has been passed by as a rental while actually being watched. It was very, very slow-moving. There was no story. No dialog, no story, no action. It looked like a real long film, but it was extremely slow. It had absolutely nothing but a very small cast. The only two actors who made it were very horrible, even worse than the acting. I was bored and felt that the characters were simply acting in an empty theater. The first scene of the movie was simply just a lot of shots. It appeared that the camera was moving like a doll. I couldn't understand why. The director had only a couple of scenes with a few minutes to show the characters. The story went right around the edges and then stopped. They seemed like they had been in an even larger film. The ending made no sense. The "main" scene involved a naked woman in a cage. This woman had a really big ass. In the middle of the scene, the camera had moved as she opened it. The next scene was her naked, sitting in her apartment and going around in a pair of pants. And then, of course, the scene ended. This movie has a name, but doesn't even have a name attached to it. I don't understand it. If I knew more about it, I would think it was the only movie I would rent. I did give this movie two stars for renting, and I don 'cant write 'The Devil In A Hotel.' But, I have to confess that I doncha think I would even make this movie. I didn't even like it. Very bad, but I don´t understand the difference between a bad bad movie and a decent one. And, although this movie was okay, the plot was very different from the first part of this movie: the characters involved were very two-dimensional. This had some weird scenes (for example, there are a lot more people around the movie that aren't in it). The characters were basically the same as the first film, and the only thing that got me angry was the fact that the "twenty-year old widow" is talking about her past years without mentioning anything that happened in the past (if she had the power to destroy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how I can possibly think that this movie would work. A bit of the director, the writer and a couple of other people involved in the film failed me in one or the other. I am pretty sure that they would be able to make a decent movie with a pretty good cast. But the idea that a documentary was a documentary is laughable. The movie was really about the "admission to a hospital" and the people that came to see it. It didn't show the actual history of the hospital and I didn't learn the real story of the person who died. That's all I can say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this film was really bad. I really thought that they should have a better way of making a movie. I don't know how I can even find the "real" title. This is really bad when you are watching it because you are so confused with this film. This was just a bad film. The main story involved a man who comes back to a high school in New Jersey to teach a lesson and was then killed. He was killed after he was teaching a lesson that ended up killing his girlfriend. The end of the film was a flashback that showed a couple in a car on a road. The man had done this before and had gotten away with it. The fact that it ended in a road is not explained at all. The ending of the movie involved a car that was moving very slow. There was an indication that the car was stopped in a collision and then stopped at the accident scene. I guess there was a second scene with the woman who ran into the accident. The two cars go to a road where there was also an accident, but that's not explained. The characters are very naive and the way the movie works is pretty weird. I can't imagine why a guy would get out of a car and not get involved in something that would be a lot more exciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of this movie is the man that can't get the picture he wants. The plot is boring, the acting is lousy, the film is too slow, and the ending is too predictable. But at the same time, it doesn't matter what you have seen in the past. In any other way, the movie is good. The acting is too good for me to care too much about what happens to be the new world after the first time. I didn't understand anything that I was looking for or what I would be. It's a pretty slow movie that is not a horror flick. I will give this movie 2 out of 10 because it was very badly put together, but I can't blame the director for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie at a video store and i could see the plot as early as 1 hour, i was a very slow person, the plot was very bad, not very interesting.  But then the movie starts. I have a feeling that the movie is designed to be a fun one, but it just doesn't work. This movie was pretty bad, especially the ending. I gave it 5/6 out of 10. It was about 5 hours and i will admit that i saw it so many times that i didn't remember it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I heard this film I thought it was just about a couple of guys, but I didn't get all the plot. I didn´t know the plot nor do I want to waste my time looking into it. I do believe that the actors should have read some books on this topic. But instead they try to cram a bunch of stuff in it to make it appear that it's all interesting. The actors seem to have their own thoughts when making this film, but if the rest of the actors have read anything on this subject they might have a few more minutes to check out. The script is also awful, as it is about a boy getting kidnapped for a ransom of $10. But I suppose it would be like the movie to be about a guy in a slumming society who kidnaps people for money. So I'd rather watch that movie and maybe find out that this is about something more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was made out to promote the new Disney TV series, "Brick" (I guess the name is a play on a "Buck"?). What I thought of at the beginning was a fun, funny show, but I couldn't sit through it. The film was about a young woman, named Olivia Parker, who goes from town to town and finds herself in the wrong time. The plot of this movie is about Olivia Parker and her sister, who wants to take her sister out to dinner, and do something with her. There is no mention of the sister, and I assume it's her sister who has the ability to turn around and get a nice dinner, which she can't say about Olivia. So, that's a lot of nonsense.   It is difficult to put a negative rating of this film because it doesn't fit the movie. There's some scenes where the actors did a decent job and some scenes were pretty funny, but there are no plot, and the ending was bad. It does seem like this was made by Disney and they wanted to make a bunch of fun Disney shows, but this was a bad one. This is the last Disney movie you should buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie looks like a "B" movie with some of the "B"-ers in it, and some of them are stupid. But I think that is just part of the movie, the rest of it was just bad. The acting was pretty bad, but also the premise. It just doesn't add up to anything, really.  If you like the "Z" movies, you will love these guys in the "K" movies. There is some sort of storyline in the beginning of the film, but you get bored and want to quit. The plot of "The Road" is about a road trip, and that plot is supposed to have some sort a beginning and end, but instead of the ending, we just keep moving forward.  This isn't the real road trip; it's something like a trip across the country, the one that was supposed to be the "real one", although there are a few towns that you get to drive through. The movie really doesn't go anywhere. It's a bunch of guys sitting on a mountain; we don't get to know who these people are. It has some of those annoying scenes with people, and it doesn't really add up with a plot.   I don't really know. That's all I remember about. I gave it 7 stars, but that's really the only reason. It was really horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible movie - a terrible, horrible, dull comedy. No jokes made, no drama, no funny, no real story, just one dumb-assed plot. Even the director knows nothing of the ridiculous situation. We get this guy, the person who tried to set up a nice little movie with a family who would love him. The only thing that kept him in this film was the fact that everyone in it was a complete idiot, and the fact he got his wife pregnant. He had the idea of a nice family, and that's where we get the idea that he's actually a person with a decent brain (and we don't mean that he got a brain, but we also need some intelligent brain to make some decisions).  Also the plot had a lot of empty dialogue (though all the characters were so dumb, they didn't feel like they had more than a few lines).   If you are gonna see this, you can just wait to see the end of it. I don't recommend seeing the movie unless you have a lot more money and are able to sit through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad, as you may or may have guessed, so it can't make a good impression. The acting is OK, but not very good. There is some good actors, but the other actors were really bad. If you liked this movie, avoid this one. You will regret it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to watch this film because i have a fear of movies in my mind and was looking for something that would be worthwhile. The plot was so bad it could not even be made into a movie, and the only thing that made the film interesting were the supporting cast. I would expect this to be a much better film if we had some more of the supporting characters, something that could be interesting. Unfortunately, it just ain't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, for something that has been called a 'zombi' this is not quite the type of movie I would expect to see. But this one isn't. You can see that from this video. Basically I just wanted to see a small part of the story, but nothing more. The only story I can see from this movie is, 'why there was a hit on a school.' That is about as interesting as a movie which only shows a few minutes in the film and a few scenes with no one except a woman. I can't imagine that the real 'hit' involved a hit and so that it would not be filmed for the film market. The acting is not that great, but it was obviously filmed in a very small place. I am not sure exactly why the 'hit on a high school.' Maybe it had something to do with a drug test for a drug addict? The acting didn't look like that at all. It has all the appearance of a 'hit,' but all the acting was fake and all the dialogue was false. And when the real hit was shown there, all the 'high school' students saw it, but they didn't say anything like that. I would give this one a 1/3 of the 'zombie' 1.0, but a 'bad' movie isn't that bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is good but the movie suffers from a weak plot, by an unfortunate writer. I can only hope to find the "good" part. Even the supporting cast members is a bit over-worked. I have never understood why they are such supporting characters.  This movie is about two teenagers, who are supposed to be friends, but we can never find a real friendship between them. They are constantly being asked to do jobs, but they never seem to agree. I really cannot believe that this movie was made by the producers. The plot was pretty good, but there was a lot of stupidity in it. A bunch of people in different professions are supposed a lot to work together to save the earth (or something else). How do you know whether you should get a job if you don't believe that a bunch of professional people will work together? The characters seem like they are working in their own business. I guess they're "genealogues", but they are not.  The only thing I can say is that I really don't understand why they have made such a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a pleasant movie: not fun and not interesting; just dull and stupid. But I must admit that watching the ending is entertaining and entertaining only, and the story is interesting. The acting is horrible, the dialog is bad, and I do not know how I missed this film; but I will give this one away as a gift. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to recreate the genre that was completely lacking in the first installment, but it does not succeed, as the first one did. The plot is very disappointing and the performances are terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was completely pointless. It has an absurd plot - a group of friends who make a bad secret out their lives - a little town in the middle of nowhere that is run by a couple of bad actors. The film is utterly predictable - even the villain is in a position to exploit the situation that the movie is about. Even the supporting cast did not make that much effort. The scenes were badly choreographed - which I couldn't blame in most cases - and the plot was so lacking in continuity that it just wasn't even that entertaining. The movie had a weak message in that the characters could just talk to each other and then get together in a movie - but the story did not provide any sense to connect it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing this film I felt sick. I watched this film because it was funny, but when I came back I realized my time was wasted. For starters I watched it on TV with friends.  For those who are familiar with the history of South America and are familiar to the characters from the show, don't even think about watching it. The whole story is a complete and utter waste of a movie. This movie should never have been in the media because it can never be released. The acting is bad, the direction is bad and the story is awful.  I can see why people are so willing to waste movies like this. A movie that you can easily forget. It has a message that should be in the trash can, but unfortunately it's wasted in the hands of fools like me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just watch it and pray to god that it will not ever get out of your mind. If you get the plot I guess it is in a very predictable way, which means you could say it is pretty predictable. However, it does get a pretty good payoff when you get to the end. I guess there is some sort of storyline (the guy takes off on a road trip to find out his girlfriend's girlfriend is a big girl who has a huge body) and the girl starts hitting all kinds of guys with random objects and then there are two of his friends in their car as a team to get involved in some of the sexual violence. I was looking forward to those scenes and had no idea they would be there.  Then you have some of those guys killing people and you get a glimpse into the guy's personal life. The big problem with this movie is that there are just too many of those stupid characters that you can see and not be satisfied with killing them. You just wonder what a world would look like if the guy had a gun. Then the movie comes up, and you just have to wait until the credits are about to get out and enjoy it so you don't feel cheated out of it. Then you just go back to the starting points and watch the rest of the movie and get sick. If that is not your plan, then go on with a movie: Don't go for a movie called "Stalker". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what happened to this movie but I think it's better to sit back and let the writers and the director figure out how to end the movie and I'm sure it will make an interesting scene. I'd like to see this movie if the first one is the best. This is like a cheap movie about a car crashing and a bunch of teenagers playing around. Why? The movie is terrible. There is absolutely no point to the story. It's just a bunch more teenagers trying to make a positive movie about car crashes and I've done plenty of car crashes in my life. There are no characters. Only one man and a female were put on a movie to show how stupid these movies could be.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are several incidents in this movie that would have been much more effective if they would have taken this time off of showing the story of "How to Make a Person Out of a Mind." The plot is predictable, a lot of unnecessary story elements are thrown into it. There are just a few scenes which are okay. In most respects the scenes that are not shown in the movie are very annoying, such as the scene with the man whose blood is spilling into the kitchen, which just looks like a scene where he is playing out with his tongue. This movie, while not terrible, is only a mediocre attempt at a sitcom that has very little value to do with its life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love horror movies but the story is just too damn stupid to be even remotely interesting. For instance, the plot is not properly explored, nothing is depicted at all.  There was some good scenes (I still think this movie got a little bit better) but if the story was developed to its full extent, it would be absolutely pointless to include them. I guess that is where the comedy part is, but the comedy doesn't even get there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what it was, or where it was filmed. What is clear is that it is not a very good movie. It is simply not funny. It's bad enough to make a film. The plot is weak and weak. The humor is weak. It doesn't make me laugh. I have a hard time feeling as I'm sure there will be lots of spoofs, spoofs and spoofs. This is the sort of movie that you are supposed to laugh at. Not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst film I've ever seen.  If you have ever been exposed to one of these films, you will never recover. It is not very entertaining and there is no plot. A simple description would explain it: it's too bad for a film: nothing interesting, no message, no suspense. But this was made so long ago that it can easily be made in advance.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My best movie ever, this was the first film I had ever seen, and I have no regrets for it. If you watch it in a cafe at 4AM and then it shows you a good movie, you get bored. If not, you have wasted your time.  The plot is bad, the acting is bad. Even the ending is bad because the story is weak. The storyline seems like something that will not be done again but this movie is so bad that you never know what it really is. I can't say that if the movie was made on TV, it would be much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a bad, awful film with some decent special effects, but the story is very bad. It's not just about a person who is a psychopath and has a very sad life. The movie is about the woman who murdered her family and made herself into a psychopath, with the psychiatrist advising her to kill her. The ending is awful and the woman just can't get away from her own crimes, even though she has a good heart. The film is about being in a basement in an apartment, with a basement with a large cell-set. The protagonist just has her arms and legs nailed to the wall, and we can tell that the camera is not there. The characters are weak and the film is horrible.  If you have a taste for horror, you'll enjoy this movie but don't really enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a documentary of the horrors of the "Wemann & Woods" but I was very disappointed. I didn't have a clue as to what would have been the movie. But I sure did find out. The film consisted of a lot of clips of footage of the 'Wemanna and Woods' case. They were clearly trying to pull the same theme that had been in the case, but it didn't work.  The acting is so bad that it's no wonder they couldn't get any actors. I'm glad that they got the opportunity to film this because I would have liked to see a documentary about the 'war.' If I were going to see this film, it would have required me to see it on TV. But, that wasn't the case. The 'WEMANN & Woods' film is not about a documentary nor is it about the case of the film-makers, but the filmmakers did some 'gaffy' scenes. I would give this a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't really say how this movie is, or what it is. But what it was is is, a movie made for anyone who will watch it, but not for an intelligent person. It is so bad and so terrible that I had to watch it on my bed. It could have been a disaster. There are many people who liked this movie because it provides "an interesting storyline" that is not in reality. But, unlike real movie where people learn something, this movie has so many holes that this movie does not make up any real value. Some of the scenes could easily have been made more realistic. But it does not. The ending is just bad. I have to wait for another movie to show me more quality. I think that other movies that this sort of movie is trying to make would be great. For example, my movie The Killing of Walter Munch, which provides much more value and inspiration than this one. So, please don't watch this movie. This movie is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time i watched this film was at my local video store. I thought it looked interesting, but it didn't work. There was some nice special effects and a beautiful photography, but the whole thing just wasn't fun. It was predictable, it wasn't funny, it didn; even the very few moments that were funny were boring and boring.  The plot had some interesting revelations, but they were very few. There wasn't much plot to connect the dots, and I would've thought that would be a fun movie, but I really felt that the plot was boring, that it was too predictable. It just wasn`T fun! The movie had only a few minutes to go before it's over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So many times i thought that this movie was better than the movie of the real Life series with the same theme. This movie was not as bad, it was good only in that it was not predictable. But the movie was terrible.  If a writer wanted to put real people in a situation that would happen in real life but would end in the end with a sad ending, then this movie would definitely be horrible.  I watched this movie twice, and I think my friends were the ones that ruined this movie. The movie was predictable, as much as anything else, so if I liked a movie, I would like to see it again. But I had no patience to see the movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really awful movie with no redeemable plot. There's a lot of bad stuff happening in the early parts of the movie. When it finally gets to a finish, some of the worst action you've ever seen (a rape scene) just happens. The ending is not nearly as disappointing as the movie, but at least the ending leaves you feeling like they might just have written a negative reviewing about a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I am just going to write this:  I just finished the last part of the movie. I would like to get some more time to see it. I have not seen this movie before in a movie theater. I do not like how they made this movie. They obviously do not know what they are doing. They make this movie out to get people to think it is a comedy.  I really think it's not. I mean, it is not even funny, if it was funny. This movie was ridiculous. I cannot believe I am laughing. I know you are wondering about it. It was bad enough to make me want to throw out my DVD with this movie...  This movie is no way to be done. The actors who played the parts did not act like actors. We had about ten minutes of comedy and nothing. I was bored watching this movie, I didn't even like the way the actors acted. The best movie I ever saw was "Stacy". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had hopes when this was a documentary and it was one of the best. I watched it but... what the heck. I didn't really understand why this was so bad. Some of the interviews seemed to be quite witty. But there are some scenes that were really badly put together. There was a little bit of humor in some of the scenes. But it was also really weird. There seemed to imply a cult-like aspect to it. There were some interesting performances but they weren't quite as creepy as the usual. I think the people in it just weren't as intelligent as the normal people were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely the worst film ever made, if you find something good in it. Not only that, it has a predictable storyline and has a decent ending, but that's all.  I found this film to be extremely boring and not very funny, although it's very entertaining. It is extremely slow, so it may have been better if you didn't pay attention to it, but not all-in. You can get a glimpse of the story at the beginning of the film, but you don't know much about it.  The ending is the worst I've ever seen. It's a sad, depressing ending. I'm disappointed that I actually purchased this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After seeing it, I couldn't quite believe that I had a brain for the plot, so I just sat there in a half-awake for an hour.  It didn't really do anything but waste time on either one of the characters or the supporting characters, so it wasn't a good movie.    I thought the first few minutes of the film were a bit boring, with a few nice scenes here and there, but then the plot got really convoluted, and I felt that I was left sitting there without a story. If you read this movie, do it with someone else and watch it on your own, you're going to get bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my opinion, the movie was awful, not entertaining at all. The script wasn't interesting. I don't remember when they were planning to release this movie (I know they were talking about it already, but I never paid attention).  The actors don't seem to know how to portray the story well. The acting of the kids is extremely bad. They don't come alive in the story. They are just not good actors.  The story is mostly about how evil an evil child has grown. There's also a guy named "Scrotus" (played by Danny Glover) who does horrible things for his child, who thinks he is a child.  We really didn't care about this movie. I didn't even see it. It is just bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a young woman I have a hard time seeing it. The film was awful and totally unnecessary. I've always wondered why this movie is such a rarity on network television. I thought this movie was just out of the ordinary but I can see how they are able to make movies so bad. I don't want to waste my time watching this one again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's OK for people to watch a "comedy" movie that is at least partly about an actual person with a big mustache and body. But the movie doesn't let you go and see what it is about. There is no clear plot to the movie. There's only a few minutes about a girl that we meet. It seems that this is the kind of movie that tries to be a sex joke, even when the characters are cute. It's not enough to make a movie about a relationship between two young people.   The plot of the movie starts with a person who thinks that his girlfriend is having sex with her husband. And there's a guy who just won her over. And then there's the guy, who just wants to get more money from her husband, while at the same time, it is a guy that needs to pick her up.  Well, the plot of this movie is pretty much like the movie "Munchmuffins". The person who is sexually happy gets a little money and then, at the beginning, he finds a prostitute with a really long nose, as well as a hot chick that looks like a porn star. But then, all of a sudden, the girl sees another girl who doesn't know what she is about and does something that he shouldn't want her to do.  What happened during the movie is that there is no real reason to make the movie any better. It just is the idea that this guy and girl was really interested in sex. You'd like to think that he had a sex problem and that he was a little horny. In fact, if he was gay, there was no sex problem. If he was straight, the movie would be about a guy and his girlfriend.  It doesn't make any sense. They have sex with each other in that scene (the sex with a guy), but nothing happens here. They just just don't develop anything interesting or happen, they're just just two guys in love and not really having sex. And it really doesn't go anywhere. The plot itself is very simple. It has the two protagonists in different costumes (the woman and the guy), which is OK but the actors were all the same. And the ending (and the movie itself) doesn't come as a surprise either. The people you would think would get the same ending are just so horrible!  That's why we don't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I hadn't already decided to be an out of my mind and had already given this movie to my girlfriend, she would not have wasted her time with this piece of bad Hollywood crap. The plot and acting were bad, the pacing was awful, and I really believed the movie would be a lot better with the other actors. The ending was really stupid, and there was no explanation of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Dukes" was a bad film. If I have the slightest inkling memory of this film, it can be a very frightening film. The film would have been a great thriller if they had just cast a few stars who would be perfect for the role. That would be the best story line of a film like "The Devil", a horror film. They just don't know what they're doing. They make the movie into a story in a vacuum and try to tell a story that is so ridiculous that it can't even be funny. They don't even do anything that's more entertaining than this. They've got the same name and theme that they used for their horror movies, so they can't really come up with anything interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first episode, where the girl is trying to make herself pregnant in a dirty bathroom at a small bar (and only a small closet) is hilarious (the episode goes on and on) but the rest of the episode is just the same. It is so stupid that it is just so bad that it's almost impossible to watch. I'd say this movie was the dumbest episode I've ever seen in a film. This is just an embarrassment to film making. It's just so boring and bad, it's just bad. It doesn't help that the whole show is based on the premise of the main character, a married woman, trying to get pregnant. That's not even a good movie. I cannot believe that the "controversy" about her pregnancy is even a fact that she gave birth. I'm not sure if I can blame the whole film as a spoiler. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is stupid and uninteresting, the actors, the story, the direction, the scenery, the cinematography are bad, but the director is good. I thought that the first scene was great and that the rest had a good message about how tough the world is. Unfortunately, the last few scenes were so weak that I was tempted to turn to a silent film instead of the TV's "Facing Fear" and "Stratte's". The plot really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had watched this show over the summer, but my expectations were too low and I didn't like it. It is about a small group of people, who kill the people around the town so they can use their wealth to buy more.  They take up arms and get rid of people that they can't kill. The rest of the town is all but useless. There are good people in town, who are actually decent and can be trusted. But in their hearts, the people are all the same.  If you want a movie with people that you can identify with, watch "The Town Manager". That show shows the people in a totally meaningless way and not for the viewers.  This movie is nothing to make, but if you are not going to make anything, then don't waste your money or anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie when I was younger. I was looking for a simple, innocent, little, family movie to make fun and not waste my time. I couldn't find one. The acting is horrible and the plot is horrible. I don't understand why it was so hard for me to sit through the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I laughed and laughed at this movie because I am sure that if I'd seen it, I would've laughed with me, too. What was the point? The premise of this movie is "the movie is to be a game". However, it just doesn't make sense. If you get a chance to watch it, just let me say "don't waste your time". And what was the end? Who knows! There is no point to watch this movie. If someone has any idea, or any inclination to make a movie, I will let them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like the old "Dinayah's Blue Moon" on steroids. I thought it was so bad I gave it 4 out of 10.  I don't know how I rated it. I just laughed. I laughed at the plot, I couldn't even remember why they wanted to film something on a lake in the Bahamas. It was just another way of playing the clamble at the end. It's so weak you don't even know who's screaming. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If your eyes were tired, it would be a nightmare. But if you'd just sit on it for an hour and watch it for fun, you would be bored to the tune of a normal horror movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is interesting but what happened to it. I didn't understand it. It had some good parts but the movie was too slow, so I couldn't quite believe how something could have happened. I had to read about it once just to make sure it was actually the same movie. The main thing was the music. It was too dark. You had to turn the dial to the music or turn the volume all the way. But what was the real purpose of this movie? Was the plot supposed to be something more serious? It was nothing. I wish it had a real plot. This movie isn't that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been away for a week. I have no idea why this movie was so bad. I really didn't like it either. I went to a movie theater last night and got the idea to find a good movie to rent on the Internet. I rented it. It was a total bummer. I laughed so much. The acting was horrible and the film was terrible. I even laughed a couple of times when I was watching it. I would have liked to have seen better and better movies, but this one was very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie to avoid it from becoming a complete waste.  If this movie wasn't meant to be about some of the greatest guys in history, then it was probably a comedy set on a fictional island. The plot had some decent humor, but it was completely meaningless as a comedy, not even funny in the right spots. The character in the movie were, well, too shallow to have any real story and nothing to relate to real life and a real person.  The movie had many weird effects that made me look like a jellyfish! The fact that they added water to the mix is just stupid. Some of the characters were really bad actors, they should have been in the beginning of their career. And the plot was boring. If this was an example of the world, then I would probably do a lot of sleep after seeing it. Unfortunately, the plot and acting got my attention anyway. I did really regret watching this movie. My advice is that if you are looking for a movie: don't waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie tries to cover up the fact that The Girl in the Mirror is a failed attempt to put a positive spin on the same old story of a teenage girl. But what does it have to do with the girl in the mirror? This movie is simply a poor attempt at a "noir" film, in which noir is only one half of the film's story. While this movie looks really good, it's a really bad idea. For starters, it doesn't really come together with The Girl of The Mirror and there are some plot elements that don't even exist in The Girl on the Mirror. The girl in The Mirror does get a copy of the book and a copy from the author of The Girl at some point and she then reads it herself. This is all the way I can describe it. This movie has two very predictable things and that's not just a cliché. For instance, there's a scene where a female in the village is taken out in the woods and attacked by a female. This was the case in The Girlfriend of The Man in the Dark and The Woman in the Window, in the case where the girl was attacked by someone who was supposed to protect her. Both these movies completely break the "no one knows the truth" line and both are very stupid. Even more disappointing is the fact of the girl being forced to sit on a mountain at night. This could of been a really funny film but the fact remains that both movies were developed in the same way that they were at the end of this trilogy. The GFE and The GLE have so much more substance than the Mirror, and in this case that fact is not just wasted. They both are noir! A truly terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never heard of the name "Inez" before I'm from a well-known genre of horror movies, but this one is no exception. This movie is really weak...it was just an excuse to rent it for the special effects.  I found this movie to be horrible. There was some very interesting stuff here, but unfortunately the acting was bad enough to be the focus of the movie and not a movie worth watching. The fact that I don't care for actors and movies that I didn't see made me mad, which I don´t understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the first three episodes, but the last two are a waste. The last two seemed more interesting with more interesting characters than the rest. But the plot went downhill in the final episode. In the final installment, we learn that the girl is pregnant. A couple years of her life are wasted by the girl leaving the job and getting pregnant. Then we meet a few more characters from the beginning of the movie. Some were cute and cute, but they were so weak that the writing didn't help at all. The ending is even bad as I was expecting it to be as it seems for all the other episodes. The movie was just awful, I couldn't even believe that I lost so many characters! And the ending was really terrible, too many characters are killed and we've seen them just in the first episode (and even the last one) but the ending gave me a little bit of closure. Even the ending scene where the people in the forest are killed is pretty neat, but I'm not really sure why, or why anyone can ever think that such a thing will ever happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise is a clever joke which has been pretty much ruined by the horrible movie of its current status. I am not a fan of this kind of nonsense, and the plot is a complete waste. Even the movie's lead was so pathetic that I would never pay money for this.  But this movie is pretty good, if you're into jokes. If you're not one of those stupid jokes, this movie will be terrible to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie, but it just doesn't go for me. I am surprised it is so low-rated as to say that it's worthwhile. The acting is awful, the music is bad, and the story is terrible. But if you get to know a little bit of the story and you find out that you like movies like this or like the characters, you are sure it is OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the most predictable story line in the world - the two friends start a relationship with the same guys who make up a 'Bondaged' (?) relationship between their partners and a mysterious woman. And then the whole thing goes... Well, let's see. Oh, I guess, one of the guys is an old girl, the other one is a married, and the other... well, that's it. When the guy shows up at the hotel, we have to see the two new partners, and see how the two of them act together (which isn't terribly convincing). And it's too long before the two partners start hitting each other in the street. It's a bad joke to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a pair of twins who, after having a traumatic childhood experience, develop a murderous and murderous reputation. The other pair, played by Ryan Keeling and Jay Andrews, are not a sympathetic and sympathetic characters. They're both bad actors but they never really show much depth or character growth. The movie lacks any sense of purpose, even the title. Even with the "fuse" the title, it's not as much as I expected from "Murder" or even from "Bully".  I was so disappointed after seeing this movie. What it was about was the fact that they were trying to connect the dots and "satisfaction" to this movie--that their murderous and violent parents had it in them when they met them--and that the main villain (the twins) had in them something like a violent and murderous mother. There's nothing I would have wanted more from the film: a villain with some sort of connection to the murder victim. I didn't feel sorry for Ryan Keel, the actor who plays this role. He was just trying to make a movie that was so bad that it could not even pass to be filmed in front of an actual murderer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A mediocre effort, but it is still a bad film: a lot of things we didn't care for and only one thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised when I first saw this film after seeing a movie: The acting was very bad, a very boring story. The setting wasn't good, the cinematography was bad, the acting wasn't that great either. It just felt like they had no idea what they were creating and the storyline seemed to drag on, but the final conclusion of this film seemed to be totally meaningless. It didn't really help that it was a very, very bad movie.  The plot seemed to take a lot of time, but at least the plot seemed interesting enough to keep watching. But what happened? The director decided to get rid of this movie, so we don't have any more excuses to watch it, although you can bet they wouldn't get an Emmy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible waste of time, even for a cheap horror film. There are a lot of "plot" and some great jokes but the lack of quality means the story becomes just an uninteresting "horror movie" with a very poorly filmed score. While there are some pretty interesting characters and some really amusing twists (all that would be missing most of the fun) none of them are properly drawn.   Avoid this one at all costs. I would watch something more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had some of the worst plot I have ever seen. I didn't even think that was true. The first thing I said was that the characters in the movie was very dull. The second thing was that they were very predictable and the ending didn't help a good story. The third thing was the acting. The acting was terrible, the characters were unbelievable and the script was terrible. If you are looking for a good movie, you would be doing a lot better by seeing this horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is completely uninteresting. No storyline. No character developments. The only redeeming feature of this film is the actors. The performances are flat, predictable, and not convincing. A little movie: I won't make a negative comment about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You've seen a horror flick. If you've seen the previous film, you know what to expect. But if you've never seen it, it will be hard to determine. This film is really quite sad. I have seen the trailers and reviews, but I've never quite the same response. I don't think this film could have been anything like the previous. The biggest reason I don;t see this movie is because it doesn't make a lot of sense. For example, when it was released, I thought it was a funny movie, but it really just was a sad, sad joke. And since it was made, I just couldn't believe that it was just a joke. This is really bad. If there's ever an effort to put out films that don't make any sense, I would take it to the big studios and make them weep. I would like to see this film's writer and director come to me and explain to me why these jokes should never make sense. I'm afraid they would laugh at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film on a random channel and got some of the action bits in my eyes. But I was disappointed in what the acting was. Some of the scenes are simply a scene of a piece of trash. Some actors actually get better lines. Other scenes are not good either, they just plain boring and stupid. The plot has some good jokes, but it's just too boring. And I had no idea what the storyline of this movie is. I'm not really a fan of plot, but I just didn't care at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, what is the story? I'll never get tired of the stupid movies with silly plot and unbelievable camera shots and unbelievable special effects. What do we expect from a film like this? If I have to ask you, the plot was very weak. Not only one person was killed in a shoot, but another was brutally killed by some strange killer. This made me wonder if they really wanted to kill him or just some other person. When did they make this film? It's just not true to life.  This movie was completely overrated and completely made up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a couple with nothing else in life but a car. What makes the film interesting are the terrible acting and the bad storyline that arises from the couple's love and their stupid car. I can't say that this movie is bad by itself, but it's pretty bad. The plot is the weak-to-good part. There is an ending that makes it appear that the two are together and that they decide to be married as their cars are in the garage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie was really awful and just about the worst type of movie i have seen so far. It had an extremely annoying, extremely over-acted and completely unfunny-gambling-story-line-plot that is completely unnecessary to the movie, and unfortunately not believable. I thought the movie was just as bad as "Tetris"--a much better movie with a more dramatic and well-executed plot--or "I'll Have to Test My Brain"!--a better movie that was a lot better.  However, there is a small part of me that feels sorry about this terrible movie. In the end, the movie did give me a chance to try and enjoy it--it was at least an enjoyable one. But the rest of me hates this movie and its weak story and I'm really glad that it's just one thing on a very small list. I'm sure it will improve after some time. I have no expectations for this movie--I can only hope that it will not affect any of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the review and comments, I decided to watch the film and I was not impressed by this piece of crap. I mean, they used a few words to describe a girl, but they used WAY over 1000 words to explain the girl's personality and actions that are completely meaningless, and the sex scene is the only thing that impresses.  There is no plot and nothing new, just a typical 'Loud and sexy' movie, without any real plot and acting whatsoever. It is very disappointing because you can't even see the characters. They were just placed there in a room, and we didn't even hear what they were talking to. It all just seems like a piece of trash. They put more money into this film than the actual people that portrayed it, making the film look like a normal one. It also isn't funny, which is the main reason I gave this film a 10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has absolutely nothing to recommend, and is more than a waste of one of my 30 minutes of brain matter. Avoid like this film at all costs. Please don't even watch this film. You can watch another movie in a couple hours, and you will like it better than this one. But if you don't, then at least be careful. I have seen many movies that contain this sort of movie, and I'm not going to expect you to watch The Expendables, or The Expenderes, but you can at least expect to see this one fail at a little more than half of the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film on a 2nd day and didn't care about it at all. It wasn't terribly good but there were some good scenes but really were just too little for my liking. They had a lot of good stuff but they just felt like they were wasting the time. There wasn't any good story lines, or anything like a real story that made me stay interested. The story lines were just a handful of poor actors in a bad script.  I won't mention the sex scenes but that was really the best part of the film. I didn't see any real connection between the two main characters which made me like their relationship to me even less.  My overall rating is 1/10 for this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a very predictable plot that revolves around a group of people being trapped in a cave and being forced to kill everyone they could possibly have killed. Then it is about a couple of characters who are sent to the camp and discover the others being killed, not in a manner that will be consistent. I guess it's intended to be a movie with some interesting visuals but that isn't what it is. The acting is very poorly done and the story is really just a hulking pile of bad plotlines.  The film has some good sets and photography, but unfortunately it doesn't really deliver any real action.  If you are really interested in this type of movie, you'll be disappointed with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the equivalent to "Flamenjau" (aka "Zojo") from "The Karach Legend".  As I say, the plot is bad, the fight scenes are poorly done, and the film is basically a comedy-adventure film with very little actual plot or character development.  The film starts off with a few scenes where the main character (Dolphah) is having his girlfriend (Anabie). That couple really sells their relationship, so they decide to break it off with their friends (or friends) to start a family with their new partners. That is not the main point, but I have to mention it because the scene where Anabie meets her is just about as bad as the rest of the movie.  After about a couple dozen minutes the movie finally starts to get interesting. But, when it's over, the story gets completely lost. At least you can say the sex is happening. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie follows the plot of a small Italian family that has fallen apart. There's a mysterious girl with an accent and some strange special abilities. Her father kills the family and kidnaps everyone and their lives are completely meaningless. What can we expect when we see that? What does this girl do? What do we do when we're sent on an adventure to see the other girl? The movie leaves us all blind to her whereabouts and to her purpose in life. The woman kills the girl and leaves her to die, but we never learn what happened. She's never shown anything that we can't figure out. The end is a pile of dead bodies. I'm sure it's not in a vacuum. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is only to my taste and not to my enjoyment. I was just about to rent it for a rental and I was only halfway there. I think you just get a laugh and have fun when you are bored. if you want some entertainment, you will not find it here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie features a cast who are all very unsuitable. While the dialog is funny, it is horribly inconsistent. There is a movie which depicts every female with a body, but it would have been different if they had done their part in other roles in a movie: The acting here is simply bad. I'd much rather see an adventure with a group of real men (or real men) than have a female as the lead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so terrible and poorly written that it actually resembles a movie from the seventies (not "classic", but certainly not a "classic" one). At the beginning of the film you're wondering why they've gotten the rights to use their old formula and film a few actors from The Wizard and The Wizard to try to make it seem more like a movie: is there some kind of plot and special effects left behind in The Wizard? In case that's not true, then let me get it. The Wizard is basically just about making it seem like a series of jokes and running a few little pranks on a group of teenagers. Not great.  I gave this film an 8 and only 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie looks like a very old "B" film, and the plot has gotten more and more obscure with each subsequent attempt. There are two guys who have been kicked by the Mafia and were given the choice of a criminal, a gangster, or a drug dealer. Only the gangster chooses a gang. Now the guy that gets picked has a tattoo on his forehead. The other guys then have tattoos on their heads, and can't be considered gangsters. The movie tries to build up its mystery and get into some deep psychological detail, but has nothing to recommend. The only good part of this movie is the big supporting cast. In that regard, the lack of the movie's supporting cast is a big disappointment.  I will admit, there are some clever twists and some clever humor that were included, but the overall feeling of the film was really weak. Not only that, but it's really too bad that the script and direction are so badly written and directed. A better approach would be to use a different script and make the movie a more dramatic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not much better than a horror movie, where a lot of actors (and the same mediocre talent of a typical horror director) were dithered with plot and special effects only to deliver mediocre performances.  In my opinion, the entire film is an example of the same sort of "horror movie" (that is, one directed by a person who lacks the ability to develop the story to an adequate level) that has been created only with cheap horror effects and a lot more questionable actors (that just happens to be a major failure in the movie.) While watching this film, I began to see that it was a bit better when the movie was released. However, it becomes more difficult and disappointing as the plot goes on.  The first thing I said was that the plot was badly conceived. I thought they should have waited until they got the plot in shape. They wasted so much time. The second thing is that the acting (the worst actors in the film) is just flat. I'm sorry to admit that the movie is quite slow. That is not the fault of the filmmakers. As a horror fan, I couldn't care for the acting, but the plot is too convoluted.  That is the only thing that was supposed to attract me. As it was, I was disappointed to find that it couldn't stand any more.  It can't have helped that the director made a very good film and it is impossible to understand anything except for the script. The film only gets slightly interesting once the plot starts. Once the plot really started playing, the film slowly gets boring and gets a little too convoluted, but at least it's not completely stupid.  So, what to do? If a movie is not stupid, then it isn't interesting. It isn't very good either because it contains only some elements, but it contains nothing that really matters. The acting is OK, but not good enough to make it interesting.  For example, I'd give this film a 8.6 (or 7.7 if I want a little more). The story is pretty good and it has a decent beginning. But the acting is far too much of a badness and the cinematography is totally poor.  Also, the cinematography is bad. While the idea is good, the lighting is poor. I wouldn't want to be confused about that and I have only gotten a brief glance of the camera movements in the screen. I'll give this movie 4
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that bad, but not worth seeing in this movie, even though it does have a slightly entertaining ending. The biggest flaw in this film is its title and the storyline itself. The movie isn't about the love-filled, heart-pounding, epic romance, romantic drama, but rather its about something more like the usual, dumb, predictable, uninteresting (and boring) story. For example, the "soulful" story of the movie (the two guys who want to get back to their time) is only about a couple of dumb teenagers. They can't act this way, with nothing interesting to them, and the story is very predictable, and it's very slow.  This is the only reason I can recommend not seeing this movie: the ending. It's a depressing title, not exactly memorable, and there are too many characters that don't make much sense for the main characters.   The only real redeeming factor in this title is the beautiful opening and closing scenes. It really brings down the tension of the whole movie, and I don't recommend watching this movie for that purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was one of the last people who knew about this movie. It is all too predictable and very much, unfortunately, one of my favorites. The acting is awful, the direction is poor, the ending is bad, but it's also pretty good.  I rented the movie only because it was free. I'm hoping to get to the next installment when I'm next in line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this film a few times over, and with no knowledge of the language it's just a really awful piece of trash...I found it absolutely unacceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What do I really think of this movie?  As a viewer, I just knew they'd never be a good movie. The story was lame, and the camera wasn't moving enough to give me a clue. While this movie is obviously about a teenage girl who has a crush on some boy, you're still left wondering why these people aren't trying to find a relationship. Maybe the writer had seen a movie like this, and knew there was nothing to be afraid about? Maybe the other woman was the one who killed herself?  After I was done with this movie, I had to find out how it was going to look. I couldn't find any indication that this movie was a spoof. I thought it was a waste of time, and after having made the purchase, I decided that I'd rather buy one and watch this than watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a stupid film that requires the viewer to sit through 30 minutes of it without any real feeling of a story. I mean the story is completely pointless. This is simply the worst movie I have ever seen. The characters are horrible, the plot is unbelievable, it's completely empty. I will give this one an 8, I'll even throw out my own DVD, but if you're a serious film lover who has already seen this one and already loves it, you will probably not miss it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a piece of crap does this movie claim to be? And what the hell does it take in a couple of months to put such as small budget (that is, less than $2 million) and a cast that is mostly complete garbage (which is true, I suppose) to make it such a bad film? The fact that this piece of film was made in less than 7 hours, and with less than 50 minutes of shooting (and some of the best talent in the movie itself) makes me wonder why it was shot in just 5 or 6 hours? And the whole thing is a piece piece of bad film, with an overbearing and sickening story. If this movie is made for a good story, then it needs a better ending. There is a lot more material to be made. It should be a better production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A man, a psychologist who has a penchant for "slash", and with an ability to find girls who can help him, meets a couple who "guests" them and begins to do business with them. A few years later, he falls into some strange new business with some very strange business partners. When he realizes that this new business is in the hands of a woman who he knows nothing about, he begins to "slasher" them. But things only get a little better as he and the "guest" get to know each other.  The man's girlfriend does not know how to help.  This movie was only slightly enjoyable, but this is a bad sign of a movie: It contains no suspense and no "whack" the scene when I heard my boyfriend and the woman are in the same room, which would be much better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I find myself so disappointed with the fact that I was so sucked into this film in my life. I'm not sure how to get started, but I was forced to watch it again just because I didn't like the first time.  I watched it again because of the fact the cast was in an overrated film with bad actors and bad writing. I can't believe that the casting of these actors was so bad, and I don't understand why.  This movie was pretty bad, so bad that I felt the need to watch the entire film, because I know my friends can't take it as well as they did. I feel like I've just been forced to wait to finish it to see if I liked it or not.  What really surprised me was the way the movie came out with a bunch of new and unfressed women. In real life, there are a lot of men, not women, in the world, who want to be with men and see how they are treated. This movie showed that many of the women that this movie was so stupid and just for show, as many movies with great actors tend to do. But the women in this movie were not treated that way. They just got more jobs, more money, with much more money than anyone else could have gotten. They didn't have much, not like this movie did.  When it came out, I immediately couldn't care any more about the movie. The idea that these people could get to work at the end of their lives is just plain stupid. I think they made a point in showing that these women should have a chance to get paid well. Why do we have to pay for it? What purpose? Is there a point to show that these female employees didn't get paid and the film had a lot more money to pay it. It was just stupid.  The only redeeming quality of the film was the special effects and the music. I was looking at the credits and the last thing that was shown was "The movie that starts now". I felt really stupid after watching it. I thought that this could be a much better movie if it wasn't the acting but it was still a pretty bad one.  Bottom Line: Bad movie: No redeeming qualities. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Devil Wears Dreams" (I won't see the movie because I can't wait until I see this movie again...I mean it's still in "The Hills"...) is not scary, and it's not interesting. It is an anti-femmeadea movie made by a bunch of drunk college students who are trying to pass out of the college because they can't get to college for a lot of reasons, and they need to make fun. For example, let's assume the main character is from one college campus. This college is called "University of the East", and you can see it's campus (it's about a campus in a town called "Pittsburg State") in "Witcher" for starters. The main character (his wife) goes to this college, meets some friends, and starts thinking of buying a new home. When it comes to the final choice, he picks a good movie: a movie that tells you all about "the devil," and tells you that the devil is a real person. This movie is horrible. The only good thing is the first scene when he's looking at a good painting, and we hear that the painting is in the bathroom that he is looking at. That's a great moment. The next scene when we see the painting and see it, is horrible and it is painful. The girl is in a dirty hospital bed with a bloody band around her throat (something like a band around the neck) and there is some dancing girls around that has been used for a few years. The scenes are awful. And I can honestly say, that the movie was one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. This is not like a movie made for children, like "The Chronicles of Hope" or something like "Jelly" or "Little Miss Candy". This movie was horrible, even for a mediocre movie. It wasn't even interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a world where we can only hope that something like this can just happen at some point, it seems to be impossible. The movie is a generic piece of melodrama with no depth whatsoever; a movie that only works because the people involved are actually "sneaky". What was interesting is the fact that the characters were actually dead inside; the idea is to find out that they've had some sort of soul in the past. As an example, you get some sort, vague story to progress the plot, but the movie then spends the entire movie trying to trick you into believing that the person in question is "the person that killed them".  I don't have the feeling that the acting is very bad (except for the lead, the "fascine"); some might see a movie like this and assume that the actors should get some work back for that. However, there are so many awful things you just don't want to see. At some point I had a hope that the film would be a satire, but I didn't really see that it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie follows the classic idea of a male hero of a movie to be "hero" in order to get "in to heaven". The other aspects of the story were extremely predictable and the movie had the feeling of being a very cheap movie. In my opinion it was the worst "movie I have ever seen" in the world. Even the way they did the scenes wasn't very interesting.  The plot was not convincing.  Also, the characters were just plain boring. A couple of characters, including the hero, got extremely annoying.  Bottom-line is that they were totally unrealistic, even for a boy hero with a really good story to tell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was very disappointing in it's way of making a horror film but at the same time it was very boring and not scary enough. Most of the actors seem like they were just doing their jobs, such as making a movie about a mad scientist who turns into a monster, a zombie in a body suit, and an alien.  The main problem is that it is way too slow and can't quite get a decent plot. The most memorable moments are those of a zombie crawling through a sewer when its stomach is full of its stomach contents and when its blood falls in a pile of gore. When you're watching this film I hope to see more intelligent horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm the only person who was really disgusted with this film. The film had a good ending and in fact it was funny. But, the story was weak and the characters were dull.  If you didn't like one of those jokes in the beginning, then you didn had to find out the other ones.   A lot of people seem to think that this is a comedy, but there's something else that is more important.  The fact that it's so bad is pretty funny, but it's not really funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is quite predictable and has an extremely weak performance, which was made even worse by the fact that the main character is portrayed by a black actress. The fact that this movie was made in 2006 was quite disappointing. The script is extremely weak, and the whole thing relies on a stupid character by the title of "Goddard's Monster" (the very boring movie which has about ten minutes of screen time devoted to the movie title). This is also bad since it doesn't bother me in anyway since I saw it twice and was satisfied by it in that way. The acting is incredibly bad, even more than usual in most of these big blockbuster (not including the film remake with the main girl having a red skin and a white skin). The plot lacks all of the charm which usually comes with movies made to appear interesting, and even the movie itself can be difficult to comprehend.    Overall, a bad film: the characters were awful and the movie is probably not for someone like myself, since the original and the remake are both good. But, the original is probably better than the remake. The remake was obviously badly developed and filmed badly. The movie was the same, but not much better. It was very predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was like watching some of the worst "American films" ever made. It didn't make sense as a movie but it made sense for no reason.  A documentary would better portray the true face of a nation. I'm not going to get too deep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never got to watch this movie. In fact, I'm not sure what I could even say.  If you can even be satisfied to sit through it, you will be left completely sick with a stomach so sore that your brain will literally crack up on you.  The movie is about a man who kills his girlfriend, and then has to keep her breathing to make sure the baby dies. His parents decide to bury her, but that's not an end-of-the-day movie, but instead one of several episodes of a stupid movie that shows how bad it gets to make your own choice in the end. It's really sad that there is so little suspense in this movie, and the only thing that really manages to scare you is the little girl, but you don't have much time to keep checking out the details of the plot.   At first I thought this was a movie for children, but it got so bad so quickly. I decided to just give this a "7" because it was something I could actually watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible. I thought I would probably see a documentary on the rise of Asian people in the US. It was no better than other horrible movies of the past. I didn't even get that far into it. When the actors did have it down, they didn't have any action. There were only a few scenes where the characters spoke, so as if that had to be some type of action. I'm surprised to see this movie at all. I don't recommend it at all, and I hope you didn't get any money, because it's the most awful film I've ever seen. It's not even worthy of being considered an action flick. It may be an amusing way to see some Asian people play some of the characters, but you won't find a whole lot of interesting characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a movie from a '80's sitcom. Except the "comedies" part is funny, but the rest of it is just awful. We watched it on cable a few years ago and was glad to see that the producers had gotten better. Then, the rest became a really bad mess. It's no longer funny. Some of the characters are good and some of the acting is good, but it's not enough for them to make it funny. We have seen better comedies.   If you want to make a comedy, watch "Fitzgöt" instead of this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I can't blame this film for the fact that it stars "The Little Princess" and "The Prince" (well, at least the latter of those two!). While "The Princess" is about a "lobbing" princess, "The Princes" is instead about a bunch of guys who love a little princess who tries to keep her eyes off. This is a terrible film, which I've seen countless times before, but it's still fun to watch it. Unfortunately, the acting is quite bad. The Prince, for example, is a little bit too on the nose and has very little in common with his two sisters, "Cinella" and 'Princes', respectively.  The princess is a sort of "crocky" princess who is obsessed with "Achimmy". That is, apparently, what she was supposed to be. She has a lot of sex and a "distant" father who doesn't want her to marry the Prince. She gets a boyfriend who lives in another town and has a penchant for her hair, but her husband won't have sex with her. There is no connection between her and him, and even her family isn't exactly supportive.  Her father then comes to the village and tries to seduce the prince to sleep with her, which she does. Then he discovers she's a real woman and decides to turn her off, so she has to sleep in her room. When they sleep together, she discovers she wants to sleep around with the prince, and her father agrees that she's just one more prostitute.  There is a very long period where the Prince and Princess both sleep together in the room with the other girl. In the end, she dies and it is only then that she decides to sleep alone in a cave.   The Prince's girlfriend, "Aria", is also pretty bad, too. The girl is too hot to be the girl he's in love with, because the prince is usually an immature type. I guess that is a reason why she's in bed with him, because there's nothing for her to do in this movie. She's in an impulsive mood. She seems to be making up a lot more than she has sex with the Prince!  The rest of the movie is about her having a bunch on the same bed, and she is in a relationship with the Duke, but I doubt if she is interested in him.  It's so bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst of the worst, I mean... I've seen this film 10 times, and it's only made 3 times, i never get up for it!  It's just a boring film about an old lady and a young boy, neither of them are cute or interesting or even cute, but they seem really stupid, this doesn't even have any suspense, and you can see it's like some piece of junk that doesn't get up the courage to fight the evil boss. I guess you can also see some scenes where you see these boys running into the hills, you don't know why they're running into hills anyway. I just can't believe they are making movies for people who are obviously, that is for the most part, dumb. I wish I would've gone and seen the more funny films they made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into the movie expecting a pretty good comedy, I don't want to see another one but I don`t care too much about movies in that sense and this is a bad one. The plot is pretty basic but it lacks drama and it doesn`t have any good characters. The ending was also completely lacking. It is about a crazy rich guy who dies after a woman comes to help him with the money he`s owed but she never really gets to go on that. The funny part is that the guy has a girlfriend and they`ll try to keep it together. They are both rich and stupid but then he`ll be with the really rich guy that pays him for everything! The only funny part was his wife, he`ve moved into a new house and got a bunch of people that are not his wife but instead only their friends and he`t wanted to spend his time with her so he did. He`ve also got some kids in with him but they all get into trouble and soon he has a bunch more children. But it seems like they all turn out to be insane and we only see them in the next movie as losers. But there are people who actually manage to keep on living and do a pretty decent job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of it in this film. If the plot is there, it is weak. I think it's a joke. Maybe it was supposed to be the end of a movie, but I think, if that happens, it isn't. This movie is so bad that I think the makers are so tired that they can only make it look good with a few minutes of "plot". They're just not talented enough to make movies like this. This is really terrible for the entertainment of watching something like this in a movie theater.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just a waste of time and a poor attempt at a "Shocking comedy." The plot is weak, the acting is awful, the special effects are terrible and it is only good when the camera is on and it doesn't look like a horror film.  What a good idea this is. The story, which should have been treated like a normal feature film, has just been dragged along to some extent.   There are some interesting elements that are added to the film, but unfortunately these are just too little and aren't able to stand out as films of the horror genre.  If you are looking for a comedy film, it would have been a bit more entertaining to do something like this. If you're really looking for the laugh, you would have enjoyed "Screwkake!" and this would be a much better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is about a "movie" of a zombie movie that is nothing more than a waste of its title.  This movie was made to make you laugh at the ridiculousness of zombie movies, and it didn't. Not only did I fail to find the jokes, but the movie was so boring that you wished you would have a life with it. This movie is about an elderly man who spends his time pretending to die while trying to build an underground tomb for his wife, but nothing else, other than his wife and his daughter, appear in the movie. If you enjoy horror movies, you won't find anything to be afraid of.  I was looking for a zombie film that was fun and entertaining, but I couldn't locate it. At least the movie wasn't terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing I can say in this film is that it tries to be a film about the future of humanity rather than about one's own lives, which just doesn't make sense.  But I won't really see it as a film. It isn't really that it doesn't exist - just the way the world works. So, I won see it more as a work of horror rather than a film for the most naive of people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't even a documentary. The idea is that people in the region have been watching the documentary so they don't know how we got it. It is the same for the fact that it is nothing short of an insult to the region that is the best region in the world (by the way that's a lie I've never met anyone who loves the area, but I think you could probably know more about the people in it than you know about the area itself). There are some pretty interesting stories in the local area, and it's just not enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the movie when I was a teen. But now that it doesn't work. How do you find someone to "explain" that? The movie was just an excuse to try to scare you out. It didn't even give any plot, the story was too simplistic.  The movie had some of the best scenes ever but the plot was really awful. The guy who was the father, who was a big fan of "The Lord of the Rings" wasn't really evil or something that would help the kids. He was just annoying and seemed like a buff guy at times.  I wish the movie would have come out in the 1950s instead of the 90's. At least I think it would have helped to keep the audience guessing. I didn't understand what was going on. I can't blame the parents for letting their kids see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the subtitle says, the only thing worth saving here is the story. The movie isn't that good, but it's not bad. So I decided to check it out and see if it was worth watching. I didn't. After watching it, I felt sorry to say so. I mean, there's a lot of story. I would like it more than anything, but there isn't much.  What happens is a little girl on the beach in a bikini, which is a real waste of time.  The ending is just boring and not really anything special.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was really horrible. It really had no story in it, the main characters, they even were bad(the man in the car), the characters were not even the best they had to be. Some great acting was done in some of the scenes, but this movie was all too boring and made the audience think, oh my god I couldn't believe the guy was really crazy!! All in all this movie is horrible. I have been looking for this movie since it's almost 10 years old, but I can't just wait forever to see it. Even the first scenes are not so great, I'll have to pay for this one to rent. I'm just kidding, but it's good that they used this movie to advertise! That's what I'm thinking. Oh so the movie had some good actors in it. Maybe some better actors and directors, I say, if they had a plot I'd give them some credit for this. I would have never laughed at this movie. Maybe they were a little confused or maybe they didn't take that well in the movie, but they didn`t have much in the way of acting. I don't think they had that much talent in this movie, as I've seen most of these movies, and I'm surprised they hired people like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I got into the movie with my wife. I thought it would be a really interesting movie if I got to watch it and see what would happen. However, the film only ends with one guy in a car, driving the car, talking about a good movie.  After about an hour of that I thought that it was going to be a good film. However the ending was a bit disappointing.  In the end you're left with a bad plot. I was expecting something more interesting and interesting. Unfortunately, the ending wasn't very interesting. In the case, what was interesting was the movie itself.  I wouldn't buy this movie. It was a waste of money, but it just had one thing going for it. The only good thing was the dialogs. But if you read the movie like it was, you won't really appreciate the dialog. It's very annoying that the main character has no clue what's happening. It wasn't even the plot that was supposed to be the plot. It didn't even make much sense.   You might get a few hours of fun watching it but you will get bored and will have no idea what you're doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting this movie to be great, but the fact that I got to watch it made me mad. It is so bad, but with the high stakes on top of the story and some great acting from Michael Keaton, I couldn't believe the story. If you're gonna watch this movie then you need to be prepared for a boring 2 hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. There was a lot of pointless situations. There were a few great scenes but most of it was extremely uninteresting and just plain old-fashioned low-grade junk. I was really hoping it would have at least a few more interesting scenes, or at least one that would be interesting enough to warrant the film itself. I guess I'll just be lucky that one of the actors who was supposed to have starred in this movie survived the casting process. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm looking for something different, and unfortunately this one wasn't even interesting. I think that the movie had so much potential. But, the plot had some pretty good points. If they had the right concept, I would have liked to see it. I really felt that the plot was slow, and the acting wasn't much good. I'm not saying that this is bad in itself, but the fact that the action wasn't done that way is disappointing. It's disappointing not because of the idea of "action", but because of acting. The acting could have been better had it been real.  I'll admit that I was interested to see the storyline. To see more of the characters, but unfortunately nothing that happened. It might have been interesting, but that was a shame because the movie didn't go that far. The only thing that got better in this movie was the casting. I wish I had seen the acting for myself. That was the only reason I kept watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was just an excuse to rent it on DVD. If it was a real movie, it would be a real story with a beginning and ending. But that doesn't happen. I am afraid this is not a serious movie. I didn't even think it was remotely worth a rental. I don't even have the intention of renting. The actors, the director and the writers don't have a clue what it was they were trying to do, unless it was just a cheap, pretentious story. A movie has to be something more. My main concern was the idea of a "noir" and a "somorca" (as many reviewers claim) as the protagonist of the movie. If a person was a "tiger", there would be no need of a story to "satisfy" viewers of this idea. So if the writer wanted to make this film as a joke, he must have known a lot more about the subject than he had stated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have written a negative reaction to this movie, in the hopes that it will have a positive review. This movie is an insult to the world of pop culture. In fact, I think this is the worst piece of film history I have ever seen. In this movie I had tears running down my throat as I read it. It is extremely predictable, and it does not make the most of the best.  This movie contains all of the wrong things you will see in your lifetime. I don't think that is an accident, and I hope to find out if it was. This is one of the worst movies ever produced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely awful. I tried very hard to find this movie. I am a very serious collector of horror films and I found this movie on video store shelves. I was sure that this movie was supposed to be a horror movie, but I don't think I understood the plot.  The ending seemed to be as predictable as the movie itself. The dialog was bad, the special effects were poor. The story had no suspense. I would have been willing to watch it if the plot was good. But it wasn't. I can't believe this movie is a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to think there is a kind of magic in magic. If you want to see magic, you have to have at least two hands and a leg. However, this film tries too hard to find magic in this flick. I do believe that this would have worked if it was made a little longer, but I understand there is something special in the magic and there must be some kind of "magic" that can't be found. I am surprised this was done in a movie. The story is terrible. I have a lot of respect for the film because it is decent, but the magic is weak. I felt like the story didn't go anywhere. There is absolutely nothing happening in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My biggest regret with this movie is the casting of the entire cast. Some actors you are never expecting to have to pay anything like money for. I was pretty sure it was just the best of the kind, but unfortunately for some actors it just wasn't. They were such terrible performances that it felt like I was the least experienced of them. Not even the acting of the best actors in the world were good enough to warrant the pay. I think I may have to do a bit of research now and a bit less of a search for this movie so as I was expecting the most talented actors to be cast in this film. If you find a good movie: be very careful. It will be hard to find a bad one. If it does get released, please don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was just a stupid, dumb piece of garbage on the television.  This episode of "Law and Justice" was probably the worst I've seen this year. I didn't like the premise, didn't enjoy the ending, but just couldn't buy it when I saw it on TV. I thought this was an excuse for the lack of quality in the rest of this series. The acting wasn't bad but the script wasn't very good either, so I was looking for something better. I wanted to rent another one when it was available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's really disappointing to see a movie where the actors are such terrible and incompetent characters that there is no substance to make this movie. This is obviously the result of something more like the people who made it. Unfortunately, this is not one of the films that has gotten the biggest ratings. If you like a real film, this would be a good one - just don't waste your time watching this movie.... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just shows the plot of a movie about an amateur film director, who thinks he can make a good film about the events of the movie. Well, he has some pretty good ideas, but unfortunately he thinks it's all about a bunch of old guys with some bad, old guy with bad taste, so it's not going to be a film with much value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible film. There's some sort of pretending plot lines, but it's very difficult to tell where they belong. And the cast is pretty poor. Even the actors who played in the show seemed to be a complete joke. The plot was too absurd.  I mean, it wasn't even remotely funny. It wasn't funny at all. I was scared, for example, that the director might ruin the film. He just couldn't stop making scenes that obviously were meant to be funny and I can't blame that.  Oh, and it also showed that everyone in the cast had a major flaw. I mean the guys that actually played were actually stupid. The acting was absolutely terrible. It's very hard to make someone look like this in real life, and I think there is a reason why this show only had so much as a cameo.  The last thing I can say is that if you watch it you are gonna have a little bit of fun. Maybe if you really liked the show, you'll like it. But if you didn't then don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem of writing a film is that you can be fooled.  The characters are flat and the story is terrible.   It should be fun to read, but it isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was bad because it doesn't know who the best girl was. It's the typical low budget movie where the writer and director are playing out of a straw. The characters are horrible. The scenes are horrible even though they don't have the best actors for them. It is difficult to believe that a movie where so many bad actors was made and released is actually pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As the movie had so many scenes, it couldn't have been much more annoying than the characters. The script was so far from being a true-film or even a documentary in the eyes of the writers, that it didn't really fit in any way.  Most of the movie (like the "document") consisted of a few dialogs, while the actual documentary was only a few minutes long. In the end, it just felt like we were watching something that wasn't supposed to be a documentary or a documentary.  If you're interested in a documentary that doesn't fit in the "movie world", watch the video in a vacuum. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first part of this movie was pretty good, with some great performances. But the end of the movie is really disappointing, with little plot, plot development and a disappointing ending. The only reason I'm giving this rating is that it is a bad rip-off of a documentary. It is so bad that even a movie with similar plot and story is more interesting than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a short but hilarious scene in which the man and woman try to fight each other, but just like the last time they fought each other in this movie, she and the man kill each other. It doesn't matter, I just couldn't take it out. The camera was bad, especially the scenes in the first few minutes were so bad. I had to sit on my couch, thinking I was going to see some action scenes.  Just like the first time they battled each other and killed each other at this movie. Now, let's see if the man won in the end or the woman would be the better thing.  The plot was pretty good with the guy and the girl fighting each other (as I remember) but the fight scenes weren't as impressive as the two previous ones. I'm sure those scenes were better because the characters weren't in one of those scenes at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented the movie with the hopes of a decent, funny movie but I was disappointed. I kept watching the entire film to the end and I didn't even laugh once. The acting wasn't great but the writing was bad. The most annoying thing was the actors. The movie would have been interesting if they had done something in their lives like they did in the rest of the movie. They don't speak like they do in the series, there is only one one guy, one guy's mother is married to them so they have a few extra lines and they use the whole "I wish your children to be my children" line to show how they felt. That line seems like it has happened in every other movie. When they made their movie in 1999, I thought that would be hilarious to see all of the actors in the movie (unless they were acting in a totally different movie) and it wouldn't be that awkward to see the "B" in their mouths. The story is really just about how it was made in the first place and I can't really see why it could have been that awkward. I would have thought there would have at least been a story that was interesting. The biggest shock was the story's ending. The ending is really terrible, so I can forgive it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have read several movie reviews about this film and I have decided to give this one a chance, even though I am not sure how. I give this movie the Worst rating I have ever given to a movie. It's not good, and it's pretty bad. This is a complete waste of time and money for a film set in England. If the movie stars a famous or famous actor like Edward or Jane or whoever, please keep your eyes open and do your best to rent the movie so we can see it at the proper level. I think we can't all agree with this film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie, but unfortunately it's very bad. I don't have any interest in making it. Even if I enjoyed it, it would be bad to see this movie. I think there are many flaws in the movie that make this a bad film - the plot is poorly put, the characters are boring and the story is dull - it's just about the end of the movie. The cinematography is also quite poor and I can't seem to figure out what's going on. Even though it's a really good movie, this is too much to keep watching. The ending is too predictable. The actors seem like they were the "pilot of the film", but it's unclear why this happened in the first place. I would recommend going out and buying it if it's worth something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, this is an absolutely horrible film. I didn't even watch the first one because I didnít realize it was as bad as it looked. But the acting was good on those previous films.  But what was in "Dance With The Devil?" There was the part where the movie had a man who used to have sex with a woman. How would that be possible to be a real movie? And when did this man find it? What about the other part where it is said that the real life model is in a park? I donít know if this movie was meant to have this movie's theme or not.  Well it did with the "Widowers" movie. But this movie didní�t. It was only a part of "The Devil." And what is this part, a little girl. The part was so awful that you wonder if it could even make it into a movie. What is the plot?  I'll just give this one 4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason that I have not watched this movie is that it did not make me sit in front of my computer to watch the ending. The only other reason I didn't watch this film is that I didn''t have any particular interest in it. It was just the most disappointing movie I have ever seen. The plot, with the whole cast of B-T or C, was just bad. I mean, you get B-TS on screen, but B-K is a far different movie. The movie was just one of many stupid situations, and they just did not add any depth or humor. The ending was even worse than the plot. The acting was just horrible, the plot was just stupid. The direction was also just awful, but I thought the entire movie was terrible, it really sucked how the characters in this movie acted. All in all, this movie was awful! It just seemed like a typical B--T movie, with nothing new. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a film that I found to be stupid. It is bad to the end of the plot. The movie had a good ending but it just doesn't really add up in any way, and I don't think it's going to make any real-life value for a movie unless it were a great story. The actors in the movie weren't very good and the whole movie looked like it was shot in a car, not a documentary like "The Wild Life". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the movie over a thousand times, and I can still remember no more than a few lines from it. This movie is terrible, a waste of time, and not really even close to a worthy movie, or even interesting, in its own unique context. What a plot was meant to be is a waste, and the plot is bad, if you care to watch the movie. A man goes off to a town that is a magical, but is caught by some other monsters, and is forced to make some other friends, and then goes into the woods, for an hour, until someone kills him and takes him into custody. Why? How? Well, that's a mystery, I guess. The ending is awful. The idea of a man who has some supernatural powers, and who has to save someone else is pretty good, but the story is pretty horrible. They obviously didn't think of the end, but there is some weird things happening. I mean, there is little dialog, but they must have missed this movie, because they should have done better. If you are really serious, you should watch the end. There's nothing here, except for some weird characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just went to this movie: the movie is lame and completely unbelievable. I can't believe this movie has a director. The scenes are completely over-developed and do not have any character, real actors. Also the story is totally bad, the action is completely unrealistic, and it is really unbelievable. This movie would have been better if it was a movie with a plot, but the story was totally pointless. You might be better if I had bought the movie for a 50 dollars to get a movie: this movie isn't worth your time! I will be sad to see the movie in the cinema but at least this movie had a plot. But sadly this movie was nothing but a waste of time!!! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie that I have seen that made me lose my faith. I mean, is there really no hope or hope for humanity? The ending just makes no sense! I'm sure that it has a small chance of making to make a film that comes out with so much promise but if it did, it would be bad. I am sure that the plot is trying, even if this is the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen a movie like this in an hour. I have since then seen this movie only once, and I have heard nothing else.  If a movie has any potential to succeed, it must include a good story and great acting. If it does not, it does nothing for entertainment, but for every movie "that has a positive message", it is a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is horrible, the dialogs are stupid, and the plot is not nearly as good as the movie is. I was a little concerned that the movie was not as bad as I expected, but I was disappointed and it is a very weak movie. The first three of the six-hour movie were good. The second three were bad. I didn't have much time to wait.  My Rating:  I don't even like to give this movie any more points, because it is just a poor excuse of a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very cheap horror film that has some plot and some interesting aspects. But unfortunately it is very predictable.  It is very hard to predict a horror film. There are very little plot twists and twists, but nothing new and nothing new. This is the reason why it is a very bad film. This movie will probably have a mediocre rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see more of this because the idea was good. The plot is solid but the characters are horrible.  One of the main reasons is because the acting is good but the writing is bad. If we could be a show that was fun and did not include much of the characters in a bad way then I would recommend it for a bunch of jokes but it's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been watching this film for 4 years and nothing has ever been so bad. Now, it is one of the biggest dumbest movies I have seen since. The acting is terrible, the scenery is extremely flat. I thought the ending was good until the very end.   The main reason I didn't recommend this movie is that it was so bad, but I can tell you it was bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, i'm surprised to see how this movie actually was meant to be a horror film but instead it became a slasher horror film of the '80's. I know some people will read this review as 'gross' (well, you might think that) but this was really only intended as a horror flick. When i say it was a horror, i mean the plot and acting were a nightmare. It was really bad to waste this guy's time, all it was is a mess, no story. The acting and the plot were pretty OK and the overall plot is OK but the story was bad...if you had to see this for any reason, then you won't get better from this movie then. I just didn't like it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can only comment on the stupidness of this film: it seems like a true, dumb piece of garbage. I had to stand on my feet when it was time. I felt like I had the time of my life being wasted. I have to assume they had something to do with the film. But they couldn't find one. The ending was really predictable. And what are the guys doing in the film? A guy, a guy, and a guy with a gun?!? If they had wanted to, they would have put the three guys together on a street in a seedy neighborhood in America, and then given them one little family.  I am surprised no one thought of the film when it had its first release.  The best part of this movie is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on the couch, on my couch, in my bath, in an alleyway. The plot is nothing that I can find, but I am pretty sure it is supposed to be some kind of "adventure" on a fictional island of magic, so it was probably intended to be that. But I just couldn't put it together. I don't know why. The first two scenes in the movie are completely confusing and just don't make much sense to me. The "adults" seem to be one of the "people" and the "children" are, well, the "ad adults". The "kids" are just in it for the "good" boys (like the kids in "The Chronicles") and their friends. The whole thing is so stupid, I think there's no time to explain it. Also, you never hear "good guys" in this movie. The kids are just there to make you feel good, but there's something more going on, I guess, and it makes you look like an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not really a fan of movies with this vague plot and the acting was really bad, if not completely unbelievable. The movie could have been a classic action movie but that was too hard due to the horrible acting and the predictable story.  What was interesting though was the ending and the scene where the girl is a little girl, it was so clichéd and the characters acted so badly. What was great was the dialog and the ending was great! If this is a comedy movie with a similar ending, I am sure the movie would be a great one. But, if it is something else, I would consider the movie a waste. Not even comedy at all.  I would give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all, I cannot see it as an effort to put forth the true value of the original. It's simply bad. I can tell that it's a truly miserable film. Not even the best film of its decade, which is the one which was the only reason I saw it. This film is one of the worst films of the early 20th century. While other films of this era are wonderful, "The Living Dead" is just awful, a truly awful film. Even for a short time period in its history, it's just hopeless, and nothing else. If you liked that one, you'd love it, if not then you'd hate it. I've heard it's been so bad in the past that it was considered even more dangerous than its predecessor, and even though that might seem to be the case, it is still only a temporary trend. At times, I've wondered if people actually watched it, but after seeing it, it still seems impossible to see it again. For that reason, I'm afraid that it is simply not worth anyone's time. This is a shame to have to watch it, and certainly not to recommend it to anyone but yourself. The only good thing about this film is the wonderful performance by George N. Robinson. I thought he was one of my favorite characters from "The Walking Dead." But his character was destroyed at least three times in this film, and was completely destroyed at the end of it. If anyone is interested, that's fine. But if you're not, you can't see it, unless you've seen it already. I'm not sure why this movie is ever considered a film worth watching. It was made in 20th Century UK, but I think it was so bad that it just couldn't find any worthwhile comparison. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe they have put this movie in a top spot as their greatest comedy ever. It's a comedy that doesn't do anything except insult and humor, which, I believe, isn't even the point.  The acting is bad and the script is bad.  Overall, I really just can't see how much money was spent in producing this movie.  There is nothing funny. The most important thing about this movie is the premise. Why would anyone put their hopes in this film? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not the best performance in the history of the movie industry. But that's only the part that makes the movie interesting. As a comedy, it isn't interesting. It's just really bad. The acting isn't funny and there's no comedy. The only thing that makes it funny is the "sassy" accents. It doesn't help the movie either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was only the fourth episode I have seen this season. But there are at least 8 episodes that have gone past the half of the "I Believe" plot, and I'm sure there are many more that are just missing from the entire series. (The same may be true for the episode "Dassey Returns," which was the "final" episode of the series).  This show was no fun at all, and was so bad that it was no surprise that it failed to get picked for an episode. It was so, and so bad. I wish I had a better show for my 13-year-old daughter, but even she had to watch at least one episode to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is one of the worst i have seen in my memory of cinema. it was really embarrassing and very hard to watch. i just cannot stand to see anything this movie has to offer but this one is just a complete disappointment. nothing can be worse than this movie. at least i think the director, director Adam Lynch should not have made this movie unless he has something better to do. at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was disappointing that this film had the film industry's highest standard of production quality and, despite a small amount of good story and some interesting cinematography, the movie didn't make that happen. The story was so bad that there was no way that I could relate to it.  The acting wasn't very good, although I knew it would probably be better with more dialogue and more dramatic performances if it came from a story. And the acting didn't really come close to what the script called for, or even made, in a way that didn't work for me.  I gave this movie 2 out of 10, but even less than that it was bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You would think that this would be the best horror film ever. There's nothing else in this movie to keep you from knowing that it is a horror film! If you knew it was a horror movie, you would not want to see it. If you loved horror, you might have liked it. But you don't, and even if you liked horror you don`T enjoy it like a horror flick.  This movie is nothing but an excuse to a bad horror movie: it is just bad, bad, and bad. A lot of scary movies were made about how scary it gets, and this one is no exception. This movie was no exception, and it has not even managed to scare anyone. It is so bad that I cannot give it any rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely painful, and it is not even a good movie in any circumstances. The acting is awful, the direction is bad, the camera is bad. The first scene after the opening credits is simply bad.  It's just very bad. Even if you like the cast members, this movie is bad as well.  This film would have been a decent film if the story was a bit good.  The first few episodes of this movie were good, but after the first episode the story gets boring and the characters become so uninteresting that the movie starts becoming pointless. The main character is a very weak man who thinks he's a man named "Pelio" and who has no real interest in anything. It's almost painful that he has to be such an uninteresting character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I'm not going to be one of those people who has to watch this movie in some time. The movie is completely incomprehensible. Although I have seen several movies (this is just my personal feelings) that made this movie come off as so dull and boring, I think it was a very simple idea. It's just not enjoyable. The first few minutes of this movie were pretty good, as you can tell. Then it became boring and just plain boring. This movie was way better when compared to others, but it did nothing when compared with a movie from another genre. It just shows the usual lack of professionalism. In the end, the movie ends with a pretty ridiculous twist. And after all, what is there to make this movie? You know, a twist to end the movie. Well, that's pretty much an excuse to make fun of the horrible things in this movie. I do believe that the movie was an experiment by some filmmakers (I've seen it in the past). I can only give this one 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a member of the Film Directors Association (FICF), I am having a hard time getting into this film. The plot is so vague and just completely uninteresting. You don't know who is the girl with the long hair, and why is she wearing a wig and hat. The scene with the naked woman and a naked man trying to undress is just flat out sexual harassment. If the film had been good, I would have loved it. If you had to see the film, you would just think they're going to break out of a tree to try and do some sort of action. But this film tries so hard to break the tree apart. If a tree was a person and you had made it for people like me, you wouldn't get an erection. So they got an erection from a person. I'm looking at you, I don't understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm pretty good at math. I am a member of the math club at a major school and I am also pretty good with my life. I've just lost some of my usual good time when watching this movie. The acting was bad, the acting was worse and the script was awful. I didn't care for any of the actors, but the film did a few good scenes and the overall was really bad. The only good thing I had was the good cinematography. But then I saw the story of the two sisters and how they had to come to love each other. How they lived in each other's house and how I was made, how they could have loved each other but for whatever reason, I had no idea. The ending was not good either. I couldn't really get into the film's plot and characters, but I still didn't want to watch it again. I gave it an 8 because it had a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You know, the "Zombie" franchise. The plot is always terrible, but "Zombot 3" is no exception. I mean, it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it lacks even the slightest bit of plot, and it lacks the slightest spark to make the movie even remotely interesting. But the plot has an excuse to have this movie. Well, it didn't, because this movie is supposed to have a plot. I was so sick to watch it, it wasn't even remotely funny.  The plot was about a girl in the middle of a zombie apocalypse that has no friends and has no memory of how she arrived to Earth and what she did before.   This movie was about that. It had no direction. The characters had no connection with each other. Even the protagonist, the woman that came to Earth, had no clue that she was here. They just had to go into the middle with nothing to help them, they had to enter the middle without a map, just to get to Earth again and find out why it was so dangerous.  If you are expecting a Zombie movie, you'll be rewarded with a laughless laugh. But when they had the idea that it was a zombie movie, it just wasn't that good. I only gave it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really dislike movies, but if they're made on this level, it's not a good movie. A lot of things are so boring that you can't make up your mind about what the characters are. We don't get to know how a person's character is. I couldn't wait for the movie to get to an exciting end. I can't believe that anybody had the idea to put this on the DVD. That said, you can watch the episode on a DVD. It's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is a little weird. There are so many actors that don't look like the characters, but they do not deserve the performance. There is also a plot that is too convoluted and pointless. I'm also concerned that the director doesn't want to go out and get a big pay or even some money. It seems that the movie is designed to make a cheap, amateur film. If this is meant to be a film, then this movie is terrible but a poor one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of the movie was so bad that it's difficult to understand why it exists in this particular story. There's nothing else to be done for this movie other than a ridiculous attempt to explain how this world works.  I have two comments to this movie: First -  It doesn't matter if you liked the original story or not. It doesn an awful lot of plot. If it's not, you're going to miss out on a movie about a world that is actually all there is.  Second - it's a waste of time. You need a lot of time to get bored watching it. You're going in slow-paced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am baffled at how to take this movie. It is a movie that shows little of value from the fact that it stars a great movie. Not only that but the movie is terrible. It seems that every character has the wrong personality and no character in it does anything remotely important or to the overall plot. It was very disappointing. The movie was not even made up of its parts so bad as that it is.  I'm very disappointed that this movie was made in 2007. This was the second movie I would have expected of the year. And it is still awful. It does not even have a plot. I cannot afford to be insulted by this movie, even though I was expecting the "good" elements. And the acting of the cast was good, but it is simply terrible. The only thing worth mentioning was the fact, I loved the character of the killer, but the ending was so bad that I could not see myself in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot does make sense, it's a little less overwritten and a little bit more intelligent. But unfortunately, it doesn't deliver.  We spend our time looking at this thing, and we wonder how many times can someone put so many words on a stupid piece of text, and then you don't make a point.  There's a lot of characters in the film that you just don't care.  The only time I'd like to comment is about a couple of characters who are completely oblivious and just give you hope and hope that the movie will end. It's a waste of time to care about.   I'll give this one a negative score of 1/3 because I thought the plot was good, but there's something more important that we need to think about. I'm really looking forward to an idea about a movie: A movie that has nothing that you can point to, or even speak for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You may find this movie out on TV today. There is not enough nudity, no gore, and nothing else that makes this movie any worthwhile to be watched. And while it is a movie that really, really kills anyone, this isn't one of those things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read on the "I'm here:  "The Secret Life of Money" is a completely unconvienous piece of waste of precious time. No wonder, I say, this movie, if it was about money, would be pretty entertaining and I would have been interested. Unfortunately, I think the same goes for all the other films of the same director. It's bad, bad, BAD. For some reason, I'm afraid I couldn't decide if it is a film based on Money or a film about Money. I'd like to see someone read a negative opinion about this movie: "The fact that this movie isn't actually filmed, but a story about Money and a story, a really good story, is somehow hard to understand."  I wish I could say the same about the other movies of the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. A couple of people said that this was a good movie. They are wrong. It is not funny. The plot is nothing. There is no character, nothing. The scenes are bad, it lacks dialog. There's nothing funny. There are no plot. The characters are not funny, they're boring. There isn't any funny humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not a good film at all, it was very, very poorly acted. I found it in the theaters and I was very disappointed. I thought that the ending was bad, too.    If you enjoy a story about a young boy and his (almost) older sister (who has grown up on her) then this movie is about two things--(1) that it's a big time commitment and (2) that the little boy is stuck in the orphanage because the principal's mother had to act to him and the old lady was having an affair with him. It was very disappointing that the movie had so little action in it.  Overall, it wasn't a good movie to see because it wasn'' a waste of money to spend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was going to be a horrible waste of a film but then I realized its a pretty good film because the script is so weak and the acting is awful. If you were going to have a horror film with the ability to see every detail of the story, you would not want it to fail because of the terrible acting and the horrible directing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've seen any horror movies, you will see that the movie takes place somewhere in the middle of the woods. That might be a place where you decide to run a business or build a new one, but the fact that this movie is actually set in a creepy place is pretty disappointing.  After seeing that, you'll probably go home and watch something else. It's probably only a couple of nights. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had nothing to do when watching this movie. I've seen it three times, and I've never seen one more painful than this movie...The scene where the "Ableiade's eyes" are shown makes it almost unbearable. Even if the director is very good in making this film, this movie is horrible. I mean, the scene where she removes some of the clothes from the real life, and then puts her in a black robe as her mother and father. You can see, I'm not kidding. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not scary or interesting for a first-time horror movie. In fact, it is just another example of why this kind of movie is so rarely produced. If it wasn't so bad, it would have a potential. But, alas, it still has a decent acting. As with the other low-budget movies I've seen, it's difficult to imagine people in this movie. It's not so bad that you can judge the actors. But the plot is not much different. It does offer some surprises, but they're not the ones you would expect. And, when it did finally come out, I found it so disappointing that I actually had a panic and didn't watch it until it was over. Even the actors couldn't convince me. I don't have a sense of disappointment or anger or anger with the movie. But it is simply not good enough to do anything else with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i wish i knew this movie was about a fictional family who lost their kids to some stupid idiot. if i could do that in the name of some guy or something i could save some money.  I'm an adult and I want to make movies with my friends, not movies where people will laugh and make it real. but this movie is not worth a second. there's no way i could get my friends to watch this movie. The acting was really bad and the "feelings" of being scared by an alien are pretty bad. the acting was good when compared to the other movies i've seen but now, if i can see it on the same channel as it's on my computer I might even go see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has got to be the worst example I've seen of that sort of film. If you like this sort of comedy, you don't care for it and this film has probably the lowest rating I've ever given. I can't even see the title! A poor, disappointing film. I'd have been tempted to watch this film before it had finished, but it just keeps going. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really pathetic, with a terrible script and very dull production. It's about a bunch of crazy vampires, who were born to be killed (a big joke) and decided to kill everyone...   What's more surprising, is that it doesn't seem to actually exist. After the movie was shot, there was no footage of a car crash that can't be filmed, or of anyone being attacked by the vampire army, nor was there ever actually some action. I guess you can find it on a DVD somewhere. There was no plot, and no plot. The only thing that made me uncomfortable was the fact that the vampire had black hair and red eyes. That was quite creepy. And the actors were awful. I just thought they were all terrible actors.  The plot is very simple. Your main character (the vampire) kills everyone, and then kills the people you are fighting. However, there is nothing about him that made my blood boil. The vampire army had a few shots to take, but it was nothing to do with the vampires. I'm sure you get the point... it's pretty plain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see a movie where the actors all go into the same dark, bad-guy-to-girl story line with only a brief hint of "Lucky" or "Ahaak" in it. The whole idea of the movie is that it can't be about the people who fall down on their knees and want to die.  Why would the "Aak" person just want to get their life right, and if there is a way to get life right? Ahaak is a little bit more of a sad person than the typical "comedy" comedian. He got his job, is the sort-of family figure of an asshole who is very wealthy, and wants to have a lot of money. He can't afford a lot, but he does get his fair share of money, so he wants to do a movie with his money to help a poor person. The problem is that he doesn't actually die. His suicide is a complete joke. He was trying to make himself more real by making himself a real person. He should have had a few days of sleep. He just got caught up on his computer and decided to die, and then proceeded to tell his wife (and friends) about all the money he had wasted on investing in stocks and stocks. He seems to be a little selfish because he seems to have something of himself.  How, I'm guessing, did he just decide to die in a couple days? He has a huge amount of money in his hands. The best part of the film was the way the scenes in the car went up and down. What was funny about the story was how he couldn't get away from doing that thing. The scene where he was running into the car was probably the best part.  As a movie fanatic, I am more interested in the story than the ending. I'm just disappointed, because I expected a little better thing than "Aaks". It's a bad film that doesn't go anywhere. There is a guy who gets in a car and has a big, awesome tank in the back of his car. The guy looks so good, but that doesnít matter for much.  It's sad that this film is so bad that I can't even begin to laugh. It's just so bad, and not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't say the entire movie was terrible but I can say the parts I liked the most were the little bits that didn't suck. For example, the "jitter" segment I saw is where they put the most disgusting person on the stage. The scene was hilarious and nothing about it made it seem remotely funny. What a waste of time they spent at a video store.  The other segments were far better. I have never laughed so stupid in that one.  This movie was so bad that I had a feeling in my stomach that my brain would pop up at any moment. I think I will never even see this movie again.  If you want to see a good movie: 1. Don't waste your time with this one. 1. Get it over a few times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is bad to say because I have never heard of an American movie: one of the worst I have ever seen.  This movie is about a mad scientist who can bring down anything and anyone to death and he tries to kill the family that includes all his other friends. At the beginning of the movie the director and the entire group are completely ignorant of the fact that these people are in charge of all other people. How did they know they are mad? How can they know anything about their subjects and are in contact with them all the time? It's so bad it's hard to understand how they can talk to people and people only want to kill people because they have become too smart to be part of an insane cult.  The film ends with some of the mad scientist's victims being rescued and told the whole story while the rest of the film is going to follow their torture. Of course the torture is going too far. What a sick and insane film this is. Why does this not matter? The director and his crew do not do this work for fun. In fact I have seen some of their other movies and they do not act like this. The whole movie is just like a bunch of dumb teenagers who are making mad experiments to see if it's possible to bring down people who have so much courage and will not die. When I first saw this film I thought it had great potential but I couldn't care more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In fact, the best scenes are the ones where he's naked and having fun with the ladies as he's back-to-back. I'd rather go for the one that has him back-and-back with the girls and then you would get to like him. This is just awful. The scenes where he gets drunk are also awful. In this scene where he is lying with a woman he has just about two minutes in a scene and she just dies in agony in her arms. Even if it was not in a sex scene, I just couldn't care for her. That's all part of the movie, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have seen. Not only a really bad movie, but also a very bad movie. In the early part of the movie, the movie starts where all the actors are stupid. For instance, the famous 'Mr. Bumble' character plays a role on a reality show called 'The Inventing Dream' where he is forced to do his "act of right" for a couple of years.  Later, the 'Mr.' character is involved in a car crash on a road near a big city where he meets a little woman who takes part in a crime scene. The movie ends with Mr. Bumbled being murdered by a drunk man with a knife. There is one scene with the car crashing and the police is searching for evidence. When the car is parked on the road and the cop calls the guy who has left the car to help them, he tries to run away. The car goes into a spiral. Mr.Bumble gets murdered but survives to get arrested. What's most upsetting is the fact that this movie had the same theme throughout the entire movie. The first scenes were all about how the car crashes, but the movie only deals with a simple matter of death. Now I didn't have to see the whole movie to know exactly what is going to happen. The next scenes are only about how Mr. Azzerbumble was killed. It seems that the first scene where all this horrible thing happens is the one thing that has happened throughout the movie. I can't stress enough that this was horrible and I was watching it as I just returned from the theater, and I think there are two or three people that could have done better. There was no storyline.  What I did enjoy was the fact they had the big guns. The way they were made was so cheaply was interesting. And I never knew why the whole thing was shown. The scenes involving the car were too far away from where they were supposed to be. The plot is only about Mr.Azzerbums killing Mr. and killing his son. The fact that the car falls into the spiral is ridiculous. The ending is also ridiculous. It was almost like they wanted to put in a killer sequence for the movie and that they couldn't get that done. What happened was all about murder and a little girl. And the ending ends with a guy getting into a car wreck.  The plot itself was too unbelievable to be believed and the plot had no
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film after I was bored. I read the book in this book and I had to pay attention to this movie because the movie was so horrible, I thought the ending was even worse. I was expecting a decent movie but the acting of the two parts of the movie are so bad, you don't want to make it a movie, you just watch it with the other person's eyes and see a bunch of people who do nothing but throw out words like this stupid story. I'm only saving a few minutes of my life because I chose to watch it because it was good. But the only thing that helped me was the ending of the film. I thought it was overrated, I mean, I don't understand the difference between a "true" story and a "stressed-out-movie" in some way. And I don;t want to waste my time watching this because it can't be that badly made because people like this. The only good thing I do was the opening of the book. I think it's worse than the book because the book is so much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just finished watching this movie and realized it wasn't great. I just laughed, and then walked out to get some beer to see if there was a sequel. I didn't really like the first one because I don't understand it's called The Bride. It's a very low-budget, boring movie. It got the best bit of it, and didn't make any sense in any way. I'm a grown-up mom and this movie should be pulled from the dustbin. The only reason I wanted to see this is because I wanted a laugh, and because the "character" had so much in it that they could put the whole "characterizing" of one of the characters in it. I really don't know what happened to their character, and if they were a couple they weren't like they are now. Maybe this is a bad idea for a movie because it's a bit too serious. The plot has nothing that is interesting. It just tries to make some fun, but when it's trying to make fun it just falls apart. This movie isn't funny. It lacks character development, the acting, and the plot makes no sense. There are two good things in this movie, the ending and the funny timing. But the rest of it is pretty terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main problem I could see in this movie was that the idea of a'secret identity' was created for this film, even though this was obviously not the case at the beginning of the film, this should have been the case and not the result of an unintentional misunderstanding. The movie itself goes out of its own name at the end of the movie (as the ending of this movie happens) and has the only part that resembles the movie itself. If the idea were created for a film, it would have been far better. For the sake of that, you must just see this movie as a standard action film, not some vague allegory film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just my usual thing, i'm very sad to learn that this movie has been completely censored. The acting is terrible, the plot is predictable and the plot has nothing new. Not even if it's the best possible scenario to the movie. I can't wait for it to get released in the UK and then of course be put on DVD. At least I could see a glimpse of the upcoming "Zorro". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was bad. It looked like a piece of trash. It was boring. The characters were dull, they were uninteresting and the plot was predictable only to an extent. There was a little bit of magic in it, but nothing good, so it seemed to go straight to the edge of death to find a vampire (the vampire) at the bottom of the sea. I could almost see it coming to life, but it never quite worked out to be true. There were no suspense, and there were some very disturbing scenes. However, the movie itself is good when watching the ending, but the ending itself was bad in my opinion. There are some good moments here, but, this movie really is awful. The only saving thing was the ending and the characters, they are good actors. Otherwise the movie just plain awful. I just can't see that the writers had anything to do. The movie seemed to be made for kids, the vampires were great actors, and the ending was decent. Unfortunately, the main reason this movie was made was that it was about the same characters in the movie as the movie was for kids. But, they didn't really do that. What a shame. The acting is good enough, but I'm surprised that it wasn't all bad, but this movie just seems to me like a movie that a mother wouldn't let her child watch. I'd give this movie a 6/10 but just keep your fingers off to avoid the obvious mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot makes no sense. There are a few interesting things that are interesting but the plot is nothing to get excited. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a dog that had nothing but a fancy home. The plot is about a little kid who is sent to "take care of" a bunch of old women. When the boy is picked up, he starts to love them, but then the whole thing is gone when the boy decides to break into the secret family. I think that the main plot (which is about to be released) is about the daughter of the older lady, not because it focuses on her mother. The only good thing about the movie is that it gets a little bit of laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only does this movie a horrible track-name of a stupid movie: it was not really a movie...it was a movie for "some movie people, like the guys in the car" in this case. But the movie had only two "people" and it ended up with some kind of creepy horror movie. It's not that good for the actors. But what are we talking about that movie? We don't have the "guerrilla" talent of our best actors, who can act and make music that can shock a few people and destroy a few stars. In case you have a car and a room, this movie will certainly make you wonder why it got made in the way it did. This movie is bad not just because of its mediocre plot, but also because of what was going on with the script. And the ending is terrible. For example, "The car guys are in their car, trying to escape", and we are shown "some kind of torture" and we don't see the "car guys" escaping. They just keep on driving past "bad guys" and going to see them. I think it was just to make fun of people. It was supposed to be a horror movie for people who want to get a thrill, but in fact it is just a movie about a bunch of people going to some horror movie in some dark parking lot. A few hours after we are finished watching, you see a story and we immediately forget it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would agree that the actors are pretty good, and I thought they were good, but after seeing this movie I really had no idea why they were cast. They all look like the same people, and they all act like the two boys from the early 1900 movies. I don't care for that. But it's bad that the movie is so bad that I had to turn into a complete idiot. I didn't see the "journey" and I just watched it twice. It is so awful, it was awful even with great acting. If I had seen this movie before I would have felt more for it. It was horrible to watch it. I thought it was terrible and I couldn't even think that the boys had the same talents as the girls. It all seems very suspicious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As always I find myself involved in something about which I don't know. This movie is no exception. This stupid waste of time from a "goodie" director (which I must say, so as usual) is about a bunch of morons (or perhaps only morons, because I am a moron) that just go around the country and find each other and make themselves ridiculous. This is stupid as it is the result of a stupid director who thinks he can "make" funny movies with nothing but cheap actors. Also, the idea that this movie is a comedy is ridiculous. It's a little bit like a movie like "Lobster Carriers". It's not a very good movie, but not bad. If you liked a movie that was supposed to be funny and a fun one, that movie is boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Afternoon on Monday night, I had the misfortune of viewing this movie about a bunch of young teens having sex in a car.  So I decided to take a bit of time off to try watching it on a DVD, because I was really hoping to see some real "B" movie.  But that did not happen. After my first viewing, I couldn't wait to see it again. What a pitiful movie I was watching.  This movie doesn't go beyond the standard, so no surprises. I am really looking forward to seeing this movie, but not because of the fact that I don't know why it is. What's more important is that it is a horrible movie, it is not like anyone's going to see a movie with this level of stupidity. It's just a little bickledy stuff and I am not going to try to take any more pictures of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   this movie is nothing to be proud of. the only good thing in this movie was the ending. the movie was totally uninteresting. the story did not provide any sense of any depth or value. the acting was flat. the dialogue was terrible.  this is the only movie i've ever seen that had a storyline that did not even contain a human. the ending, while not being bad, is terrible. this movie has it all wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film features nothing but a few annoying (and lame) scenes. If you loved "The Wizard", you would find it entertaining. Unfortunately, the producers just give the same, but less fun, material as the rest of the film, so it fails. It is truly one of the worst films I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is absolutely ridiculous - especially the acting, which makes this absolutely hilarious - the plot is so poorly constructed that the effects are laughably predictable, and the plot of course is not even remotely interesting. That being said, though, it's interesting and entertaining. But it's lousy, even more ridiculous than that.  The plot is very old, not a very good one - especially since the actor who plays the lead is now in his 50s. He's just another bland character who thinks he's so cool that he's got to have a little fun. Oh, I'll say that. The actors are pretty good, though.  Just another stupid excuse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am an out of date and I am not going to waste time on this film. I have seen it twice, and my family members are more interested than anything else. But after seeing this film I am absolutely, totally, out of my mind. It isn't even funny.    If I could write a negative rating about a movie: It is extremely slow, poorly directed, extremely stupid, and most obviously poorly acted. But if you're a believer in the concept of an American film, it's hard to criticize this movie. Even a few years ago, if you had to see this movie it would be OK if you'd be disappointed. But I have to say this is probably the worst ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been completely ruined by the movie "Life in the Village", but is still worthy of being called "a failure". It was an extremely bad film in many different ways. It had some good moments and it's just a shame that they gave this one more stars than the other actors in the movie. The acting wasn't bad as the movie I had in mind, but the supporting actors were lousy. In my opinion this movie was simply bad, no matter what actors were involved. The idea of this movie is just plain trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie of terrible acting, very poor editing and a horribly predictable story. If I had the power to put my finger on my head, I would have done it. I just couldn't find the character in his hands. When watching this movie, it is just like having a car accident. It is bad, bad, terrible, bad. Even though I was a fan of the actor, I had to find some way to put the brakes on the car.  If you like this movie then go on and see it twice, then you are wasting your time. Don't waste your time with this lousy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I am sure some of the critics of this film have already written about it, I will just say that this is the worst thing to film that I have seen in a movie. The acting is wooden and the story is just about the least interesting.   The acting isn't bad by itself, but it is bad for the movie and the director. For a film about the end of a war, this could have done well if it were set in a world with actual people, people with lives, and people who make choices in a way that can be viewed, evaluated, and discussed. But in the end, you don't have the opportunity to do anything about it.  If this was a real war, it would be a great piece of cinema and a great story. Unfortunately, it was not. It was about the failure of the government of the USSR, not the story of the war itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is nothing but a horror flick that is no more. It does nothing but fail to be interesting to those who actually care about such things. That is the only reason that I gave it an 8. I can't believe this movie made it. When I found out I wasted it on watching the beginning of this movie I felt like that was the whole movie and that I didn't get to enjoy the whole experience. I wish I had a better description of what this movie is, but unfortunately this is one of the worst movies I've seen for some reason. It is not worth checking out because it's too bad to be seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen it at my local store for the last 30 years, and it has NEVER been so bad. The biggest problem was the director, who tried to make something of a cult thriller. It failed miserably. The lead, Ben Stricker, is a VERY stupid character, even if he was the main character. He tried to bring this back to the '80s, but it didn't succeed. The other main character, Dr. Charles E. Spender, was equally terrible. He is more likely to appear in a '60s show, such as "Star Trek" or "The X-Files". This is a movie from the late '80's. Even a TV show in a small town is only supposed to make it so on a budget. I can only hope that this will be changed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    First of all, it is extremely bad (I've heard worse) than any movie i have ever seen! If you can believe in what I say about this film, go ahead and check it out: the way the movie is made is extremely uninteresting and extremely dull. The acting is just terrible, and the story is extremely boring and just pretentious. If you are familiar with the genre, the plot is a standard one, which you never get to like, so don't expect to enjoy this one. The plot is very old and the film tries too hard to make the viewers believe the actors. The cinematography is extremely poor and you can expect it to be in the bottom 10. The actors also don't seem to act very well either, the story has a very weak plot, the scenes are very poorly made, the characters are too predictable and nothing interesting. The end is really disappointing. If this is your first film, you'll be missing a lot of entertainment and you'll find yourself missing a few hours of fun. I hope that you will be able to identify the plot and find it worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film with one of my girlfriend and the director of this movie. It was a really terrible movie, the director didn't try to make any good scenes, there was nothing interesting, and the acting was bad, the cinematography was terrible and the plot was poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just can't believe these people really think this movie is going to win any award. How many times could this guy get into the big leagues and make a movie? It's got a really cheesy premise and no suspense to me. Even the actors in it could only make so many of the scenes seem like they were taking a big risk. There was no story. The only thing this movie was really good was the actors. The guy playing the role of the "Rabbahahhahhhahh" seemed to be very talented but I couldn't get past the terrible acting. The camera movements seemed extremely slow, and the camera movements moved very fast and were blurry. The editing was horrible.  I would really like to see this movie more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I mentioned in the comments, the plot and direction are extremely poor. It's not like the James Cameron movie "Darkwing Duck" with his witty, yet creepy and funny commentary. But that doesn't help either. I am very tired and have seen more of this than I've ever seen before. The only reason I chose this film was because it was supposedly set in a hospital in Africa. I have never even heard of a hospital with Africans, and I think they might have something to do with the film. It is simply terrible. I give this film a 0. 1. It isn't even remotely interesting and I have no idea why this film exists. This was a nightmare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a piece of trash. A lot of this is done by actors who could not be anywhere except in acting. The plot, despite the attempt to present an original idea, is nothing more than a generic attempt to be a "Bolz" or "Avenger." I thought that the idea was very original. At the beginning of the film, when the heroes are introduced to the villains, the villain's plot is predictable and doesn't develop. The film tries to give us hope and that it comes to something. However, the film is just not complete.  The movie tries to bring the audience back to life, but we don't really get a true picture of the villain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is only so it can be believed. It is so bad I can't even get into the details. But that's not the worst of it. The title of the movie is the word "The Walking Dead." It's a bad word for a movie: It's so bad it can hardly even be called. It just has an absurd title, that's it's nothing but a ridiculous premise. This movie really is a big fat pile of garbage, and that's why I was forced to pay money to watch it. For those who have even read the book, the title tells us that the zombies are back-killing everyone. It's the only thing that ever made me laugh. Even the title is so awful that I can never imagine what the zombies do. The whole movie is just terrible. But the funny parts of this film are priceless. In fact, they were pretty funny. But if you are willing to spend hours watching this movie, you might enjoy some parts of it - but then you have to get bored. The acting is bad. The story is weak. If I had to sum it up, there are only 4 things that made this movie worth seeing: a lot of blood, a lot more blood, and an insane amount of blood. But apart from those 4 things, I can see this movie as a waste of my time. It would be much better if it were so simple to make. It seems that it was made so simple, so it just seemed to be made that way. I wish I was reading the book that I am reading for this movie. I have yet to read it. I'm not sure whether I will ever read it again. I only assume that it is so simple that I don't know how to make that point. I can also see that the movie was made too quickly. The plot was completely written so fast that the actors couldn't act and the movie didn't really seem to be interesting. The fact that this movie didn`t try to get it moving fast at all makes me believe that the writer is a very good writer. I mean, I don`t think that if you were a writer, that would be his first idea, right? I don' t know what the writer could have written. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has absolutely nothing good to make. Some of the things are OK and some of the weird things that make this movie seem like they are only part of a whole movie or just some other movie. Also, the ending is really disappointing.  The whole plot of this movie is one big long story of a guy who is drunk, getting drunk, being attacked and attacked by his neighbors in his hometown, who then kills his neighbors and kills himself. I mean, that's really not realistic.  I would like to see an episode of the "I'm Drunk" show and a TV series of it that is based on it. But I can't imagine the show I would get, because it is so shallow and boring, that you really can't really see what it's about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just because "Bolino's Dream" is a movie starring an interesting, charismatic, and charming man, it seems that this is a terrible film. If you were wondering why the hell should you see this movie, I guess the answer is because it isn't your typical "BOLINO's Dream", with a woman whose appearance is that of an overweight woman with a big body and all that stuff. The story and the characters are bad, the acting is bad, and the fact that it features a hot actress is no surprise.  It has been stated several times that this was made for a big budget, but unfortunately it does not. I have noticed that every one of these movies I have seen is to be an exception to the rule. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of a movie, this is the least interesting piece of American cinema, but unfortunately not well received.  The problem with the movie is it really relies on a very weak story to make the movie interesting.  As a young woman (I am pretty old and I have a very young daughter now), i have seen much better films, but i can not afford to lose the enjoyment of seeing such a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a piece of waste that has not much to do with it's cast (except for those who make the small cameo in the film's most important scenes). The acting is so bad that it just isn't enjoyable to watch. The plot is just a pretense, I was actually hoping for some kind of plot. The film could do something more by simply making this movie about the people who had it prior to its release. That is an extremely naive film for the sake of its sake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the film equivalent of one of the worst horror movies ever made. There's no real reason to make this movie. The plot is too stupid, the acting is horrible, and it's predictable. The premise is a cop, whose wife and her boyfriend are just living with their friends, and he's on a road trip. If you want to see a real horror film, this one isn't the right choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first hour I watched was absolutely horrendous. I'm sure those who have seen it, don't have to suffer as much as we do. However, it was a pretty awful piece of garbage, which would make anyone, like me, laugh as much when they see it as a waste of a ticket. I was able to finish the movie by putting a few drops in a bag. The only reason I watched this was to see what we'd see in a better movie. It was pretty bad. The director had a complete grasp of the facts involved, but seemed to want to keep this movie a bit more realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only real redeeming feature in this movie is the very lame musical performance by Chris Hemminger, who, although she looks like a fresh, vibrant woman, really looks like an old lady, with no real connection with any of the people she is surrounded by. And not only that, but also the fact that she is never able to act in any kind of meaningful way. It's more like he wants to make a movie out of it, as he describes his ideas for a movie: He wants to do something that would make the audience think he's the smartest guy, as if he does not know it. He does not want to play a great movie. In the very early scenes, he does seem interesting, as always, but when he's not doing so interesting, his performance is flat and not credible. He never seems to act as an intelligent person.  The movie is about a lot of money and a lot more money is made in a house, but nothing happens and everyone goes crazy.  I do hope that other people will realize that this is bad and watch this movie instead of wasting their time watching it. It really is nothing more than a bad comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just so bad it doesn't even make sense...  Even worse, it gets you to watch this one... I thought it was the dumbest movie i ever seen. I was disgusted with the stupid people who had put up their cameras. The acting was horrible and the story of the movie was just completely terrible. There wasn't even any real plot. The characters acted like they were walking around and in front of their camera....the only thing i cared about was the camera footage. I'd have a really hard time watching the movie. There were no scenes that made me laugh.  It is so bad I don't even care. The whole thing is about as bad as a movie I have ever seen... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a waste of effort. Too many scenes were left out of the film, but there were a few very memorable scenes. However, those who complained had not got the message should have been more concerned by the lack of screen time. While I have been told that there will be some scenes in the movie with the actors' girlfriends, that doesn't make any sense. I give this movie the title and it was stupid to do so in such a short time. Also, while the acting was good, the story wasn't as I expected. I am very glad to have this film but unfortunately it should not have been a big deal for this short movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a bit concerned with the 'Presto Presto' story line. However, I just don't understand how it got to such a horrible name. I think the original title is so bad, but if a bad title is used, it must have a title like this. I thought this film was a "re-energizing" of the original, and not original, if it's in this category. So what is that?  The first problem was that it was obviously not directed.  As the plot is, this movie is obviously a remake of something. What they had in place was so little. It was so bad. A very low budget. And the story line is so confusing. The way they're changing the title is a complete failure. It's as if there is no logic to the story. In the original the 'Orobori'. It's just a bunch of guys who don't have one clue as to what's going on. The characters are all the same. They're all the guys who are the same in every plot.  This movie is a waste of effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Picking Up A Movie" was a stupid movie that pandered its way out of "Dennis the Men" and made all the things come down to a bad-ass, pointless plot. The first scene (where Dennis gets thrown in the pit), is one of the worst scenes I have ever seen in a movie. The plot is bad, the characters are awful, and the plot is predictable. There's also a bad ending, with the end being just as bad. But when Dennis dies at the end, it's good. He does it for us, so we see him again. When we get the opportunity to see Dennis again, I'm gonna cry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason I'd ever put this film into my DVD collection would be the opportunity to put together some footage from the film itself. Unfortunately, the film was so horrible, that I could almost guarantee that the actors and actresses would not have been able to complete a story with minimal character-overloading and gore. If I've ever read anything that has been in this film, I can't say that it was even remotely good.  There was an element that seemed unrealistic, and that was the biggest part of it. That was the reason I finally didn't waste a second and watched the film instead of my 10 hours of entertainment at the cinema.  I have to say that while watching the film, you can see exactly the same things as the actors did. They acted like a bunch of kids. It seemed like they were just messing around. It wasn't acting that strange. It didn't have the right look or acting that made me laugh. They weren't even trying to act as a real person. The film didn't go far enough. And they didn't act like a real monster. If you had to see it in a real room full of people, you would know that they were actors. This film was just plain bad, and I couldn't find any real reason why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a horrible film: I will never forgive anyone who plays this movie.  The acting is bad, with bad jokes that are ridiculous. I have never seen so bad. I'm not going to give this movie a 7.  This is not a movie for anyone with any nerve in his or hers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie the day it came out, I don't know why I even bothered to rent it. The acting was the worst I've seen in my life since I had to watch this movie. I tried to look at the plot while watching it and it didn't work. The director wanted to tell a story but it was just about as badly written as everything else in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so completely incomprehensible and utterly bizarre to watch and this is so stupid and disappointing. This has nothing to do with the plot, characters, characters nor anything else. The fact that the plot is OK... The fact the actors are so bad, the acting is OK but the fact the movie is terrible. I can't imagine this movie ever making my attention slip again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You'll be waiting for the "movie" when the movie is finally released... it's about a bunch of aliens that take an interest in a woman who is having sex with another man (I'll be guessing for a few hours) and then they find themselves as their property and she steals his property. The plot of the movie basically consists of him getting back into a car that has a bunch o' cars that you would be able to see around a city. He then forces them to stay there and take turns of course to try to fight each other. He tries to use the car to try and beat them all in order to try an escape from prison but that's not his plan. There are scenes where he fights and fights the two aliens and also other aliens that try and put him in prison but are not very successful. He is then attacked by some demons and a woman. After that his luck is sorted out because it's a lot cheaper. This movie is terrible. A lot of people are going to have nightmares about this movie... it really isn't the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main character in this movie is a very stupid character who is addicted to cocaine (he can't keep it in a few hours) and thinks he has turned his new-found "new" drug into a new drug that he could use. I guess that after seeing this movie it will never stop telling you that it is a movie about addiction and that it has some pretty damn plot and a decent supporting cast, but unfortunately, in fact the main character is not addicted to any drug nor does he have any drug addiction. I'm sorry to say that the movie isn't too bad, but if you want to watch a movie that is obviously about the story and not about the drugs then you might be looking for a better movie: I am a big fan of films that aren't about drugs and I just didn't like this one. But I guess you can get one anyway if you're a fan of drugs and you can even watch it for about 10 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie because of the name and the name, but I was very skeptical. I didn't like it. It was just too predictable. And I think that just because of that, it can't be a bad film. But I still didn't understand what the hell it is. I do know that the characters were pretty predictable and the story wasn't interesting enough for me to care about it. I felt like I wasted a lot of time watching it. The plot was so stupid that I decided to waste my time watching the movie. Also, the ending is way too predictable for me. I just don't understand the point behind it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is extremely bad, it is really nothing new. There are other movies about people being tortured and getting tortured to death by people who don't want to do this movie but want to play a movie with them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, I watched the first 2 episodes of this film and watched it over and over again until the light went out. The plot was extremely convoluted, with no real connection to the rest of the films in this world (it's really strange how I can predict this, even with the knowledge of the other films I've seen). I tried to see it in the way the writers intended it, but when I finally do, it leaves you feeling sorry for yourself, with much more baggage than what actually went on in it.   I have some sympathy for the talented cast members of this movie, and they are doing an excellent job, but there is one person (Liam Nighant) who isn't doing it right. I think the director should leave this film alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible - it's so bad, I can't even laugh at it, I'm really sad to see the name 'Hannigan' on it.  The ending is OK, although I think that the ending is a bit weak, you can see the scenes in the episode where you can tell how everyone is really killed off and what happens after they die.  But I can forgive it - it had some entertainment and the ending was good. But this movie is not really worth your time, it just isn't funny enough.  I would give this movie a 10 but I think it isn't a great movie, it really doesn't add up to the other ones and is probably the worst Sci-Fi TV series of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I've ever seen.  It seems so, but I know that it is a movie that a film critic can review at a small film club:  I know it's a bad film, but it does manage to make me care about it. It's awful, even worse than the other film I've seen. The characters were really stupid, the story was horrible, the script was terrible.  In most respects, this movie was better than the movie that was released in the 70s. I'd never seen such low quality movies. The plot of the movie isn't all bad, in fact, it's better than a movie about a hit TV series, the plot of this movie has much more potential.  I'd give this movie two out of five, but since I gave it four out of six, I'd be forced to give it an out of seven. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains every sort of cliché I have ever heard (if you've been caught in any movie) and not even a momentary moment in-cinematic inspiration. I've seen it in several different theaters and I have a feeling that if you're going to watch this movie, you have better watch it at a cheap motel. The acting is flat and stilted, the scenes are cliché and badly filmed, the film is badly edited, the script is weak. The story is painfully predictable and the plot isn't interesting. The film lacks any originality, it has no storyline whatsoever.  If you have something to do, read a good movie: I have two words that describe this movie: "no plot".  I will admit that the scene with the woman is entertaining but that is all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to believe that this was a real film. It is a very strange movie. It's so hard to predict where everything would happen, and even more difficult for the viewer to understand. There is absolutely no storyline. I can't figure out why anyone could care about it. The movie is one of those mindless movies that are just for entertainment purposes, or to get a few hours before bed.  There's really nothing to interact with. The characters are nothing like usual actors.  The movie has a rather strange script. It has no feeling of connection with people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty bad. It was horrible, the acting wasn't good, there was a bad script. It lacked a storyline and a plot. It wasn't interesting. It had a predictable ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd like to see a movie that would put a positive review about the good things that make this movie. But this movie really sucks. I just can't seem to get my mind out of it. I watched the movie at 3, then 10, and then waited for it to be over. I've seen this movie once before, and was glad to get a chance to see it again. The acting was OK, and the script was good, but this movie has nothing in common with other movies. I don't understand why they put this movie out. There's a lot of very, VERY bad movies out there. This movie should have been turned into a comedy or a horror movie and not turned into an insult to the human race. It's about the same size and weight as a big old garage. I was wondering why I had to watch it again, but I'll never forget it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a big fan of the show, and when I got the opportunity to see the film, I knew I would never stand in line for the second viewing. But when the film came out, I became totally disillusioned. After all of my expectations were ruined by the stupid story line (more than anything else!), the characters are unappealing, the camera is non-animation, and it just doesn't make any sense. I felt like I was watching a really dumb movie and I have this feeling about it. After I read the book, I felt the same way.  In this case, the badness is about the lack of a storyline. It's obvious that the characters don't care about them, but that is not necessarily the case. The ending just leaves you feeling more of a disappointed audience than an honest one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, the viewer is subjected to a few minutes of "junk time". The movie is not about anything interesting or even worthwhile. The only time I can recall in this movie is when the person(the camera) is at a window in a movie theater and sees someone else's face on the screen and what he does is to that person. This is about an actor, with a beard that is obviously ripped from the back of his head, who then takes off his beard and goes back to the street naked to have sex with another naked girl. This movie contains two main characters(the blonde, the dark haired black haired blonde, and the red-haired actress), and none of them manage to do anything except try to masturbate while viewing someone else.  The funny thing about this movie was that one of the main characters is named "Clemie". This is because she is supposed to be a woman who has killed other people. In the movie, it is clear that Clemie has killed people but has never killed a person. In fact, she murdered a person, and it would have been a very interesting if Clemnie hadn't killed someone. The actor is just supposed to murder people and he does not do anything with his killing.  This movie had a very low budget and it has really scary imagery. There are many scenes that involve people screaming into their mouths and having their heads cut open, and some scenes in which a girl is forced to pee while she's locked up in a bathroom (like she was raped by a real jail guard). There are scenes where an actor is forced into a car and raped. He has some scenes where he does some kind of erotic things to a female and another guy gets up for a shower. He also has some interesting scenes where someone dies in a hospital room and is later killed by a psychopath.   This is a movie that was obviously made for low budgets. The actors are awful, and although the effects are very good, the acting is horrible. Even the director can't make it even halfway decent. There is absolutely no plot, or a storyline. It is a bunch of people that are in a basement for some reason.  I was not even aware of this movie until I saw it on TV in the evening and I laughed at the first person's face. It's OK to say that the "sex" scenes are pretty good and the women look very good and pretty sexy. The
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So, we're surprised to learn that the film was made when director James Brooks and producer Richard Brooks knew how the plot had developed. After the premiere of this movie, they knew that the story would need to be adjusted and thus became involved in the creation of the film.  The problem with the plot is the plot, which includes a lot of bad writing (such as a very bad idea, "Lunch") and bad directing (such a bad acting), but also bad directing. The movie contains many scenes that are neither interesting, nor dramatic.   The scenes of the story are not terribly hard to watch. They are not very good. I guess they are supposed to have some special effects. But then you can see the effects of the first scene, and what happens is that only a few seconds before they appear. The actors look like they are acting in a scene that is the same direction of the shot for a second.  They give you a good story about the film, but at the end you get bored, so I guess you just watch it for laughs.  A lot of people seem to be having trouble getting into the film and watching it for any reason. Even this is said in a positive review:  James Brooks' acting and directing are excellent, but I don't think the plot's been developed or presented. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe this film was made for anybody to care about a movie that is about a bunch of people, from which we find ourselves, trying to save the world, and then has them killed by an alien that wants to destroy the earth so that humanity is left without a single human alive. This film is nothing like the Sci-fi movies like Space Dog, Space Dog II and Space Dog III, in which people are killed by aliens and a rescue is attempted to get rid of the aliens, but this film is much worse than that, and it doesn't even try to rescue humanity from the alien invaders. A bad movie is about someone who wants to save Earth but doesn't care what would happen to the planet. The fact that this movie was made to sell this movie is very telling about the direction the movie is going in, as well as the fact that the movie tries to save us but doesn´t do so. This is a movie about the destruction of Earth that has nothing to do with the lives being saved, but just tries to keep the earth. I have to add that this is bad in the movie. Even worse than the movie would be if it was a true Sci-Fi movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a dreadful low-budget movie with a bad story, bad direction and bad characters and the one redeeming actor, Gary Haney. I was looking forward to see this film but I couldn't wait to see it again because it's so stupid and ridiculous that I felt like watching the first time. I'd think that it was better if he had a computer camera crew. But then again, what's this supposed to be? A documentary about the war? I don't think you can pull that one off easily. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a fan of Sci fiction and have some tolerance for the artistic sensibilities of the genre, then this movie will not make your heart tingle up with bloodlust for it.  It lacks a deep thought about the message and all of the other characters, which in any genre is usually the result of a lack of thought.  A decent plot, if you can believe. There was one woman, who, unfortunately, was the only one with intelligence.  They didn't even do that in the film, but if you liked it, you just laughed.  The problem is the acting. The girl has an emotional connection with the girl that she was dying, but, instead, you see her just as an object.  This isn't a movie for the "waking up" movie crowd; it's a movie designed to keep you dutiful for a couple hours so you can get into the emotional turmoil that your brain creates. That's not even enough time to get the viewer to relax.    The movie is one of the worst films of all, it is boring, it's just an insult to human life, and the movie has nothing except stupid humor and boring plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is basically two years away from the original and even so it can't have the same influence as the original. I mean, this film can't be compared to the original film. It's an uneven plot, and the direction just isn't as good. If you have read the original, you will be horrified when you realize that it was so bad and very predictable. I just thought this film was just a dumb joke.  The main reason this film is bad is because this movie had so much of the original's atmosphere and the original is all of the bad things it was. I have read much of it, and it is clear that the "fun" of the film was to take it in every moment and just jump on the roof and yell out the loud, and you can probably watch the original as a comedy. With so much unnecessary things in this movie, you don't really want to sit through a whole bunch of jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is one of those that, after seeing an adaptation of an original play, you just can't make yourself care about watching it anymore. The plot is completely incomprehensible, as one of the characters has no clue about anything except for his name. And the acting is painfully unfunny.  And it's impossible to even find a person who could have done better than what we just saw. Even for the few moments where there was a small moment with real human life, the characters were too easily cut off by the endless dialogs.  I give this movie a 10 because that's about as much as I would expect from a movie: not only one, but two things are wrong about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not good, but a couple of good comments, including one where the idea behind the plot is that the film is "comic" and the characters are the stars and not the audience. They're not even good in the film, which is the problem with the movie. You can't expect to make a comedy. When the film didn't work like that, I didn't care much if I liked it. It was pretty much a waste of time, though. But it still had a good point in the end, and if you want a movie with a plot, this movie is about a big family and some actors. So if you're looking for those types of movies, you'd better be looking for something like that. Otherwise, you're going to waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is simply the worst movie ever made, not even considering the fact that it is "set" in an industrial park in California, where it is obviously filmed in a San Francisco theme park (it's like that, except that it's set in LA, and has some pretty nice music, and is surrounded by a ton of cool buildings, and a bunch of other stuff, it just doesn't stay coherent for even a minute. The only good parts are the characters, and they're well-acted, but the dialogue is awful. Some of the scenes have been re-drawn several times, and some seem like they were ripped straight from the previous parts, and the rest of the movie seems so much worse than the rest, and it's so poorly developed and confused that it goes from bad to worse.  I couldn't care much about this movie, except for my brother and sister, who are both fans of the documentary "The Walking Dead", and are both willing to spend their time watching it in order to keep this movie from ruining it for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is as dull and ridiculous as you can get. Even the most passionate of people will find this incomprehensible. If I was a writer, it would be impossible to write anything that wasn't this stupid. I've read that movie, and I've seen it filmed, and this is the only movie I have ever done in my life.  I have a friend with a great sense of humor and a good sense of intelligence who agrees with me when it doesn't make any sense. But when it does, I have to watch this movie so I can't lose my mind. In the end, it's just bad writing, bad acting, bad jokes, and bad direction. I can only hope I will gain my health from reading this movie and see it again. I don't know what I would gain from watching this. It will make me sick. My wife is sickened by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot starts out slow, but then gets into a lot of action. If you want to get it over the head, you might be tempted to skip the first five pages. You'll only be rewarded by a few more pages of story. What you have to say about this movie is that you have no idea what will happen and you just expect something, anything, to happen. A typical bad movie is one that has absolutely nothing to do but add new characters. This is not a movie with any characters who make an appearance. There's no story. The characters seem like they had a story from another movie. They talk, dance, get up on a beach and go for drinks on the beach, but they don't stay a long time. There is absolutely no reason to believe anything except that the director thinks they can make a movie about a few people who have died on a mountain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible, it was a cheap copy of a movie that would be considered a comedy, but was terrible anyway. This movie has too many ridiculous moments, for example a scene where an entire group of thugs takes out their opponent. It was pretty bad. It had such a bad beginning, it didn't reach its full potential. The ending was really terrible. I thought the characters looked like they were in a sitcom, or an early sitcom, the whole movie was just bad. The movie reminded me of a bad comedy from the late 70's, that the producers wanted to make a real film, but decided to make something cheap. The only good thing I had was the actors. They had great characters, they had great voices, but they seemed really wooden, so the movie just seemed like it was trying to be a "fun" movie and nothing. And worst of all, the special effects weren't good enough for a horror film. The first time I watched this movie, it gave me nightmares, and I still have nightmares about it. I am glad to finally realize I didn't waste anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script and direction are a disappointing waste of a plot. I just don't understand that this was supposed to be the final word on the future of American media. It is too stupid to be filmed, too overrated, and too formulaic. The acting was mediocre, but the plot is pretty good in the way it seems like the plot. The other bad things are the ending, the bad music, and the bad humor, but I will take it that these things are not the fault of the filmmakers, and there are many actors I think can do better. I would like to see a sequel to this, if the writers wanted to work with "Newscards." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so terrible I had nightmares. And I still got a good laugh. But even after it's over I couldn't shake the feelings. I thought it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. They need to put a bigger theme into this movie to help get it up. This movie could have been a "Hilarious" movie. I only had the one laugh for that reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can hear a whisper of disgust. "Dire, the Horror Master" is so bad I can only laugh. I couldn't believe that I would ever consider watching this, and I sure didn't. However, I sure saw that other movie on TV where the "master" is a really scary person, and you can really tell that I had no idea. I felt so dumb that I even put it on the DVD, and the movie was as horrible as it sounds.  The actors who should have done better work than they did in this movie were too obviously too much.  This movie reminds me of when I rented "The Secret Horror Files", and how much was put in that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty bad, but I could enjoy it for some time. The acting was awful, especially the acting of the actors. The supporting actors were good only for their lack of talent and the cinematography was bad.  Also, I didn't like the fact that it tried so hard to break out the characters, for which it failed. Some good actors like Michael Jackson and Steve Martin and the acting was pretty good, but the plot was so bad that I couldn't remember it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Town For All" is no more than garbage... It's a movie so far from anything else. There is no magic in this movie.... And if you have a brain that can read it, you might have trouble figuring out what is going on... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am having problems with the audio quality of this film (especially the last hour) and I have read the book that it was based on, and I would not know how the plot would work if I didn't watch it. The fact that the movie is so convoluted, and the fact that it is so slow and unclutching is really just bad. If there was a good plot and even a good script, I would be enjoying this movie. Unfortunately, that's not the case. A few interesting things happened in the book and the film didn't quite go there, and everything else was pretty bad. I cannot recommend this movie, but I think you can still salvage it for a few more minutes and let me say that it isn't too bad either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really just a piece of low budget horror film... I laughed at it because I knew it was terrible but the director knew that it was absolutely terrible... After watching this film I felt like I had seen worse horror films in the past... The only good part of this film was the acting... but the acting was awful... I am ashamed to say I sat through the whole film without getting to know the actors... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is not interesting. It looks like they are going to do a sequel. Maybe.  I think if they're making a sequel then there will be some interesting characters to add in.  But I can't see that any interesting characters would be added.  The film lacks some character or action to it. It's just a bunch of boring characters.   I would really like to see the original movie and see the characters again. Maybe that could be a better story. The story seems to be interesting but it doesn't stick. The original has a lot more. I didn't know how "solved" and "solution" were involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with my wife. The ending of the movie was not well written, though it was very well acted, I don't think they're able to do anything right. It's just an over-hyped, unprofessional attempt by a producer to make a horror movie that just doesn't work. I won't be surprised if this movie's ratings are lower than its original. It is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that I don't even want to waste my time, let alone the money to see this one. It's no matter if I see the DVD, I'm not going to see it. I actually felt the same when watching this movie. It was like they put a bunch of people on one of those videos to put a movie together. It is so horrible that they decided to put it into a movie where they can make money by giving the movie a "name". I actually thought, for a moment, that it was some sort of movie. I just had to laugh in the face of a flat, stupid plot. Not even funny. The plot is pretty stupid. It doesn't make any sense. There are two sets of robots, and they go around in a couple of scenes pretending to be "worse guys". That sounds cool, but it would be so much better to give a real plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an awful movie with very little regard for the "story" and the main characters (which are actually pretty good, to be fair). In terms of the plot, it's rather predictable and just not that much fun. The acting is mediocre as well, although the girl in it is good. The scene when she finally falls in love with this guy and then moves away is horrible and just like nothing we've seen before. The idea of the movie is that she would love that guy and go into a situation where the guy would want to kill his friends. This is bad for sure because it is predictable and not amusing. The fact that the movie could have possibly made the point that the "sensuous" dude would be a "normal guy" is also bad. The movie would have been so much better if the "heroes" would have come together in the end of the film and all the other guys would have played as they did in the beginning of the show (as in the original). The only positive things about the movie are the story and the acting. But then they're too bad to make a movie with them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in my memory, EVER. The acting was awful, the script was terrible, the story was weak and the directing was bad! It really wasn't too interesting. There is a certain point of irony that the movie was made because of it's popularity, so maybe there is a reason that this movie is so bad. But I just couldn't believe that a movie made this bad. That it is called a movie is just ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. This is the second installment of a series of films that relies solely on a plot, a couple of friends and some pretty dumb actors, so I was really skeptical of this movie. It became even a joke in certain places (like the story involving the friends and a car). In the middle section, we finally got to the point. So the "plot" had some semblance of plausibility, a beginning, a story, and a beginning. But, the acting didn't even make it clear what's really going on. Not only that, the "story" was nothing like real. The characters didn't act like any real person. The dialogue lacked dialog, the camera movements weren't even real. I think this was an attempt at a satire or parody of a movie. I don't think that it had to be satire. But I think it had no substance. It could just have been plain trash. I guess I would have liked to see it for its effect, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual, it is difficult to review. It has no plot, characters, characters and especially no real acting. It is very vague and not believable. The movie takes place in a big city as a gang of thugs. It doesn't look like a gang, it seems like a bunch of hooded guys and a couple of thugs, which isn't very convincing either.   In what might be the closest thing to a plot, the story follows the events of a fight with the gang. The main character is a little girl who was killed by the gang and who later turns up for a trial in court and who has the most important role in the movie. She is kidnapped by a bunch with no real story and only a little bit of action. This is only made up because there is a part where the cops do something which they later later try to stop.  The problem with that story was that it lacks a believable story. It contains little details about what happened, and it doesn't make it believable. For instance, it features a bunch in a huge building where they get up to get a large sum of money. There are other parts of the movie that don't seem like the ones that appear to be involved in the fight, but in one case it does something so crazy and unbelievable. I would have laughed at the idea of going into the big building, and then shooting the whole thing down. What happened in the story after it is left completely untouched, and that is about as far as it goes.  This movie is another example of why people in the big city can't find something to make that they are famous for. It lacks the essential element of suspense and suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad it's funny. What a mess. I won't talk about the badness but what a terrible movie this is. I just want to die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is basically a horror movie with a plot that's completely illogical. This is so bad, I decided to watch it and just to leave the movie with disgust. The script, which is supposed to be a horror film, is so inconsistent that it has never been resolved to a point. The movie is one of those movies made that could have been better had it been put together with some plot lines. I think I'm getting more out of these movies by making this one, and that really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty lame, but a good way to fill a few hours of school. Unfortunately the movie is extremely predictable.  The movie isn't too hard to make, but it lacks an edge.   If you want to be a true "horror" movie, this is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film a major character, a female, named "Brett" (P.C.S.I.M), has just been bitten on the face by a zombie zombie. Her body has regenerated into a vampire zombie who has turned into an undead monster, but is a vampire who has not become a vampire, but only keeps his zombie-like nature alive. As the zombie, Brett has no real face and a long blonde hair. He doesn't seem to age past 60, but he wears his usual black suit, which is too long. As a zombie who doesn't age, Brett tries to fight on. He tries to kill the zombie-creature who is also a vampire and a vampire.  But this film is just boring, even for a vampire vampire. In one scene the protagonist, Brett, takes a bite of the zombie's head. It takes him five seconds to open his mouth, and he kills it.   As this film opens, Brett is at the stage of a zombie's evolution, and that should have been the first.  When the zombie dies, the vampire is still rotting, and all of a sudden, it explodes. It blows open open and comes into a house where it lands on a shelf and falls out. Brett is left out on the ground, but it also blows open a bunch of wooden shelves, and finds another, zombie who is about to be attacked by a bunch in a shed. The vampire comes up from behind and puts his head on a pile of wooden boards. There are lots of dead zombies, which you can see in the video.  It is no surprise that this film has the worst vampire vampire film ever made. In many ways, this movie was quite good, but I didn't know how. The idea that the characters had a supernatural connection with zombies is really stupid, and the fact that they had to die is really ridiculous. This is an example of how bad horror movies can get into the market. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would like to know how i thought i heard about this film: a lot of people actually thought the film was a documentary.  But i thought it was actually a documentary when i started watching it. I got a very bad impression of it. The acting wasn't that bad at all, but i think that this is probably the worst film I've ever seen. This is one of the worst films i've ever witnessed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen nothing but this rubbish, the only reason I would watch this film is because I would like to see the end of the world! However, I didn't care enough to see it so badly, the director wanted me to see his ending, but he got me down to zero.   The film was about as bad as a movie could be. I didn the story as I expected, I thought the director was good but I just couldn't see what he had to say about it. The actors weren't believable as they acted, the acting wasn't believable. The acting was not good enough to make me care what the director had to do, I couldn't imagine anything they would do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what most people call "Bats" in their hearts. It's like watching a bunch of people in a basement and they can't find a thing they'll actually enjoy watching. For instance, the "story" of one person in this film gets to the point where you are supposed to think "he should not have taken that action", even after you've read the movie and see the ending!  What's worse than watching a stupid comedy film with no story? They're supposed to be fun and entertaining, but if your brain can take anything from this stupid little movie and make it fun, you'll miss your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie I cannot even talk to. Its a mess and its a horrible mess. I mean a bad waste of money, but it does have a lot of people who could make it more awesome. Maybe the writers should write a positive review about some good movies: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is just plain bad. The main characters are annoying, the acting is terrible, and the story lacks the drama that we've seen in past films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's something in the middle of a story that has no logic and that is just a really stupid story. I would rather go with "The Day Before Last" and be able to make a better movie for my kids. The reason I give this movie 2 out of 10 is because this movie is so weak, even with "A Night Before A Day." It's not like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Legend of Bigfoot" is the most awful movie I've ever seen.  The first few scenes are terrible, as a result of a script which simply copied the original and failed to capitalize the original spirit.  I was very curious to see this movie and its original star, Kevin Taysh and (he was at the end of "Tales of The Brain") on the same tour. But the story line is basically a dead end and the entire movie consists of a couple of big stupid guys who fight, try to fight, get their shots, and go back to the big bad guy's cave. I was hoping that this movie would be a good one, and was disappointed that it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an excuse to avoid the movie of "The Devil Wines" in any sense. There are plenty of people who like "Wines", but the people who loved "Wine" would have to put in some serious thought and consideration if they were to view it.  The story is so bad that it actually made the film equivalent to "The Devils Wines". If you're going to see "The devil Wines", you better not be forced to watch this movie. The acting is awful, the camera is terrible, the story is really bad and the characters are really bad. I'm glad to see the movie was written, but this movie is just bad, no matter how much I dislike it. If you enjoy "Wins", you will enjoy it a lot more, but it's so bad, you're only going to get one movie and you're left with some good old Wines in it, and that's just not enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a terrible movie.  Not very clever or entertaining or funny at all. Although some of the acting seems interesting and I thought it was a lot of fun, but the story seemed to be boring, boring, and even worse than the average movies. The film seemed to move a little bit closer to the actual meaning of the text and I didn't really think it was worth paying any attention to. In fact, the characters were all the same boring or even dull as the others seemed to have. The director could have got away from the clichés and the predictable dialog that often seems so often, by simply using some of their very rich and colorful characters and making it look like they don't have any.  The last part of the movie seemed to go into some interesting and mysterious territory with some weird creatures that somehow knew what they were. It was so bad I felt they were going to be real bad characters, and that the movie could only be made funny for the viewers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all I don't think I can understand how they came up with this. A lot of people in my country know that the Japanese are the real actors and actors know that you must not see the actors because you will die by the time it reaches the finish line. This is ridiculous. The actors are terrible and it shows no signs of real talent except for a very few characters that are interesting and the only reason that this movie is a joke is because they had to make the characters people that look like they look like actors. The story is weak and the acting is bad. The only thing that I can say is that some good actors could have been involved in the movie and I didn't get enough of them. I think it would have been better if the actors had a bigger plot. They were great in the beginning but there are so many scenes without enough action. This movie does a lot of silly things like throwing a baby at the family's house and calling it a family movie when they are not family members. And there's the Japanese movie which had the best scene, but it's not much different in that it actually showed the family getting along and doing everything together, but even then it's just bad. I'm also afraid there's nothing in this movie that was new. It just sort of drags you to death. It doesn't try to be funny either. I have to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There was a lot of plot and story, but none of it made sense. For instance, there was a "gut" with a man that made himself into a reclining male with a beard, so it could be interpreted as being about him taking a bath. But I found it very hard to find the point. We just can't figure out why it was so hard for a guy to just go around the city with a girl. There was also a guy who just came to the town, with a bag of body bags. And even when we were looking for a date he was talking to a girl, and then they said, 'A guy?' and it's not her. How does that make sense?  There's also some stupid humor. This is a pretty bad movie, but it does have some laughs. But it's too bad to make me feel so sorry. The ending just leaves you feeling like you just wasted your life and you just felt a bad person.   The movie itself was OK, if you like a bad, cheap horror movie. But there is no reason to see it. Maybe if you have the patience and the talent to see a horror movie you can watch it, but if you don't, you'd be better off staying alone and looking for good horror films. You won't be disappointed by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a little disappointing to see this film: it is nothing original and not interesting. The acting is bad and the only part that made me chuckle was the director (who also seems to have a talent for the biker culture) in the film. Although the film itself was pretty good, the whole thing seemed to be an anti-biker gangster movie without any real substance. It is not an entertaining film at all. The two guys who are supposed to be a couple make it look as though they are the perfect couple but the whole idea of a couple in a couple is really weak, I don't even see how the movie works. I've never seen one like this one before. I also felt the director was a little too big in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of people are in the middle-of-life. They need a better movie: a mature, intelligent, story. Unfortunately, this movie is not that. The dialog is awful, the performances were bad, the production was horrible and the plot was lousy.  This movie is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie - I would like to get more time with it. It has a ridiculous plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely nothing new, it is simply a pathetic effort of a failed director to fill in a film that is supposed to be about a family of friends who take a serious risk. It is just awful, nothing more than a failed attempt to try and make something interesting. What good it has to do is to make you like it for being forced to sit through this garbage and then decide whether to pay or not. It's like watching some sort of trashy car commercial for a couple of minutes and then watch it all the way through.  In all fairness, it does do some very interesting things with a couple new characters who are just named (I think) on the show, but this movie is about one of those old characters, and since we've never seen them before, we have no idea what we're going to get. What we are left with in this movie are two strangers that just want to sleep and watch some movies and then have their cars towed. If you want to see a movie that has a plot that works, this movie cannot do it. I'm not going to recommend this movie to anyone who isn't into acting, but if you do, watch it and see that you're simply not entertained. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie, unfortunately, can't get away from its inherent stupidity. It's a shame it even made a sequel. This is the most disappointing and worst of the movie: a complete waste of its acting and a horrible script. If you like 'The Naked Ray', you might enjoy it more. Not in a good way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie that relies on stereotypes and stereotypes. There is no way that this movie does not have any intelligent message. What a movie must teach us? To me the answer is to avoid the use of stereotypes. This is simply a complete waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If a movie like "War Crimes" had so much money to be made in the time that it did, I think it would have been an impressive performance. If it was not so bad, I would like to see a movie with more quality. The only problem is that there's too much gore in it. The acting is horrible, the gore is unbelievable, and the story is simply ridiculous. There's no reason to expect any real storyline, and they are just going to repeat the plot over and over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't too much better than a car in the garage in a garage. But it does manage to have a little plot, a couple of amusing and stereotypical female characters, some jokes, and a little bit of romance in the beginning. But unfortunately the film never gets the same intensity and excitement like the Car Car sequence in Cars 2.   The original Car Car movie was supposed to be a bit more dramatic than Cars 2, so the end result is a film that drags you down to a pit of hell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film contains a few stupid moments. Its slow pacing is quite annoying and some plot twists that are completely meaningless.   At a stage somewhere between now and the final 2-3 scenes I am expecting a movie that will probably make you lose your interest.  If I had a chance to watch the original film I would have been expecting it to be so interesting and so much more interesting. I guess I got lucky so they sent a copy to me with the original version of the script. If I am to continue reading this I will certainly regret it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a comedy at all, but that is no problem. It's bad and you really feel like a big, stupid girl who knows she's really just a girl who doesn't have any common sense whatsoever. I felt like watching a comedy and watching something like a horror movie. The biggest mistake in this movie is the fact that it's so ridiculous and so stupid that it gets fun. It has a really cheap atmosphere, but the film itself is not that good.  The plot is a pretty good idea, but if you're going to watch a comedy, you'll have to wait a while to see what a plot is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of the first series and I'm extremely disappointed that the second series is getting this far out of their reach. I've seen the second part of the series but I've never seen the first one. I'll admit, the first show was well worth, but the second one, after the first, is not quite as good. In terms of story and story-telling the story is a bit inconsistent, with a little bit too many long-standing characters who end up in "other" situations and I don't think they should get their money back. That is one of the biggest complaints I have about the whole series. While I loved the first and second series, I also hated the way they were put together. The new show is almost identical to the first with some minor character changes.   The whole plot is one big mess and I have a feeling that the two series could be made more interesting without having to rely on those characters, but then I think they shouldn't have. I wouldn't really see the series even with the characters, because I don�t want to see people getting their money so quickly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't remember seeing this movie, but I think it's the worst I've ever seen in a horror movie ever. If your typical horror movie was like this one, it would have been good if it wasn't so bad. The acting was bad, the plot was bad. There was no suspense. The gore was bad to say. The characters were bad to watch, the gore was fake. I thought the director was just a guy making fun of the cheap horror movie. It made no sense to be scary or funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure if there's any correlation with the "spiral viral virus" virus, because I didn't understand what the "virus" had to do with it. I don't know how the characters reacted to the virus, but I can't imagine that they thought that. That's all the reason why the movie is awful. I guess, it would make me mad if I couldn't just watch the episode when it is available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the biggest rip off movie of this year. I have never seen a movie that has been so bad. The plot is very basic but it's just stupid! The acting is bad as well as the plot! The plot has no logic. I don't understand any of the characters. The director is simply directing the action in some part of the movie. There is no dialogue. The characters are either bad or are very stupid.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I did not enjoy this one, but I know what it did with the ratings. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a bunch of misnamed "Superheroes" movies. There are two heroes. One is Superman, and his little henchies fight against the evil Nazis. But when the evil villain is defeated, it's not Superman. Oh no! The villains are back again, this time it's the Joker, the Supers are just the guys who get their revenge and all the superheroes in the film are just their minions, the villains are their "own and they fight for all of the money".  If you are a Batman fan or fan of Superman or Spider-Man, or any other superhero movie, you will be sorry to watch this movie, because it is only the pretest for your favorite super heroes.  I hope you enjoy some time with the stupid villains of the movie, for they will make fun with you and I will be very sorry if you don't. I hope this is not the last film I will ever see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible! The camera in the beginning of the film (especially the girl in the hotel room) is so slow, there is no story. This is like a cheap movie with a bad ending, the director should take the time to write a positive review about the movie: it is about a couple of sad people who really do nothing but kill. If you have ever had some bad horror films, this is like being hit with a stick by a bear, or seeing a monster walk through a house in your neighborhood. This movie sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is nothing but pointless. The dialog is extremely weak, the acting is lousy, and the characters are bad, especially the young girl who kills her boyfriend.  The story is very predictable (you don't have to read the book, because they are not important) and the ending leaves very little surprise.  This is just a shame that this movie will be able to reach a major popularity and I am afraid to recommend this movie to people who have nothing else to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a really cheap DVD fan. I am not one of the big fanatics. The movie was extremely disappointing, I mean a lot of crap I couldn't get past. I guess the director was trying to save money.  It is about an old woman who loses her memories due to Alzheimer's Disease, which is well made for a DVD of her favorite movie, not something she would have enjoyed in her younger years. I don't understand that. What does she remember about her favorite movies? I can't imagine why she was so cheap and unassuming of herself. I cannot believe that these things she remembers from her youth were made because she was struggling for money and had a severe brain condition.  If the movie is real, please watch it with a friend. I do not recommend watching this to anyone who isn't interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does not try to be subtle. We learn that it's a man who murders an innocent woman and then tries to cover up his crimes, but the film isn't subtle enough to say that he murders his victims.  One problem with the film is that it doesn't seem like it's all that sophisticated. We are expected to think that it may have a human brain. I am just a regular film buff, and I am not expecting to find any intelligent characters or plot, so to me it just seemed like the writer had nothing but the urge to include some ridiculous acts.  I'd like to hear the movie's makers admit that they could have made a better film, and that the man had more human qualities. This just doesn't make it any less dumb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of an original film. It really reminded me of some movie commercials that would only be in a small percentage of our time, but in this one it was a huge waste of a film. I couldn't believe this film had any real plot at all, which is always a sign that it's just not intended for us. It's almost impossible to find the same characters you could see in the real movie. They were the same people who were in the original movie, they had the same motivations, except the characters who were really played by the actors in the first one. Some scenes like that were either filmed for no reason or they were just made to look like they were in a regular movie. And of course, the plot was just stupid. I'm glad to say I managed to get hold of some of the actors who weren't in the movie but there were some people who did manage to get in. But at the end of the movie, I can't blame anybody for being in it. The movie just made no sense at all. I thought the ending was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the movie, the film was shown at a local theater and the audience just wanted to get up and look at it. What was it? You guessed it was a'stacked up' movie that is made for a movie: it doesn't have a plot! There was little, if anything, to help the viewer understand the story. The movie had the word 'Pete' and 'Pequete' written in the movie. But the only person who came to see the movie was John Hays. He wasn't really interested in watching the movie and he said it was awful! The movie was bad, but the story seemed interesting at the end, but it didn't.   The movie is now on DVD. It is just a waste of a minute and a half. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Last Boy" is the sort that screams for more original, yet somehow it comes off like a cheap, cheesy movie, that in spite of its title it still doesn't feel like a true tale of a teenager. This is not a new idea - it's one that is so far past self-dubbed trash that even a minor comedy could make an impression. Unfortunately the movie doesn't really land on a realistic level as it is mainly a story of a kid who has to live in an abandoned community and do babyshop, while the director is playing himself as a child in his own room. And as such a childish piece it is the worst part of a film: its characters are so poorly drawn, they look like people who have never even had the slightest involvement in their own lives - as well as some strange looking teenagers that look like they're playing teenagers. I have read some positive reviews about this film - but unfortunately I have seen it and not seen any decent commentary. It seems to me that everyone involved in the film simply doesn't want to have a serious discussion about it - it seems to be like a piece of trash. I am considering buying it only because it's so disappointing, and it looks as if you've never seen it before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been around for a while, and is now getting a lot more attention on it. The only thing that really gets out of the storyline is the ending of the movie. In the ending, a young girl gets a tattoo that she needs to pay her girlfriend back for. Why?? Who are these two women? (Why does this have to be a girl to pay to get a tattoo?) After a while after she leaves, her boyfriend finally kills his wife. The problem is the girl's boyfriend keeps a tattoo on his hand, so he decides to tattoo that girl off on her face to be sure that the tattoo will stay. Then the movie ends, with the girl hanging out on a beach and seeing some of the other people that she's had tattoo on her. The irony of this is that her tattoo is one of the least common tattoos in her collection of tattoos. If you're a tattoo artist, you'll see it. It's so bad, and I didn't enjoy the movie enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is about a bunch of friends who have been drunk at their local bar. They get drunk for fun before they get kidnapped by some guy on a yacht. In the end they escape from some mysterious kidnapping. However, their kidnapper tells them that their friend has killed his friends. After their kidnappengers leave, they realize that they're the guys who have murdered their friends. The main plot happens after a drunken goodie and a drunk guy leave a dance party where the goodie is drunk. They are then in a position where their friend is waiting to get back. The goodie decides to leave in a drunken haze and the goodies leave as well.  I'm assuming these people were drunk and going to the party anyway. However in the end the badie decides not to leave so that he doesn't get killed.  So it's not a good movie so that i would give this movie a 2. But it isn't that bad either. I give it 1 1 2 3 1 2 2 1 3 but that 1 3 isn't as bad as it sounds. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a bit of a horror film fanatic and I really didn't understand when I was going into this horrible movie. The only reason I was even able to stay awake through the entire time was because it was so bad and horrible that I actually couldn't stop watching it. If I could have been able to watch it the way the producers wanted me to, I would have laughed at the ridiculous premise. The acting was very bad and very fake. I knew I was watching a cheap movie but I was still expecting something more interesting than just throwing a cheap fake movie out in front of a decent movie. I really wanted to see some funny horror films but there was nothing in the way of funny to watch. I was not the least bit amused by the "spaghetti" scenes, but I couldn't laugh at them. I just wanted a better movie with some humor but it didn't happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie contains an absurd plot that involves a little bit of necrophancy. The plot is an empty plot (that would be suitable for a low budget B-movie, anyway), but it isn't quite as useless as most movies would be. The film contains no dialog, no scene which is supposed to be dramatic, no camera shots, and no musical score. This is the biggest problem with the film. Although it has a bit of fun at times, this is simply bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie on television, with some background music and background music music. What a terrible movie... you don't get more terrible than this.  Now, if you are reading this movie as a film of course, you may know about it from other movies: it's a classic piece of trash. They had been set up in a small town somewhere in the Midwest. The acting is a big rip off of the "My Favourite Movie" from the 1960s. I didn't even watch it because I had no idea what the characters looked like. They looked like some of the kids that we used to rent from. The other actors were very poor, and the scenery was terrible. Some of the scenes were boring or had nothing more than background music. The director gave some sort of plot to make a movie, but no one got a chance.  I would suggest that if you want to see this movie, don't even try it. This is basically a comedy that you might find in the store. If you do, I would say avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is very poor by far the worst I have seen in a long time. I think the director is just an apathetic person who doesn't care about the world and only cares about some of the people in the film. This is not a good film, it's not really interesting or original, it has really no good plot, the characters are dull, the camera is awful, and it feels like there is something going wrong in the story. The film is terrible in its own way but I can't really blame the director for using some obscure slang for the film to add "real" or "realistic" or to "realize" the film (which is probably why I missed the idea of real and real life). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am the type of person that is always looking for a real movie that they can make. This one was not one of those things. The acting was bad and the script was crap. They made me laugh. The one time there was some good acting, a scene was good and the director showed a true passion, but the movie was too much of a waste. This is not worth a single watch. This film was not even worth buying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first of all movies that I've seen that I had to turn away from. It just got to me. This movie is all about some stupid little guy who is about to be sentenced to jail for breaking into a bad bank robbery. Why should we care? Who would you call? A movie about "break ins"? Who would care? When you get to the end of the movie to see what the people are going to do, that's all. What was I supposed to do? What was going to say? Who was gonna get stabbed and put in jail? Why are you even making a movie about a real bad movie? Well, that answers no questions, so I don't even want to add it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really just lacks the magic and magic that other movies of this genre provide. This is because it lacks the story to be believable. The script is terrible.  The story is too convoluted. The plot is unbelievable. The whole movie is a predictable, predictable, unbelievable plot. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 is because I don't believe in this type of movie. It just can't help but be so ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the biggest disappointment in a movie ever! I rented the DVD and read the synopsis with my wife. I knew I was going to pay $200 to rent this film, and it was pretty sure that it would be the same, but I didn't think this was the right movie to rent. This is far from the movie that I was expecting. The acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and the direction is bad! I wanted to rent the movie because I actually like a lot of John Lennon songs (especially the first couple of songs), but this movie had little more appeal than the Lennon song. I also don't know if it would've been good if it were a movie with songs, but since it was a big money movie, I think it was poorly filmed. I was looking forward to seeing it, but the rental was $250. It was probably the worst movie I have seen in quite some time. I rented it at a rental store and it went straight into the garbage bin. This was the only movie I had ever rented, and I know what is best for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that you can almost forget how it's about the story of Jesus. In every other word, there is nothing about the Bible, Jesus' first message and the resurrection. When the whole movie plays out, the only thing you see is a bunch of guys on a boat. How did it happen? The whole movie follows a bunch more of people, and the thing is there are no people involved. It just falls apart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of people have written positive reviews about this movie: "It was cute, but I didn't think too much about it." "It is OK  The problem is,  'Lucky Girl,' is not about cute-girl.  I didn�t understand the plot, but it wasn�t scary.  The film was just boring, and the two-thirds of the film were just not even relevant to the story, they were just plain-faced stereotypes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just because there are some of the same actors who did this "Dark Angels" (who never worked for the same director) who are in this movie. I thought the two scenes were a bit better in the original Dark Angels film. The other scenes were not as bad as this movie has turned out to be. The only reason I gave this movie a one was because it was a movie with some fun actors who I knew from the original film. In this one, the actors did not bring their characters to life and it doesn't make any more sense. The original was much better than the sequel, and the sequel was worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just bad to watch. If it is a horror movie like "Rage Of Evil" then you get an extremely entertaining horror movie. However this one is absolutely not one of those. There are just a few disturbing moments that really bother you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen, with no real plot, storyline, or the slightest sense of plot. There is no connection with anyone and no real payoff. They just shoot a bunch of people in a prison, one person at a time, and shoot some in a car, and then finally, one is killed, and everybody is dead. Oh no. The one guy who got killed was an electrician. The cop who did the killing was also a psychopath. It is not like there was some sort of plot where the killer finally comes back to jail after being released from prison and being sent to the hospital. What about the cop who was sent on the road by the killer who got arrested? The cop had only been sent to prison by a killer, a killer in a gas station robbery. How does that person get released in a town? And he had also been arrested for his first offense.  Well, that's about right. Oh dear, I know what you are going to say. You are going back to that. The movie is about how the murderer kills a cop and then kills the cop that killed him. And you are not going to see it. There are only some parts of the story that make sense, but they are not shown in the movie. The only real twist that makes sense in this movie is that the killer is now a serial killer that has moved away from the prison and is on the run. He is a serial murderer who was once killed by the cop, and the police do not know who killed him, but you can guess that he will soon be killed by another cop who lives in a neighborhood.  The killer was also very good at murdering people. The killer had an idea that this is the only time he could do it. He had enough money and a gun so that he couldn't stop doing it. The cops are on the case. Well, he killed more people but no one seems to care, but even though it was a murder, it was hard to tell the killer anything. The camera on the cell is not moving around, and there is a scene with a truck that was being pulled over.  This is an OK movie, but if you are a big fan of horror movies, you might be interested in seeing something from them. Maybe the guy who was killed was on the train. Oh, there was another killer in the car who was also killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie that I have ever seen in an hour. I thought it was like a cheap horror movie - not even a horror flick. This movie is about a small town of people who do not realize that their town is evil, and it's about an evil doctor who tries to kill people by trying to cure them of cancer (if you are stupid, you have done that, so please keep your finger on the remote control when you start a conversation with an evil lawyer). Then this doctor is killed by an animal with some very questionable animal-killing abilities.  Now, in the original version of this movie, this doctor was killed in a helicopter crash, and I thought the movie was supposed to be about how the townspeople reacted when the scientist died. It was about how they decided to put the doctor back on life. It turns out that it was a lot more complicated than expected and was nothing but pointless for a movie.  I'm not sure what was the original story for this movie. I'm wondering if this is all about the story for the original, or just the idea that it is the town itself. In some other movies, the story has gotten much more complicated. One good example I had watched was The Devil Wears Red when I got into the film:  You might see it in some weird, demented, scary movie. In this case, it was really stupid. That was the only reason that the movie got so much attention.   But now, you probably won't want to see it. Even after you've seen it, you will find yourself wanting to leave it at that point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, there's a reason why this is called "Zebra's Place", and it isn't. Even so, it is a movie whose only redeeming trait is that it is really dumb. It's no wonder that this movie had so much going in, given its source material, but it does not have a sense of urgency. For example, it was a lot like "Zombie 4", with the zombie characters and their endless, endless killings. The plot, while being very basic, has a somewhat interesting premise, but the acting and acting are lacking. The main character, Walter White, is not even given enough screen time to develop an emotional attachment to the main character. Even the main villain, the villain himself, is so obviously evil that it really does not help.  The movie is also very slow, and even when it does begin to move, the acting is not really convincing enough to make anything out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When watching the original "Cibs" I was expecting to find a very interesting film with real actors. Well the film has nothing to do with that and fails to deliver anything that is interesting. I thought that the main character was a bit too much likeable but not the entire movie was bad. The acting was pretty good, especially the acting of the female cast. Unfortunately the main villain in the film had a really annoying voice, although she was the most interesting. Also the script was a little bit silly and was extremely predictable. I just gave this movie a 2 out of 10 but I really didn't like the idea of the film becoming a reality. The only reason that I gave this a 7 out of ten was because it was not the most scary movie but it had a good ending. But this is only a 2 in a bad way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was awful...I can't see if you guys actually have an idea of how to do a movie that wasn't so bad? In the beginning I thought they had done something right in that first scene. But then they proceeded to completely re-write the story. Not only that but the fact that the movie is about a "girl" and not a "she-girl" is unbelievable.  The problem I am really having with this film is that they should have taken a bit more time to do something that would really create something special. I have seen plenty of great, and great and good comedies in my lifetime but this is simply a cheap shot, with a weak plot, a lame script, a bad ending and an unending story. The idea is good but the way they tried to make the story into a story is bad.  In conclusion, I would recommend watching this film with the exception of a few minutes. You will likely find this to be boring and not very amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not even worth a second for me. The acting is horrible. The direction is poor, the script is bad, the directing is bad. The plot is too convoluted and too convoluted for me to take in a lot of what is happening. The film is bad in it's attempt to make a coherent, thoughtful, interesting, and interesting movie; a movie that is neither fun nor engaging nor original. The fact that it was made in the United States is disturbing, I would watch another, but I'm not sure I will. But I have to admit, this movie was the worst I've seen since I've done work on many films. I am also embarrassed to admit that I'm able to sit through this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on TV and thought it was pretty funny. It didn't even come close to being funny at all. They just sort of looked like a typical, silly story that you'd expect to see on a regular TV sitcom, and it just wasn't funny. You get the feeling that they've never done anything funny. They tried to set the characters in a movie-like environment and just then, as the scene drags along the road, you'd see yourself in a coffin somewhere. This movie is really bad. The funny moments are pretty good, like the funny moment where the car is getting pulled by a tow-chair and the woman gets killed. The problem is that there is nothing, except some funny funny moments, that makes the movie fun. The actors were pretty good as well, but the movie is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script was pretty good with a fairly simple premise and an interesting idea. However, it proved to be another of the worst movies I have ever seen in the entire galaxy. The story was horrible, with an awful ending and the fact that it was a "spaces" movie is also pretty bad. The plot itself was totally unsatisfying. I tried to like the idea of a movie of "spets" and it just didn't do so. The actors didn't come to a believable role, with the exception of Dr. Strider. I only got some of the most interesting parts, and the ending was the least disappointing. If you can see it in your imagination you might consider going ahead and buying a VHS copy for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie after seeing the other trailers, and I was hoping that it would turn out to be good. I was very disappointed, though. It's just a terrible waste of celluloid and no story to go along with it. I felt it was just plain old-fashioned acting, nothing new and new, and a total waste of time. I won't see it again. If you want to rent this movie, go to a movie that's obviously made by some sort of group, and you'll enjoy it, because you're supposed to see the other people in it. If there is even a plot, the actors should be the actors. This movie is horrible. I know you'll like this movie; it'll appeal to your inner child. But you won't enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a bit disappointing. It lacked the charm that it had in the past. The acting was weak; the story lacked any substance. It also lacked the dramatic nature that one would expect from a Hollywood thriller. The script was weak, but the fact that the acting was so bad, gave me pause. I give it 2.3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've been reading the press about the film, you know that it's full of nonsense. It's a pretty big waste of an independent film that has been completely written and staged with no backing from the producers. It starts with a girl who has been kidnapped and held for weeks, only to be discovered that she was stolen. The next thing that happens is that she has to give up all her money to help the kidnapper. Now let me recap. This movie was filmed in a big factory in China where they were constantly pumping off Chinese workers into a very slow process. The film does a terrible job of getting to the stage quickly, which leads to a lot of empty situations. For example, a guy is running errantly around the street on a motor bike as he looks at a bus passing through the city while a woman is at the same table trying to avoid getting caught in the street. She notices something hanging out to her feet so she goes to help him out. She sees the man and she goes off as fast as he. He just keeps running in circles. You're wondering what he sees. The guy runs off into the wind. What happens next is that he falls through a window. He's in a car, he's going into the car as fast. Then he's thrown on the floor. The wind is tearing the air. Then, the car stops and we have this fight scene. The scene is slow, but the director is at least the first to be able to tell you what's going on. Then all is chaos.  My guess is that it had a budget to do more and better. But this is completely incompetent and terrible from the beginning. There are some very interesting shots and great photography, but when you think about it it, no one can tell you anything. The director just gives you the idea that it was a real film.  If it wasn't for the producers, it would be amusing. I thought it was the most ridiculous piece of crap and didn't even like it. The only good parts of this film were made about a movie called "The Greatest Race". I think I may have to be on the record for some of this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise was that all the soldiers in the movie were killed in a plane crash and were saved only by a woman. The women were apparently psychic (apparently) that they knew the plane was bombing so they brought the other soldiers to safety. This is so ridiculous that it can only be kept in the minds of viewers who haven't bothered to look into the background of the characters.  The characters seem to take no time to realize that the situation and situation will lead to their deaths. They are just left to assume that their lives will be temporary and they will likely die the same way they died in the Vietnam War, rather than having their deaths being reported as part of a routine act of war.  A movie like this doesn't have much in common with other action films and it doesn't even make it look interesting for those who care about military action. Most people who are aware of war movies only seem to have a vague sense of what they are doing. If you've seen one, you know exactly how it ends, and you never know why it ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really lame film. Even worse than "Jokes". I've seen a few people that seem to know the actors but don't know how they are. The film had two actors and a couple of actors. But the film was mostly empty except for the film's original message. I had a little trouble watching it. I was supposed to believe all of the actors would have done a great job if they had a body that would have the same face on. I'm sure the actors are doing a great work in their roles, but it's pretty clear the director had no idea. I'll give this movie a 3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really know how bad the movie was until the last scene. For one of those movies that "didn't try", this was pretty bad. A few scenes were interesting but then the plot started to get confusing. The acting was pretty good in parts, although there weren't quite as good as "The Bourne Files", but it had its problems as well. The characters in this movie were either dumb or pretentious. The best thing about the film is the music. Maybe the acting would have been better, but the movie itself was a poor performance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a hottub who likes the movie "Escape" from Robert DeNiro, the best of Robert De Niro's work. This movie seems to be made in that form, but it is really an empty movie. The acting is terrible, the plot is weak, the storyline is weak (the beginning to the movie is about a plane crash, a boy is trapped in the plane and being transported into an ice cave and being sent to a laboratory), the plot features no character relationships, the characters are weak, and the plot isn't a story, as I said earlier. I guess this was made because it was a movie about a documentary ("The Journey") and that documentary would have been filmed a lot like this one and would have a plot about a car crash and a boy being transported on a plane. If you are looking for a movie that contains actual characters that act, this is about the same kind of movie. If that happens, you'll be disappointed. The movie can have been written better than the movie itself. This could have been better, and I believe this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not surprised to see this film at this point, considering the time that it was released. But I do feel like an old film is much more painful than the current one and it takes time to get to the point of the movie. This film really looked like a bad piece of film, nothing in it made sense, and the plot seemed to have a major flaw that I cannot forgive. While the music is good, it's terrible in the way it was written. I'll be honest, I had a couple of hours of gooeing time watching the movie after finishing it. The dialogue is not good, the characters are terrible, and it's got some sort of plot going on, but this film has nothing to do with the current movie. It's the standard film made so we can put the value of this film and its complete lack is truly embarrassing. What is the message? Some people have made it so we would be tempted to spend more time viewing it, but I don't want you to spend any more time in this movie. In truth, I think it's more insulting to me than the movie it tries to claim to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'll be looking at the film again just as I was when I saw this movie. I'm an obsessive and I know that if you ever want to be treated like that, you will make yourself sick. The only good thing I can say is that it isn't that bad. I saw the original "Honey Bunny" in its first two years, and I didn't care for it for very long. In fact, it still made me enjoy it. I've watched "Hipps Day" twice and I just couldn't care less. In other words, this movie can only be compared to other dumb movies that have come out.  This is bad because the story and the action are pretty good. While the characters are wooden, they are very simplistic, and they are completely predictable. The director knows that the script will have to be pretty good to save us from the terrible acting. But this movie will fail because the director was too stupid to make this movie! So, the story would never be about the real person's life; it would be about a bunch of people, and the main character would die in the movie, and then be replaced by a random person who had just finished watching the movie. The action would only have to include a scene where the person in the "Humblers" is in the coffin of a car.  I won't give the film a 10 (because it's pretty good) because this is the movie that has ruined "Hollywood" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only does the premise of this movie make sense, but it doesn't get very much out of it. What it does is some really awful jokes - like a 'Bored-Era'-type movie where a priest is murdered by a drunk priest and his wife kills him - and a woman who falls in love with a 'Dr. Tenderly' - and of course, she wants to get a little bit of fun. Oh dear Lord, how did I get in this movie? A woman who fell in love to a guy who is not married yet is sent away for "educating" at some random farm. When she returns back home, a couple of thugs and some thugs appear and kidnap her and take her away, with the aid of a priest (of course) who kills them. The woman (who was the priest) is rescued and then returns to her home. There is a lot of ridiculous lines about her husband and how stupid she was, but there isn't any actual plot. At one point where I thought I was laughing, I suddenly couldn't even make out more of it, and I can't say this is the way to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise was that this "super-tape" was about a little guy who could hypnotize people into believing they were being hypnotized. That would have been an interesting concept if it were actually plausible. Unfortunately, the director of the movie didn't really know how to develop the idea.  And the action scenes weren't very good either, because they just weren't real.  If you want to see a real thriller, don't waste your time watching this movie. There is no plot. The plot isn't much of a plot.  The plot is weak. It's just an excuse to say that it can be done. A typical case of a bad comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only a big bad movie but a big dumb one of the boringest movies I have ever seen. A story about a mysterious monster on the edge of a city and its effects on the human race. It's not even a good story, nothing like a "Lord Of The Rings", nothing like the horror movie, not even as a story.  The ending is totally pointless, it isn't interesting or funny at all. The director even tells me that it's a little bit funny. I was so bored that I had to watch it again and again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Stall (2)" is the kind of trash that i can only imagine as the kind with "The Ring" it is. At least the production is good. But it's not. It's about a guy who can pick a girl to kill a young boy with a body that is too soft to kill. So we see the story of a guy with a large beard, a big penis, and a girlfriend who has the same body he wants to pick. But the good guy is in a coma and doesn't get his arm back until the girl gets pregnant with her new boyfriend. But this is so bad, it's so dumb, and the acting is so terrible, that you won't even want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is no more than a low budget horror film - which would have been a fine film - with a fairly good cast and a decent set, but it simply fails. The dialog is too fast, the acting is terrible - the story is nothing but bad. The characters are dull and the cinematography is lousy. The director of the film has no idea what to do with the story - he just seems to care about the actors, but they don't have much to do. This is probably the worst horror film ever made, and not really a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a complete waste of some genius's idea of "make movies about the end of the century." It's a complete failure. There is no plot to the story or story line, just some stupid characters, a story that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie, or anything else in it. A lot of great actors could easily do it in a movie. But then what? That's what I think this movie has in it, and the characters are awful, even the "villain" characters are not developed at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of "Little Boy" is pretty bad - really nothing happens, only strange events and the girl gets pregnant (or is pregnant), and a little boy is adopted into an orphanage, with the child being orphaned by his older sister. As it's said, the protagonist's only son has a sister, and she dies when the other boy dies. It's not a movie - it's nothing like movies I'd seen in the past. This is the same as "Hitch Mabits", "The Expendables", "Gremlins 2", etc. The only thing that's worth remembering about this is that the boy's uncle (a pretty good actor) makes an ungodly comment about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot, the acting and the photography are extremely bad, so it is no wonder what the director thought of it. This was bad acting, bad directing, bad script and bad cinematography, terrible cinematography and bad acting. I thought this is the worst film I have ever seen. A shame to see a movie with the stars of the new movie: Hollywood's biggest stars and the director in a car. The biggest reason I don't see "big stars" is, they do not act as they should. It doesn't matter if you are a director and you get a budget from an unknown studio. How did they get a 10 or 10.3 million dollars? A lot of stars can act and be in big films, but if you make something like that, you don't know how actors act. It's like getting a 10.9 million dollars and selling a movie to a store: you're lucky to make 10.1 million dollars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a film maker and I find this to be a truly awful film:  This film features a cast that doesn't appear to be anywhere near to make sense.  The premise, which I think would only make it mildly amusing if the movie was made on the road in a large group, is that a drunk is trying to have a normal conversation with a cop (who is obviously a racist cop) and she makes a homophobic joke about it (that includes being referred to as a "winkie" or "chattie". I mean, what do you say that? You never heard that from the cast.  But this movie is just awful.  I mean all the other elements of the film, like the way they shoot the car in the background; this is just the way the director wants to make a comedy movie that is all about, and it's just the same as the other "foul" films he's made.  He wants to be funny and yet he keeps failing to do so. It's embarrassing to watch this horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i watched this movie at the first public screening in Toronto (where the film had its original release) and at the last screening in Sydney (where it's first release was).... I can't say that this movie is the worst of the recent Canadian releases.... but it really is not the best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just because they had something special, they don't deliver anything to make any sense.  I find this movie very boring, not interesting. I don't know why anybody even bothered to see it. The movie is basically a re-do of "DREAM WITH FIRE." There's some funny moments, but it doesn't really add much to anything. If you like this movie, I suggest you skip it and stick to another movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's like a child's toy. Well, at the end of the movie you're supposed to have an opportunity to catch a fish, but if you didn't have any fish then you get a little bit of a headache and can't wait to catch that one. It is also a lot like a few of the old movies where you see the same guy in every movie. This is one of the worst of the movies ever. It has nothing special to make, and is nothing good, it's just a very bad movie and that's all the reason why I gave it a rating of 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is bad. You never get to know who's a killer. The only way I can get into it is the guy playing it is named "Lassen". He was the only person who could get in. The movie is only about an actor playing "LASSen" for a movie. It's about the real Lassen. He has no idea what he's doing. When the film gets to the point where you realize there's no real LASSen in it, you're left asking yourself what happened to make the film.  I couldn't put it better than the title: "Lattard's Last Stand". When I was watching this film, I couldn the tell which actor was playing Lassden. It doesn't matter. Just try and keep watching it and see if it's better. I never really enjoyed it. I only wish I saw the whole thing. It didn't matter at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first movie I watched where I felt a bit nauseated. If I'm ever in a movie I'll be the one to make it so. I laughed when I saw the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As a child of the early days of this film, I remember watching this movie in 1976 and being quite disgusted with it. I couldn't understand why this movie was called "Tugging the Wield". It's about as dumb as it is to me to sit and watch it, and at the end I didn't even want to see the actors again. The premise (that the little guy is in a car and that he is a huge monster who must destroy the town) was fairly good. Unfortunately, by the last 30 minutes of the movie it is just hopeless, and I found the only conclusion I could conclude was that it wasn't even that dumb.  My rating is 8/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two episodes were the biggest waste of the series. Two of the scenes in the original had a great plot, but they were dull, not much better than the original. I can't believe that they even had one line in their series (I can't remember) and their character's were so bad, I was really expecting this to be a great movie. Unfortunately, I just found out that one of the actors (the young Anthony Lemoyre) just quit. It's not just that, because he seems to have a great story to tell!   I can only laugh with the rest of this movie, but I have to admit, I like watching "The Way of Life" better than most of the original series (it was much better), so I just can't watch the original show. I don't know why this was even made. If the original cast was better, this show is a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have to watch this film, you will be disappointed. The acting is bad, the story is predictable and the plot is terrible. I thought "Strayer's House" would have turned into a classic, scary thriller but instead it just shows a few more tricks in a weird way. I think the director needed a different concept. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film begins with a seemingly normal scene that has a number of notable characters in it. In the early scenes, each of them appears in various situations and, in that way, they never get to have much to do with one another. This is what I called it in my opinion. There is some minor character development in the movie, but it is basically nothing that makes sense. When each of the characters are asked to speak, it seems like the other characters just wants to talk and not talk. I think that it's because they are so stupid. It doesn't make any sense and has no purpose at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so bad that it is a shame that I will even watch it on the History channel. I was looking forward to seeing it when it came out. I went to see it when I was expecting it to be a film that would appeal to my taste and was disappointed by what I saw. While I could find some parts of it to relate to the history of the United States, the direction was poor, and the content was really poorly written. It was bad. I'm a man who would have liked this movie more, but sadly it was very predictable and I don't see myself coming in at all. Even if it wasn't bad, I couldn't really find anything else to recommend to do with this movie. The cast, which was OK in other words, was very poorly cast. The dialogue was terrible, and most of the movie was completely incomprehensible. I could probably only watch it once. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After reading the other comments regarding the bad movie, I can understand that it is a very complicated movie and I am interested to read the complete plot. However, the plot is not the same as the other reviewers, and I believe you will find the truth difficult to realize.  Firstly, I will say that the movie contains a lot of blatant anti-Americanism in the beginning. While the opening scenes are funny and funny in a way, the ending of the movie is simply bad and the plot twists are poor.  The movie also contains a few scenes that are completely incomprehensible and some scenes that do not make sense. You will also find some scenes completely irrelevant and senseless. The scenes in the end, are not even very interesting to look at, although the characters in the movie have some interesting lines.  On the positive side, the movie does have a few interesting scenes, and some very interesting scenes. Unfortunately, the film doesn't reach the same level that is considered a masterpiece. But, that's not the end of the story... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the reviews and thought they were right.  I was wrong.  The characters in the movie were the most awful, most uninteresting. And the plot was about as shallow as it was in real life.  Even when watching a movie that is based on the real world, it is boring to watch and don't get to know who we're supposed to find in the story.  It's got to get better to the actors and the script and to watch over the plot and just not get bored or watch the movie.  A really cheap movie at the expense of what was given to the director and an interesting but at the least not entertaining movie. It's bad to see a movie like this with a mediocre cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is some good stuff in this movie, but the whole movie is like an awful version of Shakespeare's "Richard III", with only the end to keep you entertained and, hopefully, alive. The movie could not have been made as the book, with Shakespeare's character in full glory and all the drama was replaced by a horrible monster. This movie could only be made for "The Curious Case Files".   The movie should have been the end of the story, but unfortunately is not. The storyline focuses mainly on Richard's life from a previous time, but there is not even much more to talk about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an interesting idea, but I just can't understand the plot. For example, you need a small computer with nothing to run it. Then you can just get a computer and then all of the functions that make the computer is like magic. This is completely unbelievable. I'm not sure why these people just want a computer. When the person gets a computer, he's got all sorts of computer programs. Then they don't understand it all and just do that in one minute. You can see how there are little programs that make computer stuff. Then people get mad and you get mad. But they should see a movie that will make them understand that they don`t understand. I have a feeling that this is a joke movie. They should just learn that they can't just buy a computer just like anything else. They're making this just for fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was an embarrassing attempt at a "Hollywood Movie" with a cast that consisted of a couple of "Dalmatians" actors and a bunch of thugs. There are some parts that are entertaining but the overall story is stupid. In an effort to make this look like "Dorin's 2" I think this would make it even worse.  The story is supposed to have something to do with a little girl who runs around getting attacked by a bad gang of killers who were supposedly the gang. That seems a plausible storyline, but unfortunately doesn't have much substance in it, and just fails to have much weight. In fact the entire gang's goal is to be more popular with kids who have little heartaches, so they would go after the girl with a red wig and make off with her. Unfortunately this doesn't make a big deal and would really hurt the girls, who are in a panic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Not only was the first time I saw this film, I can recall at least four times that it was the worst film I have ever seen. It's not even funny, but not even hilarious.  There are many scenes that were absolutely unbelievable. The only movie i can remember in my life has been one of those scenes. It was only done by a drunk college students who had the idea to try to make a joke to his brother.  The only good thing I can remember was when one scene was done.  It was hilarious. It made no sense. But, at the end of the film, there's another scene. I'll never forget that scene. So, if your eyes are closed for more than 3 minutes, you can wait until it's over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As usual, the film was a total failure in showing the complexity of the US-Mexican border. From beginning to end, there is a total lack of foresight and awareness by the makers, which is a poor reason to let them off the production of this film. The film is too simplistic and doesn't do much more than a basic "Athie's Girl" movie which has never been seen. I watched it in Mexico and my opinion is that the movie was about some sort of kidnapping, that some of the characters were in an affair with a local prostitute, and that there is some sort or some sortof drug operation. As if the plot itself was totally unrealistic, since the actors did nothing to save the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad. The plot was predictable and not even a good story. I was afraid of seeing this movie because of its potential to be a disturbing horror movie that just wouldn't get better. The acting was terrible. I wanted to go into a fight with this guy to get some action. I didn't even find out why. The director and actress were horrible. I could not get past the horrible acting. I think if this is in a dark basement somewhere, I would have enjoyed it. Not even the director was able to act in this movie. The only reason I decided to see it was because of a few scenes that were in it. I have read some reviews that say "in a real house" is a great way to film a horror movie. This is not that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film would be interesting if it had a plot, something that would have the same kind of story as the series. Alas it does not. It is very poorly written, and the actors don't seem to be the same. The film has a few moments where I felt a little bit sympathetic to the characters. But the acting is simply bad. The ending is really bad. In a movie like this one you feel like there is a slight closure to the storyline. Unfortunately it's just not there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   First of all the original plot is ridiculous. If they had to do the movie, it would've been pretty silly. What we can say is that they needed more actors and less story. They were a couple of actors who seemed to be good but were too old for this. You know that I'm not exactly a good actor who was involved in a movie that they used as a stand in and were supposed to be a movie. This is just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this film was a bit late. I had read that it was directed by David Zeskind, and when I saw it I was completely unimpressed. I still have doubts about the plot, but it still isn't a good movie. It is so bad, that I actually don't want to see it again, even for a moment. For example, there are many scenes in which the characters are shown to be mad or mad. The plot is so pathetic, that it takes away most of the original purpose. In particular, it fails completely to be a plausible film about life, and it makes no sense to me to have to talk about it. That aside, the whole plot seems so weak, that there is little sympathy for the characters. And the script is so terrible, that the movie itself doesn't make sense at all. A lot of actors are so good that they need to be paid so that it doesn't come across as crap. It was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies that comes out after the mid-eighties, when I was a little too stupid to understand. It's very predictable and is no better than a mindless trash-fest of the early, but not so great. As I say, it's not great, but it doesn't really have a good reason. We just don't have the right imagination. What was the plot? Who was the guy playing the kid? We don't know. But as we see the movie's plot, it just has no storyline. Even a decent story doesn't make you care about it. The plot is a waste. I don't think the director got it right. I think he had a great idea, but he was too stupid. I just couldn't figure out who the kid is. He seems like a pretty good guy, but really, I can't get excited for him to be in the movie. He's too old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I was expecting this film to be interesting, and I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately it turns out to be another piece of crap. I didn't even like the plot at the beginning - it seemed like another, more predictable, plot. The story is obviously one that's so predictable, you wonder how they get to make it. If there were some sort of plot, I would like to see a real plot, something that isn't so predictable. But they give you so little background, the acting is just bad. The "sister" character only seems to be a bit more naive than the father. I also wonder if he is an evil person, but he's so much more than just. The plot was good, but I'm sure the producers had to pull something like it because it was supposed to make me think that the brother is in a serious way, so that he could possibly find a cure, even though there was no way for the brother to do that. I was also disappointed that they didn't get the brother much more screen time than the sister. It seemed like they had just wasted a lot of screen time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot's too long, and it lacks any significant story to make it worthwhile. It doesn't help the "clue" in which the plot is so badly written. There are too many unnecessary scenes to make this movie worthwhile, which is too bad. A few very annoying and needless scenes of gore are also omitted, which are not a reason to dislike the film. This must be one of the worst films ever made. I give this bad movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Hijab" is not really an interesting show, but it can only be a terrible one. Some of the dialog is interesting, but they are not so good. The premise is pretty good though, but then, you get the idea that the plot is about a hazing of the boys, and that the boys get mad because of it, which has no relevance whatsoever, or is at best a very poorly conceived one. Even if they were the actual boys, the acting is OK, but the movie is really awful. The acting is bad enough to make it worth sitting through, and the humor is only in the worst place. I had really hoped to like it, but just could not get it through. I think the movie would be better if it was based in a sitcom. That would be more interesting and it would make me happier to watch it than it does, but I just couldn't bring myself to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my last appearance in the film, but it's really an awful one. I have seen many people who can't understand the meaning of "Dorsey" if you look closely at the film itself. They can't see anything like "Bizarre", "Fiasco", "Titty", etc. The characters are so bad, and the dialog is terrible. This is my only 2 minutes of film history. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is weak, the acting is poor and the whole film is just dull. There's an overused theme (the killer's cell) that is painfully absent (aside from the murder itself) and a few lines about the killer's wife's behavior in their early years that are pretty funny but forget to be relevant. In the beginning the camera gets close to the killer, but only for a moment. The camera never fully connects with the killer. It seems like the killer is having problems with his son. After that a scene plays out between his son and the killer...and in one scene, he hits the killer on the nose with a car.   There's also some pretty bad stuff in the story. A group of friends of the killer are on a trip and they suddenly decide to go on another trip (and see that they are about to meet with the family), but in the middle of the trip, they discover that the killer has been killed...and then they get a brief glimpse of a little girl who killed the killer (as she's running for her mother) and are almost taken on a car for her parents' trip. That is pretty cool, but this is obviously not a good way to introduce this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad, but at least it didn't make me like it. The opening scenes of the movie were actually hilarious. For example, the way that I laughed at the end of it was so absurd that it made me feel sorry for myself. I guess that if it had been just my husband and me, it would have been funny.  The problem is that there are two versions of the story and one of them is so bad that the other (the original story) is better than the original. For instance, the original version was pretty good, it's just a matter of finding out which version is the one you're most interested in. Even if you didn't get the original story, you should have the original storyline in your head. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful, and I don't think it made any money at all. At least in the first 3 weeks of shooting. It's very easy to watch it, because it had a bunch of annoying things to "spend the night" with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was completely without action whatsoever, it had little to do with the plot, the dialog was bad and the film is only bad when viewed on a DVD.  This was directed by the guy that made the "Shall the Dark" movie: Michael "Dangerous" Dempsey. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The premise of "Laloy" revolves around an American college student named Adam who, in search of a girlfriend, goes to a town to meet a married couple and starts sleeping with the couple's wife. But when she discovers that he is in the wrong mind, she decides to try to make him love her.  If this were actually a movie, it would be a pretty decent one. However, it is not. It contains nothing but empty, unbelievable melodramatic clichés, which only makes sense when their purpose is to make the film seem so much more interesting.  You might get a sense of how I originally imagined "Loy" to be, but I have a very low sense of the genre it is. I mean, for instance, "Sister's Blues", which has more to do with women than it with men. There are no characters with such a big brains as the guys of the "Lacy" family. In fact, you can almost feel their own characters, with the most disappointing ending in the movie.   If you want to get a feeling of disappointment, you might watch "The Mask of Fear". This was made many years ago, and although it is more like a horror film, it has much more substance than "Lancy". In fact it is so bad that I didn't even look at the DVD for those "Lantsons". It's no doubt that the film's actors should have been taken out of the movie for themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw the movie, and it was terrible. It was so bad I couldn't believe it had any idea whatsoever, and at times the dialog was so painful that it was painful to watch the movie. In fact, when I watched it, I really didn't know what was happening to the characters. I didn't even know who these actors were. I felt that they weren't actors, and they were just morons who you would expect to be, but I was disappointed that they were actually acting. It reminded me of a movie I had forgotten to see. And to make it worse, the characters were so, so stupid. I can't remember how I felt during this movie. The writing was bad. And when it did a lot of "talking to a lot people in the real world" it wasn't real. The actors in the movie did little more than utter foolish, incompetent, and pointless nonsense. I couldn''T even ask why these people had to be in such a movie. It wasn't like they were acting like the actors in real life. I was so disgusted that I didn''T see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew from the outset that this movie would be a terrible movie. The acting was mediocre, the acting was wooden, and the storyline lacked any real connection to the "normal world" in which the movie takes place. The plot, especially the characters, felt like they had done something for an hour. The movie just seemed to drag on. The dialog was weak, the characters were not interesting. The ending made little sense.  But this movie was very disappointing. It was not even funny. I wouldn't have even considered watching this movie, but my brother and I left it after watching it because it was so terrible that we thought it had a chance to be funny.   It was an uninteresting movie. I would have rather avoided watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What a waste of a film this was. I was disappointed that it made the impression that all of the characters were black. It's obvious that this is a black family movie. Even though the actors were white, they weren't the white. The acting is about as bad as it is in all of my experience. And the idea that this film was about a real family is laughable. Even the actors who are black did so poorly as they did their part in this film.   I found this film disappointing mainly because of the script. The movie is a horrible caricature of black family members. You can't see how the white characters interact with their black family. And there is not any real discussion of race or ethnicity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main story of the movie is about a guy who is so terrible that his girlfriend finds him and has him kidnapped by some guys. This movie is bad. This is only part of the plot because of the stupid plot of some stupid story. It is really strange that the story does not make a lot of sense. One of the most pointless story line: The girl kidnaps the guy and there is a bunch of guys who rescue him but they fail to do anything. There are two guys, one of whom are killed by the guy(the main story). The other guy, he dies in the end. The end. So far, I think the plot is OK but it is really bad. I really think the reason that this movie is so bad is because it is so obviously about a stupid plot. The guy is not an evil guy and really a loving guy. Why is he trying to get into a girlfriend is not worth explaining. It should have been a more interesting and better story, rather than this pointless crap. But I guess you can't blame the writers for such a bad story, since the idea of a guy kidnapping is so simple to understand and that the people in it are so stupid that they can not use it. In the movie, I saw the main character killed and in the scene after the scene of the guy leaving there, the girl and a guy was shown in a car driving away from the scene. So, in the movie there were not many scenes with characters. The only scene I saw where there was a lot more action and a lot better storyline is one that showed the guy was a friend with the car. This show was completely pointless. The plot is so weak and it is almost unbelievable that the guy could get so messed up. I guess the writer and director just try to get people to laugh. It was so bad that it does not deserve a grade. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie starts off with a decent beginning. It seems like a real little flick, but there's too much filler (like the infamous "Sickness"). I'll just give this one more time and say that it has some good parts. But I can't get that high-school girl out. It is just too confusing. There's too many characters, not enough dialogue. There are little glimpses of the movie's villain-character that don't work in the plot. In addition, there's not much happening in any of the scenes. The acting is okay. The camera-movements are pretty good, though they don't make it look like they were anywhere near. But there's so much empty time in the movie. And I think you can't make something like that up. The storyline sucks.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It is bad on every single level, with an unprofessional, amateur, anti-hero type story. There are so many mistakes, such as making a lame, boring ending, the unbelievable plot (which is never in the script), ridiculous plot twists and a stupid ending, that this movie seems like it is attempting to come out of the closet of some movie maker.  If you want to see a real movie that will satisfy you, get one. It will never even be a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this film was very shallow and ridiculous. It was painful. It wasn't surprising to see that they hired a few people and turned to some people who just wanted to see a movie with something more than a normal movie. It had some good actors. But it got very annoying in the way that the ending was not moving as well as expected. I don't think they are that good, but it was not as bad as they claimed. There was nothing special about it. It's just a typical piece of crap! I really wanted to be able to look at some photos. I want to be shown some great pictures from it. But that didn't happen. I give it 3 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are very few things in this film that I can respect. They were apparently trying to portray this character as a villain, which was ridiculous and in no time whatsoever was a bad idea. However, most of the film is pretty good. But the other ones were really bad. The script seemed like an excuse for a bad joke and the acting was awful.   I was really hoping for a comedy and a "one-man, one-woman movie". The script was, for the most part, OK, but the rest of the story was just horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. Well, OK, the first half of the movie is pretty good, the other half is not. Then all of it is just plain bad, like it is often seen in the action genre.  It's like a movie made by a bunch of people who don't know what they're doing, a bunch who just read and listen, and then some people who just act like that, and it's a bunch to make people mad.  A good action genre film would go for a decent budget and special effects, and would give a decent cast and plot. Even a decent script would have a good payoff. Unfortunately, this movie has none. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first learned of the film, I immediately said it was bad, I was wrong. The premise was that the "turtles" would invade the forest at the start of the movie and it ended with a brief cut to a scene of the turtle swimming on a lake.  This is the worst way possible to describe a film:  It was awful, boring, boring...really, really nothing, and just terrible. I didn't care for this film at all. Not only because of the lack of details, but also because of my knowledge of the way that it is supposed to be and the fact that I knew that it was going to be released. It was too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no plot. It just has a naked woman who is very hot and has very strange eyes. This is a movie that is obviously set to be just plain dull with very little actual character development. There are some good acting but the story is completely incomprehensible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an insufferable waste of wasted time and money. I was not really aware of the whole "the first guy on the beach gets the hot girl" concept until I found myself in it. I expected a bit of extra special effects and a little bit of music as a way to keep the audience interested. I found neither of these. It's too bad to waste that money and time. But I suppose, in this case, it can't get any worse than to have some sort of "feature" added to the movie.  This was terrible. It really should have been made a short film of this sort of failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   i tried to watch this movie only to see a real ending. But, i don't think that it would have been funny. If this was the movie, i would watch the ending. I was expecting something funny and funny but just ended on the same low end as the movie i saw on TV! I also have the feeling that the movie is a lot like that one "Hitch" movie which has only 3 scenes. That means that there is nothing in it except a few funny scenes and a one line. If it was a comedy movie it would get a better ending. However, the storyline and plot are extremely bad. Some scenes look like they were in a movie. Some seem like they are filmed in a store with some music and just some actors.  In this movie, all the "character" are in place and all the scenes are just fake. That is not good. The scene with the big house with an elevator was one of the worst scenes I have seen. In the movie it was just a room with some actors and nothing. The one scenes that were in the big room were just some guy who just got out there and laughed and smiled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies of my life. In other words, "The Walking Dead" had a pretty good ending. They made this movie like an after-thought, amateur attempt at a horror movie.  The biggest issue in this movie is the fact that it doesn't add anything to the end. The ending is just one thing in the movie and nothing else.  If you have watched "The Dead" you know that these kinds of movies just don't happen.  This is just an excuse to waste your money and time on a bad horror movie: nothing more, nothing less.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the only one of the many stupid films that I have ever watched. When the acting is not good, I will never forgive an action movie: the only two that i am willing to accept are 'Mad Men' and 'Fast and Furious'. They both are not as bad as the other movies that this movie is so bad, and there is nothing that this lousy movie lacks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had the potential to be an excellent film. I only reluctantly watched it because the production was horrible. The script is just too long, as if you haven't seen one before, like The Walking Dead, a movie that has nothing in common with The Walking Alive. The acting is bad, and the story is pointless, especially the end. But you can read the plot and decide for yourself.  If you like Walking Dead a few episodes, or even The Walking Away after a couple of episodes, it's fine, but not this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm watching "Lemos the Great" because it was a horrible waste of a film, but it could be worse. The film is so bad I thought about watching this to see how awful it was. I would have just gone to the theatre to see it and be shocked to the extent that it actually was like nothing else.   The movie is filled with an absurd number of things, like "vampire" movies, a bunch of "human" monsters, and it doesn't seem like it was made for a "TV" type of movie.  I felt like I was watching "Roots", but in the middle of the movie it sort of just kept getting better until it had the urge to end.  In the end, I thought of "Lunge", the only movie that I can ever remember watching in this manner. It was a fun way, but at the end of the film I felt so bored that I gave it up on the last day.  This movie is a horrible disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So when a new movie comes out, a good movie would be made with an honest story, in a way that it could be funny. When a bad, disappointing movie, like this one, is made, we should be really scared of a bad film. When I rented this movie on DVD, I knew that I was in for a short time, I hoped that I would enjoy it a bit. Unfortunately, I did not.  I couldn't believe that it was even a bit funny. It was just one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The actors were really wooden and the acting was totally terrible.  The ending was a pretty predictable and it had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What I would like to say about this movie was that it was bad but at the same time it is pretty good and enjoyable, but the bad part isn't as bad as the good part. The premise that a group of aliens escaped and is then slowly brought back to Earth to try and save the Earth, which is made into a game by being a psychopath and a necrophiliator of some sort. And there is no plot. Everything happens very quickly, like in the previous film. It doesn't even have a plot, nor a story. The camera works so badly. The acting is wooden and the characters are horrible.  This movie is so bad that I am really ashamed to even admit that it's interesting. It is really horrible. It's a waste of time and I can't say why anyone would even recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie started out great. A great story about a small town of people who decide to sell a house. They build it up and make a few renovations to help make money. But, the first two days of filming are where the film gets horribly twisted. After seeing two different characters, each of them ends up being the worst version of their original personalities. You see the one that has the most power in the film. The guy who is best at making money in a family of four and is then suddenly a greedy banker. It is almost as bad as the man in the first movie.  The story starts to make sense, but then goes downhill fast. The characters are the worst characters, and they are terrible. It takes about ten minutes or less of real time to get to the end.  As I mentioned before, this movie is about an old man whose son is dead. There is a real movie about a dead son. I mean real real movie! I guess that I should add more details about how horrible the story is, but it's about a tiny village and a small part of it. I don't know why this movie was filmed. I guess it was a long story for another production company, who are known for making movies like this. The only reason I knew it was actually filmed was because I saw it on the internet. It was a small movie made by a small company. The main cast is pretty well done, but I can't believe that the plot was filmed at the local school. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have seen in my life, it starts off too cheesy and boring. I was curious to see it, I just had to get the second DVD off the shelf (and it got stolen) because it was so good. But I was left very confused after the first hour and I was really bored by the ending. The scene after the "End" scene was really confusing. It seemed like there was no connection between the scene and the ending (and I thought I might just see some of the characters again) and it left me feeling really disconnected. I don't even think that any of the actors know what the "end" is, and they were really just using the word like it was a joke in my book.  I gave this movie a 10 because that I don' t like some of these movies, I don t like bad movies and I don't understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the one film I can't buy into. A poor movie, as bad as it is. I know what the score is supposed to be. I've seen it before. It is not to be expected to be the best one I've ever seen. The plot is about a drunken father and a girl who takes a small boat on a lake in order to get drunk, but not that. I won't even bother to watch the beginning because I don't want to. It's as bad, stupid, as it has ever been. I can only say to stay away if you need something, but I don pretty much want to stay there anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a little surprised that they even gave this one, but it's interesting that the movie was made by Robert Morgen (the director of this film, and, I believe, his other films, though not, one of his best works, would be this one) and not one of those many films by him which I've seen that made something so awful. I didn't think much of it at the outset, but the movie could have been a really good one if not so much gore. I was quite baffled when they filmed this. It seems like they did some special effects, and the actors were well cast, but they didn't seem to do anything that makes you want to scream and jump and scream and shriek, and this isn't an accident, it's an abuse. Some of the scenes were very boring and dull, and had no real characters. There are no plot, and only some scenes were good. Most of the actors seemed like they weren't in this particular scene. Not that I could say for sure, it was the best movie of the genre, but even that, it would have been so much better had they had a plot and the characters to act as they normally did. The only interesting thing was the camera work, and it was poorly put, like a camera in the background and the camera on top of the camera when it was there. There was no sound in it. It was just a bunch of people shouting.  A very boring film, but like one of Morgen's films, it is good that it was made. But it didn't come into the groove of the movie, which usually takes so much time to build up the characters, which they didn`t do. I'm really ashamed to say that the people who made this crap can't even bring even a small bit of excitement to this film. And I thought that the acting was good, but this was only about a couple of minutes of making the characters more believable and interesting. It could have had a better plot, though I'm not sure. In my opinion, they should have gone ahead with making a plot. It`s been enough to create a good atmosphere. A good man and a bad woman, and a good man, and there were many scenes that were interesting and showed different scenes that weren't shown.  Well, to be fair, this did make a point, although I don't think there was really much in it, so I can
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a horrible, unbelievable piece of trash that just happens to be one of those things that are terrible comedies. This movie is not only a bad idea for one person, it is one of the worst comedies that I have ever seen. It tries to be funny but it is awful, awful even. There is absolutely no logic in it. The dialog is bad, the plot is bad and the acting is bad. If this is one, then this is the sequel of the movie, but there is no redeeming factor. The idea is that if you can't do the jokes within the movie world then you could try the movie. It is like writing a novel, and writing a positive review about bad writing: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting to enjoy this movie, I was excited when it appeared in the theaters, and was left utterly disappointed.  The movie does not deserve to be on the screen.  I went to see it at the local video store, and the guy was just standing there. He was so bored and didn't even know what to say. It's not even a movie, it's a movie about a little boy, his girlfriend, and what has been happening to him lately. I didn't like that part of the movie, or the idea of it being a "movie". I was so disgusted to watch it, it wasn't even a funny or interesting movie. I'd expect better quality, it was awful, the movie made me feel sorry for my life.  If you want to see this movie at a friend's house, don't even waste a few minutes. If you like a movie with a small amount of entertainment and nothing but annoying dialogs, then go for this movie but be prepared for a big deal of disappointment.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just a little bit strange - i don't like this kind of comedy but its not that bad. it's not all that I would like. a decent movie: a little comedy with some humor and some serious comments about people, which is only so it works but if the humor is only a couple of minutes then it could get you to laugh so easily that you'll probably pass out after having a bad laugh.   So if i'm a person who can see something like this I would probably pass it by to friends but not even friends who would care about it. But not really. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. It's a big fat waste of an Oscar-nominated, "Best Actress" Oscar winner, who got off her way to a very good part in the movie--I'm not sure--and not a really interesting person either. It is very bad in most respects, not a good movie. For that reason, I have left it alone, even after the first 15 minutes when I watched it was just "fun" and not "excellent"--I was expecting much more from it. It does not try to develop any plot or plot or character--it does not do anything but shoot stupid stuff in a way that it should not be doing. It just looks like a bunch of guys on a skateboard, and there are lots of scenes where some guy is being attacked by people or whatever--in most cases, two actors with only one eye.   The movie's only funny thing is the title. It was a reference to a song on "I Love Rock and Roll", and in that song, all the guys are rockin' and rollin' at the same time. Not only that, but the song is a little ridiculous--the title is about one thing--I thought it was a bit ridiculous. I have seen other movies like this--some have some pretty funny title--but this movie is bad to me in general. I don't know how it was filmed or what made up the story, but I have heard that it was about a real rocker--and this one was about someone who likes rock rockin'. I guess that is what made it funny--just that stupid title.  The acting isn't good--this is a real low budget movie with lots of actors and it's hard to believe that anyone gets anything out of it. The actors don't even have much dialog--it's just a few lines and you could easily miss one of them. I also felt that the way that they showed the movie in "the theater", which shows the camera moving around the studio with an editing effect that just made me jump into shock. At the beginning when they are shown sitting on the skateboard at the front of the skatepark, it's just there. There are other things that can be shown to have happened to that same table. That seems like a whole bunch of footage for the "takes" of the movie to some of the folks in the audience. I really wanted to see more of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film had a "hairdry" script that was not developed or directed in any creative or interesting way. This film was no good. It is a waste of time and money. The dialogs, while there are some amusing ones, are bad. I thought they used an interesting script, but then I couldn't find it. The director, Christopher Robin, seemed to be interested in trying to "change the world" by showing how evil things are. He did the same with the characters from The Mask of the Future. There are not enough time in the film for any serious viewer to see how awful the film was. I'm tired of seeing actors and actresses of this standard, and don't find any examples of these actors in a movie: The villains are not as dangerous or as evil as they look, like they should be. I can forgive some actors and a few interesting characters, because they do the work for their movie, but if they don't, it will be left a bad impression. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film looks like a bunch of sad people who would rather spend time on a few movies then they have the nerve to tell the world what they think about movies. When they decide to go to Hollywood, their minds, and the souls of their fellow actors, are set on stone.   A movie like this was filmed in America, and there were plenty of people working for it. Not one single one of them had made it so poor.  If they're good actors, and if they had the right talent, they would've delivered a good performance, with enough entertainment to keep things fresh. There is nothing in that case.  What they do is make stuff look like garbage.  In fact, they had to make something like that happen. They can't afford to have people doing this, as we discussed in a previous review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably the most worst example of the worst sort of movie I've ever seen, and one of the more painful ones of all. I never have read anywhere on this earth that so many people, with little more than a few minutes of education and intelligence, will watch it. This movie is not, in the words of the subtitle, a story. This is about a little girl who becomes a part of the vampire clan, and gets killed by the vampire leader. I know this because I've seen it before, and it's been done before.  I don't know why anybody wants to see this; it's a waste of time to see. It is simply bad.  The girl is, well, a girl, but she's dumb. That's the only reason why she is part of this cult. I've had it in my mind that every movie made that kind of mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You must know how this one gets over if you get a chance to see this movie. Well, I have seen it but this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Why? I have never seen a movie with this sort of garbage in it. No idea why I'm even watching this one.  My personal favorite was "The Secret Santa" and that was so bad as well as it was. This movie was stupid but it didn't have much plot. The acting was the worst and the characters were very pathetic. They were just two actors without a story, a couple of actors who looked stupid, and the director had no story. The ending was really lame.  I have watched all of the bad movies I have made and this one is one of the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the type of "B" movie that we don't want to watch. The movie revolves around a "gang of seven", led by a young drug addict named Jacko, who runs a small marijuana operation that uses his status to make money for the local sheriff, thus creating a nasty "slay-down" (as his nickname suggests) on his fellow friends, including a "young cop, whose name is "Carny", whom the sheriff kills as part of the plan. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang members, which include Jacko's drug dealer, make some money by selling drugs into the local shop, which then uses Jacko and the rest to run the cocaine trade. What happens next? Oh, I don't know. For the sake of my sanity, I think you can guess, but you're right.   Also, there is some pretty horrible commentary in the movie regarding the violence of the gangs.  Also there are some weird little scenes in which the cop is in a "thug" mood and tries to pick fights with the other members of the police, which makes the film completely meaningless. There are some scenes where the cop gets drunk and does something "shocking". It's pretty ridiculous for anyone to believe that, in a movie with such low-rent production values, this movie should be a "feature film" and not just a standard action movie, but it's so much like a "movie" that I can't really say what it was. If the movie was actually made by "federal agents", it should be set in a jail or a prison.  So where does the cop get all the drugs? Well, it turns out there's another gang and another cop and another drug operation in a neighboring neighborhood that runs a drug racket. This is only supposed to be the case for a police officer, who is also one of the victims' in this film. But, what about the cop and the others? They never see the cop in action.  How is he supposed to stop a gang of seven? Well... his uniform doesn't appear to be all that special... in the end, the cop has a knife that cuts off one of Jacko on a drug deal.  In the end there are scenes of a group of thugs in a restaurant, a big group of men in the streets, and a cop who makes some weird, semi-comical comment.  This really isn't very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first heard this I was like "oh no, but what a weird director, what a sick man, what's a weird actor, what is an odd director..." I thought, who's going to write this film, who can I call, then I thought "oh yes, who is a crazy guy, who does crazy things, what does a guy have to do??  The whole thing is just dumb, I know it's not that, but a stupid movie. I'll never be able to stand to see this film again, but that's OK, what did a director do that was so bad? What did a great director of a movie do that made a bad film? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible, really bad and probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Even the actors seem to be acting so badly, it's just unbelievable. The plot is terrible. Don't watch it. You'll never understand what a "wrest" is. Even in the beginning it was hard to understand what they were doing. The acting was OK at least but not great. They just couldn't get the right vibe for a comedy movie. The director made an attempt to put this movie in the position that it was going to get an Oscar for a movie that has nothing to do with comedy. It was just not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't enjoy this film. I've always wanted to see a film with a positive ending. The story was terrible and the acting was terrible. The music, although OK for some songs, was awful. And the whole plot of this film was bad! I couldn't stand it. It felt as if I was watching a movie that had some life in it, rather than a movie going to hell for a reason. It doesn't even have any sense of life, it just kept going over my head. I really wished that I would get my money back so I could rent this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this movie the day it was released, and even more of it I watched.  I was curious to see how it could make a statement. I couldn't be more disappointed, so I decided to read this article instead.  First of all, it is simply stupid. I mean, what made the movie? This is really no matter.  What made the film? Well, the story is fairly predictable. The only real surprise was the fact that I never see the movie after sitting through it twice.  In fact, it's only for the fact the director didn't make a full movie about the movie and instead chose to make a simple feature movie in the end of the movie. I think that, if he had made a movie, he would probably be in debt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a half-baked, poorly-written movie in every way possible, not even decent. I think it's the same movie with "Dead Men", and it's got a lot of stars and very much like that movie. But it's just not very good either. The plot has been put forward by the director so that it's predictable and you can see it in one time through the movie. I won't go into details of the plot. But at the end of the movie, we get to watch a movie with blood, gore, and explosions (not for a bloodthirsty action sequence, but just for the camera crew). It's not a movie that can keep pace or plot formation over the course of the whole movie.  The acting in this movie is absolutely terrible. Not only in the scenes, but in the dialogs and the acting. The only way it does seem like a movie is by watching it over a few minutes and hoping to make yourself sick.   In a movie like this, the writer would have to do something about the "plot" before you want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie seems to want to get the big budget, and thus do a lot of things it does. However, in one particular point, there is none. The movie is just about a group of college boys trying to kill a cop. They are both friends, so they have a certain kind of brother to each other...  The problem is that it's just not a good idea to film this movie. I've watched this movie twice, and every time I was disappointed. I don't understand what happened in the end. There was no real story, and they only showed how many friends were there to shoot the cop. The story was weak... but only because the camera had a camera that could actually take the actors' faces, and the acting was so bad that it could make it look like a film. The end was the worst part of this movie, and not only because of the horrible acting. The only thing that saved this movie was the music. I cannot recommend this movie to anybody, because it makes it look pretty good. But if you like it, don't bother. It is bad, and there are other, better movies you can make about it. This movie is no good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days after I rented the film, I discovered that no one had a clue as to what it was about. In fact, I believed that it had been filmed in a studio...but, I was wrong. There was no clue whatsoever about it...  The actors seemed to be from the same set, which is what makes people want to rent it. They were very un-intelligent and un-skilled, and seemed to lack the usual chemistry, and most of the actors had nothing more than two or three lines. There didn't seem to be any reason whatsoever.  A really nasty film, and I won't have to rent until I can figure out what it is.  I would rate this a 1. But I guess I'm only one person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie begins with a plot in which a gang of three, one-eyed ninjas, and one-eye-cognition-neuralist (DMCN) get pulled into a feud in the town of Kalya. When the two gang members, the boys from the north, go to the local church (with their eyes shut), where the leader (the big guy from the south) gets attacked by the ninjas of the north.  If you see the first part of the film, you'll immediately realize the entire plot is just a bunch of trash. It's not even funny. The first part also doesn't seem to be very interesting. The other part contains a little bit of humor.  But this movie tries to completely make the gang of ninjas into a real gang (it was a real ninjas). There are scenes in which the ninjeres do various tasks and in which they make a big bomb. When they see the bomb, it looks like it's made in a small workshop. It just doesn't go together. They are just stupid.  And it does not really help your plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely nothing new, so bad it made me want to kill myself. I don't remember the name of the movie, but I can name it. My only complaints are that the name "Worst Movie Ever" isn't accurate. The movie could have had a name like "Bad Movie: The Movie". My favorite movies from the 70s and 80s would never have been able to make such an unbelievable plot. The acting was bad. The direction was terrible, the directing is weak. The dialog wasn't even coherent. The "good" scenes had good sets. This movie could be made with the best of film making. But this movie was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, one of the most annoying movies ever made EVER. I saw it 2 years ago when I was a teenager, and I still can't say how bad it was. The acting was weak, the storyline was stupid, and the cinematography was absolutely terrible. The plot of this movie was SO, SO bad. I could really say that this movie is a ripoff of the movies in a "Sci fiction" class where all the actors and a "studio" cast would have been good. I am ashamed that this was the only movie that I saw. My friend, who just had me laughing the whole time, had me crying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm afraid of writing a negative negative review, but it's too disappointing to comment. It is like watching the end of the war or the rise of the Soviet Bloc. It's just bad! The first three episodes were excellent and I loved the ending. But it was very weak. I don't understand how to solve it. The show has nothing in common with a movie: everything is lame and pointless. And I'm not getting the whole of the plot. You don't know how the two guys find each other, or why he can find it? This movie is just bad, and it doesn't have any message. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of people on earth will say that I love this movie. Well, I didn't. I was looking forward to watching this movie only because I was hoping it would help my interest in this kind of film.  In the end, it didn't really do that.  I'm sure there is some movie that can help me, if not one of these terrible movies it would be worth watching. But, the thing I was most baffled by was the fact that the actor who played the person who was killing the victims in the movie was himself. I thought that was odd and stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this movie at a movie theater in downtown Philadelphia and, on it was a bunch of people. I watched it with a lot of friends. What the hell, they had the idea that this movie would be some sort of "Hollywood" version of a movie. They had no clue whatsoever. There was not one hint that this was a true story. The acting was flat, the plot was plain, and the story was pathetic. I couldn't wait to leave this movie. I kept looking at the "documentation" of the movie: the movie was just about as bad as "The Last Summer" because the story got to a point to where it didn't go any farther. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I knew a little about this film, and was horrified to see it. It is not a comedy, even though it is set within a hospital, and yet I found no humor, humor, and nothing funny. The film contains some very disturbing footage of the hospital, with a huge number of body bags stuffed into beds and with a female patient dying of a huge wound, only to find the hospital's top surgeon (Kris Wilkins) watching.  The film is extremely bad in that it contains no funny scenes and it is extremely difficult to figure out which is funny and which is not. It seems like they just cut off scenes for no reason. The entire film seems to be a mixture of "jokes" and "grossly offensive" scenes. Most of the dialogs are very predictable, if you find humor in these scenes. I found myself laughing in most of the scenes and didn't even think that the film was funny.  Bottom Line. Avoid like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the biggest waste of movies EVER made. It's so bad that you wonder why it was made. What happened to the plot? If I was a movie writer, I'd have to make a guess. I'm pretty sure it was in a vacuum chamber in some deep underground. I wonder what really happened to it. Probably nothing. It didn't even shoot. I don't remember. Maybe I missed the opening scene. The story and the end was weak but it wasn't bad. The ending sucked so bad. I'd just like to make the movie again. It sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I rented this because it had a great cast and I decided to rent because it's a comedy. The cast were so bad it was almost hilarious.  The plot was so convoluted and poorly executed.  I felt like it was the least interesting movie i've ever seen. It has a really low budget and a really bad acting.  As a female who is in the market for a comedy I felt annoyed and upset. The biggest problem in the movie was the fact that it didn't make any sense. I didn't get the impression that the actors were trying to take over the story.   The funny scenes were completely fake. There are some scenes with the best cast. The rest of it seemed like they were scripted. It's OK though if it was funny. But to be honest it just seems like it doesn't know what to do with humor. The story seemed so ridiculous. I think that it was in a sitcom that it should be a comedy movie. It had a really boring ending that made it worse. It didn't fit the idea of a comedy in any way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most embarrassing film I have ever watched. When I was a college student of biology I was very competitive with the rest of my classmates and all my classmates. This is nothing but a cheap film, nothing to watch but an attempt at a cheap movie that is nothing to write about and is nothing special to watch. A horrible story and a horrible cast, the whole thing makes no sense except for the two characters who we barely know are not that well played by anyone but they somehow manage to survive. We have gotten past this by time. I have written a negative about this film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can find a decent bit of film to be filmed in England at the beginning of the Second World War, this would be a good one. But unfortunately, it is just a bit of a bad one. When the war started, a few people in England were willing to fight and die for it. The people of England could not believe that they would go and fight in such a big mess. So, we get to watch one movie. And the movie that is shown is a little bit of an embarrassing mess. You will wonder what happened to the people that died in a war that was not fought for the purpose that they fought for. I watched this movie because I don't care for the actors that make it. And my main point is that it is a shame that it was in a vacuum of war. But at least it was filmed in a real war. I don`t really like watching this movie, and I was not the only one who watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   After the first few minutes I knew nothing about this film. I knew that "Wiseer" might have been a film with its long, dark hair, but the problem was its lack of any real story, a lack of character development, and an extremely poor storyline. I didn't care for it. I just wanted to get back to the pre-WWI style movies of the '50s, '60s and '80s--The War Zone was a bit better. There was no direction, no character development--no characters. I wanted "Wiser" to be more like a "classic" horror movie. I couldn't quite make it.   I ended up watching "Winex," and "The Day After," and it quickly became apparent that none of these films were as good as the originals. The only thing I didnít enjoy was "Warden." For years, I loved that movie. For most of the film, though, I knew it was the equivalent to "Wider." I knew "Wiper" was inferior, but what I didn���like about it was that I never quite understood the difference between "Winer" and "WINEx." I had watched "Winesx" as an excuse for my growing bored with these genre films. But my opinion was changed after the first hour of viewing. For example, as "Wetter" I could do without the character development. "Wipe" was just plain bad.  The main difference between Wipe and "WAVE": 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible, although I do like it, but the plot and its actors are so bad that they have really become the main focus in my mind.  The acting is unbelievable. And the plot is so weak and convoluted that it's no wonder that this film was not as successful as it is supposed to be.  In fact, I'm really worried that this movie was written because I knew that this would be bad if it was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the first two parts in the book, but i'm not one of those guys who gets turned off by the book and has to read the whole thing to get a glimpse into a movie. I did not know this would be a bad place. It is not. It's not even as bad as the book. Its so bad that it can't get a viewer to be sucked into it. If I hadn't read the book beforehand, I would be on a shelf with the book in my hands, and the book would have me crying.  The main actor, the person who was in the movie to be the "killer", is so incredibly stupid and so slow that i don't know how he pulls a gun in a movie: it's a simple action movie. He pulls a rifle to his chest with a single bullet in it. Then he fires one bullet into his neck and gets killed. How many times he is shooting. When the shooting is over, he picks up a bullet in his mouth and shoots another gun. He is not very good at it. He does a nice thing but then he is suddenly dead. He tries to pick up another body and toss his body over a fence, and then, he dies on a pile of rotting leaves.  I know how the acting was. It wasn't just the way it was done. I don't see it coming up again, and I donít know how it was filmed. If this was a part of the book I would probably watch it again. The only thing I wanted to know was whether the actors in the real world had a body and a mouth. They didnít. I would have to wait until the writer was finished to see whether they had any brain in them.  My point is that the only reason I thought the movie was interesting and had any entertainment was because I was a person who liked books for a long time. The acting is very poor, and it just shows the lack of talent on the set.   This movie does not make any sense. If it wasnít interesting then, it would make a lot more sense. There are no plot. The plot doesnít make any claim to be. The characters are nothing that is surprising. This movie has nothing to say. It was not worth watching. I gave it 4 out of 5 credits. I give 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with some little knowledge and had to laugh because it is so incredibly stupid. The acting is just bad and there is no depth whatsoever. What really bothers me about it is that the director said he wrote this in order to reflect the film. For whatever reason, it doesn't. I couldn't find any reason for this film to be the only film in which this director could say the words "the world is flat", but it's the only one. I'll say that's because it's so bad and they all get away from having a plot. That would make a great film but it doesn`t have any plot at all. This movie should be a joke if it was supposed to be a comedy. You don't need to read anything else than the movie. The script should be put in a jar and dumped on the ground. It was nothing like it should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed that I had seen a movie with this title, and I couldn't find it on my own. The movie did not come out from the theater in the same format I expected, and it was not even as bad as I expected. The story was only a quarter-the same in some of the scenes. And the actors weren't even bad. They all looked like they were drunk. The dialog wasn't even the same as the movie. The plot was even worse than the plot in the first.  There is some good stuff in this movie, but this movie is only made because this movie was available at a local movie theater in one of the busiest theaters in the U.K. This movie is not even in the top 100 movies that it made in Britain. The whole premise is that the world is overrun by some sort of virus. The world is dying because it is being overrun by something, and the people who live there are scared and are scared because there is something infected. This really is no different from any other, boring movie: people are scared by an epidemic of virus-infected disease. This virus is spread around the world, and that the people are suffering from it. There was no indication of any virus-like disease (as shown in the film, in the credits, and in the movie itself) so the world has fallen so many times, and all of the people in the world are infected by the virus and there are people who are scared, and people are dying.  The whole movie had no sense of direction or direction whatsoever. I thought I might get a movie made from this, but I didn't. I don't remember why. I remember the name "Wartigal" for the first time I watched it. It was the only movie I saw in my country. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this on a low budget movie and I couldn't believe what I just watched. It is nothing but a cheap little movie for kids, not even for grown kids. I couldn`t believe that they wanted to put some of the worst kids in a movie (or at least any kids in the US) in a really violent and scary place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is so incredibly bad, i cant blame it for it's poor production and plot. Most of the shots are not even directed around the most important parts of the movie. The characters are awful. Most are boring, the characters are shallow and the dialog is poor. It doesn't make any sense when you can watch it, it just is plain ridiculous. This film was a really cheap piece of film, but you have to find something better out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that this movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Its so bad you almost could have gotten sick! I don't know how this film was made, but if you saw it at a film convention, I would have to see it in another hour. There is too many stupid lines that are just dumb. Why is this movie even in this world? I really don't understand the main characters. The whole movie is about a guy who wants to be rid of a woman and tries to do so, but he tries to be the only one that can do that. I'm so sick of the idea of "sex" that it's not just for men. I am seriously hoping you can save this film by making some real films. I only hope to see a sequel to this movie, but that is not enough to make me cry. I had to put it in a negative light to this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film, the whole plot is stupid. The fact that the main characters are so big and strong that they don't just get slapped around. How could this be, and why would a movie based on a video game ever get made? For example, what did they really plan? You can probably get that message from the first person when you see this movie. If they had the time to make the film and follow up all the game, this movie would probably get a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was horrible. I am a huge fan of the series, however I saw the first 2 and 4 episodes and was not prepared to see another bad episode in this series. What makes this show even worse was the acting of the actors. This show was horrible, the acting was terrible and the plot was completely unbelievable. They didn't even have the same budget. Some of the acting seemed so stupid, but I don't know what was going on. If it weren't for the script, I would rate this movie a 1. I just hope you can see the episodes on DVD. If you do, tell your friends that it's not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The title is about a girl who, after a couple of mysterious cases, suddenly turns to her boyfriend and discovers that she has never kissed anyone (at all, aside from her boyfriend), she then spends the night making some silly dance moves to the top of her own personal stunt tower. This isn't a movie: it's a movie of people who can't wait for the next morning to see it, a movie about people who don't want to put up with noir, and who won't get through one minute of a film without wanting to read about it. And, I am sure, if it was made by real producers, they'd have made better stuff than this. It's not even worth watching, let alone seeing it. At one point, there was some sort of interesting scene involving some woman playing, and then she turns around and shows her naked, so it's hard to find out exactly what happened. That's just the only reason you can keep watching the movie, as the "documentary" does not include a proper plot. It had a good ending, but there was only a couple moments of drama that I would have liked to have seen. I thought the scenes were pretty cute, but that's not really the problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it can't help but have some decent stars. The main actors should not make up movies like this one. That is why I left the movie: because I have to admit that it's only a mediocre movie. I didn't really enjoy it either.  I wish I could return this movie to the theater, but unfortunately I can't do this. I think it needs to go on a vacation and a movie set of "I Have to Give It Back" should be released sometime in the next few months. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just can't find the reason. The main character is a guy who's been a teacher since junior high school (which includes an almost nonexistent sex scene and a "bust" of bad acting). He's a really weird person who wants to spend the night in the library with some sexy women in a bedroom. He's really quite good at dressing and making some of the most shallow sexploit scenes that he can muster, including a rape scene in which the guy is dressed as a sexy girl. When the guys' girlfriend is on the bed, it's just that one guy. I am baffled that "The Flicks" has allowed the "Flicks" to allow such a poor film to succeed. I would have a bigger question about "The Movies" if they had a film that featured this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this film, you are forced to sit through a few half-hour episodes of this film only to see how horrible it is. It is an absurd sequence in which you watch people screaming in their guts. And then you are told that they are "climatically" going through the whole movie to see the story of the movie: a man suffering from cancer, being surrounded by two other women who want to "go back to India" and "join the army".  The rest of the plot is obviously supposed to have some relevance and some relevance. The story begins when "The Woman" is a widow who wants to "stay in India", but her husband, Dr. Khali, has a brother who is married to the husband's "family".  But the story itself seems so amateurish and pointless, that it can only be considered to be something that is too long.   There are some funny scenes throughout the movie. And in some parts, the characters are trying to make themselves out to be more Indian, but the actors have never even been drawn.  And the characters, who are in this movie, have never seen like I did before.  If you are really interested in this film I would go through it twice and see how much of the story was pointless. But unfortunately this film doesn't really stand up to its full potential. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst comedy movie I have ever seen. I laughed for about a couple of seconds...until my wife and I both stopped laughing. The plot is awful, the actors/actors were awful, and the whole movie was just bad. I have yet to see something that has worked this damn film. The idea of the film was that the main characters were supposed to be one of the three main characters, and that the story could somehow add to the movie's story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film more times than I can remember, and I have always suspected that it has been filmed at some place. But the way they were able to make a film of this, and so, it just blew me away. What could it possibly mean?! It could only be filmed at a bad place. A movie about a fictional "glorified" movie was ridiculous. If it was in a movie studio, that would be the best, but in reality, it doesn't matter what it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot really does not go on too much of a storyline. But this is only the first episode of a really bad movie. The good thing that is the good actors are on top. The bad things are less. There is a good scene where the girl finally realizes that what she is saying is no lie. Then the scene is nothing. It is just bad. If you are watching this movie, just watch the first scene and then you will wonder why you are in a car.  The one good thing in this movie is the ending. The closing scene of the movie was really good. It was something that we could see forever. I would like to say that the ending was not the only thing that needed to be in this film. But I am afraid of people ruining this movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this movie and so I really can't say why this one has been so highly praised, I suppose it is because the acting is really good, but the plot is incredibly weak. The plot is weak, at least in my opinion. The acting is awful, I've seen it two or three times, but if you are a huge fan of horror movies, like I am then you can wait till the movie is released. The only good thing is that I have seen it so many times, so my opinion about it doesn't really change much, even if I saw it on other channels like HBO or HBO or other channels, but I'd say the only thing that really saves this movie is the gore and gore factor of the plot, which it doesn�I don�t have.  It seems like the director's intent is to make a thriller-type film with a twist, but he really doesn�t seem to be interested in making anything remotely scary. You�can�take it for what you want to, but it doesn't make a scary film, it just makes boring and mediocre movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When we were just told that the title of the movie was the "Trip To Hawaii", we were not quite sure where to begin. After seeing the title, we understood that the director had done some research on the topic of the "trip". We thought that the premise was fairly believable. But the actual premise was far from being convincing. The ending was weak, and the characters were just completely predictable.  What is really annoying is that the movie has a rather ridiculous name for the "Kahaku (Cape)," which only made sense after the title was introduced. Ahaak! Ahaark!  This movie was probably made for the benefit of the directors, who wanted to make a film about a real adventure, but the idea of a real trip is nowhere near a movie made to promote tourism, something that they had to do, or something that this movie was no more than the sort of movie they had been making for the last two years, anyway. The film was very bad not because of the plot, but because the characters acted so badly that we did not want to see them again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the plot was really funny, and it looked like a fun spoof, but I just didn't really understand the plot. It felt like they made a movie to mock themselves. However, they didn't get the right timing and put it right at the beginning. I think the plot is actually a fairly decent idea if you understand that people do this all the time. If you have read the book, it is pretty good. But this movie was too far away from the book and the movie lacked the same depth and direction, and the characters had so many fake emotions and it seemed like they were just making stuff up as fast as they could.  Overall, I don't recommend watching the movie. It is too bad that they used so many gags and fake emotions in it, and made no real connection with the real story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was not even good for a '80s comedy: just an extremely predictable plot with a ridiculous plot twist in the end. I found it a bit tedious, as a comedy I have seen many more than a thousand shows. As for the plot, it could've come down from the top and made itself all. It was horrible to watch. The comedy scenes were terrible. It had many times where there was only one scene where a normal person in a movie would be seen, and instead there was a two-line long speech that came out after that.
