Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just bought the new Sennheiser HD 800 on Ebay for $160.00 and it is an outstanding audio product. This new and improved model is a fantastic upgrade from my old Senns. It comes with a large-diaphragm cardioid condenser for the best sound, and the HD 800's bass is just outstanding. The HD 800 has a built-in mic and a 3.5mm stereo jack so you can plug into your computer for listening to CDs. The headphone jack has been upgraded with a 6.5 mm headphone jack so now I have a good set of headphones to choose from (and one more to go). I am a fan of the new HD 800 headphones because they have better sound quality and the cable is much better looking than the old one. The only downside is that the headphone jack is not as flexible as the old HD 800s, so it can get a bit tight if you're not careful when you get it into the headphones. The new SENNheiser headphones are not for beginners, but if you have been with the HD 700 for awhile and like the design and the sound quality, you'll like these.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like this item, but it would work better if it was an audio device. The headphone output has a very high impedance, which means that I can't run any higher impedance speakers (more than 10 ohms). I'd prefer to have a stereo jack, since I'm used to the way stereo speakers are set up and the way they sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    (This is a good example of a review that doesn't work because of the writer's tone.) The other reviewers seem to think this is a great device, and I agree. I use this with a laptop and my portable media player. The only flaw I have noticed is the screen does not dim or pulse at the same time. It's great when I'm at a party and my laptop and the music are playing at the exact same time, but when I leave for work the music gets played through the speakers, and it isn't at the right volume. If I was to pick up a separate unit, I think I would go with the Pioneer S-300, but I would still consider this one the best in its price range.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Excellent! I'm just getting started using this but I have some questions before I purchase: 1. I read that the unit requires an AC adapter but can you tell me what your output voltage will be without one? Is it 1.5V? 2. Are there any restrictions on the usage? I do not want to destroy the device and I do plan to use it for audio recording, I'm looking to buy a small-sized microphone for travel. Thank you.

I like the fact that it's small and compact, I can fit one in my backpack.   I am happy with the cable, it seems to be of high quality and is very flexible.   the only thing I would like to change is to have the input level control in a bit more clearly marked, but other than that I'm pleased!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this for about a month, and have to say it's pretty much perfect. No problems at all with anything. All I have to do now is put the right plug in. It just works! I do have the problem with the button on the back of the unit that allows the user to select one of the two different voltages, but it's not a huge deal. I really like the fact that I can set the voltage to whatever I want and not have to remember the different volt levels. My only complaint is that there is a slight delay from the power button being pressed to the LED lighting up, but other than that it's a great unit.   I used a 9 volt battery and the unit would not charge the battery. I have contacted the support and am waiting to hear back. Thanks! Reply Delete Hi Anonymous, I'm afraid we are unable to assist with your battery issue. I will check back in with you regarding your other concerns as well. Thanks for the follow up! Delete Hello! I am a professional electrical engineer and I am the electrical engineer for the department where you work. My understanding is that the 12 volt and 24 volt batteries should be compatible with the 5 volt lithium ion batteries but I don't have the expertise to check the compatibility. If you want to email me with the results of your battery compatibility test then I can work with you to get the right battery installed in your unit. This may help to resolve any battery issues with your unit and save you the effort of having the battery and charger swapped out. If the battery is not compatible with your 5 volt battery then we can discuss if you could purchase an adapter so that the new battery could be installed on your unit to avoid any potential problems with the new batteries.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought these to replace a set of vintage (1970-1977) JX-10's in a vintage Fender Jaguar. The original JX10's had a solid sound with decent volume, but were a pain to get on and off. These look nice, but not much more than that. I had a bad experience getting the jacks to connect when I first got them. Then I noticed that they're all soldered to the chassis. The jack itself is soldered and I can't be sure the jack will work the way it's supposed to. That said, I'm not a huge fan of the JX's anyway, so I'll stick with the Jaguar.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A   Very nice and easy to use   It is a good and fun toy with two speeds to it, and good amount of power and control. I am looking forward to many hours of fun with this   I have it in my bag, ready to play with at any time.   My friend is just a little bigger, so I get a lot of my friends, but this is a wonderful toy for small toy play.  I love the feel of it. I like the way the vibrations go from the high to the low. I also like how the power switch is on the top so I can turn it off and not get it wet. This is the best toy I have bought and I will be buying more. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     1 out of 5   I bought a Kogan USB cable from Best Buy, the cable arrived damaged, so I returned the unit, and was offered a full refund. I bought the Kogan to replace an old one, and I have been very pleased with the performance, but I'm not so thrilled with the fact that the KOGAN has been "discontinued".  Customer Service Response: This cable is a great quality and can connect to any USB device. The USB connection is a 1-to-1, which means that you can connect your device to your computer directly and it will charge. The 1-5-7 pin cable is also the same as our old standard Kogan cable and is compatible with all of our other cables as well. We hope that you have a smooth experience with Kogan Cable, and thank you for your feedback.

I purchased this for her first computer because I was concerned about the quality of some of the others. As expected, it has superb sound. It also is very easy to use. It's well worth the money. This is a quality product that comes with everything you need to operate the machine.

The sound quality is very clear, and the built in speaker is excellent. I would recommend it to anyone who has to travel, including air travel, and who does not want or need to keep their own computer (especially if they are just traveling with it.)  Excellent! Great product! Bought this to use with my laptop while on my flight in DC and traveling through Europe! I am so glad I bought this. I also bought the extra USB sound cable and have yet to use it. It has plenty of features and works perfectly with my Macbook pro.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great toy for all the people who are just starting to explore anal stimulation and are looking for an all-in-one kit.   The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the lack of instruction. I bought this just before my birthday (November 6th). The first time I used the toy, the head didn't even reach my g-spot and I was completely surprised.  My second time I got it right and it felt amazing.  The silicone is incredibly soft and smooth, and the head is super strong.  In my opinion it is the best toy for beginners. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very compact little unit with a good sound. The only problem is that the buttons are very small and hard to press. I am just about to go to the store to buy some buttons. The light is good and the volume is good. I don't use the buttons very often but if they were bigger, I would be all for them. This is my first eurorack system and I can say it has been a real pleasure.  Rated 5 out of 5 by dave from I am a professional engineer and this pedal has been wonderful for my work in the studio. I have always loved the sound of this pedal and I am now able to utilize it in my live setup for great sounds. I can hear exactly what I want to hear.  the sound is quite incredible.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      "This is a very nice and smooth sounding, high quality set of headphones. The bass has good presence and is fairly deep. The mids and treble have nice balance and are very detailed. I found the soundstage to be very good and very deep. This is very good for home listening and I plan on buying the next set for a friend. " Good headphone and good design:  "I like the sound. The headphones sound good with or without the battery. I am looking at getting a set of these in the near future." Review of the $250 Koss Porta Pro 5.5 The PortaPro 5.50 is a slightly cheaper option for the Porta's larger brother, the Port Pro 4.  While the Portadget Porta is no longer on sale, the $50 Koss Pro 5 is on sale and will be around until April 15th.  They are pretty much the same size (0.75" taller), so they are equivalent in size.  The 5.55mm drivers were designed for portable audio use, and are driven by a 9.5V 2200mAh rechargeable battery.  This headphone has very impressive bass response (with a little treble rolloff, but still very good) with good detail and detail resolution in the highs.  The Porta has a very large soundstage, but it is just a tad larger than the Portapop, but has slightly more depth.  To be honest, I think the Pro 5s are a little too large for the porta's smaller sister.  For comparison, I've been listening to the Portuos for about three years now, and my ears are pretty used to them, so the Portal 3s sound a bit like a "baby" to me.   Both headphones have adjustable cord plugs, but the Koss plugs are much larger (and not quite as flexible), and the Porto's are a lot more flexible (I think) than the Korg plugs.  There is a micro USB port on the back of the headphone, and the headphone has two mic inputs and a single line out port.  A remote is also available for the headphones.  It has two controls (volume up and volume down), a mute button, a battery button, and a mute/connect button for the microphone.  I like the remote for the headphone port a lot, and I'll

As I have owned and used many other portable CD players including the Sony A5000 which I also have used many times, I am glad I chose the VX for my portable player. The CD player and CD-RW drive are easy to use. It has a good quality sound and I liked its size, portability and easy portability. The VX is a good choice for a portable CD player or laptop CD reader. The price and the good quality of this device are also a plus.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing you notice about this device is how light weight it is. It's about the same weight as my old Motorola RAZR Maxx 2, and that is a significant difference. The first thing I did after using the phone was set it on a table so I could see how small it was. I also bought the black case to protect it better. This device is not a phone to take on and off and is easily held in one hand, but you can still use it like one. It has a 3.5mm headset jack so you can use your mobile phone if you need to. I prefer to use my phone with my left hand in order to be able to make a phone call. I can also use my other hand to hold a mouse or a pen. The phone is very small. I would suggest this phone to anyone who has an old phone that's getting a second life.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1.   This is my first electronic device (not a watch or a computer) but I had a dream of being a famous DJ/radio DJ/music producer. I really love the way this device is designed and the fact that it can produce high quality audio on a mobile phone and I can take pictures while I listen to it (I have a Sony Walkman, but can't take a picture when I'm listening to an audio recording). This device has also improved my listening experience because I can listen to the sound of the music in the room and the other people while I write (this is also the reason why I purchased a Bluetooth speakerphone as a gift for my best friend).

This coupon may not be available online, but you can find it in the store! Readers of this blog might remember my previous reviews on the Galaxy Tab 3 and Tab 4. Both devices I purchased had some major problems that were caused by the battery.  Both tablets suffered from a major battery failure in the middle of the battery life.  So when I received my new Galaxy Tab 10.1 Pro, I was very pleased to see that the Tab 10 had gotten a complete battery overhaul, and that it seems to be much stronger than it's predecessor.  In addition to the new battery, the new Tab 10 is much slimmer and much more streamlined.  Instead of a large backplate, the Tab comes with a smaller and more efficient design. The Tab 10 comes in two sizes, 10.0 inches and 10.5 inches, the latter being the smallest and slimmest version of the Tab.  These tablets have a back plate made from a more rigid material (i.e. metal), which is a nice change of pace to have on a tablet.  The back of the tablet is also noticeably thicker and heavier, and has a raised section that keeps the screen off the tablet's back.  It's the kind of design that is designed to fit in your pocket, as it has a large surface area.  It's almost like a more durable version of Apple's iPod Touch.   In addition to its looks, the back of my Tab 10 also features an external speaker (like the iPad Mini and Kindle Fire HD).  In a pinch, this can double as a front-facing speaker if you are sitting in your car.  One other nice feature on the back is the slot for a microSD card.  You can actually insert this card into the tablet if you have a 64GB or larger internal memory card.   The battery also features a dedicated power button, which is on the bottom of the back cover of the device.  Samsung says that the tablet can charge at a fast rate for 2 days on a single charge.  Although I can not confirm

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I like it a lot. It is light weight and it works as it should. I have a lot of old vintage radios and this one is much better than any I have ever seen. I do recommend using it with a battery backup battery if you are on a long journey or you can't get into a car for any reason.   My wife has a "good luck" radio, but she has the battery back-up option on this one.  I will have to give it two stars due to the size and weight, but overall, I love my radio and it is a good addition to my collection.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Ed from Lightweight, Compact and Powerful I bought this a few weeks ago. It's a solid unit, works great. I use the unit for my outdoor radio and the batteries last a good week. As far as its size and power, it's perfect.  of the five reviews that I found on the web, five of them were in the low ratings, the other two were 5 stars. I can see the positive reviews, but the negative ones have to be corrected. First of all, there was no mention of the battery power on the website. No mention on the manufacturer either. Second, they are selling the unit without a battery back up. You have to buy a rechargeable battery if needed. So when I went on sale at a very good price I bought it.    Third, the unit is a very solid unit with a lot going on inside. It even has an indicator on the back panel that shows when the antenna is connected to the unit. But, I found out that the indicator on my unit is not displaying the correct direction for the antenna as per the instructions that come with the antenna. Now, I do like to check the direction of the antenna, but that's not a big deal for me. If I could figure out how to fix it I'd purchase the new one anyway, but it's a minor annoyance.  is a nice little light weight device. I am using it on my "good night" radio and am very satisfied with the performance. I've had it for a week or so and I have not had one problem. I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone and would recommend it to anyone that needs a light weight light weight radio. I bought this after my previous Radio-Pepsi lost it's battery.

I used the original Mac keyboard at work until about a year ago and I had to replace it because the keys got stiff and it wouldn't fit my fingers.   I bought a used Apple keyboard for $20 and it worked great for about a month, until I had a bad freak-out in front of all my coworkers.  I was sitting in a meeting and had to take a step back so I could compose a long message and they started shouting my name and I heard them yelling at me for about 2 minutes.  The keyboard works as a USB keyboard and the keys are super comfortable and the size is perfect.

I'm very pleased with it. It's much more fun to listen to than the stock radio.  Reviewed by: David M. from Ocala, Florida on 11/26/2016. Perfectly suited for the new listener. The sound quality is great, but the speaker may need to be modified to fit the driver of my car. However, I would strongly recommend this product.  the sound quality in this unit is wonderful and the fact that the car stereo doesn't fit with the car makes this unit even more fun and useful to the new listeners  Rated 4 out of 5 by MikeM from Great Sound with a little work. I bought this as a gift and I love it. The only thing I need to do is add the speaker so that it fits the car properly. The buttons on the radio control are very nice, but in order to use them, the speakers need to mount in the right way and have the right amount of travel. All in all, a great radio for the money. I recommend it to anyone looking for a great inexpensive radio. I plan on purchasing another one so I can listen to music from my phone instead of the iPod. ,  I've always been a fan of the radio because I've always liked being able to control it, but I'm not too fond of how much the buttons move when turned on, as the right button doesn't move enough and the left button moves too much. This solves my problem because I don't have to worry about changing the buttons to make them fit the car.  for those who want to be able to change the buttons, it's very easy. - the speakers can be moved back in their position. I use to use the speakers facing the driver seat. Now the speakers are in their stock position (front left). I had the speakers set at a 40 degree angle to the seat to accommodate the driver but now that it's in their new position I donno. I'd recommend this radio to anyone. I'll be purchasing another. 's only problem is the speaker volume and it's not very loud.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a convert from a PC to a Windows-based tablet and this is an excellent device. I like how it's easy to customize and what kind of functionality is available.   When I was in the process of getting the Surface Pro 3, I was really impressed by the high level of Windows integration.  I had a Windows 7 desktop PC and thought I might be able to take advantage of it, but after trying to use the Surface for about a month, I found it hard to use. With the Surface, I can use any application I want, and when I'm not using a program, I just have the display open. The only thing I would change about the Surface is that the kickstand really needs to be a bit stiffer. I could not hold it at all and the bottom would tip to the right if I held it the wrong way.  The design is very good and has more functionality than I expected.

I love the fact that it comes with 3 batteries and the USB cable (I have a laptop). This is very light and fits in my hand so well. The batteries work great. The only negative thing I can say about it is that it gets a little hot. It is a small, portable unit, so I can't say the same for a laptop. Also, the charging cord is not a good one and it comes off easily when you pull it off.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first electronic music console, I bought it to replace the one i had, but the quality of music I have is way better than the original one.  The original model was nice but I found that it was not good enough in terms of quality. This new model has better features (speakers, built-in power, bluetooth etc), even with a few extra features (discrete bass boost, variable delay). I love this thing, it sounds great and my new one has never stopped working after i got it. The only thing i wish was different is the input connection, as on the first model, it took a while to figure out the input.  that said, the sound quality is much better than before and the quality is great. So, i highly recommend it if you like electronic music and music consoles.  " I have this in my car, it's awesome! It can also run off batteries, but I don't use it much... The fact that it sounds so good with both batteries in and with the speakers out is super. It doesn't get much better."  " This is the first portable electronic music device I have bought and I am very happy I have it. It is not as large as some of the other products I have had but its easy to maneuver around the car. The volume and sound quality are top notch.  and this is the only way I will get music out of my cell phone." " this is a very good product and the best thing about it is the fact that the speaker is connected by a stereo jack so that there is no need to plug in a cassette tape player"  This device is a must for anyone that wants to listen to the greatest music on earth!  I wish there were a way to adjust the delay or bass to get a different sound and to be able to adjust how much power I want to get. My only complaint is that it takes a long time to charge and there are no instructions for the various settings. Also, the controls are located on the side of the box not in the center, so you have to reach for the buttons on the other side. . The speakers on my other electronic devices are very small so I was able to use them when I was driving. The sound on this thing is absolutely incredible, it brings out the best in many styles of music. The bass is clear and not distorted by the amp. It's so comfortable

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am using the LG G3 for the first time and I am VERY HAPPY with my purchase. First off, the camera quality is very good. I have the 4.3" screen version and it is awesome. The screen has great clarity and color and the phone is a pleasure to use. This phone is an all around great device that I would recommend to anyone who is on the fence about getting the LG, just buy it! The sound quality is also very good and crisp. It takes videos and photos well, and I have no complaints. Overall a great buy!!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I bought a new iPad. It's a pretty cool device. I love the ease of the touch interface and the power of the cloud. The only issue I had was that I was having a problem with the keyboard. One finger just didn't click it all the time like it should be. There was a small "click" that would sometimes happen. I sent it back and tried a different model, which was just fine. But I did come back to return this one. It was my fault for not changing the battery, but it's still frustrating.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a nice device, but I had some trouble getting it to work. It had been broken for about a year. I could not get it to switch on, but after some tweaking, it did. The only thing is it does not come with batteries. It took me two hours to get one set of batteries. I wish I had purchased the ones that come with the phone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As you can see in the photo, I have added a couple of buttons (1/4" round metal contacts) to the connector on the back of the unit. You can easily connect one of these to the phone. If you have no need to charge your phone (i.e. you're not a frequent user), this can be a great idea.   If you already have a cable to charge with, it's easier to just buy the one with the extra buttons.  Note: I didn't even know there were other phone holders. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using this radio for over a year. I am happy with it. It has a good range for a medium size radio. The volume adjustment knob can be a little hard to reach for the first week or two when you are used to a simple push to turn knob. The key pad, however, is very easy to use. I can use it as a wireless radio when I can't leave the house or it is late at night or early in the morning.  Review of DJ947L-00XDJ Review by Michael I was given this radio by a friend who has one and it is great! I have a small office space and needed a new radio for my laptop. This is a much better replacement than the other radio I had, in my opinion. I love how the keypad is designed to be placed in the back right hand corner.  a much simpler design than the KA20's. This has also reduced the amount of strain on my fingers. It uses a standard AA battery which is easier to find than a rechargeable one, even in my apartment building which has a great number of wireless charging stations. The range is decent but not great. In the city I often am away from the radio for some time so a long range would be great. . Purchased it for my girlfriend to replace her old computer radio, which had been discontinued. It works great and the only thing I have to adjust is the volume up and down but that's it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I have been a customer for some time now. I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I have a laptop with windows and a wireless card that I just upgraded to 802.11n. This adapter gives me the most reliable connection with my Windows 7 laptop. It has made connecting and controlling my wireless devices such as my laptop and bluetooth keyboard much faster and more fluid. I highly recommend this product.  ----------------------------------------------------------  1526 So great!  Posted by - 11th July 2011   I use the adapter at home when I'm on the road and it has been very good for my needs. It's nice that it only supports 1.0.1.7.0 on the new firmware. This has made things quite a bit easier for me. I also just recently purchased my wife one too to play with. We're happy, just need some more people to be happy.  and i can't wait for the next gen one  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  of course i want it...  -------------------------------------  Great product!  The one thing I did not expect was how easy it was to set up! Great customer service, good support and good quality product. Thanks!

I just got the adapter and I have had zero problems connecting my Apple wireless keyboard, mouse, and headset to my Mac-Pro. This one is my favorite on the market. You will be happy as I was. Thank you so much! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Ease of use:  (5)   Price:  $5-10   I was expecting the screen to be tiny but it is bigger than I thought.  The keyboard is also really well made. The buttons are all located in the middle of the board and I had no trouble with it at all.  As for the battery, I just charged mine from the wall charger and it lasted a whole day. I haven't used it too much but I'm pretty happy with it.   Recommend:  I like it  (8)  I was going to buy this but I saw it at the price I got.  I had to think about it a bit.  It is not too hard to use.  (6)  I love the touch screen.  So far it has served me well.  Although it could be bigger I am pleased with the way it works so far.  But I think if the price were even $1 less I'd buy it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this to replace a broken (older) Apple iphone 4. The only con is the battery. The iPhone 4 lasted about a month of regular use. I don't use that much time on it but I had to charge it 3-4 times a day. This one lasted about 2-3 months on the same charge.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPhone is the best phone   I have owned   It is the only phone that has a great battery life   And the battery lasts   forever   Because of that the battery is not a concern.   You will be fine without it   In the past I have tried all kinds of phones   This is a must buy   Also the new iPhone 6 is not the same   Just not as cool    A good digital music player:    This device is great   the playlists are very long   Its a great idea for the price   Although I do not play music much   Still it is a great device   For all your needs   All the songs are great  Great all around GPS unit:      Another great device from Apple   When you first see the box and the first look at the device you will see a lot of hype on this device  It really is a big screen, beautiful screen, great cameras.  There is a ton of info on this screen  You can get directions to your destination.  You could also get directions by using the Maps app.  The map apps are top notch  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is a very good computer and I am glad that I bought it.   I have bought computers in the past that were defective, and I didn't regret the purchase.  My son, however, is very disappointed.  I will not buy another computer. I bought this as a gift for my father-in-law. I have no complaints and it is easy to use.  A definite keeper.  Thanks Apple!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received my first device from the Voodoo team as soon as it was released. The build quality is excellent. I was initially worried that it wouldn't hold up to my particular use (which is very limited), but I really think it has great potential. The Voodoo 3 is a nice-looking device. The back has a nice texture to it and the design is very attractive. The buttons are well-labeled. I've used this device for about a month now. The only complaint I have is that I wish the screen could have been a bit taller. But hey, it's a 1.6 inch device and it's not a gaming device anyway, so I am probably not the target audience for a device like this. I still don't use it often enough to make a proper comparison. But, for those of you who will be using this device, I strongly suggest getting it, and I have a feeling you will be pleasantly surprised.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really love this thing. I have 3 laptops (Macbook Pro 15", iPad 2, iPhone 5) that are older and have a hard time holding things with the keyboard and track pad on. This keyboard is the only keyboard I can use with these older machines. I don't use the mouse for a reason. I can reach most of the buttons on this thing without it but my fingers just don't work on a track pad. Also the track pad is so much better than the ones I have. I'm going to buy a 4th one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This has been a favorite of mine for years.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i i i   I've been a customer of this brand for many years now, and i really appreciate the quality.   After a couple of years of use, the noise level is still at about 50 decibels.  The earbud is a bit hard to clean but i don't think that will bother most people.  It works well with my Iphone, but not with my Nexus 7 (because of the placement of the plug on the Nexus 7).  The noise level of the earbuds is very comparable to my old, more expensive Sennheiser i80.  If the price was a bit less, i would consider this a great value.   Good for the price! I love these earbuns. They are comfortable and good to listen to music, and for the most part don't cause much noise. I've had them for a while now and still haven't had a problem with them, but I have had to use a bit of force to make them go in, as it seems like some can take much longer to go in than others. I will continue to buy these, but they are nice if you want something that's comfortable but doesn't cost much.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like the M-Audio Red.   Its easy to set up, very small, compact, and easy to use.  It can be set to go very low, or very high.  If you're looking for a good, compact preamp, I would definitely recommend this one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I think the price of this product is right. I have been using a laptop and using the tablet in conjunction with a computer for a couple of years now and I still like the tablet.   For the price you are getting an extremely good computer/tablet.  It is a pleasure to use.  My only complaint is that the touchpad buttons are tiny and I'm not even sure it works. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "I really love my Kindle. The battery is a little bit annoying, but that is a problem for only 1 out of 25 books I've checked out. I love that I can read it at night and while I'm working. I've been able to get it out of bed and go to the kitchen on a rainy day. It's very handy to be able to read while commuting, or while waiting for the bus. The only time I really felt a need for a stylus was when I was reading a story, and had to write a note on the Kindle. It took some fiddling to get the paper to stick. It really is very nice to have a "digital ink". "The only thing that is less than perfect is the fact that I am a big fan of the touch screen. I can easily get lost without it. I have also had a lot of issues with the "search" function that would sometimes make a huge blank space. And the thing that makes it really worse is that it just can't track the position of the finger when I've used it like that for a while. I find myself just leaving the keyboard off, and just using the touch button. It is annoying that it doesn't have a dedicated function key for it either. "It's just not the Kindle I thought I was buying. It just feels clunky and has no functions at all, but you can do more with it than any other device out there, and it's worth the extra cost over a tablet. 5 out of 5 stars. "The Kindle is very handy for a lot. But it's not perfect. It doesn't take a lot for it to get boring. It isn't very easy to use. I think that the price is just right. If you can find the money to buy it. Buy it. It has a lot to offer"
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the best device ever. I am in love with the screen. It is large and bright. It takes some time to adjust to it as it is not too thick. The device is very quiet and is a nice device for my job.   No complaints about the performance:  If you are looking for the latest, greatest and best, then look no further. The Y-Phone is the product for you. Its compact, light and looks great. The best feature of the Y-phone is the screen, but the screen isn't perfect. It doesn't have the same quality as the Samsung Galaxy S III. But its a lot better than most of the phone that I had in the past. So if you are in the market for a new smartphone and you need something more than your iPhone 5, this is the device for you!  I'm very happy with this product. I'm still not able to use the internet with it, but that's a small price to pay for such a great device and great price!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new i8's sound really good. There's a bit of a delay on some of the higher frequencies, but once you're past that, the i8s are very dynamic. I like how they're both passive and plug-in. They just plug right into your computer. If your computer has a USB port, then you can use the i2's as a soundcard and run your DAW from your computer, which is great. The i8 has an XLR mic input, but the i1 has an 1/8" TRS input. If you're looking for more versatility, the  i8 has a nice set of line-level inputs with phantom power, and an S/PDIF port on the back.   When I plug in the iphone to my computer, I can't hear the delay on the vocals on my computer--not sure what the cause is. You can get an adapter to make the delay go away by turning off the line-in and line-out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received my TACO 2 portable CD player today. I have no words to describe how pleased I am. The unit is very small and well built, which is especially nice on a slim portable device. The sound quality is top notch. It's very easy to use, I only need to remember to plug in my device every time. I had a hard time deciding which model to get because of the many different models on the market. I ended up getting the TACOS 2 for my own personal use and it's well worth the money.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good device. I was very pleased with how the phone looks, the design of the interface, and how well the phone does the job it was supposed to do. I am able to communicate on the phone as well as I can in person by sending text messages, posting on Facebook, or talking on the headset. There are a lot of things I love about this device. It has a large screen, it's easy to use, it can connect to the internet, and it's a great value. Overall, the phone has a lot going for it.   I am giving the ZTE ZMax Pro 4G LTE the 5 stars because I liked the fact that the phone is an affordable device and the overall phone design.     I bought this phone for my son. He has used it in the store with no problems, and I know it works well. His younger brother, however, is using it in his dorm. I don't know how well his phone works at all on their end. I have never heard of his device being on the other end. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You got a great deal on this product. I'm glad you picked it up for $20!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jim from Works well to send letters! This was a good deal. There's nothing more annoying to a postal worker than having to read and understand a hand written letter that has been scanned and labeled. This thing takes the stress off. I have a few of these and they have been great!  The item was delivered quickly and the packaging was good. The printer worked well and the box was well wrapped. I got a very good deal on the printer and am very happy with the purchase.  The item was shipped promptly. The shipping box was a little dirty but it was good that I paid $20.

And it comes with a decent charger.   This is a great phone and the best one I have ever owned.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used to have a laptop, but switched to a tablet after a few years.

I've owned many electronic devices, but never had the problems this one had.  This thing is pretty simple to use.  Once you get the hang of it, it's an absolute pleasure.  The battery life is very long.  It is great that I can just use my iPhone and use it to watch movies.  There's no need to use a second screen.  A lot of people complain about the sound, but I can hear every single word I'm saying. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had a couple of electronic devices over the years, the first being a Panasonic PDA that I bought for my brother at the age of 14. He also had his first one.   I was initially turned off by the very cheap feeling, plastic and flimsy feel of the PDA and after a year it broke, and he threw it away, and I have not regretted it one bit.  My other electronic device that I have been looking into buying is an iPhone.  I do love my iPod, but I am looking to replace it with an iPhone when I have enough money saved up to do so.  My brother's wife also owns an iPhone and has a lot of use for it and I would like to get a similar phone for myself as I have a friend that has a similar one. I was thinking of buying the iPhone XS, but a lot less expensive.  Since the first one was so cheap, I was really disappointed to get the cheaper iPhone X.  The phone is definitely nicer than the one I had, and it is definitely better than the LG V20.  It is just way too cheap for the amount of screen and RAM, it seems like the company that built it doesn't even know what they are doing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was a little skeptical at first, but I think it has plenty of use. It's a little bigger than I expected (my hands fit in it easily), but I do have to work the joystick a little for it to work with my big hands. It definitely doesn't interfere with my typing, which is pretty good. It doesn't have all the features that a laptop might have, but the controls are simple and easy to use. The joystick controls are also pretty simple and the controls work really well. I'm just not a fan of the large touchpad on it. For a computer keyboard, I don't like the space bar on the back of the device. My experience is limited, but it definitely is not as comfortable as my Apple MacBook Air. Overall, the keyboard is very responsive, and I think the touchpad works fine. The controls are responsive enough that I'm able to use them without my hands being covered in a laptop and keyboard combo. I've been using this as my laptop for a while now, but if it were cheaper and offered a USB port I might consider getting one as well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have always wanted a computer from the early 80's so this is the best I can find. I did have a difficult time adjusting to the new buttons and the layout, but overall a great product.    Excellent!   The GBA is a great device for playing NES games.  The speed and responsiveness is outstanding.  I have been looking for a great handheld system for a while now and this is it!  Takes a little getting used to, but once you get into it, the machine is wonderful for the price.  I play most of the games on my SNES, but have been playing a lot of games on the GBA and it seems to be very close, at least in terms of overall system speed and accuracy.  For $29 you get a solid, reliable system.    The only thing I found that could be improved on is the control setup for the buttons.  A small button could be added near the right side of the unit, just beside the power button. It's a simple design improvement and would make the control more convenient to use.  This will probably not take you long to learn how to use the control layout, and after that it is quite simple to play.  It would be nice to have an SD card slot for an extra game or two on the side so you could load an already saved game if you have an emulator. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This phone is great, I've been using the iPhone 4 for almost a year now and when I got the iPhone 5 (I was not a big fan of the design of the original) I was very interested in this one, it is so much better. It is very sturdy and has a great design, no loose parts or dents in it. The screen is very bright and the speakers are great. The phone does NOT come with a sim card, which was really a deal breaker for me, but that might be an issue with my carrier. I also tried to activate a new sim from my wireless carrier but they told me that I would have to purchase a sim. I am still deciding what to do. It's a great phone and if you have a job, or have money to burn buy it, I highly recommend it, it's the best phone on the market.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this item about a week ago and it was a great purchase. The best part of the phone is the built in speaker that is located at the top of the screen, on the opposite side from the speaker jack. It makes listening to music or calling someone so much better. This is my 2nd Iphone. I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As with most electronic devices, the iPad is a bit on the expensive side. It has an extremely sleek and lightweight design that keeps it light in the hand. It's thin enough to be used with one hand. The design is simple, so anyone will be able to pick it up and immediately start using it. The iPad has the latest technology. It comes with a USB port that is used to connect to the computer, an SD card slot that holds movies, and an Internet connection. This is the first digital device that I have found that has a removable battery. You don't have to pay for an extra power cable when you use it. It also has the ability to make phone calls and send text messages. I was surprised at how good it sounded through the headphones, and I think the speaker is loud enough to get any listener's attention. The screen on the iPad has a 1024 x 768 resolution and has no issue on my 7" tablet. The size of the iPad may be off-putting to some people, but I find it quite easy to hold, as it's so lightweight.   I don't use a lot of music, so it's a bit disappointing that the tablet doesn't come with any music players. It does come with a nice looking case that will allow you to carry the iPad in a sling. I purchased the case online and it was extremely easy to put on.  The screen was really bright, especially when I used the "auto brightness" setting.  While I didn't use it too much, I was impressed with how well the iPad handled my work.  It also is very light-weight and comfortable to hold.  There were a couple of times I accidentally moved it down and had to go get it.  Although the screen is beautiful, it did have a problem with the audio.  I tried turning up the volume a little and my music became distorted.  Unfortunately, this happened more than once. I think it may be because it had such a low-resolution screen.  The battery lasted an average of 8 hours.  You can pick the iPad up and use it for a couple days on a charge.  If you can use a case and use headphones, the screen may be more usable.  This is a great product that's worth the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought my first e-cigarette on 11/09 and I am very happy with it.   It works great in my car.  It also works great when you are driving.   What can I say that hasn't been said already?   This thing blows my mind. It's a huge improvement from smoking regular cigarettes and I'm about to order another one. I just keep forgetting to use the tank. The only thing I don't like about it is that the battery is a bit hard to re-charge but that's only because I just got the one that came with the tank...I'll get another one to try next time I go to the store  Excellent product, amazing price!   The only negative for this product is that it doesn't stay attached when you remove the top.  Other than that I think it's a great purchase.  Great Product   For the price you get a very good quality product with great features.  The battery lasts for over 8h with out recharging.  I recommend this product.  Good value for money.  My only suggestion would be to have a cover for the battery.  I purchased the E-Cigarette tank on 12/07 & received it on 12-12-07. I had it in the mail on 12th-12th December. I have not had a chance to test it yet, but I am looking forward to that.  Very pleased. Will order again when it comes. .    The V-2 is a high quality and economical option for those looking for a reliable e-cig  This is a fantastic product for the money. It is the same size as the ciga tank with more capacity. I would recommend this for those that want the same taste as an actual cig but with a vaporizer experience  I'm a new vaper but I love it. I'm an ex cigarette smoker and have been trying to quit for some time but I have found vaping is a better alternative. I don' like the taste of regular cigs and I had tried so many products that tried to replicate cigs but never satisfied me. So I decided to try the V2 and I couldn't be happier.   Its easy to use, easy to carry and easy to refill.    Thank you guys for helping me quit smoking.  ,  Linda  5 out of 5 stars!!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a P5200V in mid-September. I didn't realize just how good the sound was until I got it. Now I hear music like I never have before. It's been a long while since I heard such great sound. I just get so much better sound and a little more clarity out of a computer headphone than I did with the P5100.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had this item for a while and have gotten use to it, I love the little touch screen. I love it so much I purchased a second one. I do wish the battery life was longer but it will not hold a charge for very long anyway.    Review of DJI Mavic Pro Quadcopter with GoPro Hero 3 + GoPro Grip + Smart Battery + Charger + Camera:  When I first started researching on the Mavica I was skeptical as to whether the quadcopter could handle a high speed camera attached to it. After a few months of using the drone with the quad-copter and a GoPro 4 Silver I have decided the M-avic has handled it with flying colors.  I can't wait to see what I can come up with next.  the flight time is fantastic! (at around 12 minutes per minute) and I'm able to capture some amazing closeup footage, it is still a long ways off from a professional grade but as a hobbyist I'm still extremely impressed with the results.    The drone is still in the development stage. Right now the remote, battery and charger only work with the Mii-Pro or the Miii-Pro. (They have been tested, but are not complete. They have not been tested by the manufacturer but have been released.)   Once the firmware updates are complete and the drone is compatible with the GoPro App the Mavi can be flown remotely. The flight controller will be able to fly autonomously if needed.   After many days of testing, I can say that the Mv-Mavic is a great drone that's still developing and I have not found a use that it's not suited for. I can see the MAvi coming in handy for people who need to get really close to their subject, but for general use it's great.   I've found that with the drone's high resolution and slow battery (it can take between an hour and 3 hours to charge) it's still a little too cumbersome to fly if you are shooting with a high end camera. For everyday use you will find the Mvi to be great. . (They having been tested but are. (The firmware updates will bring the drone to a higher level of performance, but the quad copter is still very early in its development. It will not be released to the public for some time. Once the firmware is
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is very quiet. I have a few other models, but the F7 seems to be the least noisy one.   The remote control is the best.  The built in batteries are quite small.  I like how it has built in speakers and mic.  Very cool!   I would recommend this product to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to replace an aging and now defunct Motorola Vibrator II, but I found that the vibrator has much better power and longer lasting orgasm compared to the G2, so much that I've purchased the G3 and am already looking forward to using it. It has a better design and is more comfortable to use. The power cord has a small cord that is easier to plug in and I like that the included power adaptor is compatible with the older battery, making this unit compatible with other devices I already have.   The only problem I had with this is that the charging cord is too short and can easily get hung up on my nightstand. Other than that, I love it. The only drawback is that it doesn't come with the attachment, which I would have preferred, but it is still a great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I have owned many of them, this is the one I use the most. I have had it for a couple years.   I have owned several of the other models, however these do not have the build quality as this one. The other model is much cheaper and I think much more solid. The built in speakers on this model are just ok at best. Not bad but not great either. The sound quality is what I would call good but not that great. It also needs to be plugged in, the power adapter that comes with it has no usb power output. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The best phone I have ever owned!   There's no need to spend your money on other devices   If you can get a good deal on this phone, you can't do much wrong.   This is the phone I expected when I bought it, and I still want to own it.   The only downside is the screen, and that's a small one to be honest. It's not terrible, but it is the same color and the same brightness on each and every screen you see. I've seen other reviews of it that claim to have gotten the white screen, but this is not the case at all. I think I'll pass on this one.

I recently purchased a portable hard drive from Netgear and it has been very stable and stable is the key word. It is easy to use and very easy to setup.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If your looking to replace your computer or tablet, look no further. The Samsung is a solid device for the price. It is simple and not as fancy as it could be. I have a Windows 7 tablet, and I was worried about the battery life, but I'm very pleased with the battery Life. I've gone for 3 days with no issues and they have plenty of juice left for a week. The camera quality is good, I use it all the time to take photos and videos. The only thing I don't like about the Samsung is the screen size. It's a bit big. There isn't a lot of space to put your apps, and it is difficult to read a document. My only gripe is the camera. It just doesn't perform as well as other phones I've tested. However, with an app like Adobe Creative Cloud, you can work with that tablet with ease. This is one of my favorite purchases. I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the great things about the new generation of portable music players is the ability to carry a lot of music around in a small package. I have a lot more music than I can ever use so this is a great solution for my needs.   The main thing that I like about this device is the fact that you can play with no cables.  There is also a built in microphone (not very good quality but can be adjusted). I've tried to buy some other cheap and good quality portable music player in the past but this one is the best I've ever used. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So far the first two weeks, i've had the g810 for 2 months,  i've not really had to do much work with it other than setting it up and using the software.   This was my first ever computer,  it has done everything i needed.  i could type and type easily,  the mouse works,  there is no lag at all.  This is what it is supposed to do,   I've done alot of research  on this computer  and i am so pleased i bought it   Pros  :   - I love the software,  It's easy to learn how to use and it seems easy to use.  - No lag,  No lag at ALL,  its very quick to boot,  and it is very stable when it does boot.  Cons   this is where i need to comment on the software it comes with.  it only comes with a basic program called "My Computer"  This doesn't even do anything,  when i go to start up my laptop, i have to first change some settings  it says that my screen is a "Nvidia X screen"  and the drivers that come with the software are for a nvidia X300,  then i have all this trouble to figure out what i need in order to make it work.  I am very disapointed because it comes so cheap   It does all the same things my HP laptop does  this laptop does it for $200  I'm not going to bother changing drivers, i'm going to just keep it the way it is.  The other problem i have is,  every time i run into problems with the computer it gets confused and tries to load some old drivers  so all i have left is this nvidia software.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was so excited when I heard about the KV12 for the past couple of years, but it's taken until now for it to arrive. So glad that it finally arrived!   It's a great keyboard replacement - it has the feel of a mechanical keyboard, but with some great keys.   There are many keyboards on the market that look identical to this one, but in my opinion, there is no comparison. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I think this is a great idea for your smartphone. The device is very light and compact and the design is very slick. The battery life is not long but if you are constantly on the move it does last for some time. I'm definitely recommending this device to anyone who is a fan of Android or has a smartwatch.    Best smartwatch! Best smartwatch on the market. I love this watch and I can recommend it to anyone.     - Review for Android Wear Version   -  This is an excellent device that I was very pleased with. It has a great battery life, it is very thin and the color choices are excellent. There is a wide selection of watch faces that look great on this device.   This product is perfect for a busy professional who is always running.    My only complaint is the charging cord is not easy to replace and it is only 5 feet. I would not buy this watch again if I can't easily replace it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     "I have to say, I was extremely pleased with the quality of the keyboard on the G10. The touch pad was fine, but the touch pad could be a little larger. It's not that it's too small but that it just doesn't feel quite as responsive as the other models. I am a bit disappointed as I've already gone through two of the laptops. I did find that I liked the touchpad better than the keyboard."  —Anonymous, G10, August 2013
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      If you are going to pay top dollar for a piece of gear like the iMac, iPad, or even a new gaming machine you need to be able to use the computer as intended.   If you have a laptop that you just want to be used a couple of times a week and doesn't have the power to handle anything but basic computing needs, you will not be pleased with the iMAC, iPad or any of the new Apple gear.  It does have a very nice screen, but the performance is lacking and the screen quality is not good.  If Apple is going to keep trying to push iMac's and iPads to become full-fledged Macs, you are better off getting a PC.  So much for the iSeries.  The iMac is a great little computer and it is better than the iPad or any other iPad or Mac. If you need a computer that will help you get work done, a PC is just the ticket.  But it will not last you the next three years.  Buy a PC before you buy an iMac.  This is true if you are just looking to have a small computer for browsing the Web, emailing, and just a few casual email programs and apps.  However, if you want to use it to run professional programs, the iOS 10.6.3 is a bit sluggish.  iMac owners can expect the newest version of Mac OS X to be released in less than a month.  There is a beta version of the 10.7.1 and the 10GB version of iTunes can be loaded on the iBook but that is about it.  Now, if Apple decides to make 10.8.1 the new version of iOS, which is the latest version of OS X and OS X Mavericks for the Mac, you have the most powerful Mac OS yet.  Apple will most likely release this new version on November 20.  We will have to wait and see how fast the iBooks and iTunes are to load on the new machines, but I think the iDevice has the most complete experience with the most features and performance out of any new Mac.  As a newbie, the only real issue I have with the new iMacs is the new, large screen.  While it is very nice to be bigger, I wish Apple would just keep the same form factor that was in the i5 and i7 line of models.  All the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've used it for over a month and it works great, the batteries last a long time. The buttons are hard to find but work fine once you learn. It's more than a cell phone so not a big deal if you use it for your email, but a huge deal if it's for business. My wife uses it as an alarm clock and she gets up at 6AM for work every day. She doesn't even have to plug in to charge it up.  Write a negative review about an electronic device and its quality:   I have used the iPhone since 2010 but never had one of these phones until a few months ago. The first few days the phone was really hot to the touch. Now I can use it on my iPhone 4 for the last month with no problems. I have used other phones and they've been great for a while but the iPhone is by far the best I have ever used.  and yes, this phone is a great investment!  Don't like:  This was my first smartphone, but I now have the Note and love it. I used my old iPhone 4S, which I thought was so great but I had problems with it. The battery in the Note was much easier to replace. The iPhone app has been helpful in learning about the settings.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first time I bought this item, I had a good laugh at the price. I was a little disappointed with the box and packaging. However, the box wasn't too shabby, and the cable came in a little cardboard box. The cable that came with it was actually a little stiff. I found the cables on Amazon to be more bendy. The unit itself is very easy to set up. I got a little confused while trying to get the light bar set up correctly but everything worked fine. I have to admit that I was initially skeptical about the color temperature setting as it seemed to be a bit too cool to me. However once I got the hang of the light I really enjoyed the warm color temperature. I am only one person so I can't really say if the color is accurate enough. All in all, it's a good little light bar.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use my Apple iPhone to play my iPod. I also use my phone to send an SMS message to my son, which I can use in the car with my iPhone. It's a nice thing to have to communicate.   What a fantastic device.  I love my Apple!   This review is from:  "The iPhone 5"  The "iPhone 5" is one of the best devices Apple has ever produced and it's a bargain at $199.99!  With a 4.7 inch screen and a resolution of 1024 by 640 pixels, the iPhone 5 is a great device for those looking for a device that will serve them well for years to come. The new retina display and faster performance make using the iPhone more natural, while the camera and overall user interface are improved. The iPhone 5's processor is a 64-bit A7, so the graphics are smoother and the animations are smoother, too. The 3.5 mm audio jack is still here, but this time it sounds clearer and the battery life is longer.  What's new with iPhone 5?  The new screen technology is really something, it's gorgeous and it provides a lot of fun features. It comes with a larger 5.5 inch Retina display.  The camera is better, but not amazing.  A lot of apps are now available on the App Store (like iMessage and Maps).  You can also send an email to a specific email address.  You get a better, brighter display with the Retina HD display. It has a high resolution of 2048 x 1536 pixels and a Retina Display. It is definitely better than last year's model, but there is a downside. The screen does not have a scratch-resistant coating.  So you can't use it in the rain.  Another downside is that it is not compatible with the iPod Touch (3rd Generation), and you cannot charge it on an older iPod Touch. The battery life has improved since last year, but you will not find the power of the new Apple, as the phone can run out of charge in just a few hours.  But the iPhone's screen and hardware is still a lot better than the old iPod Touch model, and you can buy a new iPhone 5 for $99.99 and save some money. I love this phone, and the new 4.0 operating system is a nice step forward.  It's been a long time since I've

The battery life is a lot longer then the other devices I have and the price is great. I have one of the "go to" devices and I use it every day.  Thanks e-cigs.com for offering a good alternative to smoking cigarettes.  Great little device: My son loves these!  My son was hesitant at first about vaping, but I've been so pleased with this little device he has become a real vaping fan.  It's nice to be able to have both an ecig and an analog. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this phone to replace my last LG Optimus G. This is a wonderful phone! The only problems I have are a couple with the back buttons and that the buttons sometimes don't seem to be clickable. The battery life on this phone is very good. It is easy to use, and has lots of functions. However, the problem I have with this phone, is that if you lose it, there is not a way to replace it. This seems kind of silly to me. I would buy this phone again if I could.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have not been this happy with a brand new e-cigarette. I have been vaping for a couple of years now, and have gone through several brands, but none have been as consistently smooth as the Smok. I bought the Nautilus 2 a few months ago. This was a pretty pricey purchase at ~$60, but my expectations were pretty low as they seem so similar to some of the other high-end e-cigs I've tried: they're pretty and the packaging and build quality is top notch. However, I have only been using the Smoker for a little over 2 months, and I'm very impressed. My favorite part is the heat up and the lack of a leak when it's working right.   When it's cold and you've just gotten off work, this will be your go to for a quick vape, or even a quick cig break.  Posted by Mark at 4:50 PM
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have an X200 and it is awesome!!   It has an excellent feature set and I am using it to work with large files.   So far, I have not had any issues and I think this device will get me through the next 2 years.   It takes very little time to setup and it has the power to handle very large files with ease.  If you are looking to move a large file to a storage device or transfer one of your media files, then this is the device for you. I would rate the X200 4 out of 5:  The X200 runs at a smooth 4ghz.  It does not slow down when you transfer large files and I have used this device for over a year and never had a problem with the device.  The screen is bright and easy to see at night.  My X200 also has the feature of being able to connect over WiFi to your mobile device as well.  So if you are like me and you need the extra storage for all your media, then get the X300 and enjoy the added features.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use this device for my daily needs such as making music and emailing. I am not a music lover but this is the only way I can get my music on the air. I do not use the built in speakers much because I do a lot of web surfing and have to keep the volume on. I find the built-in speakers a good compromise. I also like the quick connection to the internet that they have. The battery life is also good. I'm happy to find a product I can use everyday. If I'm going on a trip, I can connect to the cloud and stream music on a portable level. I just need more of the same. I have bought another for a friend who is a musician. Good purchase!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really enjoy my Rode NTG6. It's the very best Bluetooth speaker that I've had. It was easy to set up with only a few taps of the screen. The sound quality is superb and I'm sure that you will be surprised by how great it sounds even in very close proximity to your face. The speaker itself feels very solid. It can't be dropped, bumped or pushed on your face which is very important when you're listening to music. The only downside is that it is a little big for me. Other than that, I recommend the Rode because it's the most complete Bluetooth speaker available at this time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     My Samsung Smart TV is the best in the market, it's very fast, powerful and looks great.  Excellent performance and features. The only reason I gave this 5 stars is because I wish the remote control buttons were a little more responsive. They don't always work when you press them and the system doesn't react to the button until the other player has finished playing. You'll be doing a lot of button mashing, which isn't a good thing, as this will make you work more.

This also didn't come with a manual, but when I purchased a new one a couple of days ago it came in a nice, heavy package. So, I know that you have gone above and beyond for me. Good job!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this device for about a week now and I have to say I have really enjoyed my time using this product. I have an iBook and iPad and this is a pretty big improvement over those. It is very nice to be able to read eBooks on a Kindle using the included reader app. I did find it to be a little bit on the expensive side but you should not have to pay more for something this nice. The only thing I can think of is the small button placement on the screen. I would like to see a little more adjustment in how the buttons are positioned but otherwise this is nice. I hope to get another set of e-book reader's in the near future! I am very pleased with my purchase and it is a very nice device to have around!Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used this product in the past couple of days. It works great as a Bluetooth headset. However, when I tried to turn it off, it started to glow a deep green color. I would expect something like that to be easy to turn off with a keypress, but it was not. Also, when you're using Bluetooth to connect to the computer, you should be able to do it on the go. With this, you have to manually turn it back on. You also have to deal with the fact that the LED's that you see in the app don't light up properly when your headphones are plugged in. I'm very disappointed with this product.

If you want a good device for the price, this is a good choice.  If you want to get something that is a little more powerful than your average Android phone, this may be the device for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    5.0 out of 5.0 stars (based on 4 reviews) (4)  Write a good review about an electronic device and you'll be praised by your fellow forum users!     I bought this product because I wanted a good wireless remote for my phone, but the price wasn't great. I used to have a Sony Bluetooth device and used to use it for that. But I think the Sony is better in most of it's functions. My wireless remote works great, but when you use it, it's not really as smooth as the one you get from Bose.   However, if you're looking for a wireless remote with a nice sound quality, it may be the perfect choice for you.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      This is the first computer I've owned that's "unplugged" from a wall outlet. It's so tiny! It just fits right in your hand! Even better, you can plug it in, turn it on, and have a usable computer without a power cord! The interface is very smooth and easy to use. This is an excellent value! It's a real "gaming machine" and not just a "tablet PC."
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Love this   This is one of the best toys I've ever bought. The design of the head is great, and the shape allows you to thrust it into places where it will not hurt you. I don't have to pull the head out to pee, it's really comfortable. My only issue is the packaging, but I'll probably replace it anyway. I've also been a fan of the sex toy manufacturers who make toys that are easy to clean and don't cause any pain. The Rabbit is no different. I love it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If I had a $20,000,000 device that would allow me to see the whole world's history in 3D, I'd buy it.   This is a really nice 3D camera, and the price is right.  The main problem I had was that the lens of the device is too narrow for my eyes.  I bought the 1.3MP device, but I have a bigger lens, so the 1MP is really good for me.  When you look up at a high building, you'll notice that the image isn't sharp, and it's a bit distorted when looking down.  It's not too bad at night, and for a small object, it's not bad.  But I really needed to use this device to get the history of World War 2 to look like I wanted it to look. This device is a work of art.  This device was made by a gentleman who went to the trouble of making an accurate and beautiful World War II map.  He has the time and effort to make this map of a country that he has lived in since he was a small child.  Every detail is included.  One of the most amazing things about this device is that, when you turn it on, the camera will automatically take you to where you have the most recent photo taken from.  You have to be there in order for the device to work correctly.  To help in locating the location, there is a timer that will send you the photo of the place as soon as it is taken.  Even if it's dark, you will be able to see it with a good lens.

Since then I've used it in every conceivable situation imaginable. It has worked flawlessly. This is my 3rd unit. No issues. No failures. This one has exceeded my expectations. I'll be purchasing another one soon!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I love my laptop.   I use my laptop with my iPad and iPhone.  I wish they sold it with a stand...but the stand is very expensive.  They made the battery life on the battery last for at least 3 more days... I use the same power adapter with my computer.  The price was a steal.  The screen is beautiful, the keyboard is nice, the build quality is great, and its battery life is fantastic.  It even has a headphone jack which I don't think Apple should be without. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If there's one thing about this product, it's that you have it on your wrist! The battery is very long lasting, so even with my old smartphone, I haven't had to worry about the battery going dead!   I also find it convenient to use on the go, since I rarely carry my laptop, so this product is a great fit for me! The sound quality of this device is fantastic, and if you're into bass music, I find myself using it at the gym (or any loud music) a lot.   Finally, if you need some music on the train or subway, you'll want to consider this device!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A week ago, I was very interested in my new iDevices R-100 digital watch that I bought from   for $200. My favorite feature of this watch is the ability to change the date in a few seconds, thus allowing me to get the most accurate time. The other features of the watch are: The R-Series watches have built-in microphone with a rechargeable battery and built-ins built-into the side of the face, so the watch is more water resistant. It has a built- in speaker which allows the wearer to hear what the wearer is doing, such as answering a call, or speaking into the mic. It also has built--in GPS that allows the watch to determine the location of the wearer by taking an optical image. It can track a walker with the help of a Bluetooth beacon, and if you have Bluetooth earbuds the watch will sync automatically so that the music you're listening to and the GPS map will remain synced. The R1011 also has the capability to use GPS as a watch on the go by using the Garmin Live Map. All these features were not present on the previous iDevice model, which I really liked. When I first got the R-1011, I noticed that it was really hard to get a good picture of the clock hands, even with a digital camera. It wasn't until I got the Garmin Forerunner 305/305HR that I noticed the lack of a proper and accurate view of the date. This new watch allows you to have the most up-to-date, accurate time on your wrist. The most common criticism of the iDevICES R- Series is that their GPS is not as accurate as their GPS watches from other manufacturers. This is true, but the watch can track with a battery life of 2 years, whereas the Garmin's watch can only provide for 2 days. To be fair, I don't see many people using the GPS function. However, the GPS is pretty accurate in areas that you need it, such a hiking trails. Overall, the watch was worth the purchase, especially for a beginner. It is definitely a step up from the Garmin and is the best price on the market.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     "It took some time to figure out how to use it but when I did, it was just like a computer when I used an old computer. I was really surprised by this because I used to have a computer but I didn't do very much. This was the first computer that I used since then that was more powerful than my old computer (the Sony Vaio VPC-TL) and the keyboard was better than my older computer. The screen is much more detailed and colorful. The speakers are great. The size of the computer is perfect." -- Brian, New Jersey, USA
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     5 out of 5 Great value - good product Very good device. Fast, accurate, and works flawlessly. Very easy to use. Highly recommended!  4 out of 2 found this review helpful My first step into electronic cigarette was with this unit. I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I like it because it works so well. The batteries are a little larger than the ones I have in my original cigarettes. The only downside I would say is that I would be nice if the mouthpiece was smaller. The mouthpiece is quite long. I can fit a larger bottle on there and then my juice doesn't run out so fast. The product itself is very good quality, I am very happy with this purchase. I do not like how it comes with a small charger because it does not have an outlet built in, so I just plugged it into my phone charger to charge it.  3 out of 4 found this reviews helpful good little device the juice comes with and the unit works pretty good but the batteries are not rechargeable and it takes a while to charge up. if you don't want to run out of juice you need to charge before you use. other than that it's a good little product.

The camera is great, battery life lasts for days (I keep mine charged up all the time) and the video quality is good. I have been shooting with it a while now and the only thing that has changed is the interface is now a little more intuitive and the lens is a little bigger.

I do use a laptop but had always wanted a tablet that works and is portable as well! The battery life is so so and you get some cool apps that will make your life easier. I use it for web surfing and gaming (like Angry Birds). I really think I should have gone with an iPad but I am so happy I bought it because of the gaming apps.

I'm not a fan of the small, light and slightly clumsy size of the iplex.  that being said, it does a good job, just have to use it with some care, the controls are a little bit finicky.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A good phone should:  a) be easy to use, b) be simple, c) have nice design, d) not be a pain in the ass to work on, and e) have a good microphone.   The Moto X, in all the right ways, does a good job with the first three of those points, but has a hard time with the last one.  A couple of days after purchasing the Moto X (the first one in the US!), my boyfriend broke his thumb while using the phone to take a picture and call someone. After a bit of investigation, he learned that his phone had a fingerprint scanner, so he tried it out.  It worked... kinda.  The fingerprint scanner had problems registering the finger that was put in, so the picture he took was of the index finger, while the rest of his finger was marked for "Invalid Fingerprint".  Luckily, there were two of us in the room when he tried the scanner out, so we were able to help him.  For $199, I'd be okay with a slightly unreliable fingerprint scanner.  This phone is one of the better looking ones on the market.  Although I still prefer using my iPhone, I think it's a good upgrade from my HTC One, especially for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best Bluetooth speaker I have had. The audio quality is superb. The sound is clear with no distortion. The design is very good and very practical. I use the speaker in conjunction with a Bose Soundlink. The Bluetooth connection works flawlessly. The best thing about this speaker is how much it costs. It's a lot more than the speakers I have owned and paid for the last few years. The speakers I bought last year are about twice as much as this one. I can recommend this speaker to anyone interested in good Bluetooth speakers.

I'm a bit annoyed at the keyboard (the keys are mushy) and with the touch pad, I didn't like the size at all and I tried the old Windows laptop which had a lot better trackpad.  *  * A good device for light web browsing:  * * *   The touchpad is very easy to use but is mushy.   In all these reviews I've read the only thing that is not perfect in my view is the keyboard. I didn`t like the keyboard of the old HP and this one is no different.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used a few different ones and have come to a consensus on the Voodoo 3 with the AudioQuest Dragonfly. The sound is very good and is not too muddy even at high volumes. The volume control also makes a world of difference as I have heard the headphone get quite loud and even at normal volumes it is more than adequate. The headphone is very comfortable and the ear pads are soft and supportive. My only complaint is the cable. I can see why this is a flagship model since the cable is the main focus, but in my opinion this is not the best cable in the world and makes a huge difference.  Good headphone, but:.......................................   The soundstage is good and I enjoy the immersive sound in my music. But the lack of bass and the lack the depth and spaciousness of the soundstage make it less than perfect.   However, for the price the V3 is a great buy and I am going to get another one for myself.   I recommend this headphone as I feel like the sound is not bad at all but it could be better, especially the bass is lacking. The fit of the ear cups is very nice, the comfort is good, the sound and the build quality are both excellent. , July 10, 2018: This is one of the best headphones I have owned in a long time. I have had them for over 2 years and have only had 1 problem with them. There are some small imperfections that I noticed at the base of the headband but nothing significant. The cups have a great clamping force and seal but have the unfortunate issue of getting very warm to the touch after extended use. This is a problem with all Bose products, but the headphone is much more susceptible to it than the headphones that are much more expensive. The comfort of these is great though. I really don't get that bass problem they have to be as good as the Beats and the V-Moda's. I am very happy with my purchase and the price is right at $150.00.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1) If you like the device it has a lot of potential as a good music source.   2) The sound quality is good with good highs and lows.  3) This is a portable device which means you can easily plug it into your laptop, MP3 player or even computer speaker.  4) The device is portable which means if you want to keep it nearby you can carry it.  5) The app on the app store gives you some great features like the ability to control the volume and the song count.  I love the price, the device is light and small and will be a great addition to my iPhone/iPad collection.  I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      A nice product!    by Michael R. on 11/09/2011 byon 11/08/2011 " I have been using the LITE version of this product (with a small LED light on the bottom) for two weeks. I have an LED flashlight that I use all the time, but I'm more familiar with the LIGHT version.   The LITE can be easily activated by simply pressing the button, which is located just above the batteries (just above the light). The button is small and easy to access; there are no markings on it which could cause confusion. It takes about 10-15 seconds to go from "off" to full brightness. That's really quick for a flashlight. However, once you turn it on, it takes several seconds to turn back to "off." The LED flash light is a nice addition; it's bright and not distracting, but it will only last so long before it dims. The flashlight does have a short battery life, which means you'll have to replace it before a day is over.  , but in a good way. The light is small, but the fact that it has an LED makes it stand out from the crowd of "flashlights." I bought it so I could carry it when I go to the beach to get sunburned. I am sure that it will also be helpful to hikers on trail with limited cell reception, as I would imagine this flashlight to be more effective than a cell phone.  . It's great to have an electronic flashlight with an LED light for outdoor use, as it is a lot less annoying than a flashlight that has to be plugged in to charge. The only downside is that it does get hot very quickly and you will want to keep it away from heat sources.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best. You'll love them. I do have one problem and that is that I've found that I don't have much use for them, and I'd rather get a USB headset and my iPod.   It's just a little odd to be using a computer that requires a lot of battery power to operate, and yet the earbuds don't. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this at Wal-Mart for a good price. When I first got it, it was a bit noisy. After I turned it on, it quieted down quite a bit. But, the sound is still a bit annoying in my apartment. I would definitely buy this again for a small office. The USB port is an added bonus, but you have to be careful not to put it in the wall. But this is a nice little electronic device for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My e-reader is fantastic! I've had it for less than a year but already it's reading hundreds of books and I'm only halfway through. I'm a new dad and this is a great device to help me focus on my family's well being.    Good for first time E-Reader Owner:  I just received my Kindle Paperwhite. I am a first-time e-Reader owner and I love it! I don't use the bookmarks so I cannot comment on the ease of using this new device. The only thing I would comment on is that the battery is not as long as I had hoped but I just wanted to put that down to initial inexperience with the device. I would say it is a decent product for those of you who are just beginning to read e-books. I do like the way the page turn buttons work.  Incomplete review:  I'm using my e-Readers on the go to review the devices and to find out their pros and cons. I've been using an E-reader for several years and now want to buy a Kindle. I really like that I can read a book while I am driving in the car so this device is perfect for me. I just can't recommend the Kindle PaperWhite for the speed of the reading. The E-Reads can't match the speed and quality of a good paperback but they do hold a lot of eBooks on their screens and it is fun to browse the e-Book shelves and see what is on the shelves that I want to read. I will also admit that I really do not know how these things work so I have no clue about the battery life. One thing that I am very impressed with is the speed at which I can flip through pages. I read my books in 3-4 days. My experience has been a lot better than many of my friends who are on a similar budget. There is a lot to be said for the size and functionality of the Kindle. It does a lot. For a budget device like the Kindle the Kindle Fire is also a nice alternative and I have had a lot more fun with that device.

I'm on T-Mobile and it's so quiet that it makes my phone feel a little hollow.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The SONY Z Ultra was a really great choice, especially since I'm in a position to get the best of the best. I'm a Sony enthusiast and this is probably the best Sony has ever made. It has a super-large screen that takes up my entire living room wall. The sound quality is superb, but the speakers on this unit are way too quiet. I can't find any use for the headphone jack, so that's a bonus.   So glad I found this unit! It's much better than the Z Ultra and even beat out my old Sony PCM-E1.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - - -   I bought this in order to record audio with my Mac Mini. I have a 2.8 inch audio recording port in my Mac. I've also had a similar mic. This is by far the best for recording audio, the quality is pretty much on par with the one I previously owned. The built-in USB ports is great, but it is only 2.4 megabits per second - not fast enough. The mic on this unit is great. I haven't really tried to take advantage of it yet, but the mic is really good, and the audio quality is quite good. I think my only complaint about this unit would be the price. It is still the most expensive USB 2.0 USB mic on the market, however, I would say that this mic is more of a "first class" mic than the others on the same class of microphone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this because I was a big fan of the original iPod Touch. The sound quality is quite good and it's a great size. It's also easy to charge. I do wish it was a little bigger, but at least I'll have a backup in case I forget to charge it. If I get one for my kids or grandkids, I'll definitely get one of these in the next 2 years or so. I'm already looking forward to replacing the iPod.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had this device for about a month now, and it is awesome. It's a nice sounding unit. I love the fact that the volume and treble are adjustable. I've used the unit while sitting down at my computer, watching a DVD, and while sitting at a desk. My only issue is that I wish the remote control could be a little easier to use. The buttons are spaced quite a bit and sometimes don't work. They seem to work more sometimes than they do. Other than that, I would recommend this device to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had been looking for this device for a long time, but could not justify the $$$ because it did not seem to match my needs. I have been working a lot lately, and with all my gadgets, I had really been wishing that I had something more compact. This device is great for what it is! The quality is amazing. The volume is perfectly adjustable, and the audio quality is great. I am using it to control my air conditioner, and it sounds wonderful. I wish they had something smaller and smaller, but overall a great purchase, and definitely worth the $25.00 price tag!  Rated 4 out of 5 by jm from good product but very hard to set up I am very happy with my purchase. However, for the price I paid, the volume control was a little difficult to use. If you want to change the volume, you must first pull out the ear buds, which took some practice to get used to. The battery life is also short, the unit was just fine for a week or so but after that, it seemed like there would be no battery for a couple days, so I took it down to the store. I was told that if they could find another battery, they would replace the one that was defective. So, I got a new one but the only thing it has improved on is the volume of the sounds. The noise cancellation was a minor improvement for me, but I think that it could have been better had it not been for the volume setting. Overall, good device for the cost and is really easy to set-up. I bought 2 and now they are in a closet because I just don't use them any more.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for a family of three, because we wanted to be able to listen to our music from a distance without a TV. The sound was very good from what I could hear. The bass is good, and has a nice level in it. There was a noticeable level change at higher volumes. I've heard good sound from the same speakers I got on this site, but the ones on this one sound slightly better. I just finished playing one of these speakers and I couldn't be happier. I have been listening to my iPod on my bed, which was too big of a room for my stereo system to fit, so I bought the two speaker set in hopes that I could listen to music while sitting up in bed. I'm so glad I bought this system. The speakers are easy to put up, and they work well. There's no "pop" and I like the high end of the bass. I don't like that some of the sub-woofer bass sounds a little too boomy, but that's to be expected. I would have liked the sub to sound more neutral, but it's great. Also, I don' think that they have a bass adjustment, but I'm a fan of the sound I get without that added noise. So, thanks Soundmax. If you like the sound you get with your speakers, you'll love the sound.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm new to this, but I have to say, I'm really happy with this product! I'm currently on my second one, and I've used it for everything I can think of. It is pretty easy to get the hang of, and is easy to use, but if you can't figure out the steps, don't feel bad - it's not the most easy thing to learn. However, once you do, I've been very happy with the functionality, and this thing is a beast. My favorite thing about it is that it is a portable device as well, and can work anywhere you want. I can watch the news on my car, listen to my music, or write on a piece of paper while I'm on the go. The only thing I've found to be a little hard is the menu system, which I have no idea how to navigate. It's pretty confusing for me, but hopefully it gets easier as I get used to it. Another thing I don't like is the battery life. This is a pretty small, light battery, and the longest it has lasted is about 3-4 hours. That is a little disappointing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      The iDroid 1.0 arrived yesterday, and I must admit, that I was impressed. I knew it was a pretty low-tech product (a little more like a calculator than a phone), but I didn't expect it to be this good. It's a good phone, even though I don't use it for a lot of applications. The display has a very clear, crisp, bright, and clear image, so it's not a cheap phone, and it has great sound quality, too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Hi i am new to the e-cig scene and i have tried quite a few now, I like the fact that they give you more control over your flavors and the battery life is great. The battery life on mine is only about 5 hours and its still a good long time. The only drawback i see is how the coil doesn't always come out evenly but the best thing is how good the cloud looks. The coils are just the right size, the taste is awesome, but the most important is the battery.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used this device for a short time. I bought it on sale, and after reading some reviews, I decided to give it a try.   The design of this device is great. I've never had anything that actually fits a battery so snugly. After unboxing it, the only problem I had was the batteries were not sealed as tightly as they could have been. I used them without any problems. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is a very good product and very good value.    Excellent product and value, at a good price:  It is an excellent and well built machine. The build quality is excellent and the speed and quality are fantastic. The noise on my amp is very minimal and doesn't have any unwanted sound to it whatsoever.   For only having to buy the case and plugging in the battery as well, this unit is great value, especially if you don't have a great deal on a good amp.   (Posted on 8/7/2017)  Perfect for my needs:................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... I have been looking for an amp that will handle my bass to go with my keyboard setup for many years. I have a Yamaha RDX which is a great unit but lacks a bit in the top end for my liking. I needed an amp with more power and more clarity. I did not want to spend a fortune and have a decent sounding amp. I found the Klipsch RS1030. I do not know how it compares to the RDX because I have no idea. The RS10 is definitely louder and more powerful. I used to own a Yamaha YSR amp but found it was not the right solution for my requirements. I was always too sensitive and never got all that bass. I had been looking a long time for a decent-sounding, high quality 1030 amp, so after reading the review and using my Klips chips on it I purchased it. I am not a professional musician, so I can only give a fair opinion and try to describe the experience. The amp is a little louder than I like, but it has so much more power in the sound than my old Yamaha and it also sounds a lot better. When I got it home I connected it to my mixer (the original Yamaha) and set up my bass and I'm getting a huge amount of high end and clarity. My main amp is not that loud either, but I don't mind because I can set it to low power. My other amplifier has a bit too much distortion and I cannot stand it. With the Klipps the bass sounds great and is very clean sounding. It sounds so good with my Yamaha and I donít know if Iíve really improved it that much at all. However, it would be nice if the amp was bigger (more volume) and had more power. However the Klippingst
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a wonderful product! The sound is a little louder than expected, but that's what this device is for. I haven't used an amp yet because I wanted to wait to hear the results of the high quality amp and monitor I bought for my computer. But I'm not worried about that.   I love the touch screen!   So far, I've only used it to play games. But it does do something! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you want to use your own laptop as a desktop replacement, it's probably not going to get much work done. However, if you're a web-savvy, web-centric person, the Eee PC (which looks like a laptop but packs a few extra niceties) is a fantastic alternative.   This computer is not the "best" at any one thing, but if you want a reliable, low-maintenance alternative to a Windows computer, it might be the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In all fairness, these are excellent headphones. They sound excellent.   It doesn't bother me if they aren't perfect, because they are pretty darn good.  The only thing that bothers me is that the ear pads are too big, and that the headband is a little short, but that's a minor detail. I use these when I'm sitting in the living room, and in the car, and while I'm working. They really do sound better than I expected they would.  I would buy them again, especially if they had less expensive versions with more memory.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this monitor for gaming on my new gaming laptop. I bought it mostly for the gaming performance. The build quality is excellent for the price. The color accuracy and contrast is better than I had hoped for. The size is perfect and the stand is pretty sturdy. The speakers are ok but are hard to turn up. I don't play any PC games but would recommend this to anyone who wants an alternative to their standard LCD monitor.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Reviewer: jj - favorite favorite favorite - December 6, 2010  Subject: How to set up a Soundcard in Linux I have been trying to set this up for a while and have found that the documentation is not up to date. The following links should get you started:  How to install a sound card in Linux   To get a general idea of what can be accomplished, take a look at the following files:   How do I start the device?   The SoundCard module in Linux requires a sound driver. You will find a number of different drivers for different types of devices. To determine which driver to use, use the following command:   the name of the device, for example:  the nameof the device,. For example: the sound card, for example, will tell you that this device is a sound device.   , for a. For example, you will tell is a device. To get the driver to run, run:  it depends on your particular device. For a Sound Card, you need to first find the device driver that you need. It will be under the /dev directory in a regular Linux distribution. Look for a file that has the.conf extension and has the filename: the name. For most drivers, that filename will be the device name. This file can be either in the /lib/firmware/ directory or as a /etc/modprobe.d/ directory. If you do not already have the necessary permissions to modify it, then you should use a program called gksu to get the necessary file from the firmware.   and have the filename. For Most Drivers, thatfilename will be in the directory. This is a Linux command for accessing the sound cards and sound modules. You do not have to know anything about Linux in order to use it, although you might want to. The SoundCard application is an interface to your sound card. It is called "Sound" by default in Linux and is located in /usr/lib/sound. The user should have root permission to use the application.Once you have the application open, you can configure it to work with your sound device (you can also use the graphical front end to get information about your soundcard, if you wish). If the SoundCard program does not work for some reason (it may not show the correct information or may not function at all), you will have to find the exact

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i  It's a great tool for making video recordings, but also very good for making home movies!   The camera works very well, even at night. It is also easy to use and very well built, the plastic has no flex and the lens has a nice long focus throw. The tripod mount is also very secure. I love the remote control - just turn the dial to your desired exposure, then press the button, and your done. I also like the included battery grip.   For video shooting, I like the size of the camera, especially for the price. I'm using a Canon A5000, which is a great camera for the money.  The viewfinder is not too wide, but you can see the whole image on a screen, which I prefer.  There is no menu to mess with, and there is very little distortion in the images.  It is easy to adjust the focus and exposure as well, by moving the knob, and it has a decent auto-focus mode.  For stills, I would recommend this camera for stills. The video mode isn't that great in my opinion, the video doesn't shoot at a high enough speed, so you can't use it as a video recorder.  This camera is great for both.   Good camera, terrible battery.  Review by Mike  I use this camera on a tripod with my 50mm lens and the battery life sucks! It takes about 4 shots to record an 8 minute long video and then it only has 2 shots left. I have to charge it after every session. If you want to record short clips and save them to your camera roll you will have to get a better battery. This is definitely not a budget camera. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the K-70 because of the review that this was a perfect replacement for the iphone 6s (it is not though).   The iphones are way more than a replacement.   They are better than iphons in every way.  It takes photos really well, even when the flash is on, and the interface is very fast.  A nice feature is the flash, you can turn it off when you are not shooting and the camera takes photos instantly without a sound.  The microphone is okay, the quality is not as good as my iphony, but still pretty good.  Very happy with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My i7 laptop has a 2x2 inch display, 2x Intel cores, 8gb ram, 128gb SSD, and Windows 7 64bit. It has also been upgraded with a 512gb SSD. When I bought this laptop I was very pleased with the build quality and the screen resolution.    I love this machine:  I've owned three of the first generation machines: my first iMac (3.3 GHz 4 core CPU, 16gb ram and a 256gb SSD), my third one (2.8 GHz, 8GB ram and 256gb HDD) and my latest one (1.8 ghz, 8 gb ram, 256gb flash drive and 256 gb SSD) and I really don't like any of them.  The screen has become more grainy with time and I'm a big fan of the i7 processor and 16 gb of ram but that being said the SSD is too slow and I can't seem to get the system to boot at all.  This machine will work fine for someone who wants to run games and surf the web but I really would not recommend buying it if you're just going to use it for surfing the net and running word processor.  I would not suggest this system for serious video editing but then again this is not my first or last machine and I doubt I would buy another one anytime soon either. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love this thing. My wife got it and I took a picture and she had to stop laughing. When she found out she thought I had a mental breakdown. And I mean that quite literally. I have never used a remote for a device this big before so I was quite worried for a while. However, the first time I used the buttons on the front of the device (where the controls are) the thing opened a panel and it was not a good idea because then I got two of them stuck and would not open the device at all. I had to remove the screen. But I got over it after that and I like the remote so much now that I have a bigger phone and a computer so it was nice to have this one.

My only gripe is that there is a small plastic bump at the rear of the case, which could be an improvement, as it would make it easier to insert the case and remove it from the back of the unit. Other than that, it is a great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     -Excellent design -Great value for money -Simple to use -Works as advertised -No glitches -No hassle for the price "The only thing I would like to see a little more of is a way to make the connection between the light on top and the screen, so the phone is not in the same position as on the back, which makes reading the battery life indicator difficult. I would also like to be able to use the phone without the back cover on, but that's not a major issue and would not have made a difference to me." -Shelley L., United Kingdom "Great phone, no battery issues. Nicely polished metal, looks a lot like Apple devices and the price is fantastic for what you get. You can't go wrong with it and it would be nice to see the back design be more like the one on the iPhone 5 and/or iPod touch, instead of just a single flat piece." -Liam O., Canada "I would not call this a "perfect" phone. The size is not ideal in a large hand, the speaker quality isn't great, and the speaker is loud enough that it can drive my wife's iPod. The camera and the size are not for everyone, so try before you buy. Also, the power button, volume buttons, and power button on the rear are a little awkward, and I have to grip the back to push the button to turn it on." -Ben R., Australia "It's an old classic! The price is right on the dot, the design is classy, and it has the features I was hoping to get out of it. My only gripe is the back panel, as it is fairly rigid and won't slide down on my desk without help. Not a huge deal though and if you're someone who doesn't have to do much of the typing (I'm pretty lazy), the back can easily be removed if you have it for a long period of time." -Jenna A., United States "Very nice. My old iPhone 5 was very fragile, and this was just as good, if not better. The screen is easy to read and it's not hard to use. I have a couple of apps that I like but the ones I use the most are in the store for a reason: price." -Dee S., United Arab Emirates "Amazing phone. Beautiful screen, excellent processor and camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the price and performance, the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x will not disappoint.   With a price tag of $200 or so (or just under $200), the ATH has some serious competition for its price range.  However, that price is for a product with so little to offer and is also one that is not "professional quality" but in most cases has a better overall value. The sound from the AHP50x is more balanced and better in its presentation than the M50, but the overall experience is the same.  If you really want the best value for the money, it really is hard to beat the Ath M50x. Posted by ATH at 9:10 PM
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got the tablet last week and have been having a hard time with it because my wife keeps trying to stop me from using it. So, I decided to go to a service and have the screen repaired. The service guy did a very good job and fixed the screen within 20 minutes. He told me that the screen on my Samsung laptop is much worse and he wouldn't be able to do anything about that since I own the same Samsung laptop. I've tried everything from my Apple laptop to my Toshiba laptop but nothing can touch the quality of my Apple screen. The Samsung's screen is just as good as any of the other computers but is just not as comfortable. I still can use my laptop but it is a big step down. Overall a good service.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The AEG (Auto Eject Gun) was a great addition to my gun collection. I really enjoy having this gun in my hands. I also like that the charging handle has a built in safety. This gun is very solid. This is my second gun from Elite Tactical that I have purchased. The first one was the AEG-01 (which is the same exact gun minus the battery compartment, or so I am told). I recommend the Aeg-01 as the AGG is only a little heavier and not nearly as solid. I would like to see the charging handles and the bolt released lever redesigned, but that is minor and not worth a 5 star. I do like the way they look, the metal is very well made and looks good. Overall I would recommend this to any player of any style who wants a solid gun that looks great, shoots great and is easy to use. If you can find a cheaper AEG in this price range, you should definitely do that.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new LG L9100 is a very good smartphone in general. I've been using it for a couple of months and can say that it's not that bad a device in general (it's just not very well-designed) and I don't mind the way it's built. As I said before, it's definitely not a great design, but I haven't had much trouble with it since I've had it and it hasn't made me regret buying it. The screen is very good and has great color accuracy (in daylight, at least). I've tried many devices over the past few years (including Samsung phones, Samsung TV's, and even a few Nexus devices) and this is the best one for my needs. I am on my 4th LG phone now (3x LG L90's, but the new L9102 doesn't have the battery) and it's never disappointed me.

I'm very happy with this device, it is everything the S5 should have been and more. The only complaint I have is with the microphone. If you plug it in with a mic that requires phantom power, it's a no-go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have tried many different brands of portable audio players, including the Bose SoundSport    and the Koss Porta  , and I finally purchased the Bowers & Wilkins P3 because it looks a little more expensive (for an iPhone) but it is a lot more enjoyable to use than most of the others.   There are more than enough inputs (two) and outputs (three) to make this a nice, portable system for those times when I need to go to the bathroom without the other devices I have in my bedroom.  Aesthetically, this is a sleek, elegant, and attractive piece of equipment with the B&W P3 making it the perfect backdrop for watching TV shows, music videos, and sports. It doesn't look like it cost a lot, so it also makes for a very cheap gift for someone.  The only thing I don't like about this system is that it has a lot of extra inputs and outputs, and if you have a lot going on at home, you'll want a bigger system.  But if you are like me, and you want something that has a little less noise, can plug in easily, and does not consume a lot battery power, the P3 might be a good choice for you.   The B&Ws are still in a beta test phase so some of the features may be changed before its full release.

Also, you can easily control how often it charges. I've found the "Quick charge" to be perfect for my needs. I just love it!  I really like it. I use it to power my iphone for calls and emails as well as playing music. I did have to buy the USB charger for my ia and it was not enough for me so I had to buy a micro usb. I have no issues with it at all. The only issue is that my iPhone does not charge while using this device because the charger is too big for the iPhone. My husband can't charge his phone. I wish I had a longer battery to charge my phone but it is perfect.  Best purchase ever I am so glad I found this on Ebay...this charger worked perfectly! I never have to worry about running out of batteries for my digital devices. Love it! I've also had to put it into airplane mode, but it's not a problem because it charges quickly!

I was also worried about the picture distortion, which I only found out was my TV being too dim. I used the TV for a couple of weeks before I got a 1080p display. The picture is much better than I thought. The contrast is great. And the picture is more detailed than I expected. This is a good TV. I would like to see the sound go up to higher quality, but as it stands, this is good enough.

It is easy to use and the fact that it is not battery powered really helps it get the job done.  This thing is very sturdy and comes with a ton of good batteries.  It works with a PC or a MAC.  If you want a good device that is small but powerful, then this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The GX1 is my first portable computer and I'm really impressed with it. The quality is very nice. It's easy to use and the battery life is awesome. I used the GX to watch videos and listen to music and it does all that with ease and speed.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had this for about a month now. I have no problems with it, it's amazing for what it is. If you have a problem, call a repair person and they will be able to fix it. I am not impressed with the size and that it comes with a small charger. It is great that you can keep it for when the power goes out, but this is what I would have wanted out of a watch of this size, it would have been better if they made it a bit larger. If I had a larger wrist, I would probably not use it because I think it's a bit to big. But I am 5'8" and it fits me perfectly. I can wear it with a shirt or a long sleeve shirt because it doesn't slip. It would be great if you could replace the watch battery for a bigger one that wouldn't have to be charged so often.  Product:   I received the product very quickly, and the watch is amazing for the price.  to bad the watch arrived with 2 battery units, i guess i should have just used that extra time to look for the charger to replace it. but i did like the watch more after having replaced the battery  1 of 1 found this review helpful. .  and the other one that came with it is pretty nice too, very simple design and i love how it looks. but the battery is not that good, i had to replace the battery every 2 weeks and now the watch still works. but at a big loss on how to replace that battery because it is not removable  of 1 found the review helpful  Was this review useful? Yes  Good. -  Reviewer: A  It's not very easy to replace a watch battery. The watch is very small, so I wish the battery case was a bit bigger and made it easier to swap out the battery.  be careful though. I lost one of the 3 batteries that came in the box and had to buy 2 replacement batteries because the first one had a little problem. (If the battery were bigger, then it would be easier.) The other battery was fine though. Overall, I'm pleased with the product.    Was also helpful:  A  The watch itself is very nice. I do wish it had a small battery case as it does tend to loose a bit over time and the larger one can't be easily replaced without
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got a really great item as promised. This is a good quality unit, easy to set up, easy for anyone to use. The only con I found is that it doesn't like the heat of the touch screen to it. If you want to use this as a remote you can use a bluetooth mouse. This does have a good range.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is my 4th device from Apple.   I'm happy with these.  As long as I don't have an SD card, these are great.  I've used them to watch movies and TV shows with iTunes and they play great. As long I'm not missing my old DVD player, I can use these in the background without draining my battery.  They are small, light, easy to use, and affordable!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you're buying a good e-reader or laptop, don't use "e" for "e-reader" or "ebook" for any type of electronic device;     they don't have to be different, it's more accurate to use "electronic device" for a specific type of device rather than a specific device.   I don't know why they use the old term, "iPad," for iPads in the U.S., but I'm not a fan of the "i" sound in that term, especially because it makes it sound like it doesn't even work.  I've read many reviews and am still not a huge fan of any type.  It is my opinion that all e-readers are not good in their specific type. There are the Apple E-readrs, which are great, but the iPad Mini is not.  The Amazon Kindle is a nice device but still isn't the best, and I don�t think any of the other e-book readers have the same features as the Kindle.  And the Nook HD and Sony Reader HD are good ereaders, but are still a bit pricey, and my Sony Reader is a very expensive electronic device. I've also bought some older e-dvd and some older computer laptops, and each one had the same problem.  Each one had a "i," even though it did not have an electronic device in the name.  They were all just computer devices, and they worked just like computers.  There is a small difference between an e-ink screen and a computer screen, but not much.  E-ink screens are used mostly to read ebooks and computer documents on mobile devices.  Apple e-Reader, $250.    Nook Ht, $149.  This screen can't be replaced if it's a defect, so you have to buy a new device if it breaks or becomes defective, but this is not something I'm worried about.  But in order to buy an ereader or computer device, you have have to use a specific term to refer to it.  My daughter is a child psychologist in Florida, and the first thing she does when she's looking for a good book for her son is check the dictionary to see if a book has any definitions to the word she's searching for.  Now that she's an adult, she's trying to figure out the correct

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a child I wanted to be like my Dad when I was a teenager. He bought me all the cool toys my favorite TV shows and even a computer. That's one reason why I love my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I love the quick and easy interface that the Tab is designed around, the fast boot up and the fast data transfer. I have used it to play music from my mp3 player and also my iPod and have even had to play through several iPod players and iPods to get my mp2 to play. I haven't had the problem of slow data transfer or having to wait a long time. The only time I feel bad is when I get the occasional "Error" when it's doing a transfer. The error doesn't slow my data down, so I know it's just a little issue but it still bugged me at first. My biggest problem is with the battery life. I've used it in my car and at home and the battery is starting to run out and the charging rate is very slow. I used to get around 10-12 hours from one charge but now I only get around 5 or 6. The battery is also getting really hot. I think my phone is at least a year old and I have seen some of the other phones that come with a better battery life but the Tab 3 battery still isn't a top rated device by a long shot. I hope Samsung keeps improving the battery. I also hope they improve the software and don't slow down the interface as much as they have been.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device because I was having some problems with my 3 year old computer. This thing fixed that problem. I can now install a program or two on my old computer that I had forgotten about. I've put it to work so far! It's a nice size, and can be taken on the go. I like that I can use this while I'm on the phone (for the price, it's hard to beat!)    Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. I'll probably recommend this to a friend. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use the tablet for work. I enjoy reading my emails and taking notes. I have been using the tablet as a replacement for a laptop. I am currently using it with a wireless keyboard as well as the tablet. I use a keyboard that attaches to the tablet via a USB. I find that having both a keyboard and a tablet is a more comfortable way to do my work. The iPad is small enough to be hidden in my purse. Also, it has a high resolution display and the screen is responsive to touch. I haven't had any issues using the device for work, even when using a wireless mouse. I love that it has the ability to access my emails in the cloud and read them while on the road. I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a small tablet to carry around and do my daily tasks.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I think the best thing about this is that you can do it anywhere. It's great for work and for playing music, even when it's cold outside. It even sounds great. I'm on my 3rd one now, and it's so light! It's a nice weight and the battery lasts forever!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the A7s last year. It's a very good, good value for the price. Great job, Sony. You have to be pretty lucky for a product to have gone this long and become as good as this. This is definitely a keeper.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Tommo from Solid purchase I purchased a Sony A7R for Christmas. It is a great camera but it doesn't live up to the high expectations of the specs. The sensor is fantastic, the lens is great and the photos taken are so good that you don't need to do much else. However I think the software will be a problem. There is no RAW mode, I don't see the need for it. I do love the fact that the camera has built in wifi. I love that you can take pictures on the go and email them to your family and you can also take them with your tablet. Overall it is a good buy and is not going to make much noise in the cameras and lenses department.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received the M3 and have just had it for a week and a half, it is a fantastic device for the price, but it is not perfect. The only problems I had were the charging cable, and the usb port on the usb socket is too small for the battery. The usb port does not charge the battery, it needs a full size usb cable with a plug like a mini or micro. Also, the usb on the socket only goes to a certain type of phone. My LG S3 does not work with this device. The battery life is great on this device, I have been using it all day and it is easily fully charged by 6pm. Overall, a great device, but I am going to take a step back and give it a more full rating. I am very satisfied with my purchase and will be ordering another one very soon.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So far so good.  Excellent Value  Rated 4 out of 5 by Jn from Works fine so far I'm very happy with the device. It's very fast at booting and it's the first computer I've bought where I haven't had to use a bootable CD. It only took me an hour to get it up and running. It doesn't come with a hard drive, but this is a small price to pay for the convenience of being able to plug the drive in directly. I think the price tag may be a bit high, but it's definitely not the cheapest computer I have ever bought.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:        I've had one of these for a few years now and have been using it every single day. I have it in my car as a watch/clock and for those times when I'm bored I can just use my phone. I've used mine for a number of reasons: 1. It's cheap. You can't beat that for that price, especially in this era of high-end watches. It has great battery life and never has been "dumb" when I needed to know the time. 2. It tells the time and date on the analog dial. It also works great as a digital clock. 3. It does not vibrate which is great if you don't have a very sensitive ear. 4. It charges pretty fast. I use it to charge my phone every morning so I can keep it handy in my purse. 5. It is water resistant. The silicone band and buttons are scratch resistant.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am really happy with this computer. It has a lot of features but I wish it was more intuitive. Some programs do not have a description and cannot be found on the web. Some software, like Quickbook (which was a gift for my husband), can not be downloaded. I have a laptop that can handle more files than this one so I know I could do much better on this computer as a college student. My husband said it is slow for some programs. He has it for school but says he can get it even faster. It is better than my laptop.  Rated 5 out of 5 by sjp from It is easy to use and the price is very reasonable I had been using a PC for 10 years, it was difficult to use the computer because of the mouse. This computer makes it so simple to use, I was able to use it for 10 minutes before my husband walked in. I think my husband has used it for years and it works perfectly. ,,  My boyfriend has a Macbook Pro. I recently bought the Dell XPS 15 9560 (12 inch, i7, 4gb ram) and the Dell W7170 (15 inch, AMD CPU, 8gb ram). So far the XPS is an excellent and powerful computer and the W7 is an even better. I am extremely happy with both of them. I also like the laptop that my sister just got. She also says that she can not believe how much better this machine is and she has an XPS 12 that is also a great laptop. I just wish I would have bought my computer before the X3 came out.  be sure to check out this other review!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first got the ZX Spectrum 128 theres really not much to do except playing your games. Theres the sound but theres no other games so thats about it. Well when I got the 64 I wanted a better sound and I also wanted more.   I got an Amstrad C64 when I was about 12.  It was a huge disappointment because of the way it worked. It was very slow, slow to read disks and very glitchy. But after many hours with the Amstrads I got a bit of a taste for what Commodore did with computers. They put a lot of care and effort into the C64.  The Spectrum was a much better system. It came with lots of different games which I still have and am still playing. The Spectrum also came with a controller which was much better than the C32 controller.  If you're going to buy a C64 you might as well get a 64.

It is just better. The cameras are a little less good, but that's just me being picky. Also the fingerprint sensor on the back is a lot better than the S8+, and the battery lasts all day without dying. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that I wish it had a headphone jack on the bottom, and the S Pen is much better than on the S7. But this is a good device." " I'm not sure if this device has enough features, but in the end I find this to be a solid device that's worth your money. I've been using this for 2 weeks, and am very satisfied with my purchase. It has a fingerprint scanner that I think works great, and has a good sized screen. There is also a 3 hour battery and good sound quality. The camera, unfortunately, isn't great, but still acceptable. I haven't had any issues with the phone being dropped or being left on my desk. The fingerprint scanner is a very nice feature, but for my money this is the best overall phone. Also I would like to see a fingerprint sensor in the back. I use this device almost daily, and it still has my phone number on it! "  Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought an iPod touch 8GB a year or so ago because I didn't like the previous generation. The software was buggy, but I found myself using it, and the music quality is great.    I purchased an iPod 5G and found a lot of the songs I previously liked were still good, although they got a bit too loud. Now I prefer the older ones.  Great purchase!   This is the cheapest iphone I've owned. The speakers are good and the device seems a bit larger than the latest phones but I've yet to find out.   in addition to the iPod touch 4G i also have a 2nd iiphone 3G. I find the newer version of the 3G is a bit easier to operate and more enjoyable. The 4G iphones have better speakers.   I'm very happy with the purchase

The buttons are small but a nice touch and the buttons on the device are not clicky as many devices I've had over the years. There are several apps to use with it such as an interactive coloring book that is awesome and a music box that is really fun. I bought the toy for my girls because I know they would love it too and the fact that they didn't want to play with it until their birthday makes me happy because it's a very good toy for those who love to tinker.

If you've tried either of these devices and really like it, I would recommend picking up a HMD.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I ordered this on a whim when my husband brought home a used K5, and it has become an integral part of my office. The sound quality is excellent, and the built-in screen is great when I use it as a laptop.     The build quality of the unit is excellent and it is quite sturdy. It is very light, so it fits in a small space as it's attached to the desk.  I use it on my lap. It's good for typing, and I use a Bluetooth keyboard, so I don't have to worry about getting it plugged in. I have used my K5 for about 2 months now, and every time I take it off my lap, I lose it. I don,t understand it.   When I first plugged it in, I was getting a very annoying "battery disconnected" message for about 10 minutes. It wasn't plugged in completely the first time, then it plugged back in about 3 minutes later. It should only be on the 2nd charge. I guess I'm just getting used to having it plugged directly into the wall.       Just the basics. I haven't used this much. The screen is very bright, but the quality is a little rough.  I haven''t used this too much yet. I didn't hear it make any noise while watching movies. The speakers are decent, but I really don't like the sound when watching movies with a lot of background noise (or if I'm on my phone and it gets loud). I really like it when it''s turned off or when it's on my desk, so that the speakers are focused on the screen. I do prefer the quality of a TV, but that's not the way I use this anymore.  Great product but not easy to plug into your TV or computer This product is great! I''m a graphic designer who uses this a lot. One thing I noticed is it needs to be plugged directly in to the wall, not the TV. I found this out in the first week and tried to figure out why it wasn''t working. It turned out it was the way it was designed to work, the TV could not charge it directly. I fixed it myself, I found a solution and I recommend that if you buy this you plug it in to your TV. That''s why the reviews I read are so good. I''d recommend

This was not a major inconvenience, but it did slightly affect the overall appearance of the product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was at this store on a trip to New Orleans and needed a new cell phone and wanted to have it shipped directly to me. I checked Yelp and was impressed with the service and the good selection and price. The staff was very knowledgeable and polite. They made me feel welcome and they helped me with everything I needed. They also made me a gift certificate of my choice so I could have it sooner. I would definitely come back and use them again in the future. Check the reviews if you have a hard time making an appt there, because they are friendly and polite even when you don't speak very good English. And I don't want to use Yelp for reviews. The owner is very helpful, the girls are helpful, and the price is fair and reasonable (my favorite store), even for the city. I am a regular here and have recommended them to all my friends. I am a big fan of the staff here. Not just because they answer all my questions about everything but also because they always take care of me when I need them, even if I ask them to do something they don't know how to do. The girls here are nice and always know how much they can and can't do. If you don' like to talk and prefer to do things on your own then this store is not for you. But if you want a place where they know how things are made and how to help you if you need help, then this is the place for you!! They have a ton of things to choose from. The selection is large, and it's hard to get bored with. It's also very helpful to get a little bit more info on the things you're looking for. And a lot of what they have is free with a free store coupon (it's very easy to get that on the bottom of every card). I get there often, usually at lunchtime, so it's a nice place to have a chat with a bunch of women in a really nice environment. There was a small girl in the store last time I was there. She was pretty rude. This time, there was a man, a woman and 2 young girls in the place. And they were all very friendly and very helpful. I had a lot to learn from them on various things like the different types of cases they have and how some have extra pockets. I was in this store several times before I started looking for things like that on eBay

Rated 3 out of 5 by gs from Great Phone and very nice for the price I have owned this phone since early November and it's perfect for what I wanted. However, it seems to be a bit slow for the speed of what I do. I have a 3 yr old daughter who likes to play on her ipod daily and I don't have a lot of time. I love my Apple products but the Samsung seems to have a better quality. If you're looking for a phone for younger kids or students, you'll find this is a great phone. If this phone would be able to do some of the stuff my sister and I do, it would be perfect.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You can do anything!   The best thing about this monitor is how easy it is to set up!  As always, we have a very positive experience working with a manufacturer that understands the needs of our clients!  I'm a big fan of the wide viewing angle   I have to set my monitor this way because it makes everything look so much bigger. I don't know why more manufacturers don't make a monitor that lets me get the most out of my desk space.   When I purchased the monitor, it came with one 3 inch USB cable (which is pretty common, but also nice) but I would suggest purchasing a longer USB cable. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very happy with this unit. The quality of this unit far exceeded my expectations. It is a very good speaker and very good sound, at a very nice price. It has great tone and bass and even when my wife is watching a movie on it and it gets too loud, the volume comes right back down.   If you are in the market for a small, simple but very good sounding soundbar, this is it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great sound, great price I have a good amount of music on my home stereo but my wife's favorite is the Rolling Stones. She can't hear them at all with the speakers on her TV. These speakers are amazing. I just love the sound of them and how easy they are to use and set up. I bought the subwoofer as well. I have it set to one channel and it sounds great. :)  From the bottom of my heart... This was my first foray into home theater. I've owned other products, but never had this experience. I am now addicted!  : )  Excellent sound in a compact form factor This is one of the best sound systems I've ever owned. The subwoofers do a great job of getting low end and the bass response is tremendous. I'm not a fan of center channels, but these work just fine. I'd also like to add that I'm still trying to find a quality remote control for this unit but so far this is my favorite one. So many great things about this product: 1.) Excellent sound quality from the speakers 2.) Subwoofer works very well 3.) The remote control 4.) Good quality materials 5.) Very affordable, but I haven't found a better one 6.) Overall, a perfect product in a good-looking package. The only negative I can think of is a lack of options and/or the remote control not having a volume control. I think they would have done better to have two separate volume controls and maybe have a mute button on it. Also, for the money, these are a wonderful purchase. I will be purchasing more units in the future for my friends and family. Thanks Hifi-Media for another great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got the A.T.T.-50 when it first came out and it worked great but then after a while I got tired of using my finger to turn it on and off. So I looked up some tutorials online and then I found out that the ATC-3100 was much better. I got mine on Amazon and you can get it from other places too if you don't want to spend much. I have only been using it a week but it seems to be doing a much better job than my previous one. For a small device like this I don't think you'll have any problems getting it set up. It works good and the LED lights are bright and work great. I do wish that it didn't have to turn on when it does and not automatically when you hit the power button. The only downfall to this device is that you won't be able to use your iPad or iPod Touch with it but the other positives are enough to recommend it.

But once it was set to that speed, I got good audio and all the effects I wanted. It was great. I think it would be even better if the buttons were on the side, but that's a nitpick. I used it for about 3 weeks before I decided it would make more sense to get the "D." This one has a lot more features than the X, which I really like.   - John R. - May 20, 2016

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great speaker.   I am currently working on a project that requires my son to have access to my sound system. He can't come in the room, because the speaker is too loud for him to use. The M-Audio Sub-2000 has been a lifesaver. I will not hesitate to purchase another. Great speaker!   The MQ2000's are not the cheapest speakers around, but I am happy with them. My son can enjoy his favorite movie when it is on and he does not need to run upstairs to the sound system to get that sweet bass. Amazingly powerful   When my wife bought me the Sub2000 she made it clear that she was not disappointed. It was loud and clean and very musical. My wife is a recording artist and she knows what she wants for her music. She even likes to listen to some classical music on it. The fact that it can be used as a home theater was great because I didn't have to run up to the living room to turn on my music system. I am so glad that I bought it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the XBox One at the beginning of the year and it was a good buy. I have played a lot of Halo, Halo 2, and a few Halo 3's on my XBox. My girlfriend and I recently got the 4th and newest Halo game for XBox Live, and we are both really happy with it. I do think they could have done a better job marketing the games to older and younger gamers and making sure the games were interesting, but if you're like me you know what to expect from Halo.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In my opinion, the Audioengine A40 is an excellent device.  The best digital interface I have ever used for a portable.  For $250 it's hard to beat.  A lot of digital devices nowadays come up short.  So I can see why this product was chosen for the Best of the Best award.   The Audioengine is my first purchase from the AudioEngine company and I can't recommend it more. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You get a big battery life.   It's nice to have a back up battery for my portable music player.  Very comfortable.  I'm 6'2" with a 34" chest so I need the long battery life, very comfortable and looks good.  You have to try it  It has a high sound quality (not like a cheap boom-box) and has a great user interface.  There is a little annoying buzz from the 3.5 mm cable when it is powered down which can be fixed by turning the volume up but there are times when I have to plug my earphones in while playing my mp3 player and have to stop it to turn them on so this isn't a problem to me.  If I could I would get the battery to last a little longer but it is a great device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the most wonderful little box I've ever seen, and I've owned many, many! Excellent price for great product, with free shipping. The batteries seem to last a long time. My kids and I love that it has a built-in digital timer and alarm. I have to admit, this is a great box. My only real complaint is that they didn't include the batteries. Also, the lid does not have a lock.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only reason I give this product a 4 is that the audio quality is just OK.  It can be used as a speakerphone, if you have a stereo in your car and you want to use your phone without a microphone and a car adapter.   However, the speakers are quite loud and I found them quite disappointing because they have a decent amount of bass and a good overall quality, but the audio is not that good. The speakers have a slight distortion, but not to the point where it is distracting. They are a bit lower quality than the Audioengine D50R. However, for the price, I feel that the AudioEngine D50 is just a bit below average for it's class. I wish that it were a bit better in terms of it's audio quality, because it's a great value.  I'm giving this product 4 stars because I feel it's very average in it's quality.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm very pleased with the new iHome 2.0.   The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that the device was big!   There's a lot of features and features, and it works really well.  I have my computer hooked up to a big screen TV and it's nice to see the same image at different angles.  If you're looking for a small box that does everything, this is the one.  The only thing I would change is the charging dock.  It seems to be too big, so if you want to connect it to your car's AC charger, it takes too long to do so.  Other than that, I think it's great.  Thank you, iHome!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I have a TRS-80 Model I (1982). It is perfect for all my TRS/TAS needs. When you get an electronic keyboard, the Model I is probably the best buy you will ever make. You can get the TRS keyboard on the Model II and you can get a TAS keyboard on a Model III. They all work great and have great sound. I have not used the Model III yet but it has the same sound as the Model 1. Great keyboard.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    (I would rather pay a higher price than a less efficient one that doesn't fit the needs of the user.)  This is the only computer I have ever owned. If I don't have it on the desk at all times, I have a hard time focusing. This computer does not make me forget to take notes or to make sure I read the instruction manual first. The graphics are pretty good and my kids love the computer's voice synthesizer. The keyboard is a little clunky but I was able to learn to type on it. This is a great addition to the family.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      I bought this to replace my old cell phone. It is easy to use, good sound quality and a good weight. It also has a few other functions that work well as well. This will work well with my tablet that I have and I like that the cell phone function works.  Very impressed!   I have purchased these for my kids (ages 13 and 8). We love the noise cancelling feature. The kids can talk and sing and have fun. The buttons are easy to push and use. They do not get dirty. These seem like a good value.  I love the sound quality of this one. I can't comment on the other functions (like music, ringtones, etc.) because they are not in English and they are only in English.    I love it!  I just got mine today and I love it so much, its so easy to put it in my ear and I dont have to turn it on, I cant believe that I got this, its very expensive for what you get, I love love love it.   and for a great price  And for a very affordable price, this is the best for me.  in the U.K. we are lucky in that there are so many of them in my local stores, they do not exist in the USA  best purchase  I bought my new bluetooth earphones for my wife and she loves them. They are a very comfortable fit. The sound quality is wonderful.  The fact that they fit my wife is a big plus.  My wife does not have a bluetooth device so it has been nice to have her use it on my iPad.  It's a great deal and great service.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am extremely pleased with the new G4. It took a little getting used to the volume control, but the device is quiet and has a smooth, warm sound that makes watching videos a pleasure. I would suggest a new speaker system if you are a large fan of movies. I've been using a JVC sound bar as my home entertainment system, and it really needs the G4's bigger speakers. But I'm very pleased with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just got this yesterday, as it is about to be my first day back from school after the summer. I was worried about how long it would take me to be back to my usual habits after a summer of going out and doing stuff (but still not doing a lot), but it's definitely working! I don't use all the buttons on my mouse, but I use most of it anyway, and my fingers seem to be getting more used to it, so there's that.   I do have two suggestions: First, I find myself pausing the game for longer than I'd like (I usually have to pause it while I walk around the room in search of a cookie), and I'd also really like a way to customize the cursor or a way for me to customize how much I'm scrolling on my screen at any given time. I feel like I've been using the cursor since I got it, but it would be nice to have a way of changing it. Second, the mouse is a little noisy when you are gaming for a long time. The only reason I don the mouse (and I own quite a few) is that I have a computer with a built-in sound card (which I'm assuming is more or less the same as this one), and since I use a headset at all times, I don  great game!    Great mouse and good value!  A little bit of tweaking to get the best performance out of it.  Overall: 5/5.   The mouse works great and works well. The software to configure it is not nearly as user friendly as the mouse, which means I had to spend a little more time in Windows doing the setup, but overall, this is a great purchase and would recommend it.  5/5!  :  For those of you that use a mouse with an LCD panel, you won't be dissapointed with this unit, because this mouse is the only one of its type on the market! For those who are thinking about going with a mechanical mouse that isn't a cheap, flimsy, plastic one, I think this is the perfect option. The colors are nice, and the buttons have the best feedback you can get out of any mouse out there, bar none. I am not a "mouse expert", but if you do use a USB mouse, you will know what I'm talking about. The size is perfect for me,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I was at a great computer conference last week. The speakers were all on their laptops so I had the opportunity to demo the newest Windows Vista upgrade. We had a great demo at the end of the conference. A small screen came on to show a slideshow. I took a few photos, looked at my pictures and I thought I could use some help with the presentation. I tried to find a PowerPoint that would work, but couldn't find any. Then I found  "The Book of Pixels"  by Steve Johnson. I bought that book on Kindle and gave it a try. I like that book a lot so I decided to give it a whirl with a nice large screen. The book has a simple and clear layout. I can see a good portion of the slide set quickly and easily, but the photos were so blurry, it was hard to make out the words. I still found it interesting though. When I had some free time I looked around my house. I was surprised that I hadn't bought a book on photography before. I have been looking at some magazines that have a lot of good photography on the covers. One day I think I'll get the "Poster" magazines and make a photo album for my office. Thanks again for sharing the blog with me! I really appreciate it and am looking forward to more from you! I have been watching some of your videos and I like what I see. I will be buying some equipment to start filming my own videos with this camera. We have been following our blog for a while and I am quite excited about what is happening with this blog. Our readers are getting better and better. I was just reading the blog and read this blogpost. "I'm in need of a new camera to replace my 70D". It is very interesting and that's where I got my camera for my 70d. Great article by a guy who loves his 70D. A great article by Bob (who is a professional in the video industry).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my VCR. I have been with it since the beginning and it never fails to impress! It looks the same as it has always done. It's the only VCR I use because all of my other boxes are too expensive. I love the fact that it's so compact. It does all the things that I need and more!  Rated 5 out of 5 by jim from The VCR that's so great I have a VCR for nearly 30 years now. It had outlived its prime years and, like a car, my VTR no longer gets any new parts or updates, so it needed to be replaced. I called the company to get help. Their rep told me the parts I'd need would probably cost around $250, with the chance of a $75 rebate for the parts. I'm sure it is worth it, but I didn't want to spend so much money for a machine that would just break down, and then have to get a new one. After I saw the new TV I bought a new VTR, and my old one was a great machine that has now outlived the VCR business. This VTR is small, quiet, runs reliably, and fits my needs perfectly.  From Anonymous of Seattle, Washington on 12/30/2016. My old VTR was working perfectly. I purchased this replacement in the hope that it would be a little brighter than the old unit. So far it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is much better than the original and it runs cooler which I find makes it much easier to listen to. It is more comfortable in the lap, easier to clean and I think it runs much longer than the previous unit. I am excited to use it. It has a solid feel to it and I am glad I got this one. /r/vcr has some great choices for VCR's

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:        The S7 Edge is a great device and is a true step above the competition.   What's most impressive about the S7 is the screen, which is beautiful and easy to read with minimal glare, making it a true workhorse that can keep up with any work load and has no issues staying on in all conditions.  The S7 does not have a headphone jack, which might be a bit of a missed opportunity for some, but the built-in stereo speakers sound good and the volume level is fairly low.  Some people may have an issue with the fact that there is no headphone jack or worry about the batteries running down quickly.  There is a microSD card slot (a first for Samsung's phones) that allows you to use it as a memory card reader for games.  Some of the best features of the S6 The only downside of the Galaxy S7/S7 edge is the price.  It will set you back around $800 for the 32GB version, but only $650 for the 128GB model.  You have to pay about $50 more for the S Pen, which adds an extra $100 to the price tag.  However, for a phone that offers a lot, and is just a few dollars more expensive than the Galaxy Note 5, the S series is a very good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The product has a good amount of buttons and features on it. I have the 8" tablet, and can comfortably use this on the couch or a bed. The battery life was good. I didn't want to have to recharge it, but there are options to buy rechargeable batteries. It is more of a computer, so I could have used my tablet, but not with my TV. I really like the music player. I found it easy to navigate and had no problems switching between music. It has a built in light that allows me to turn off the brightness when watching TV so the TV isn't too bright. The quality of the video is good, not the best but good enough. There are no software updates or updates required, so if you don't want the latest features it isn't that big of a deal.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you're looking for a cheap e-cigarette, or want to know more about e-cigarettes, this is a good book for you. It's not about nicotine, or the way the products affect people, but it's good about the products. It covers all the details, and the authors have a good grasp of how e-cigs work and what they can do. I'll admit to taking a different approach to the book than most people, because e-cig smoking is a huge deal, but the authors are fair and their opinions are informed and not a sales pitch. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes smoking, and is concerned about the impact on public health.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this with the intention of using it as a GPS to my bicycle. It is great at that, but I ended up using the GPS unit as a light weight compass. It seems really well built and solid as far as construction is concerned. The buttons are all well spaced and not overly difficult to use. The screen is very small and only usable when viewed from a very close distance. It would have been great if the screen came with an internal battery to charge as opposed to an external battery that requires an external charger. This way I could have had a battery that could be charged from a USB adapter. That way I wouldn't have to use my phone as an external USB charger. I've also found the GPS is often confused when I have it set to a very small area because of the way it displays. It will take a while for it to fix its mind about the position and will often end up confusing itself. It does a great job of keeping track of my bicycle route, but at a speed faster than I want it to be doing on my bike.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sennheiser Momentum 180 earphones are amazing. They have a rich and detailed sound, and are very comfortable.   The comfort is also greatly enhanced by the soft, supple silicone tips that come with these earphones.  The Momentum earphones have a 3.5mm input on one end, and an 3.75mm input/output on the other end.  If you can't live without a 3mm input, the 3.25mm input should be a good replacement.  I also have a Koss Porta Pro3.   I think the Momentum Earphones are a bit better, but the Sennhesers sound and fit are very similar.  There are several differences: The Koss model uses a dual 3.0mm input with a volume knob on the side of the headband, while the S.E.D. model is a single 3.3mm input. The Momentums are also a bit larger in size and weight. The KOSS Porta Pros are a little warmer, but more balanced in nature, and much easier to use.  I'm in the market for a good pair of headphones, but they are not for me.  They are just too small and not comfortable. They can be used as a headphone with a phone in a bag, but it is definitely more awkward than with a traditional headphone. I'm thinking of the Momentums instead.

You can make it last a week.  Also, I really like the music player because the app plays it and has a pretty good sound.  For people who prefer tablet to desktop, this is a good buy!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   You are the most amazing, talented man I've ever known. If you don't think so, I suggest reading this article ( https://blog.mjpearson.com/2013/05/10/how-to-make-a-good-buy/ ). I'm a self-taught programmer, and you have been instrumental in me learning. You have shown me that there is a lot more to programming than the front-end ( http://blogger.michael_fry.com/?p=1495 ). I can't thank you enough for being such a great teacher! You have a very unique perspective and you've taught me some things I would never have found if it weren't for you. Thanks again for all you've done!  When I was at a disadvantage in a programming contest at work, I was reminded of your blog, so I decided to check it out. I discovered the same thing I thought I had read before ( http thecoderblog.com ): that you were also a writer. As I've discovered writing in itself can be a creative act, I decided a little writing contest might be my answer.  I have been asked by many people "What will you write about next?" and I don't want to disappoint my readers. I have the urge to write about how the computer makes it easier to program than ever before, but first I'll have to convince my editors to let me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I bought this device about 2 years ago.   I can't believe how much I love it.  Now I use it for almost all my audio-recording needs.  There is no better way to spend a Saturday afternoon than setting up my recorder and recording the latest hit from Taylor Swift.  I use my laptop to stream music.  My only complaint would be the lack of an option for USB microphone support.  When you put a mic into the line in, you cannot control its gain.  The input is not as clean as you would expect.  Also, you will need to buy the adapter in order to connect your camera to this device.  When I first bought this, I didn't bother buying an adapter.  But after using it for a while, I realized I needed one.  Best of luck.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've owned this for about a week now, and I'm happy to report that I'm getting great performance out of it. The build quality is impressive and the LCD has great color and contrast. I use this as a tablet, but also use the mouse and keyboard as well.   The only issue I had with the monitor was that when I used the mouse, I would occasionally miss keystrokes. But that wasn't the only issue with the unit. After I got used to the monitor, I noticed that the screen went dark after I went to sleep (it was at about 3AM at the time).   It would stay on for a while but would go back to normal when I woke up. I also had a few glitches. When I tried to turn off the monitor and turn it back on, it would either go dark or show a white screen with white letters. Other than that, I'm very pleased with my purchase.    This item is GREAT. It is light weight and easy to set up. The only thing that you need to do is make sure the power cord is plugged in right before you plug it in and the monitor will power on for you.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   You need a big battery like the iPhone 5 to keep your phone charged, but the Apple device can take over 8 hours to charge your phone. I've been using a Samsung phone for a long time and I love it. I like the way the phone feels in my hand but it is not big enough to be a full-fledged work tool. You need a huge battery like Samsungs to have this function. Also, it's so big that it gets lost sometimes while the phone is in my pocket.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just bought the S8 and it is amazing. So much better than the original Galaxy S8 plus I could not be happier with the product. So happy the shipping was quick and easy as well. Would highly recommend this item and I will definitely be buying from here again and recommend to my friends. I have had the S7 Edge for quite a while now and I really like it. It has all the things I wanted. However, the fingerprint reader on it is terrible. It only works once after 10 tries to get it to register a fingerprint. I really wanted the S6 Edge+, but I am glad that they have moved away from this fingerprint reader in the new Edge model. I will be upgrading to the S9, but I hope Samsung will make the fingerprint sensor on the S3 and S6 better. The fingerprint reader is terrible and I know it can be improved. This is an amazing phone. I'm not a fan of Samsung or HTC, but this phone is great for me. The camera is amazing and the battery life is incredible! I will continue to purchase this phone because this one just gets better and better. Good looking phone, but not much. I have this phone now for about a month. This is a good phone, I've only had it a month and it has been good so far. But it is missing a few things that I like on other phones. I can't really complain because I don't have any other phones to compare it with. I know that a lot of people like it for its looks, but the design isn't a big deal for me because I just wanted a phone to have a better camera. Also I know other people who use it are very satisfied with it because they have better cameras. Overall a good, good looking phone.

I wanted something that was small and easy to operate. I got the PDP1836 with the 4.3" screen for $89, I installed it on my PC and it is great for my needs. I can use it on the go and have it on for hours on end. It has great volume control, auto-adjusting volume, and very good sound quality. The screen is bright and easy on the eyes. I bought this radio and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a compact radio for their bedroom.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little speaker. The sound quality is good enough. The size is perfect for me, and it has a great sound quality to it. There are many, many other cheap knock-offs of the original speaker which you can get, and I would not recommend buying these. They do not work as well, do not last as long, and will break sooner. I recommend this product, however. I have yet to hear a "good" version of this. You can buy a good one for a little more money, but don't expect this to stand up to the originals.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from A good price, nice product and sound This is my first "high quality" speaker and I must say it's a great product. I bought the 8" one for my home theater setup. I used it with my old pair of AVRs, which sounded ok. I also bought the 10" for my son's room (his computer) with my AVR and it is perfect. I didn't bother to purchase the 5.1 version, so that would have been a different review.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been wanting an A/V receiver for a while, and i finally got mine on sale.   I was hesitant to get a receiver on a budget, but the prices were so low and so generous that i had to have one for the money.  They came in very quickly and everything was fine in the box.  i am very happy with the sound quality, the quality of the sound is just as i expected from the specs and the amp is top notch.  I will definetly be buying one more time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a TRS-80 Model III in 1975, and after a while I noticed that I had no serial number.   So I got a model 4 and kept the old one.  I'm really glad I did.  It's an excellent, powerful machine.  My TRS can't compete with the Model III and the C128 in its ability to program and play games. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have tried several different batteries, with several different brands.   The VCR works very well and is easy to operate.  The only negative was that the battery is rather fragile and not the best quality.  I was able to replace it with a new battery, however. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a wonderful little device. I have never had the pleasure of owning a pocket computer before and I really like it.  It is compact and very easy to use.   I have been using my iphone 4 for over a year now. I bought a iphones charger because my ixpensive phone can not be charged at all.  I now have a working electronic device for a low price.   Was this review helpful to you? Yes (0) No (0 )
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So there's my first experience with using a new computer in my house. I really like this computer, a lot. I like the screen (which I'm really happy about, since the other computer is a 10-inch Dell and it's a piece of crap). I like that it doesn't have a backlight, since I can only see a part of the screen at a time, but that doesn't bother me, since this is my first computer of its kind in my home. My only gripe with it is that if you don't know how to adjust the settings (i.e. changing the wallpaper) and don't put in an extra couple hundred bucks, you won't be able to use your internet service on this computer. I'm sure my local ISP could do this, but I doubt they will because they're probably so busy doing whatever it is they're doing that they don't even look at what's happening on their computer. If I had to take a number, I'd give it a 4 out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love it! It was very convenient and easy to use.     Reviewer: P.H.  Rating:  Review:  (This review was collected as part of a promotion.) The device worked very well and is a very good value. It is well made and it is well thought out.  It is easy to navigate.  My only complaint is that the cord on the charger does not connect to the USB charger.  I have been told that this was done for safety.  Very glad I bought this product.  (This update was collected after the review was published.)   (Note that after this review was submitted, the author of this review asked the manufacturer of the product to change the cord to a more useful length for his use.)  A great product. The cord is too short for a cord charger. The product was extremely well made. I will recommend this product and its price to anyone that is looking to save a bit of money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am not a professional audio engineer. I have had no training or experience with audio, I am not qualified to even be qualified to write about my experience with this device. I am more than happy to have the device as it is but not for the money spent. You get what you pay for, and this does not have the sound quality or the build quality as advertised. Also, if you buy this, do not use it in a home with a single occupant unless you are a master bedroom engineer. The cord is very short. You must plug it directly into a computer to hear it. I used it in my living room with the tv. I ran it in stereo on a 4 speaker stereo system. The amp in this thing does not sound bad. But the sound is muddy, not as good as I expected. I would not recommend this item.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've used my new Samsung Galaxy Nexus for a few months now.   It's a really great phone.  I love the high-res touch screen, the super light weight, the large screen, and the battery life.  The new camera is very nice, as is the software.  So far, I have no complaints.  This has been a very positive experience.  Thank you for making a great product!  I'm a big fan of the design of the phone. I like the fact that the back is a soft-touch vinyl.  It really helps a phone feel great in your hands.  When I got my phone I was impressed at how big the phone was, and that the battery is huge, though I do think there are more efficient ways to power a phone. My big gripes are that the display is a little small for me, and my hands don't like it that much.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     You get all the benefits and none of the drawbacks. I don't really like the volume knob, but it is really easy to change which setting I use on the volume slider. The battery life is great and it doesn't use that many batteries to keep going. I would say that this is a great addition to my collection.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's cheap.  It does a good job of turning a sound system in your room into a decent one.  The cable is fairly long, and the mic is a lot more than adequate.   I was hoping to get a little more gain but this is more than sufficient. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Very very good quality product and the customer service is fantastic. I've used these devices for years in my field and they've always been high quality and reliable.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sony Xperia Z5 is a very nice phone. The new glass-and-metal design is very nice and does a good job of conveying the same great feel as the phone itself. It is a slightly better quality phone than the Galaxy S6, which I had the opportunity to use for a few days. The Xperia Z3 is the best value among all of the Sony phones, and the only one that I wouldn't want to go without. My biggest gripe is the screen. The screen is fantastic for pictures and videos, and I can really see what the Z5's screen can do. However, the resolution of 1080p is still a bit low for me, especially compared to the Galaxy Note 4's QHD screen. However the phone is not the worst at displaying colors on the page. If you're looking for a 1080p screen, there's not much else to recommend.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "My new TAC Pro is a very nice product. The interface is good and the sound quality is great. The bass extension is excellent as well. I have only used it for 2 days so I haven't had time to check out the settings. I did find some minor issues though, like the remote for the amp was a bit difficult to use. Also, the battery life isn't great. I haven`t seen anyone else say this, but I can't really say that it will last for hours at a time, but for a portable device the sound output is quite impressive."
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a big fan of the Sony VAIO Z series. They are very versatile and can replace my old workhorse notebooks. I've always been a fan of Sony, as they have always been about providing the best products for the money. I have the Sony Vaio Z series laptop and also the VAIO Notebook T61. My only complaint with the VAio laptop is it does not have the ability to be used in landscape mode on an HDTV. When you try to set up the laptop, it just shows the same icons and options on the bottom of the screen and no landscape options appear. The VAIO notebook is also a little slower but the video quality is much better than the laptop. I also do not like the fact that you have to buy a case and a keyboard separately. The keyboard comes with the notebook but the case is not included. I'm sure this is just a problem with the production line and not a real defect. I think most users will not have any problems. Overall I would recommend the VAIo series to anyone who uses a PC for work and play. It is much more versatile than any other PC and is a lot cheaper than buying a laptop, which may or may not include the keyboard.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a problem with the light from this monitor. When I turned on the monitor, the light came on fast, and I started to see a flicker. I was afraid it was caused by the monitor. I looked online for an answer and learned that this is a known issue, and no one knows the cause. I went to the store to have a technician look and they said that this monitor was not sold as a flimsy product. They would suggest using a different monitor. (I did not think about replacing my old monitor) This is a good monitor if you use it in a small classroom, for a class of 12 to 20 students. It is not very large, but it is a great monitor. It has a good picture quality and the flicker issue is really annoying and distracting. If they make the display larger or a little lighter, then this monitor will be worth it. However, if it doesn't have a flutter, then the price is not worth it for what it can do. - RYAN P.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I like the device because it gives me a lot of options for the type of songs I want to listen to at various times.   The music library is also nice.  I like that the device doesn't automatically turn itself on at times when you are away from the house.  There were some problems I had with the device when it was out of battery power (like in the night) and I also had some problems with the display when it went to sleep.  I have had to power-cycle it in the beginning of my marriage as I got tired of looking at the same thing every day.  This problem is solved by turning the display to blue and switching to the battery saving mode which is on by default.  A lot of people have commented that the display and the buttons are very small but I would suggest to size up your size in all electronic devices that you use to make it easier to use.  The display on this device has a bright blue light that is easily visible in bright sunlight.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am looking forward to replacing my broken Sony PS3 which I got from a friend a while ago because I found it to be very unreliable. The main thing that I disliked was that it didn't come with a charger. This is another thing that i was really disappointed with because the new system is all about having a lot of options and a good variety to choose from. One of the things that i wanted to buy was a Bluetooth bluetooth receiver because I already have a 3.5mm headset. I can't believe that they don't have bluetooth on this product!   I am pretty satisfied with this purchase.   It is really easy to set up and has a great feature where you can make a call by swiping left or right on the top panel.  I recommend buying this product if you have a PS3 that you want to keep your game history and personal data intact and if you want a good bluetooth bluetooth wireless receiver.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:       This is a fantastic product. When I first purchased it it was about $75 and it was well worth it, but I am now looking to get a larger one because it's very much a one man job to change the batteries. However, this product is very well built and the sound is very good, even when it's not plugged in.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I don't understand why they have been on the market for years. There is only one problem. They do not work!   The phone is very good - I have owned several of these phones. The problems I have experienced have been that the power supply does not work, the phone has no way to turn off the phone, and the power source can cause other problems.   This device is a waste of time.   Write a negative review about an electronic device.  In my opinion, these are the worst. I've spent more than $300.00 on three of these bad boys and the phone is junk.  They have very limited functionality and require you to plug your computer into a wall wart to get to the internet.  This is a piece of junk     When I bought a new computer in 1997, I bought this phone in 1997 as well as a Windows 95 system that is almost 15 years old. I just received a brand new 15 year old Windows 95 and I have been able to download the whole internet over it and even do a web search on the old computer (which is dead)  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a big fan of the old Apple Macintoshes.   They were a small portable computer that could do everything.  The computer could do many things like surf the web, run Word and Excel applications, and do some simple math.  They could be plugged into a TV, and used to watch movies and TV shows.  With the new Apple Macintosh, you have to buy your own monitor and keyboard, or plug in a monitor and mouse to a Mac.  I have never owned a Macintosh computer, so this one was a good buy.  At about $700, it was less than I would pay for a nice laptop from Microsoft.  And since I am not a fan of Windows, I have been pleased with the ease with which I can use a Windows computer on a Mac without a copy of Windows. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have bought many different types of electronic equipment but for the price and quality that I've experienced with these products, I would consider all my purchases with a smile. The audio and video quality and the ability to use all of the functions of these devices is fantastic and has improved as the years have gone by. I don't even have to worry about the cords going into the wrong holes anymore because these are not only made to stay in place, but are able to come apart when it is necessary. I have two of these on my desktop so I can watch TV while I work at my computer and the volume of each can be controlled via a button on the back. I can switch from sound to audio on the fly and have the ability of having a completely different set of music playing. I haven't had any problems with these and am very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended for any who are looking for a quality piece of electronics at an affordable price.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     If you have to upgrade this, it was the right upgrade.  I have had my Apple TV for nearly 6 years now and I have been very happy with it. Unfortunately, I've become dependent on iTunes to do my media viewing and it is very annoying to find myself hitting a button to try and download a song.   I do not have many complaints about the Apple TV as it works fine for what I am looking for and I do not feel the need to upgrade it.   the only thing that bothers me is that the remote seems to get really hot when watching HD movies, this doesn't happen to me with my Xbox 360. I would recommend that the Apple be made a little more durable. I have noticed the remote can get pretty hot when it is not connected to the computer.    
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just got this after looking at the many reviews for the LG V10. I am very impressed.

This is one of my favorite watches!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This product is the best portable battery charger i have ever purchased. The batteries last for months.   It's a very good portable battery with enough charge for many years.  The batteries are not cheap and the charger has a lot of power and i feel it can give you great power for the price.   It is a great charger but has 2 problem: 1. Battery power drops after a few days. I've tried several battery replacements. 2. If you connect your iPhone to charger with a charger adapter that's not made by Apple, you will get a bad charging indicator that says battery full. I don't want to be charged at 30% with a 30% battery!  Works great, only problem:  This charger works great and is easy to use and charging. The only problem I have is with the usb-c connector not working correctly, it seems to be "unfriendly" with the charging cable.  i need to buy one :   i have purchased a few other chargers over the years, but nothing could compare to this charger and have already made sure to order one for my daughter's Apple watch and now my son's iPhone 7.  i was not expecting it to charge my iPhone 7 at all at the end of the day.  so i am going to buy another one for sure when i get it  This is a really good charger. I am very happy with it. The USB-C plug that I got is definitely a problem. It will not stay connected to my laptop, and the plug is too short for my charger adapter. I think I am going buy a longer USB-A connector next, so I have enough length to plug it into my computer. I also had to add a little bit of silicone between the two to make sure they wouldn't pull apart or pull into each other. However, I am happy that it works well enough that I don a few more batteries for my iPad Air 2, so that I will get 2 full charges. . The chargers comes with a usb-C cable but I can't use it because I don t have an adapter for it.  And if it does, I will be stuck with a crappy charger, or the usb dongle. This charger will get you a lot more usage out of the devices than I think most people will need.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought these for my iPad Mini 2. I use it for surfing the web, listening to music, watching videos, working, writing, and reading. The screen is very good. The device was easy to setup, has a nice design, and is very fast. The only drawback is that the iPad mini screen isn't very bright. My experience with the iBasso i816i:  The iBasso is a small, sleek, and elegant device. The design is very attractive, and it is very easy to set up. My only complaint is that it has no wi-fi. The iBasko can be powered by the iPad Mini, an external battery, a built-in battery, and a USB power bank. My main problem is that with all of these batteries, the battery life is horrible. My iPad Mini only has a 9 hour battery life, which is way too short to keep me going without a recharge every 2 weeks. The sound is loud, but not bad. It is an open sound system, and not a closed system like the iBook. The iPad Mini has a headphone jack, but this speaker is not connected to that jack. Also, the speaker is loud. The speakers are easy to connect to a computer and have a great sound quality. The speaker has a volume knob that lets you adjust the volume.  I did experience a few problems: 1) when iBarto is not playing a track, the sound is not very loud. I can hear it in the background of what is playing, but it is not as clear as if it was. It may have been my iPod or a CD player, but I don't think this is an iPad problem. 2) When I first played the first song, the first couple of beats on the beat pattern sounded really funky. It was actually a good beat pattern, but the beat was kind of slow, making it hard to hear. I had to listen a few more times to hear it. 3) The track itself was kind out of tune, so the sound was a little out of synch. 4) The battery life on the iPad isn't great. I have found that it lasts from 11 - 12 hours, then dies, so if you are like me and plug in your device for a few hours and then plug it back in, then it will usually be about 11 hours or so. 5) When you are playing
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The iMate2, despite being a little on the small side, does a great job of getting your tablet-sized screen out to you. I use my tablet to read, research and work at the same time, and have been happy with this device from the beginning. "  I got this device mainly because the original iMage doesn't play nice with older tablets (and the iPad too), and because I wanted a tablet that could run Chrome on Android. I bought this for a class, and as a class project, but I've used it every day since. It has a small footprint, has a good screen (though not great, but for an Android tablet) and has a headphone jack to plug in your iPod or even an audio recorder. The only con I have is that it lacks a SD card reader, but even with this one-hundred-percent problem solved, this is a really good device for the price. And even better for being an unlocked tablet. I'm recommending it highly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the Sennheiser MM600.   It is a good product.  It fits nicely in my ear and does not obstruct any part of the ear.  I listen to classical music on it and have no complaints.  If you are a beginner or an advanced listener you will be pleased with the product. I would not recommend the  headphones  for heavy listening. I highly recommend this headphone if your music has a more intimate feel to it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I have purchased two of these for my kids and they are amazing. They have two buttons to use to change channels from TV and Radio to listen to different stations and even listen to some music. The ability to listen on the go is amazing. The only problem I had with this was that the speakers were not loud enough and I would have liked to have one more in the tv cabinet. This product is very well worth the money. I have recommended it to all of my friends. You will not regret this purchase.  A good value and works well for a small house with a small TV set. The TV is on a high definition monitor. . ,

My biggest gripe is that it is just not that big a device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This thing is great, as always, and I love the quality. It has good power and sound, with very little hum. There is a light in the remote that you can change in your car, which makes the car-radio-satellite-tv look even more like what it used to be. I bought this to use at work and have been very satisfied. It is a great value. This thing has good range too. I don't use any remote-control-type devices, I do my own listening, and this works great with the internal earphones. I'm very happy with my purchase, and will continue to buy from Radio Shack.

I have not done a ton of gaming with the device yet but it is working out great so far. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a Xiaomi Mi3S and it is very nice for its size, is comfortable to wear and is very good quality. But it's not the best in terms of battery life, or price/capacity, but for those who don't mind paying a little extra, it's really very good.  What you can't do:   No camera. The camera is not usable. The phone seems like a very well built device, but the camera is terrible and you cannot use it in low light conditions. You can take photos, but there is nothing to them except for the camera icon. When you shoot, you have no idea where the photo is going to be taken. A great phone, not an amazing one. Xiaomi has a lot of momentum right now, but it's time to take stock. It has a ton of hype and should be applauded for that. However, the Mi3 is a pretty expensive device and that's the first thing you can tell right off the bat. It is very much like a Galaxy S5, which at a similar price point, is far more impressive, but also a very expensive device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best thing ever! I just got my new laptop today. The thing is amazing! I have used other laptops that have great screens but I'm really liking my new Asus. I can play on the computer all day long. I like the way it is compact as well and the touchpad is pretty responsive and comfortable. I just can't wait to get my kids into their first computer. If you need a computer for the long haul, I think I've found the perfect one. I am still learning a lot about computers and this is really easy to use and I like that I can just plug the cord into the wall instead of having to hook the device up to a computer.  Write a negative review about an inferior product:   I had an Asus Chromebook. It was not well built at all. The battery died after only a week of use. Then the touch screen became unresponsive after about a week. The laptop was sold refurbished at Best Buy. It's been 2 months and my laptop still has no internet, and still has a dead battery. Please don't buy it at any retail store!  How do I find a good online retailer?   I'm looking for a high-quality laptop for my family that is also affordable. I'm searching around and can't seem to find any good deals and I'm trying to decide between buying from Amazon or Dell. Is there a way to find a retailer that I could get something for the right price?  You're probably already doing some of this, but I'll reiterate:  If you want a quality laptop that you can afford, the most important thing is to make sure that you're ordering an Asus model.   That means looking at the features that the manufacturer has put into their products, the materials used, the warranty, and of course, the performance and support.  If you're looking at a brand-new computer, it's best to look for laptops with good features and high quality build.  What are the features?  Most people will go for the specs, but they might not know which features you're really looking for.  A great way to get more details on a laptop is to Google "What's in the box?" and search for reviews of other users' laptops.  Here are a few of my favorite laptop features that you should look for when looking for your new laptop: Good hardware (as opposed to a brand) Good

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     i have always loved this product  Great purchase, wish it came with a charger!  I love the remote, very useful! I have had to replace my two other remotes and I wanted to make sure I got this one just for this. It's so useful. I have found it is a little slow to charge when connected to the wall, but I think that could be because the car adapter is only 2 amp max. I also want to note that it is made out of a plastic which tends to chip. I would recommend having a 3.7 volt car adapter for better battery life, but it's a great little remote and I would highly recommend it. I haven't tried using it as a phone charger. It seems a little large though, so I would buy a car adapter next time.  This is great! . It is awesome! It works well and is very easy to use. My kids (ages 11-13) like to play with this remote. They can tell what is playing and are always able to use it!  I have been a big fan of this remote since I got it. So far, it is just as advertised. I bought it from Amazon, and received it a little too late, as I got the Amazon Prime shipping, but the package arrived in time for Christmas! I love how easy the remote is to use, and that I can choose the station (music, talk, news, etc.) I want to listen to and set the volume at a certain level. I am especially pleased with the fact that you can now use it as an external audio player with the included adapter. This is a very nice feature for a toy remote! It doesn't get any easier to use than this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      You have a great idea in this app, and a very easy to use design. It is very easy for a beginner, and it is an easy to read interface, very compact.   The only negative I would say is that the text is a little small, and there are no options to make text bigger. But other than that, this is a great app!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The screen was nice and sharp and the size was just right. The device is fast enough to be used in the office and very comfortable to hold.   My only gripe was the USB charging cables were too long. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This device was a great device when I first got it but over time I have had to replace a few of the knobs. The button works great and the volume control works as well if not better than any I have ever seen.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a 2nd one of these after buying the original one when they first released. It has a lot of features that I don't think other similar devices have. The best one I have tried so far for controlling my smart phone/computer. I have also heard others say that it is very slow, but I have not been able to get it to freeze and I use a small battery every day anyway.   The battery life can't be beat:  Some people like the fact that the buttons on this device are different. I don�t but you can find different sets of buttons on other products and I like it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a little hard to see at first, but it's just a very simple product. When you first turn it on, you hear the two buttons, press the button on the left, and then when you press the right, you turn it to the side. I really like it, it works good and the battery is very long. Rated 5 out of 5 by Bob from Great little unit I've had this for years. It is great to turn on when you don't want to deal with fumbling and turning on the house or when you're out walking.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of the original Logitech keyboards and the new ones are no exception. That said, the new Logitech G710+ (the one that has the extra key) is really a good keyboard for a little extra money. I was hesitant to get a G710 on Amazon because it wasn't available at Best Buy but they actually had it. In the end, it's still a good quality keyboard (but the extra keys could have been more useful if you have to type long articles). It does have a number of the Logitech design elements but it's not exactly a Logitech - it's more like a Ducky, for example. The keyboard has two buttons that go together for one or two-handed typing, which is good because your thumbs are free to do something else. The bottom of the keyboard houses the Fn key, so you can press that to switch the function of the keys to the next or previous word in a sentence, or to move the cursor. The keys themselves feel a little mushy and the keys don't feel particularly tactile but for the price it's really not a dealbreaker. If you're looking for a comfortable keyboard that gives you a few extra features it's well worth picking up, especially if you need the extra space for something like a spreadsheet or other office work. You can get the same basic configuration with a bluetooth keyboard on Amazon but if you want the extra function keys, it costs $50 more than the original. So I would suggest the G710 for $35 but if money is a factor and you need that extra function key you can get it for $60-70 with a Bluetooth keyboard.   You can find a better, more expensive G710 at BestBuy.  Rating:  Good (4/5)  Purchased:  $49 (Newegg.com)   The original Logitg G710 is probably one of my favorite keyboards ever. The new Logit G710 Plus is very much a different beast. It's a much thinner keyboard that does away with the spacebar. It has fewer features than the old G710 but it feels better, especially the function row. There are just four additional keys on the key caps: "G" for go, "M" for middle, "J" for jump and "1" for enter. The function keys are nice and tactile and they do make the most
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the   mouser mop about 3 weeks ago after a very negative experience. I have very sensitive skin so I didn't want to use something with a lot of chemicals. I tried the  mouser and the mop for a week. At first I wasn't a fan of the smell but after using it more and more the smell and odor got better. I still didn't like the texture but I have to admit it did reduce some dust/stain issues that my wife noticed when we were cleaning the house. I had no complaints about the mousers power. It works very well but I still recommend using a good hair spray to cover hair.  by Jena T. on 01/10/2018 byon 01/102/2018
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    (5)   i don't like how hard the battery needs to be charged.   I have two of these and one of the batteries had a crack in the bottom but that's it.  A good feature:  If you have a lot of music on you can take a lot out of a day with this   For the price it is a pretty good   A bit pricey, but I recommend it. The only thing I dislike about it is the need for a charger, so I'll never buy a device this size again.  Rating is for the unit and USB cable only. I use this product for recording in my car, however it would be even better for a music studio. I love it because it's durable, small enough to take anywhere with me. It has a nice, clean sound which has a very nice bass line.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my    iPhone 5s. I have been very satisfied with the product   and the service   from the Apple Store.   Apple   has a very   good reputation and   customer service .   If you do not have an iPhone and would like to buy a second-hand phone:  What is the best phone you have ever had? I have an  iPhone 4  , so if anyone would like an   second- hand  iPhone   - I think I have the right one!   I would definitely recommend   this   for   people   who   like   using   a   real   phone!  I use the   same   camera   on   my  Mac   as I do   in   iOS .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very pleased with my new D-Sub. I have to say, the features are quite a few. The screen is very bright, and easy to read. It's also very easy to control the volume. I love the fact that I can record a little "music" while I am using it. My only concern with the screen is that if I put my finger on the lower right side it will take me to the previous screen which I find somewhat misleading. I would have liked a little more "real estate" between these two screens.   All in all, a good product.   Rated 5 out of 5 by John from Excellent product, excellent price Very easy to use. Good sound quality. Easy to adjust settings with the touch of a button. Great for gaming.  Product was exactly as described and works well on our Dell PC.  it's a great little thing  I would give the D-sub 930 5 stars except for the fact I don't like the button on the bottom of the unit. The small indentation is very uncomfortable. Also, it is difficult to reach the lower button because the unit is heavy. In general, I am satisfied with my purchase, and wish I had bought it from another source.  as always good value great sound quality the D sub is good for use with a laptop, I have a desktop so it would work great if it were a larger unit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My XO-1000 can get hot but it's not as much as with my iPod Touch. I can actually turn the volume down to about 25% without any problems.   I think the volume knob is a little bigger than the iPod on this particular model but it fits fine.  It's quite comfortable to hold and looks like it could last for a long time.  I've used it a couple times to watch my children's videos and I haven't had any issues with battery life. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A device I can use and own, but will be gone in a couple of years when it is no longer usable.   It's hard to fault the product in any way, since they had me do the repairs. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If it didn't work on my first try, I would have given up the moment I discovered it wouldn't work. I have two of these, and although one of the two would work for me, I could not get the other one to work either. The reason is that I can only hear the voice of the music I want to listen to. There is no tone control. So I have to make very small adjustments to get a good sound. The first time I tried this, I didn't even know I was supposed to turn on my TV so I could turn the volume up. There are more than enough of these things out there that work great!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a samsung galaxy s4 mini with 32gb of internal storage and a 16gb micro sd card and im using that sd card to store movies on. I have an iphone 4 plus and can fit most video files on the micro sd and play them on iphones. I did upgrade from the samsung s3 mini (32gb internal storage with 2gb microsd card) to the s4 (64gb internal memory with 4gb micro SD) so the mini is a little on the small side but I do love the s3 as it is. The only problem is that when i wanted to download movies off the micro SD I could not because the app was down and I had to download the movies on my computer (I have a mac).   When i tried to do this the microsd would not recognize my s4 so I was using the usb to flash my s3. I contacted samsung about this and they stated that they will fix this problem.   A couple weeks later I got a message saying that this is a known problem and that a software update will be released in the next couple of weeks. So the next week the s-store was updated with the fix and I was able to download videos. Now the microSD card is recognized by the s5. This was very helpful. Thank you so much for helping me out.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i love it   I want to know how many times I have to pay someone to set it up on the fly:  -   I was not so lucky. It was a bit of a pain getting it all in place. Once I did, it is smooth sailing. -  - It's all digital, so it works fine. It did not recognize my keyboard (it says not even recognized, but that's the last time I ever had a problem) but that just means I can use a wireless keyboard - 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using this product for several weeks.   It is so great for a quick and convenient way to play music.  It works great with my iPod Touch and it plays loud as a speaker, but sounds fine when played through speakers and headphone.  The screen is great for using apps on your iPad and iPhone.  I would highly recommend this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had the A5-USB2 for about 1 month now and I love it. It works great for music, video, web browsing, and even a bit of video editing and playing games (but not so much now that it has crashed). The only thing I've not liked is that it doesn't come with a micro SD card slot (or in the case of the A6-USB3, a micro USB socket) that would make using a hard drive and all the storage space of the new MacBook Pro that much easier. (This was something that I also found out from a friend at work.) I was able to install the latest version of iTunes using it, however. This would be my 1st purchase from DSI and I think it's an excellent value.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an excellent product. I have not had one break yet, and so far it is performing very well. The only problem is that it does require a fair amount of time to recharge. I am going to have to try something else with an internal battery, I'm just not sure if it will hold up.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is very good! This is my second pair. I originally got these in the silver color but when they were sold out I switched to the black for a different look. They look really good and are great sound quality. The only con I can find is that they are a bit noisy compared to most other headphones. I wish they could make them quieter.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A recent purchase from Best Buy, this little unit is a decent addition to any home theater setup. As a result, it has become one of my most used gadgets and is on my "to-have" list. The unit is small enough to fit in a purse, but does not feel flimsy. The quality of the sound it produces is excellent and it's great for watching movies in the kitchen. I have only one complaint (for now) and it is something that I am not willing to live with for a very long time: the controls are hard to get to (and hard to remember).   The unit itself is easy to operate and there are instructions on the back of the unit, but after about two weeks of use, I still have to remind myself each time I want to adjust a feature or change a mode. In the end, I don't think it is a great value, but I am happy with my purchase so far. A few minor complaints:  The on-screen menu and buttons are very hard to see and use. When viewing the screen, I have to squint very hard or just be a little bit closer to see the various controls, although most of these controls are easy to use.   I really hope that the company that makes these controls will add a little LED lighting so that people who are more visually impaired can see what they are doing.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a great device with a wide range of features. The only thing I don't like is that the battery life is a little short. For me it lasts 4 hours but I'm not a huge power user so I can live without.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good little gadget. I love my Kindle, but this one beats it hands down. It is light weight, small, light, small yet still works. The battery life is great. I have mine connected to my laptop which has a big screen and the light goes off every few hours, yet I'm still able to read. I can't see how anyone could complain.   I purchased mine at my local Best Buy for under $20 and had it in 3 days. It was the cheapest item in the store. I will be buying another for the office.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you are looking for a good computer and are looking to purchase a wireless keyboard for your PC, or any device for that matter, the Logitech Revue Dix has to be your number one choice. It's a great all around device.   It is a sleek, sleek keyboard.  It's also an extremely durable piece of hardware.  The layout of the Logerizer is fantastic.  With the Num Lock feature you'll be able to hit keys on the right side of your keyboard. It does take some getting used to and even after some practice you will be doing this quickly and correctly.  When it comes to the keys themselves there isn't a lot of difference. The key travel is great and it's responsive to any of your moves and the keys are easily customizable.  My only issue with this keyboard is that I'd have to say that I've never been a huge fan of the NumLock feature. The whole keyboard is made out of Cherry Blue, which I personally love, but I know a lot people don't like the color. I also know of people who will love this as I do. I would only get the black keyboard. But, even with those things, I think it's a good product.  Posted by Jules at 9:52 AM
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Great buy!   By Chris on March 01, 2017  Product: FangShi 5x5 Cube I absolutely love the 5x4 FangShu. The design and feel are perfect. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the magnets in the corner were slightly bent, which made it a little tricky to turn.  In my opinion, the best 5x3 FangShuyang I have ever had! I love the cube and the price too!  , I have tried so many cubes. I had wanted to get a 6x5 FangShou for a long time. But, in the end, the design and quality of the 5X5 Fang Shuyang was so good, that the price seemed almost too good to be true.  The 5x2 FangShyu is also a great cube, but not a 5X3. This is a very good cube and worth every penny.  Thank you FangShui for making such good quality 5x cubes.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this as a replacement for my iphone. After using my ipod and iphon i found this to be a better option as the screen is much larger and bright. The only complaint i had was the battery life. I usually use it 3 days a week. It has lasted about 5 days with light usage (reading) and 5 days without use. The design of the device makes it sturdy and you won't drop it. My only problem is the price but that might be just a coincidence. I've bought iphones, ipods and now this. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The best tablet ever made, with a sleek and beautiful look!   I love the weight of this tablet, the screen is great and I love that you can put it down on a table while sitting on it.   This is my first tablet, I have an iPhone 5c and I find it a little slippery, but this one is really easy to hold and is light weight. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     1. It's a great product! The price is extremely reasonable and it's the first piece of hardware I've ever owned with a USB port on the front. If you're looking for a small computer-like device that's well built, reliable, and has a USB socket on the side, look no further. 2. The software doesn't come loaded with any extras but that's not a dealbreaker. It does have the ability to be installed over a USB connection. For the price, it's an excellent value. 3. It is a very simple device to use. 4. You have to manually reset it after a reboot. 5. It supports a wide range of media formats such as MP3, OGG, MP4, DVD, USB drive, and USB stick. 6. It has a great price point for what it does.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Ease of use:  The best-designed device I have ever owned! I have never heard or seen any other product do what I was told it would do, and the first thing I did when I got the device was to turn it on and put it to work on the internet! I use this device with a desktop PC, and I can't tell you how useful it has been!  The software is very user-friendly, and a number of applications are included for use.   The battery life:  I was surprised how much juice the little device has left once I got it running. The unit is small enough that I can carry it in a purse (in my case), and it also works well with my wireless access point, which was another surprise.  The "key" function of the device is extremely useful.  I highly recommend this product!    The product is good, but the price is unacceptable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have not had a problem using this monitor.   It is accurate and does not look too much like a TV.  The only negative is the only way I can connect the monitor is through USB cable to my PC.  If you have a USB hub you can plug this into it.  I think it would be better if they made the monitor wireless. I have a problem with some people who are really into technology and never have had a computer until now, I was looking for a computer when I was about 8 years old and I found this monitor and it has been the best thing that ever happened to me. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the wireless transmitter and the receiver and have it up and running, so far, on my iPhone 5s. So far, I've got it in 2 outdoor spots. This transmitter works much better than my previous Bluetooth one. I've been using it on a couple of hiking trips. I don't have to worry about it dropping my phone or causing it to go dead. If you are thinking about the 5s, get this! It's well worth the extra money. It's a very small investment but one that will be worth it in the long run!  Rated 4 out of 5 by The_Dude from Good but a couple features need improvement The unit works well as advertised. I like that there is no power switch and all I have to do is connect the unit to the 5Ghz radio and that's all I need to get up and going. The unit has a small problem that needs to be resolved with the radio and receiver. When the unit was paired with my iPhone the remote control was not recognized. After some research, I determined the problem was that I had the unit connected to a computer. The next best thing to connect it to a phone via a USB cable would have been to connect the receiver directly to the radio. Since the receiver can be powered off the receiver, it is impossible to turn off the transmitter. Since I have not done this I have had no luck getting the unit up and working. I will give it five stars for the fact that I can use it on my 5S and 4S with the same radio and have a complete working unit.  Product reviews for the 5ghz radio are here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wU-r2KU5Yc&feature=youtu.be The product was received and setup successfully on the phone. It works as expected. I'd love to see the remote included in the box as a backup.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use the Epson Scanjet 500 with the D810. I have a Canon 7D that I bought at B&H and it is a great camera, but it's huge, expensive and has a ton of problems, so I bought this, and I've been very happy with it. My only complaint is that I think there is way too much contrast. I've had it for a while now and there's still a lot of white that's just a little too light. The negatives: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am so glad that this headphone came. It is so amazing and well made. The sound is so clear and the bass is so rich. It really makes me want to listen to the album that I bought it for. I wish the price was cheaper but its still so good. Also I want to tell everybody that they should try the V30 if you are on the fence. There is a difference in the sound between it and the old one that is very good. Thanks!  Rated 5 out of 5 by nolobod from A new benchmark! I've been listening to many headphones over the years. I thought my current set of headphones could not compare with these. After all I have the AKG K550s, Sennheisers and Sony MDR-7506s (which I own). I was wrong! I couldn't be happier with these headphones. The bass is rich and accurate, the mids are rich and detailed. The mids of the Sony are the most neutral. I am glad I spent the money on these headphones because I know they will last a long time. I would recommend these to anybody that wants great sound and comfort.  5 stars for these things by Mark  I've got a lot of headphones but these are easily the best ever. They are very comfortable and have a very clear sound. They sound good, but not great. I guess this is the first I've ever heard someone who said that a pair of these headphones is better than a pair I had and a pair that I own. I'm still trying to decide if they are good enough to justify spending a couple hundred dollars on, but the difference is pretty dramatic. If you can't spend that much, get a pair if you can.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The build quality is very good. The device is very quiet. I recommend this device to all. I also love that you can take the sound off.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the best things about this radio is that it can be used to control your   thermostat,   or the thermostatic pump that I bought from my neighbor. This is a smart way to control the home and you don't have to do anything fancy. Just pull out the radio and press the button on your thermostats. I think it is the most convenient way to operate my   temperature control system. My only other complaint is that the buttons on this radio don't come on at the same time as the buttons under the screen.   I have not tried to use the button control buttons on the top of the radio. It is difficult to get to with the tiny thumb keys on my  iPhone 3G.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned an original ipod for about 10 years, it has worked good most of the time, but now it has lost its signal due to bad connections to a power line. I replaced the ipod with this one. It has saved my sanity and I've found myself to be listening to music or podcasts on it, with very little interference and very little clipping. My old ipod was terrible and if I tried to listen to music on it when it lost its connection to the power line, I'd turn it on and it would just stop playing. Now I can still listen to my music without it losing connection. It is a must have, if your a musician like I am.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Sarge from Love the sound The speakers in this device are absolutely fabulous. The sound quality is phenomenal and the clarity is excellent. It definitely makes music more fun to listen too. However, it's not a large or heavy device. As far as audio quality is concerned I think you can expect great quality. ,  "Good quality at a very fair price."  ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a little worried about the reliability of this device due to it not being on my computer at all. After about a year of usage on my desktop PC, I can see the lights dimming and the speakers cutting in and out with no warning (even though I don't use a lot of noise). The audio quality is good though and the battery life is better than the battery on my old computer.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This    is a beautiful unit, I have used a lot of different products over the years, but the   I am   most   proud   of is this one   The quality is superb, and the  battery life is fantastic. The   control panel is easy to use, but not so simple that you can't use a computer with it. I have found   the  main   button to be difficult to press. Do not use if you have a hard time seeing:     I just purchased a   new   camera   for   my     iPhone 4  ,   which   had   good   resolution   and   high   quality   pixels,  but   unfortunately   there   seems to   not   have   a  good  screen for   my    device,  it   always   has   small   text, and  it   does   look awful on   everything   except   the most  sharp   display   that   you   can get.   For   about  $50 I was thinking   something like this would work great   but it doesn't work.  If I had just spent   money   to buy the  Samsung   S3   it would   easily   be   on  my   list  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have 2 of these devices. The first one I got was about a year ago and has worked great. I use it at home for my ipod and ipod mini. I used to use my old analog radio on my ipad and my computer. However the ipod min is about to go and I want it to be able to talk into it on a bluetooth. The second one I bought about 2 years ago has worked much better, but I am not a huge fan of the plastic casing. I can see how some could get tired of that.  I'm very happy with my purchase of these ipod speakers.

It was a hassle to ship my laptop to them but the end result is a device that works. I had a problem with my iBook Pro for some reason, so I emailed them and they were able to sort it out. Highly recommend!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This keyboard has great features and is easy to use. The font is a little small but it's better than most keyboards on the market. Also the switches have a good resistance.   If you are not that big on gaming, the keys are very comfortable and don't hurt your hands like most keyboards.  This is the keyboard you need to play the game "Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker". The keyboard features a full size red backlit keys.  The key caps are high quality and they look awesome!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The best I have ever used".  I have tried many different types of cell phones. I always came back to this phone because it is durable, reliable, and it has all the features I need. When I get a new phone I will continue to be a customer. It is really hard to say anything bad about a cell phone.  Linda, New York   Comfy, Easy to Use - Great Features! I was looking for a phone that would be easy to use, comfortable to hold, and would not break the bank. I like the fact that my phone does not have a power button and the buttons on the phone itself do not have to be pressed to make a call. It can be used just like a hand held phone. It takes longer to set up and use the phone compared to my other cell phones but it has everything I need and that's what I'm looking for.  as a long distance call, you have to have one to do it right. When you use a traditional cell phone with a landline it's just as good if not better. For the price, this is a great phone for a great price.  and the customer service is excellent. They are very responsive and help you with any question you have. I have not had to worry about my phone ever again. I'm happy so far with this purchase. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my iMac.   It has been the best computer I've owned.  With that said, the screen is flicker-y so I'm thinking I'll get a better screen.  If you are looking for a great computer to buy, I would not recommend this computer.  It is a good computer but is not a good all-rounder. I like my Mac so much that I got the iMac to replace my Macbook Pro, and while the i Mac works just as well as my MacBook Pro, the i-Mac is just better.  I think you'll enjoy the new computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "I was skeptical when I first heard about this unit, thinking it was just another high-powered amplifier with little to add to my audio collection. My hopes were dashed, however, when I received it...the sound is astonishing! The amount of detail, clarity, and dynamics is simply incredible! The high end is crystal clear and the bass is well defined, yet not boomy. The highs are also very good. The quality is simply astounding! This is the most amazing sound I have ever heard. This unit will be a regular part of my stereo."    "I have always been a fan of the TPA6120 amps. This is a great unit which puts out great performance. The unit sounds and feels like a piece of high-end kit. I highly recommend this amp."  I received the amp from JBL at no charge, but would like to take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to JBL for allowing me to test this unit and review it for others on the forum. This was a very pleasant experience to be able to receive a product from JB L, and I appreciate your support in giving away these great products for free."  TPA6180 Review:  At a price point of $1,500, the TPS6180 (model A100) is by no means an impulse buy. The $1K price tag has a lot of people questioning its value. However, I have always found the TPD amp to be very good value for the price, in part because the sound is so good. And with the new TPSA6180, that sound quality has only gotten better.   I first tested the TPG5180 at a recent Music Choice Show, where I reviewed its more affordable sibling, the TB5180. I was blown away by the difference in sound quality between these two units. At $200, it's hard to believe that the TPE5180 has the sound quality of the TB.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Ipod Nano is amazing!   I'm a big fan of the iPod touch, but this model is much better in every way and much smaller!  I'd be hard pressed to buy anything else in my entire life!  The design of this model gives the impression of a professional design.  The build quality is outstanding for an inexpensive product.  I also love the fact that there are no wires on the back of the device.   For a $50 portable, it is truly amazing.   Customer service:  I received my Ipod nano a few weeks ago and I really love it!  So far, the only complaint I have is the batteries only last for 2 hours.  Another big plus is that it's waterproof so I can take it in the water for fun!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPad is very good. I love how my pictures, videos, and music are accessible, even on the road. I use my iPad for studying, writing, and reading and I am very pleased with it.   I bought the i7, but the battery lasted about 6 months. I will be buying a second one as soon as it is available.  The i7 is definitely worth the money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great piece of kit. The build quality is excellent and it works great.  Excellent I'm using the iStick for over a month now with no problems at all. Its small form factor, light weight, great for travel and perfect for keeping your device charged in your pocket. My only complaint is the battery life is extremely short compared to other electronic devices on the market but the good thing is it is easy to replace the battery with the included one so its not that big a deal.  (Posted on 5/15/17)  Great Product but... I have an iStripper v3. The iStrip does not work with it. No buttons are accessible or usable. I use the v4 and it still works. (Posted 8/17/16)  with love, with respect, and with a strong warning It's a good little device. It was fun to have in the car, and I was pleased with the range, but the battery runs out really fast. It does not last more than a few days of full usage. Also, the USB port seems to work, but it only charges via usb-C to power the device, and the charging leads are pretty tiny. They are easily broken by dropping them. Not sure if they are even made anymore. I have been using the v2, it charges instantly via USB-C, but runs slower, and it uses much more power than the v3, which is my main device. In a nutshell, the v1 is the superior device to the v5 in my opinion, and a much better value if you don't want to give up any features. I do want to mention that I have had a v1 before I got the v8. It had a few minor issues that I had to deal with. The biggest one was the charging port was not very good. It works fine on the v6. If you know how to work with a little bit of soldering, you can fix it for $5. If not, it's not worth spending $7 on a charger. The other minor problem was the battery. It's not a bad battery, but as it was very new, it wasn't very efficient. It would often die in less than a month without charging, and be dead after a couple weeks. I am hoping that the v9 has a better battery. And I just want to add that i'm not a
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This thing is a big step in the right direction for all things electronic.  This was my first and only time using a tablet, and I really liked it. I was very skeptical about the battery life and the speed.  I did not use it for more than an hour a day.  My only complaint is the lack of a proper charging port (you have to use the provided cord).  The tablet charges in 4 hours and 30 minutes.    Write a negative review about an average electronic device (eg: Kindle, iPad, Galaxy, Blackberry, etc.):   I'm not sure why I haven't already written about this.  The battery life is terrible, so even though the unit will last the entire day, that's just not long enough.  When the device starts to die, it won't last more than a half hour.  I don't know why Amazon decided to sell this device for $100 more than it should cost.  It's a shame that they had to raise the price and not be more transparent.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sound: I was impressed with how good the sound was on this device. It sounded almost as good as my stereo system, only better. The low end on this was quite nice, especially the mids. The mid range was clean, articulate, and loud, but still fairly clear and not boomy. The highs, while not being "brilliant," were very well-defined and very clear. The bass was a bit tinny and did not have a strong punch, but was still very well controlled and detailed. The soundstage was good, although a little on the small side. If the subwoofer is a little too loud, the sound will cut out sometimes, but this isn't a major issue. I'm also a little disappointed about the volume, since it is too low for my room. However, I'd recommend that you don't try to play loud, as the sub and bass are not a problem and the overall quality is well-worth the price.   Pros:  My sound was almost as amazing as my system. I could hear every instrument and the background noise perfectly. The clarity and detail was amazing. This is a must have for anyone who likes to listen to music.  Cons:  For the price, there are some cons. The subwoofers do not last very long. I would advise that you get a little bit of volume, or buy a set of powered subwoos. The amp isn't very powerful. I was expecting a lot more power. It doesn't feel very sturdy, either. I am pretty happy with the purchase.  My favorite piece of music on it is Toto's "Africa".  My rating:  A

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing I noticed about the new G2 is the excellent sound quality. It is very clear and crystal clear and is just about as loud as a pair of earphones can be without overloading the ears. The bass is good but not overbearing and the mid range is warm and smooth. It has a nice depth to it with some nice deep bass. I could listen to these all day. There is no harshness and they stay in your ears with no discomfort. I have used these on both my Macbook and my Sonos speakers and they seem to work perfectly. For the price, I think you get what you pay for. The only issue I found was that the batteries were running out very quickly and the sound was fading a bit when the batteries ran out. I got the extended battery life version for $5 more. They're great headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works flawlessly, works with the phone's sound and works as advertised. I was worried about not being able to get it to record my stereo music since the phone doesn't have a built in mic (and I do have a stereo). But I am a complete novice in electronics, and I can record everything I have with this. I'll definitely buy another one. I am also looking at getting another set for my boyfriend's car!   " "The phone works great, but it needs to have a better mic, even on a good mic like the Mophie. The phone needs to be able to select audio through the phone, like the Samsung S4 does, not have to get a separate mic. It also seems like the phone would make better use of the camera if the microphone was not placed on the top (it has been placed in a similar spot in other phones, like many others, but doesn't work as well). Overall, it is a nice phone for the money, and it comes with everything you need. However, I am looking to upgrade the internal battery next year, because it does not seem to use as much juice as my S4."  Find the right wireless earphones for your ear type:

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got my new Macbook Pro 16 GB in June. I have only had it for about a week. So far so good. My only complaints would be that there is not a lot of space to store my music on it (it's on my laptop). And the speakers sound pretty bad (it seems that there's a lot more bass when you turn them up and a lot less when you don't). However, I would recommend this to people that are looking to upgrade their computer. It's a pretty big step up from my old one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     - This is a really cool little little device!  This is a nice device. If you want to make the most out of your MP3 player and don't need a whole lot of features, this is a good way to go! The only thing I'd change is the battery life. I think the device should have a bigger battery life than what it's offering. There are a lot of great features that come along with this MP3 Player and I would have liked to have seen a larger battery life as well. I'm not sure how it would have held up with my use over a long period of time, but I'm very happy with the purchase. I have not had any problems with it yet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1. The design is the most appealing. The metal enclosure is solid and the display is clear and crisp. The speaker quality is excellent (it has a slight tinny sound at times). This is an outstanding device for people who enjoy using their computers and tablets as a tablet/smartphone, but don't have much space in their pockets. The buttons are very easy to use, the USB-C is a real boon for me, as I never had a cable handy for a phone charger. And, I have to say that I'm quite pleased with this purchase! 2. The size and weight are both great. The keyboard is big, and I actually like the size. My main gripe is that it doesn't really fit into a bag or purse comfortably (at least not in the small size of my hand). The top is flat, which isn't ideal. But the weight is perfect. 3. The charging case isn't quite as convenient as my Galaxy S8 and S8+. It's too heavy, and the top is not flush with the bottom. I do not wish to have to unclip the charging case every time I plug in the tablet to charge. But, if you're trying to maximize use of your space, it may be the best device for you. 4. The screen and speakers are better than expected. The brightness is very good, the viewing angles are excellent, and, unlike some people have complained about, the speakers are very loud and clear. 5. The USB-A cable is long and doesn't require me to unplug it from the USB port to charge my phone. 6. The battery life is the best I've seen. Not to say it's as good as the Note8, as it really depends on the use. My screen is on the back, and that means that I charge the battery via the charger every night. This makes a total of 6 hours for me. I charge my Note8 for 5 hours per charge (with all the screens off), which leaves me with more time to do other things. Overall, the device is great.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I don't understand why some people give the Nexus 7 a negative review, that is the only reason why you would buy it. I have had the phone for only 2 weeks, but already I am getting used to the size and design of the phone. I do not think I will use this as a daily phone for work like my other android phones. It's a good device for the price but I doubt it will get a long life if you need it.   Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been wanting this device for quite a while, I've had many others before, but this one was by far the best!  I was looking for something that didn't get in the way, something that can also provide music, but is not "just a speaker."  It's small, and it does what it should do very well: play music.  The battery is nice and long, it's so good you can use it all day, all night.  It is quite loud, not as loud as a lot of others, but enough to get your attention.  I would definitely buy again, and recommend this device to anyone looking for a portable speaker.   5/5 BEST THING EVER!!!!!!!!!  I was at the store buying this product at my local store and the guy gave me the thumbs up.   It was the best part of the store and I would recommend this to everyone.  Just want to tell you that the product was in stock and not only were they running out of this thing they also had another brand for sale.  Thanks guys!  Product Description: This is a good little device that works well, but not great. If you want a device to play music in the car or when you're on the road, this is good for you. However, if you want something more useful such as a media center, this won't be enough for you, even if you own multiple Apple devices.  For this price, you can't expect it to be flawless and it's not going to replace the sound of a good sound system for audio playback.  What it can do is make your iPhone look like a little mini music player, a good way to pass the time. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I've got a bunch of these sitting on my desk at work. I love that they don't come with a usb port. I have a bunch, and use them for connecting a computer to my home theatre sound system, and for a desktop to play games on. I also bought a couple of these to try out for a remote control for a music player. The connection on these is just fine. I get a bit of a pop when I turn on a new computer but I don't know what it is, but I just set a few of these up to use for my music player and I'm having fun. I might buy another set when I'm finished with this one. You really have to love the small size to love these.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of the most impressive pieces of gear I have ever used. It is absolutely amazing. The quality is amazing, the battery life is awesome. I never expected it to be so nice. Even if you don't like the fact that I've found a way to replace it, I suggest you look at the other reviews before you decide this is not for you.  A very good headphone:  I use this headphone for about 5-6 hours at a time. When you play music the volume is not too high, but there is a good amount of bass. I like the soundstage and detail the headphone provides. The only con I found about it was the noise cancelling, but that is more a personal preference thing than anything else. 1 of 1 found this helpful

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The battery life is great and you can connect up a USB cable to the USB hub.

This is my first wireless device and my first experience with a device with a USB hub so be warned you could be in for a wait but it's a worth it for me.   Rated 4 out of 5 by daveb from Good Product, Cheap price Pros: Solid build and solid design - I did a lot of research on the topic, but found this model to be the most user friendly, most intuitive. Cons: The display is a bit dark in direct sunlight (not a big deal) and a bit blurry (no big deal, but I do wish it had a color menu). The camera is fine, but does require a USB 3.0 adapter, which was very cheap and annoying to find, and the wifi doesn't support AP mode for more than a 5-8 mile range (no problem)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best headphone   I have ever used  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a HP 3u4 for about $60 a few years back and it was really a lot of fun. It was small, light and small and it had a lot more power than your average laptop. But the screen was not as bright as you'd like for a screen this size. I had to put it away for a week in my drawer to get it back to the bright I thought it was. I also thought it should have a faster hard drive so I went to Best Buy and bought a Seagate Barracuda 7200. The 7200 is really good for my needs but is still much slower than my old one and it is much harder to use it. But it works and the screen is still bright. If your looking for a good computer with great power, this is the one. Also, I didn't think I'd love a keyboard this small but I do. The keys are small but the keys and the feel of the keyboard are great and you can hit a lot with it. The only con I have is the lack of a headphone jack and the lack a webcam and it could use a better case.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I don't have any negative comments about this device. I've used the same setup for many years now, and I really like it. When I first bought this unit, I wasn't impressed by the size. I would recommend getting this over the larger model if you can (they sell this as a smaller unit too). The unit can be plugged into a TV or your computer for access. I do wish the volume levels were easier to adjust though. The unit doesn't get too hot after prolonged use. The cable is very thin and the remote is very well made. I like that you can use this device on a tablet or desktop, which would normally be a pain, but there's a few things you have to change on the device (keyboard, microphone).  The price is excellent, and the device looks very clean and good quality. I'll buy again and again.  A good product.  at  Great product...if not a bit pricey.  with  It's the best thing that happened to the remote. I'm now able to listen to my favorite music on the big screen without having to look down.  I'm very satisfied, and very satisfied with the product. I love the sound of the music. It's easy to use, and all the settings are available from the app. I have the tablet version and I am using it to surf the net. If only they sold it as an mp3 player instead of a receiver, I would be happy with the price, but it is the best sound I have ever heard. So glad that I bought it! I highly recommend. Thanks Amazon!  Just What I Was Looking For  Easy to use and works perfectly.  of  I am a first time buyer and I don not know how to thank you enough. I didn't know how good it was going to sound till after I got it but now I am blown away! I think you will find yourself listening to it many times on your computer/tablet/phone. The sound quality is perfect and the volume is just right. My first purchase from Amazon and I'll be back. Thank you!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It came to my door almost a week ago and I am very happy with the experience. I have two of these, the original model, and an updated model. The original model has worked great for the last 6 years. The upgraded model is a bit louder but is still perfectly usable. It would be nice to have a "pro version" of this but this will do until they add that. The only reason I gave this five stars instead of four is because I have had a hard time with it. It is not as stable as the original, it makes a whining sound, it has a loud clicking sound when you push on the button, and has a tendency to hang up. If these problems can be solved with some basic troubleshooting, I would give it a five star rating.    A little louder than you think it is:  I was disappointed by the amount of noise the model 2B made when it is on. It was so much that when I went to play with it, I thought I had the batteries disconnected when I took it out of the box. I am really not a fan of noisy and unstable models. This is a really nice product and I will buy it again if they make it in another size.  Great addition to our studio:  My Sound Blaster Pro X has become a mainstay in our audio studio. It has the processing power and sound quality that I need to put together complex mixes. In fact, when our son was born last year, I had him in the studio playing the sound of the baby on repeat, and when I turned off the sound, my ears were still ringing.   I was really impressed with the amount this worked on my Sonos. The software is so simple to use and it seems to do what you want it to. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high end sound card.  "The best card I've ever used for surround recording..."  This is the first card I bought. After a bit of research, I decided to buy this model and had it setup. I'm glad I did. It's the best card that I've tried. You get 4 audio channels (for a total of 8). It can do 5.1 audio, but that's only really useful if you're doing surround (more channels = more audio). I'm doing multi-track (multiple tracks of audio), and the only issue I'm having with it is I'm running into
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had my A-TOSON 3 since early 2011. I really love it! I had an original Toson that I got at a garage sale and the sound was horrible. When I saw this at Target, I knew I was in for a treat. The sound is so much better than the original. I like the control knob to easily adjust the volume. I can't wait to buy a second one for my daughter who is getting into music, and for myself so I have one in my office at work. I also love the color. If you're looking for a good sounding device with a lot of features, this is it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really don't care much about the features of the e-reader; it's my laptop, and a laptop doesn't really need a touch screen to use.   If it had a good touch screen, I'd probably switch from my laptop to my e-book reader, but that's just me.  There's a touch function on the back of the cover, which helps the cover stand upright.  The cover is a little thin, but not too thin, and the paper is still stiff.  When I read, I can't see myself getting tired of it.  At $80, it's not that great to use, but it is a great gift. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been very pleased with the performance and the features that are included with this device. This is a good deal and it comes with 2 batteries. The device is very easy to use, and has a simple layout. The quality is also very good. I have bought other electronic devices, and this one is very well built. I highly recommend this product for its features and performance.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It really works well.   The thing is huge, really heavy, and the only time I have used it was to send out a couple of emails.  However it has gotten great reviews and I plan on upgrading.  My biggest gripe is with the volume and noise level.  The only time we have ever played games was while trying to send something out so I do not know if this is a problem on the other computers or the volume was so loud when we wanted to send in that first email that the game was drowned out.  If there was a way to adjust the volume the sound would have been much more pleasant.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - The only downside to this is that the microUSB cable is very short. I'm using my Samsung Galaxy S5 at the moment with it charging via usb and my Nexus 5 with it also.   - I have a few complaints: 1. The microUSB cables are not long enough. If you have one of these you have to cut them to length. 2. I wish it came in a different color. I have tried to use it with the same charger, but its still very noisy. The USB cord is very stiff when trying to keep the phone in one place 3. The design is not something I want to look at everyday - a lot of the buttons are covered with a plastic shield. Also, the buttons may be slightly difficult to press if your hands are full. 4. As for sound quality, it is ok. I can use the Bluetooth headset while playing some games. 5. The charging unit takes up a lot more room than expected - when you get it home, you have a very tight space around you.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It was a great addition to my collection, and it's an excellent price.   The sound is a little lacking in bass, but it's still really good for a portable.  I like the fact that it is easy to use and I can leave it on the bed and not worry about it going dead.  The only drawback is the weight and the size, but I got used to it very quickly and didn't mind.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     "When my friend bought me this device she had been using a lot of these old cell phones. I was skeptical at first but I was very impressed with the design and build quality. It's lightweight and it works perfectly with my iPhone. When it comes to the voice calls and audio quality it's the best of both worlds. It has Bluetooth and a headphone jack that I love having. All the features are there and they are easy to use. It really comes down to how you plan to use the phone, this is a no-brainer."  Read the full review in the January 2014 issue of Macworld magazine.

Also, having a camera on it doesn't take away from the value.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the look of the E2 and it plays great.   The controls are really easy to use and the built in headphones are great as well.  The battery life is great for all my needs!   One con is that the USB port doesn't work with most devices and the software has problems downloading games. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love this device. I am going to order another one soon and will definitely continue to buy these.   My one problem with this product is that the battery life is short. It starts out charging to 100% and I only get about 10-12 hours of use. It should last for several days though so that's not a big deal. I would recommend this product if you are looking for something that is easy to setup and get good battery life from.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Thank you! After reading about the various problems I had with this new computer, I decided to just go ahead and buy it, considering the price was right and the price of the original system was well worth it. After installing the driver, the unit has worked very well for a week now. Very simple to set up and to use. I'm a very happy camper.  Good, reliable computer:   I like my new desktop! After a good deal of looking around and trying a few things, I chose this system over others that I saw. I like the ease of installing the system. It's nice to be able to keep the same parts and the same software for the system as long as I like, and I like that I don't have to worry about updates and upgrades. I'll have to wait to see how well the graphics card does in my system, but I'll be ready to go with the computer in a few weeks. I am very satisfied with this purchase. I bought the computer on the strength of the "good price" when it came in the mail. That was worth all the work I put into getting this system. I will certainly be recommending this site and this product to all my friends who are shopping around for a computer.  the computer is solid, but not at all as nice as I would have liked. The system itself is not as nice to look at as the first one I had (the one that I bought in the 90s). The system has no power brick. It only has an AC adapter and it is a little tight to get the AC adapter out. I had to use the manual for the AC adaptor, so I have to keep that in the back and keep it close at hand. I wish the keyboard was a little easier to use but I am sure that can be fixed with some time. It is just as easy to use with my older keyboard as it is with my new keyboard. The screen is a bit difficult to read on due to the size of the screen and the high contrast. But I just had to buy a monitor since my old one was getting really old. The computer has a DVD-ROM drive. I just have to find out if I can get a CD-ROM in it for my computer. My old computer had a CD drive for all of it's hard drive, but they had to throw the drive out because the drive would only hold one CD in the CD
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like the sound from the TAC. It is the quietest I've heard from this type of DAC. The build quality is excellent and the headphones sound great. My only problem with this DAC is the amount of noise it causes (I have a couple of small portable speakers, so it is easy to hear what is going on in the headphones, even if they aren't powered on). I would have preferred a little bit more noise canceling. It's not as bad as some other DAC's in this price range that produce excessive noise. This is just the way the TATAC works and the way that it will always sound (at least when I am not listening to my own music). It's still a very quiet DAC, but I have to say it doesn't compare favorably to the competition in the small portable headphone market.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So I've owned this thing for a year now. For $30 bucks you get a device that has a lot of great features. The speakers are clear and the microphone works well enough. The batteries lasted for a week so it's a good product. I had trouble getting it to work though. At first I was getting around 15-20 channels at once, and then eventually got to around 40, and sometimes as high as 60 or 70 (sometimes not). That's with it being charged at all times, and the last charge took a long time (7 hours for a single channel). I'd like to try other things before I upgrade.   I use my iPad a lot so the touch screen makes it a bit awkward for me to use this on my iPhone but I still prefer it to the iPad.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is my favorite thing in the world. It is so much easier and faster to use than a computer, I have two. It has saved my sanity while I was sick, which is a big deal for me. It takes me anywhere, whenever I want to go! I am in love. I love that I can listen to all of my music and books on it, and that I don't have to lug my laptop around. I get emails and web pages in my email, and I can still listen to music. I can even stream movies. It's a total life changer, for me, so thank you!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The ELC-W150 is a perfect balance between price and performance.   It is very quiet, and runs at 100% power.  When using a laptop, there is always a lag in using the ELCW150, and there are always times when I have to press the power button.  I will keep the E LC-W1510 until I can get a "good" wireless keyboard.  (Posted on 7/9/2012)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     My wife loves my iPad, even though I do the majority of our electronic activities with my iPod, and the iPad has a few advantages over the iPod.   First, I'm able to play a wide variety of songs on my iPod. My iPod just doesn't have enough storage capacity to play most of the songs on there.  Second, the iPad is easy to use: just plug it in and you're good to go. The one thing the iPad can't do is play back audio from another computer in my house.  But that's kind of a moot point, since the Mac does all of my "work" these days.  This device is the first portable one I've used that has made me want to buy an Apple computer. I've been looking for one of these since I first heard about the device.  The iPod has always been the device that I used for listening to music and movies, and my iPod Mini is about as portable as you can get.  I have never been able to use my iPod in my car, or take it to the airport, so this has been a long time coming.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this item for use in my work-benching position. This is very easy to use, easy to set up, and it is the first time I have used a keyboard which is very good! I am going to recommend this to my co-workers!    Review by: Mike - Laredo, TX. - December 20, 2012  I have had this product for a few weeks now and I am very pleased with it. I use it to work out and it has been very easy and fast to set. The only thing that i do wish was made smaller was the key that lets you select a specific color or the key to turn on the lights. If that is any sort of complaint it is only a minor one and it can be changed easily. I also like the ability to use a mouse with this keyboard.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The E6 works well. I really like the fact that it comes with an SD card.   When I was a kid I always loved Star Trek: The Next Generation, but not as much as I enjoyed TNG-E6-E4.  I bought the E6 when I needed a portable radio, but it is so convenient that I have been using it almost every day for the past two years.  I was hesitant about buying a cheap portable radio because of the battery, but the battery lasts all day on a charge.  When I started using the E-6 I noticed that it was easy to use, but some people may be intimidated to use a cheap little portable.  The E-5 is probably the same price as the E3 or E6. I think it is a good deal for the price, but be careful not to break the batteries (which are easily replaceable).   The first thing I did when I received the E5 was plug it into my car battery, then the power adapter and then onto the car stereo. The only negative thing about this unit is that there are many problems with the earpiece.  Most people complain that it falls out and they have to replace it.  It is easy to replace, just make sure that the ear piece comes with the plastic clips.  A more expensive way to look for a good portable is to buy a pair of these, which can run about $10-20 more.

When I get home from work, the device is fully charged and working just as good as when I got it.  I highly recommend this product.   5        Customer service is the number one problem I have had with this product and all of the others in the series.  It seems that you only have 2 options when contacting them and one of them is either no phone number or just a "no comment" when you call them.  In the past, I called them, they would do everything they could to get me a hold of me.  This time, I just got a hold the hell of my own and never got a call back.  When trying to get a hold off them, I was told there were no records of my order and I got "nothing back" when trying to follow up on that.  The other negative is the "quick start" guide they make for the device.  You get the info on how to setup it in only 2 pages.  So why would I want to read it, I have done it already.  For those that would like it to work better with the computer, it does not.  If you can afford it, get the one that has a monitor.  Even then, it takes about 4 hours to get it working correctly.

It's been extremely convenient, because all of the components can easily be removed without damaging the other pieces. I'm not sure why some people don't like this item, as it's a very well made and well engineered device. It does require a very firm hand though, so I suggest using a lot of lube (more than you think you need) and holding the buttons down firmly.

The new and improved AirPod is a larger, more rigid version of the previous one.The new AirPad can be worn in one hand or in the other. It can also attach to the side of your watch and used like a charging cable, the AirPuds are also a wireless pair. The AirPads are much more durable than the previous version. This is important for all electronic devices that will be used every day. They are also less prone to breakage, especially when compared to a traditional headset. The AirPorts are also more powerful and can be used to charge your iPhone or iPad. AirPods have a Bluetooth connection and can work at a range of around 30 feet. They also can be paired and paired with your other Bluetooth device. There are no cables or chargers for the AirPod, which is good news. Since they are a wireless version of a traditional microphone you will need a wireless mic to use the Air Pods. They will work with iPhone, iPads and Mac, but they do require a Lightning or 30-pin cable to use with the iPhone.  The Air Pads will work on Windows PCs, but there is no native support for them.     They are not recommended for use with laptops due to the fact that they are large and bulky, but if you want to connect to the computer you can use a Lightning cable.  Air Pods are very easy to set up and use. The controls are intuitive and can get pretty busy when using them for the first time. They provide a great audio experience with a clear, high

The seller said the instructions were on the box, but I don't think so. The first time I used the unit was just to check that it was working, I couldn't figure out the controls. I did take the unit out to the window to see if it would change, and it only made a small dimmer. I guess they need to get some better instructions on how to use the units. I am going to have to put another one on, but this is a great first unit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   When i first got the XE5 my first thought was "wow, this is a nice looking phone". I loved the slim design and the way the sides were rounded off and rounded back, which really added to the overall look. The color matching with the rest of the device was nice, but a little dull and the blue accents on the sides really didn't go with the device itself, and really didn�t help me see any of the blue in the X-Series design (the blue was in every other case i owned). That being said, this phone really was a pleasure to use.    The display has good brightness, the speaker quality is great, and the battery life is about as good as one could hope for in an LCD screen phone. However, the Xe5 isn�t a great looking phone, which I�m disappointed with as the Xfone 2 is one of my favorite devices.  That being said i think this phone is worth every penny and you should definitely consider getting one if you can get it.  This review is part of a series of features that will be used over the coming weeks to break down the XSeries lineup, and will include a series that covers the XPhone, the M5, and all the other devices in this line up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had this device for about 2 weeks and it's working pretty well.   So far I've been using it on my home stereo, my laptop (the one with my speakers) and the DVD player.  I can get decent sound, it's not as good as my old receiver, but it can still get the job done.  It's nice to know that I'll be able to plug this in and have the speakers and my TV output good sound from my computer.  The only problem I have is that I had to use the HDMI cable from the receiver to my computer, which made it too long.  Hopefully, I'll get my hands on some better cables when I get the money for a new computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a good device, as most E-cigarette users would say, it's very easy to load, great flavor and vapor production, but only if you are careful about what to load it with.   For my first time using it, I had some trouble with the battery, because it's a 18350 it needs a lot of juice, I was able to get it working for a couple of times, but then the battery dies.  It's also kind of hard to see what's going on with the screen, but I suppose that's the reason it's in a compact size.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a college student and I use a Sony VTC6 in my portable music player. It is a very powerful unit and I like its sound.   There are no problems in terms of durability and it is good to have a portable sound. It does not cost much and I am always ready to buy a new unit if necessary.  5 5 Excellent product, perfect price for a high-quality product 5 star product.

I was very pleased with the first device I bought but I would not recommend this one to someone who does not want to be constantly running around looking for a charge. You can charge your phone at any time, so it isn't very convenient to just leave it plugged in or leave it on at night. The screen is nice, and it charges pretty fast.  Posted by : Mika : at 8:37 AM
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - This keyboard is great for all the things I wanted:  I was looking for a keyboard that could replace my old mechanical keyboard that had been sitting in my basement for over 3 years now.   It is a little heavier than a mechanical, but still pretty easy to use.  My first thing was that it is a standard QWERTY keyboard, which makes it much easier to use with a touch screen or a mouse.  The LED light for the space bar is great.  There is no need to constantly worry about which keys are on or off because all the keys are in the same place.  A lot of people would like a backspace key, but since this is a mechanical keyboard it didn't have one, so the backspace has to be the only way to undo something.  I use a USB cable for it because USB is great, and it connects really easily.  And because it's a mechanical it's not as loud as a mechanical (like some) and it's easy to get used to the noise of a mechanical.  Overall great product and I can't recommend it enough!   Overall score 4.5   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

The other nice feature is that you can set up a phone to ring for you if you get into an accident and need to send an emergency call. The app does not require an internet connection, and the calls and texts are free to both parties." Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Great Buy   I bought this to replace a cheap knock-off   It's the only way   to   get   an   amazing   sound   for   £400   You would be amazed   at   how   simple and quiet   it   is   Even though   the price   seems   too   high   i bought it    for    £800   because   its   good   and   easy   control.   There are   many   better   cheap  knock off   all over the net   but   this   will   be my   best   purchase   as   my  friend   has it  1,800 hours ago  I'm amazed at how good this unit is. You will be surprised how it is in comparison to a cheap one. I've had it for about three years now. It still looks as good as new. The only thing I would like to see changed is the 'auto up', it automatically turns itself on at night when I'm not looking. I like the 'on when on' mode better. I have one of the newer models as well (also great sound). I recommend this product. Great value and great sound for the price!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I bought this after having my iPod 3G for a year and I am soooo happy with it. The quality and sound quality are amazing. Its a bit bulky for a pocket, but a small enough size that you won't have to carry anything with it either. The only thing I didn't like is that I wish there was a way to turn it off without needing to take the cover off the whole case. Its super frustrating that you can't just turn the device off. That is my only other issue with this device. But overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase! I would recommend this to anyone with a 3G iPod.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had the   iPad for a week now and I can see the improvements   over the past 7 years.  The keyboard is great for typing and the display is clear and readable even with light reading.  It's easy to use, has nice touch sensitive buttons.   The software is also very nice with all the features that you would expect.  I love that you can buy apps for   the  iPad (and   Windows 8),   that   is   not as good as the  iPhone.  But at the same time it's just the same   same  for $349. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for my 16-year-old daughter. She doesn't play a lot of electronic games because her older brother and I always get into them, but with this I got to be her first. I thought I would get something that she could get into without getting a headache or the gaming feeling because her brother and dad are all gamers. She can't wait to get her hands on some more of the different games. She's also gotten her sister involved in the fun. Highly recommended to others!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love the idea of an external USB charger for a phone but I've been waiting for this to come out for about 2 months now so this was a big deal to me. It's easy to use and plug in, it lasts the entire day even on a 3G connection, and it's pretty quiet in use.   The downside of this charger is that the USB cable is a bit short so you need to make sure it's long enough to reach the USB port.  The new iPhone charger is not the one I expected from Apple, the design is not as elegant and is a tad too small.  There is no USB port but instead this little dongle plugs into the bottom.  I don't really know how to use the little USB port and it is a little tricky to power off the phone but for $4 I'm glad to have it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is an excellent keyboard, but the USB is too short. I am an engineer and the USB interface was very hard to use when there was an error. Also I wish the space bar could be different colors and the function keys can be put in a different places. If you need a lot of keys with lots of different functions this is the keyboard for you. The keycaps are very well done. The font on the keys is nice and clean, and the keycaps feel great. The build quality is also good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In my book, the best thing about this device is that the only cables I needed to buy for it were the very expensive HDMI cables that I purchased off-the-shelf from the big box stores. The AC adaptor for the TV was very easy to install, and it just works! I wish the box came with a power cord. My computer works fine without one, so I wish it had one. I have only had it two weeks, so perhaps I'll upgrade it, but until I do, I'm really happy with this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm an ex-navy Seal who served for 19 years in the Navy. I was a combat engineer (combat systems, radar, sonar, weapons) and a field intelligence operator. I used the iMac for the bulk of my work. I've had it for two years and just recently put it to work (I was a Windows user from the age of 10). The iMac is as good as you'd expect from Apple: easy to use, fast, sleek, and looks good.   I also purchased an external USB hard drive because I want one on the go for when I go on business trips.  If you're a Windows consumer and you like using Apple computers but you need a USB 3.0 port on the side of your iMac, you're in luck:  With the external hard drive, I can run my Windows programs on the iPhoto, iMovie, and Garageband programs on my iMac while simultaneously connecting to the USB port on my external drive (to edit my images).   With the hard drive in, I have a separate display connected to the iGPU.  It's a small thing (though I love it!) but it makes my workflow a lot easier (even if I do occasionally do a whole lot of work on my MacBook Pro, the i2 screen is a lot better than that).  The iMac has some drawbacks, especially for gamers.  First off, it's a little sluggish with the external drive in (I can barely get it to boot up from a clean install).  Secondly, you can't plug a second USB drive into it to create a portable drive.  But if you're not an iMac gamer, it will still run some games well (including the latest Tomb Raider).  If you're someone who likes the look and feel of the i7/X7 but doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the Mac Pro is an excellent alternative.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this at a local Apple store and got it to replace a broken laptop.   As far as the features go I didn't have to do anything different to get the computer working the way it was supposed to.  The only complaint I had was the keyboard, the clickiness of the keys on the keyboard bothered me, but it does the job.  Overall I really like the product and would recommend it to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Product: Qi wireless headphones i listened to the sound but the sound quality is a bit disappointing.  I purchased the Wireless headphone (PY-1) for my 2 year old daughter to use as a second pair of headphones for her homework, she had always loved music, the earpiece of the headphones was clear but her ears had difficulty fitting into the ear cups. After listening to her, the sound was not bad, but the clarity of the sound with the pads was less than what the other headphones in the market had. The sound quality was very clear and good. But the comfort for my child's ears were not what I expected. The pads feel like a rubber like material and can be hard to get comfortable for an adult. It is also very loud for my kid, she used it for a few hours everyday, so the noise from the device was noticeable. I would recommend this product to a friend, I do not think she would like the sound though but would still use it. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The screen is beautiful in color, it is crisp and bright but not too bright as to make the display difficult to read at night. This is definitely a case of being in the right place at the right time but I didn't expect any less. The design of the phone is a little ugly but it seems well thought out. The fingerprint reader is a nice touch and the volume buttons are all very responsive. Battery life is average at best but I did get about 6-7 hours of screen on time before the battery was nearly exhausted. The phone has a nice, solid feel to it and the build quality is great. It feels very premium and premium phones are not cheap by any means. There is very little bloatware on this device, but it does add to the price. The software experience was very good on the Galaxy S7 Edge. I would say it is very comparable to the Galaxy Note Edge which is to be expected but it's a bit smoother and easier to navigate. The UI feels like an evolution of that and not a massive change. The stock Samsung apps are more or less identical to what is found on other flagship devices such as the Galaxy A/B/C/D/E/F but a few Samsung apps like S Voice and Samsung Pay were missing. Thankfully Samsung has added a ton of great apps over the past few months like S Health and S Memo that really make the software experience a lot better. Overall, I recommend the Galaxy Galaxy S6 Edge over the Galaxy Edge (I believe the S Edge is a re-branded version of the Galaxy Alpha), however, it really depends on your need for a phone that offers a nice large screen and a good amount of power. Pros: Gorgeous screen  Good build quality  Possibly the best phone Samsung has released in a long time Cons: Fingerprint reader is slow
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is pretty good. I have it set to a stereo setting. It sounds pretty clear. I used my own custom speaker with a sub. I like the way it can adjust sound from quiet to loud. I can adjust the volume down to a whisper when I want to listen to a conversation, or I can crank it up to the max volume when I'm looking for the next big hit. I'm not sure how well it will sound with other people talking. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. The only downside to it is that there are no usb inputs. Also the plastic casing has a little flex when it's not closed. So I would suggest you buy it with some padding to prevent scratches.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The M3xS is a nice little radio to have. Its small and light enough to carry around in my backpack. It's easy to use and the interface is easy to configure. My only complaint is that I don't use a USB hub for the radio because I don´t use that much the internet. But overall, I really like this radio. The PX4200 is also an attractive device. The design of the PX4000 is more elegant than the M3, though the M4000 doesn't seem to have the same range. I liked the smaller size and the good looks of the M4100. A very small, but decent, radio:  I would have liked an additional band on the M1000/M1600. There is a big radio on it (at the moment it is an M4200) and a big antenna in front of it. This does not sound like much but the range of this device is really impressive. Great radio with a large antenna on it, and the large radio is even in my car's glovebox:  The PX5000 is also a decent radio. It has the same radio interface (that you can use on a standard SDR) but it is a very compact device (for a SDR it is) and its range is fantastic. It will do up to a distance of about 300 m from your SDR. Excellent range for a SSTV device: You can get up to about 300 Mhz with this device, and you can get good results at distances up to around 300 M. You need a fairly simple antenna to get good performance:  You need a high quality SMA female antenna. The SMA connector is only designed to send out one signal, so you need to use a SMA male connector for the antenna. As it has the standard SSTB connector you will need to solder your own antenna. You can do this with a piece of tin foil. If you have an adapter that allows you to convert your SSTAB antenna to a standard antenna it should be able to give you decent results. The P500 is also good, but with the addition of a radio that allows it to operate at higher frequencies the P500 would be my favorite SDR of all. For a compact, fast SDR, the M400 is a good SDR:  Like the P5000 and M4000, the P400 is an

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received this as a birthday present and I am very satisfied. It is well built and well made. I have one of these in my studio and the only complaint I have is with the USB cable. The cable is a little short and the cable could use some tightening. I still use it because I like the sound but the cable is very short. I had to spend the extra money to get a longer one that works great. My other complaint is with how the headphones are stored. I wish they had an extra holder for the cables so they can be put away. I guess its a good quality device with a little extra money spent. I highly recommend the Audio Technica!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first got the Rokinon D-2 Rokkor the first thing I noticed was how good the viewfinder was. I don't like to complain about my equipment because I'm a photographer and my equipment should be good, but it does have some quirks. The viewfinder is small and the image you see there is a bit fuzzy. The picture quality is a little odd since it has a filter and no spot meter. I think the Roktron R2 does better on this part. It's also much more expensive than the D-1 and R2. So you can make the case for buying both, but I would definitely choose the R2 for a beginner's camera.  The Best Value in Micro Four Thirds: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using my new Xplore Pro for a few weeks now, and it is awesome! The Xploration Pro is one of those things that seems too good to be true at first. You may be thinking, "I thought all electronic devices were garbage." And you would be right. Electronic devices can be very dangerous. Just take the time to learn how to use them properly, and you will be glad you did. So far I have found the Xplorations to be excellent, and they have been very reliable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the KEF LS50 (a good amp) for my Sony MDR-7506 and am really pleased so far. The KEF design and build quality are excellent and the tonal balance is smooth and neutral. It has plenty of power and I had no problems connecting to my Sony, and it's also fairly comfortable to use. It's also relatively compact (easier to carry around than the Tannoy models). There are a few more features I'm still curious about. Maybe in the near future I can look into a second tube and add a power supply... a little more expensive, but worth it in my opinion.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the price I was hoping the sound quality would be good, so I am pleased to say that I am not disappointed. I was a bit surprised, to be honest, when I opened up my package to find the headphone jack and the speaker out. My initial impression was that the headphones were not very good, but that is no longer the case! These things are seriously good! I am happy to have them in my studio!    Review of DJM-PX200; 10-20-12; Tidal (USA); 10-19-12 by Tidal:  I have only just been able to get my hands on a new pair of Koss headphones.  I bought a pair of the PX200 in November, and have been using them a few times since then.  It is well built, and looks great with a nice leather pouch for carrying around.  These are much more comfortable than my old set of JVC K1000s, and they sound very good. I am very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Great product, great value, well made.  I have tried several high end electronic devices over the years, some very expensive, none are as good as the Pico 8 with the MicroSD card slot. I find that the PPC microSD card slots are a lot better quality than the SD slot on my Pico7 and PPC10. The SD card has a hard time in the slot. When the device is off the card will be slightly loose and won't stay inside the card slot all the time. When I connect the PICO 8 to my Macbook pro (2012) and it is turned on, the card is held securely in place on the PIC chip and it stays put in there all the times. The Pico8's video/audio output is better than the P2's on my other Pico series devices. I'm using a Sony HDX video recorder for HD movies and recording audio. I've found that the audio has no sound loss with the PCC5M HDMI out to my tv's sound system. I found that I get a better signal level on the LCD screen by connecting the video and audio cables together, not by having the audio in the case all the way. I am very happy with my purchase.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    What's it like?  We love the sound quality of this DAC. In my opinion, the SVS U3 is the best sounding DAC on the market right now. The amp isn't as good as the Polk Audio D1, but for what it is, it's still very good. It isn't a powerhouse, but it gets the job done.  The biggest problem I have with this DAC is that it doesn't have any sort of noise isolation. The SVS DAC is so close to the headphones that it almost creates some noise, which can be a big annoyance. .  The SVA3 can get loud. The volume is decent for a headphone amp, but you will want to turn down the bass at high volumes.    I'm going to give a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars because of the quality of sound and the price, but the U3 can't be considered a true masterpiece.   Bottom line: I recommend this DAC and amp if you are looking for the best value for your money. If you are new to audio and don't know much about amps, I recommend looking at the M1, M1X or M2. If your only goal is to get the best quality and quietest amp out there, go with the SVA 3 and just turn the bass down a little. If noise is a big issue, go for the M2, but with the added bass.   The sound of the U2 is great, and you will be hard pressed to find a DAC on this list that comes close. The U2, however, comes at a high price so if that's not what you are after, look elsewhere.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was initially skeptical about buying an external hard drive but when it arrived at my doorstep I quickly learned that you really can't find anything better than the one that came with my computer. It was just right, sleek and durable, and it is very easy to boot up (but not to an operating system).   You can also use the included software to manage the drive.   My only gripe is that the USB 3.0 port (used in tandem with the SATA 6Gbps connection) is very slow. The drive requires a lot of power to drive data and the slower the USB connection, the more likely I am to experience performance problems.  It's no wonder that Apple chose to replace the external HDD with one of their own design.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod Touch and iBooks are great devices.   I haven't bought anything else since getting these and I plan to.  My only negative is they don't last forever.  There are better and shorter lasting devices, especially for the price.  It's nice to have a phone that you can use when I'm on the go but it's also nice to be able to have all my music.  Overall it's a great product that does all I need and more.   Product was exactly as described and was in stock for an order of 4   One of the coolest things about being able to listen to music on the iPad is the ability to just plug your iPod into your computer via a Lightning cable (which is handy if you don't have a dock for the iPad).  You can even transfer your iTunes library from your computer to your iPhone via iTunes.  Unfortunately, this is where things get a little sketchy.  The device only charges when plugged into the computer (it's not a full size laptop like most).  This means that the only way I'm ever going to charge it is from an AC outlet.  I think that's a little strange because you'd think charging it while it's off would get rid of any heat, but I guess I'll have to find a way to charge the device while it isn't in use.  But let's be honest, charging while it sits on a table doing nothing is pretty stupid. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   You could buy a much better device, but you could do it for a fraction of the cost. My biggest gripe is the fact that the "firmware" update has to happen within the firmware update. It's kind of annoying that you can't just do a firmware update to the phone and be done with it. The other negative is that there is no headphone jack. For the price this is not an issue and would not deter me from buying this product. If the headphones were included I would definitely purchase again. Pros: Affordable. Good battery life. Can be used as a desktop PC. Cons: No headphone jack

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit was working fine on day 1, and as I use my PC daily I expect some delays in getting to work. I bought 2 of these in the hopes that the first would work for a while, and when I needed a PC it would work. As a result I have no complaints with it at all. The sound quality is the best I have heard from a laptop/PC combination, the USB ports are a huge plus.  Product Review: The Dell XPS 12 is a great buy with a great screen, very good performance, great audio, and a nice keyboard and mouse. I like the keyboard and track pad especially since they are both built right into the keyboard. You'll not find anything in a laptop like this in the market right now.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Good product at a reasonable price. It's not the fastest charger out there but it's not bad. I use it all the time and would purchase this product again.  I like this charger!   I've been wanting a better high-rate charger for a while now. I've never owned an Apple device or tablet, but had been hearing good things about this one.   I picked up this one about 2 weeks ago. As I'm a new customer I've ordered from Best Buy twice to get a review. I really like the box it comes in. It has everything you could possibly need to get started, and then some.   It comes with a charger with an included cord. This charger is so simple that I find myself using it a lot more than the older charging cables that are bundled with my iPhone and iPad. It also has an "extra" charger cord, which is a really nice touch. It doesn't come with a converter, but you can buy one that will work with the phone you're using it with. I was worried at first about whether I'd need one for my old iPhone 6/6S and my new iPad. The adapter that comes with this charger is very helpful, but I do have a USB-C to Lightning cable. The charging cable is also handy and I feel like it works well as an extension cord.

But I also have a lot of friends with old LG TVs which they still have for me to use. I use the LG HDTV at work. No complaints about the picture quality.   - I'm very pleased with the product and the way it works.  -   The image quality is very good. The colors and sharpness are excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my second Samsung smart phone. The first one lasted about 6 months. The battery is a little small, but it's a good size for a phone. I'm a mobile application developer so the small size of the phone is not a problem for me. I also don't like how the phone doesn't turn on when it's in standby mode so I have to put the battery in. If I just wanted a phone for browsing the web and texting it'd be fine, but this is an important phone for me and I'd like to have an SD memory card slot. This phone is quite a bit cheaper than the others. I would have liked a back up battery as the other phones have a 2A charger. But I've heard nothing bad about this phone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I don't have a problem with the battery life. I do not know whether it is because the unit is new or because it is not a new product. I bought it because I like the sound quality and thought the screen was easy to read. The unit came with a new remote that would have been a nice feature if not for the very large volume control. The remote has not been the same since I've had it. I did see that other users on this forum had been having trouble with the device. I found one other user's report where the remote worked for several months but then the remote stopped working. So it's possible that there are some issues with this unit that would be solved by the remote. I am hoping this remote is simply a cosmetic problem with my unit and that I will be able to use it in the future. The sound quality is fine and the unit can be plugged into a wall adapter if desired. My experience with the remote has been so good that I'm willing to spend the $20 on a better remote.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I bought the i5 for my Mac Pro, I had no idea about the power consumption. I've always assumed that the i7 would run cooler (no matter the fan), but it isn't. It does run a little cooler, but not by much. If the fans were quieter, it might be worth the tradeoff. For the price, I'm happy with this.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Bekat from Very cool! Very cool product and very easy to install and use. I have a lot of fans, but this one seems to be a good balance between noise and power consumption for the amount of fans that I have. Very efficient and great performance, as always, from my ASUS. The fan is a little loud, but I still have room for two of them in my setup. Very nice!  Customer Testimonials  This is a really good fan, I've got 3 of them, for my ASUS GTX 1080 SLI and the noise level is very much acceptable, I would say even low is good. The power consumption is ok. The only problem I have with this product is I have no chance to use it and see how well it works because of my son's school. That's why I ordered the Asus and not the EK.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really liked this product and I used the product all of last month with great success.   It can charge my iPhone from the back of the car without having to plug it in to charge it, it can charge the batteries in my iPod (no problem on my car's AC) and the speakers were louder and more powerful than my stereo (my stereo's were still great though).   The speaker volume is very high compared to my other car stereos, which usually are very quiet, and the sound is more like a full blown car stereo (without the amp) than an iPod car stereo. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had been looking into a new iMac for months, I was on my third one, but my current one wasn't good. I have a couple of others, and I was hoping to get a MacBook Pro, but iMac has more ports and has more features. Plus, I don't have a problem with the size. So when I found out that this Macbook Pro had just got released, I jumped on it. So far so good. It's a pretty good computer. The screen is amazing, and the keyboard is very easy to use. I've only tried it in one mode: the computer screen. The keyboard is a tad big, but that's what they're made for. The one thing that irks me about the iMac is the way that the graphics card is powered. It needs to be plugged into a power outlet, or a USB port in the wall. This is frustrating since I have another desktop that needs to run. This also makes the i Mac hard to get into and use. It really isn't designed to be the type of machine to take anywhere, it's meant to be a computer that you can keep at home or in your office. That being said, the i iMac runs the latest OSX which is the best that it's ever had, and if you like OSX you'll really love this. If you're on a Mac you're probably going to like this as well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I went to Walmart to purchase a laptop, I wanted the best laptop, but I also wanted a wireless one. I got the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 110 with Core i3 1.6GHz processor.  The computer worked well, I had an excellent experience using it.   I was a very pleased to use the laptop, it was really well made and I love that you can use it as a tablet. I would recommend the Lenovo Yoga 110 to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm looking forward to some of the new features of this product. I'm a fan of the Sony Vaio Z1 and also the new Xperia Z. I have used both and had great experience.   I'm looking forwards to some and the new feature. I've already used the Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) version and love it.  This review is based on a test version of the Xperia Z1, so it may be slightly different in the final product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:       The sound: The sound of the SoundMagic E30 is very good, a nice mix of bass and treble. If you prefer less bass, you may prefer the Audio Technica ATH-M50x (the most bass-forward of the two).   I do not hear a lot of distortion on this set, though. The soundstage is very wide and the bass has a solid punch. The treble is clear.   If you do not like the bass, or you want to use headphones, it's probably a good choice.  The sound on this is so good! The sound is very full and accurate. I have the Sennheiser IE6. The difference in sound is amazing. I can hear everything clearly from the middle of the floor to the back of a car. The SoundMagic system is very detailed and has plenty of bass. It has a good sense of balance.  The SoundMagic has the best soundstage on this whole list, which is odd considering the size of the soundstage.  As stated, I think the Sound Magic could be a little louder, the S/PDIF output does not have a low end, I would've been interested to see the low end of the SADiEQ (a very powerful headphone amp). The sound stage is very large and expansive, the Soundmagic is very flexible.   The mic: The Mic is a good quality mic and is a very small headset. It's not going to be your go-to mic for recording, but if you need a good one, this is a great choice. It does not distort and has a nice sound when miked.  To finish off, if you are looking for a good value headphones, this might be the right one for you. The Soundmagic E30 are good, but not amazing. If I'm going to spend the money, I'll spend it on something better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had my VX700 (model # 070BVX700) for a couple of weeks now, and so far I'm very happy. It looks like an electronic version of a VHF scanner. It also has a nice wide-angle lens and a good microphone/speaker setup. I use the VX600 and the V600R and they both work well. The only thing that's really missing is an external antenna for reception, but that's easy enough to add. It's also a shame the battery only lasts about 2 years, since I could have kept it on the charger for much longer. I bought it new in September 2013, so that's an average life span at this point. I love the idea of having a multi-band VHF/UHF scanner, and I've been using it for many years now. I can't recommend it highly enough.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great product at a great price! If you like the iPhone or other iOS gadgets I highly recommend this product.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect little device! I have been using this device with a Galaxy S5 since the day it came out, and it's my go-to phone for doing all of my communications online, with no issues at all! There's no data plan, and no more roaming fees, which are a big deal to me. The battery life is great, as I can go all day and do lots of voice and text messaging. The screen is brilliant, and I'm pretty picky when it comes to mobile devices, but this is the first mobile device I've ever found with the specs that will satisfy my needs! I also really enjoy the built-in screen saver feature, which is always a huge bonus. There are so many ways to customize this device to suit your needs, and the price point isn't bad either, considering the amazing phone you get.  If you are going to make a large purchase, buy it here at B&H Photo. I've had mine for just over a month, and as far as I am concerned, it is a great deal. I have a couple of suggestions: I'm getting a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ now, and would love if B& h offered that as well. If not, buy a regular Galaxy S7. The price drop on the S7 Edge is just a little steep. That said, if you're getting the Edge, it would be nice to get the regular S7, but if you get the Edge+, you're better off. Finally, the battery life on the Edge is a little disappointing, as it is on the regular Galaxy. I get around 20 hours of screen on time with this phone and it usually lasts me through the night. So, for what it is, this is a fantastic deal.  inb4 Samsung-ing your camera, but yes, you can, but no need. I'm really impressed with the speed of the update and app downloads. The phone is very speedy and the camera has the same photo quality as my iPhone 6S.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only thing I don't like about this device is that it's a bit bulky. It's a little tough to use, but with the right application it's amazing how well it works.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tanya from Best Bluetooth Speaker We use the S3 and really love it. We use it when the house is too quiet for other speakers and a lot of people use this for their kids and other people who play games with them in their rooms.  a little bit on the bulky side but i like that i dont have to worry about it falling over. if you have small children, this is a must have.  that's it!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   You're probably wondering why this was only on the top spot.    The reason is that the other contenders did not perform as well as I would expect from such a good deal.  If you have been looking for a good price-performance ratio, then these are a good choice.  This is one of the few products that comes with a warranty, and the parts fit great.  These are not cheap, but if you don't want to worry about a lot of junk on your phone, then you'll like these too.  The price may be a bit too high for the quality, but for a quality device, I'd probably spend more if it wasn't so limited.  Overall, they were not bad at all and the warranty may be the reason you'd get these over cheaper models.  My only complaints are the buttons on the phone are too small and the micro-USB port doesn't quite plug in.  A good place to get a charger: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased this device to replace the Apple Airport Express. I had previously purchased an Airport Express and while the screen quality on the Airport Express is very nice, this has an excellent screen, looks better, and has a better battery life. The speed of the wireless is extremely fast. It takes a little practice to figure out where to put it on your laptop. I did have the problem with the Airport Pro's screen that caused it to blink at certain intervals. I used an external monitor and a mouse so that wasn't a problem. It took some adjustment to get used to the wireless, but it's not a huge deal. I have a problem with it using the Mac App Store. I'm pretty sure this is to help Apple and not the Mac.

I have been using it on the road since it came out and have no complaints whatsoever. It has a full size HDMI port and is great for playing games or watching movies. The screen is excellent and has good viewing angles. It's a pleasure to use. I've used my other tablet in the same category and will continue to do so as long as it is on sale."  I have to say I'm very impressed with this device. I was able to spend the night playing a game on my Xbox 360, then going back to work. While I have my original iPad 3, this one is faster and more reliable.  It is very well designed with many quality features like a micro SD card slot, USB 2.0 port and an optical drive. I'm going to be buying a case for it soon. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've never had to replace an e-cigarette in my life and it doesn't disappoint.   I'm not the best with batteries, but I'm glad I bought this one because I think I'll have to keep at it to replace all the ones that quit on me.  The tank is great - it doesn`t leak, it fits in my hand so easily, and it even holds a light.  I was using a cheap disposable but it didn't hold enough liquid.  This one holds enough so I don`t need to put it in my pocket every day to refill it.  When I'm done with it I can go out to get a new battery and just put this one back on.  All I need to do is put a new wire in the battery holder and that`s it. I had to buy the one without the USB charger because mine was on a shelf and I didn't want to go into the store and buy it for a dollar, but in retrospect I wouldn't have done it without it. This one doesn't use any batteries, so if I'm out of juice I just put a little bit into my mouth. I also have to admit that I'm pretty good at it - I never get burnt or anything, so it doesn´t bother me at all.  It's also great for traveling and the battery life is good - I´m happy. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am really impressed. It's lightweight, very easy to use, and it has amazing sound quality. I'm very pleased with my purchase. Thank you so much.  Best headphone for the money I've purchased from Headfonic, the JH13HA (also known as the 'Ultra', 'Ultra 2', or 'HD650') is one of the best wireless headphones I've ever owned. Aesthetically, the design looks very nice, and the build quality is top notch. In fact, it's one of my favorite headphone designs. My only gripe is that you need to buy a special 'Hifi-Box' adapter. That's a small annoyance.   Build Quality:  5  I love how the JHS stands up on its own. It feels very solid and durable. The fit of the headphone is excellent, although I didn't notice much difference in isolation between my JH8 (Sennheiser HD-400) and the JHA, which I find a lot more comfortable. (Sidenote: I've owned the HD-800s for many years, and have been using them with my Sennheisers since I bought my HD800.) Sound:  I've been listening to the JHF since I got it about a week ago, and I must say I'm blown away. I have an HD600 in my daily use, so I can't tell you how much better the JHC is, but my opinion is that the HD650 sounds absolutely fantastic. I think the sound is better than the HD600's, and is closer to my own HD800 sound signature, with much less bass and bass boost. You could literally go play with the level settings on the JHD to get exactly the right sound for you. I would highly recommend the JF8 (or HD800/HD650) as the best headphone for portable music or gaming. Soundstage/Frequency Response:   I do not feel the JFH/HD600 or the JHP are great in the soundstage, although there is more presence than the JHM. Overall I'm extremely impressed, and will continue to use the JHK as my all time favorite headphone. Review Update:  Thanks to some of you guys for posting your thoughts on the headphone on Headfonics website.  The JHH13 is so easy to listen to. The soundstage is huge, the bass

I have used the Yamaha S series speakers with a Yamaha ATC phono preamp for a number of years. This is the first set I have had that comes in two separate units to be used as a pair. I am very impressed with the sound quality, with the included earphones being extremely good. The bass is deep and punchy, and the treble is smooth and clear. These are perfect for my home theater setup, and I have bought many sets from this manufacturer.

It is quiet and quiet when you have a baby to sleep on the bed. This is the first computer I've had that allows you to have your own print-outs and doodles and stuff on it as well. I have a laptop that comes with a printer but I prefer this one because it's easier to use. It takes a few seconds to set up the computer and you are done with it in about five minutes. It can do all the basic functions of your laptop but it allows you more control over it when needed. I use it to do my school work, homework, reading and playing games. I am very satisfied with this computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this unit for my 7 year old son, who was getting into video games. He loved the old Atari 2600 and wanted to own one, but he was afraid he might lose all his games on it. So, after a little research, I was happy to find one in my area. It works fine and has no problems at all! I am glad I got this for him.   My son has been playing games such as Donkey Kong, Pac Man, Frogger, Space Invaders, etc, but my wife does not like to play them and has said she cannot find any of them she has not played yet. I like the fact that it is on a PC or can be played on a computer. I am sure this would make a great addition to any family!    Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like this product   It is really good for the price   There are more and more products that offer USB to digital interfaces, but this is the first that I have used   The only drawback is that some of the connectors are not good, but nothing too bad   Good job    Good Value, Fast Shipping, Quality The USB to serial converter was delivered in a timely manner. No problems with the order. It's very compact and lightweight, which makes it great for the desk. I purchased the USB to Serial adapter for a computer I am building.  Perfect I love this product. The device is very easy to use and fits nicely on the desk or in the bag. I would like a bit of more color but I love the light that it emits. The only con I have about this product is that the USB port is not compatible with my Mac Mini. There is a "Portrait" USB to PS/2 Port, however I'm using this for an external display in a smaller monitor so the USB is not required. I also purchased a USB to Ethernet adapter from eBay which I use to connect my external USB. Very happy with this product, definitely worth the money.  the only thing that could have been different. the connection from the converter is a little to loose. but if you are careful this is not a problem. . Great product and the price is great.  it is a must if you have a computer to use as a network server and are connecting via ethernet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I've never heard of this before but i liked the way it works and it's very easy to use. It did take a couple of attempts but i was able to use it to make the lights on my house go on and off.   It does the job well and it has a lot more function than it's cost  It was easy to set up and the product works. It could be even easier if you had the right kind of battery. It was easy in the beginning but as you make changes you need to remember to plug it in. This could be a good starter if you don't want to spend a lot of money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i like the idea, but the build quality is horrible (i'm using a refurbished iMac), the screen is too small (and the resolution is too low), the battery life is terrible and so is the audio quality, and it's way too slow to browse. but, it's still great for a cheap, decent computer, and i have no regrets.  Rated 5 out of 5 by T.L from A wonderful piece of gear This is a great little little computer. It is small enough to have in a laptop bag and the screen size is ideal for a small screen in the backseat of the car. The speakers are great for movies and are the kind of thing you can't hear on the television. The fact that it has a full size USB ports and an SD slot on the back is just great. Overall a great purchase and a great value.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had this product for about a month now and have tried to use it every day for two days, and it was just too hard to press the button at the bottom of the screen. It takes a little time to find the button to use.   This was the only reason I am writing a negative review. This thing is hard to use and I'd recommend to only use it in a low lighting environment. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This product works pretty well but be aware of the software that comes with the computer and it will be a pain to use for some time until the software gets updated. I have a Lenovo Y520 and the software is very slow in processing my video and editing my pictures. The screen is also very small and in some instances will not work because of the small size. The Y510p also has a much smaller display. So if you need a small desktop computer with very good performance and screen you should look at the Y510m but be prepared to deal with a lot of software to get it to work. The computer is also not very quiet so be prepared for a lot more fan noise while working with it. Also beware that you cannot use a USB cable to connect this computer with another one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my phone. I know I shouldn't, but I just can't resist holding it. I don't want to replace it, though. The design of this phone is wonderful. The glass is the softest I've ever seen on a phone. There is no scratch or wear on the phone, and the back has a nice matte finish to it. Battery life is also fantastic, I've had it for about 7 months now. I keep it on all the time, but still have plenty left for the occasional use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I'm glad to see an affordable audio amp!   When I bought this amp I had no idea what to expect, but this is great for the money!  The quality is very good and the included remote is a huge bonus.  I can't even find a place to buy one in the states, so I was very pleased to find this one here in Germany.  This thing is a monster!  I've had it up to 4 hours at low volumes on my soundbar and it's still completely silent!  For its size it's very versatile too!  Highly recommended!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received the K-70 to replace my previous K-60. It does not compare with the 60% I already had, but for a good price and great sound it is a good investment. The K-series is very different than the K3/K3ii/K30/K20/K10/X5/K7/K4ii etc. The bass is noticeably more pronounced. The sound is clearer with better midrange extension. This is great as the K60's bass was not so clear in comparison. The treble is slightly smoother than the 60%, which is very nice. I would not recommend this as a substitute for an expensive K30. However, it is excellent for casual listening. The k-70 can also be used in a small portable set-up without the need for a separate amp. I recommend this if you have the money to spare and are looking for a new portable headphone to supplement your portable music setup. This is a wonderful device at a very good price. This may be a very interesting headphone. It has a very different sound signature compared to the K series of headphones I have, but they are good value for money and if you listen to lots of different music with different headphones, this could be a decent alternative to the bigger headphones I currently use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had many bad problems with my iPod that I got from Best Buy.    So I am very glad to have found an Apple Store to try out the iPod Touch.  I was a bit disappointed to find that it was only compatible with Windows (but MacOS was fine).   I'm a little concerned about battery life on a smartphone.    After using the iPod for about 2 weeks, I was able to get through about 8 or 9 hours.  But then the battery died about a week after that.  I will use the phone for most of my phone calls.  This is the best thing I've ever purchased!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have to say I am impressed. I have two of these now. I had bought an iphone 5 iphones, and have been wanting a iphONE for a while. I love this phone. The battery life is amazing. I usually take this on a plane and never have to worry about it dying on me. The speed is pretty awesome, I haven't had any problems with it. It takes amazing video and picture, and I love that it has NFC (with MST). The camera is great. You can make calls with this phone, and the screen is clear as glass. If you like iphONES, you will love the iPhone. The only problem I have is the phone is heavy as fuck. It doesn't feel as thin as my old iphOne. I don't know why but it feels a little flimsy. I also don't like that they have changed the volume buttons and the power button to the same position. This makes a very weird clicking noise when you hold the phone down. It also feels like the speaker on this phone is loud, but it is loud enough. Overall though, if you like an ikey or iphonest phone, you should buy this phone it's the best iphOOOo in this iphONO.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got my iphone 4 on 2/25/2011. It's still going strong. When I first got it, I was a little nervous about using it for the first time. It was nice to have the ability to talk on my phone while riding, but the battery life was about what I expected from my old iphones. I've been using it daily since.   One of the main drawbacks of using it is having to recharge it on the go. You have to carry around a charger. It is so simple to recharge a dead cell phone with an external battery pack like this one. I got the large pack as it holds enough charge to power the phone a couple of times.   and it holds a lot of charge, but my ike phone is the one I use the most, so it is my only complaint.   the device also works for voice mail and to have an internet phone line on the bike.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this because I'm a huge fan of the original EZ-Fuse, but was interested in an updated version of it for the iPhone and other new devices (such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 7). The new version of EZFuse has better specs, like a much longer battery life (and not as bulky as the original model), but I would still give the original a solid 8 out of 10. EZ.Fuse is an amazing little gadget! It's very easy to set up and it does exactly what it's supposed to, with very little hassle, but there are also tons of options that I would have loved if I had been more aware of the options when it came to software features. However, if you don't care about features or have no idea what you're doing with a new device, this may be the best gadget you can get in terms of power and simplicity.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This unit is a simple but very useful device. The power supply is not a problem, the unit runs on 120V AC. The unit includes a small USB cable that can be connected to a computer. I have an older laptop that could run the unit but I had to plug my computer into a USB port to charge it. The charger for the unit is quite slow as it takes about two hours to charge the unit. The only problem is that if you have a computer that can handle USB, you cannot use the included cord. I would have preferred a USB cable to use with my laptop that can charge devices from the wall. The other thing is that the unit does not charge any devices that are plugged in at the same time. My iPod, cell phone and computer all charge at the exact same time and they all run at the full speed.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Well Made, Reliable. Simple and easy to use. The computer works with a USB connection and it charges the device instantly. It also has the ability to automatically power down devices that run out of power. A Good Value I own the iFlex, a unit that is designed to be portable and lightweight, but the iWatts are more portable. The iWatt unit is well built, easy to maneuver, and works well. The USB cord is convenient, and the power supply included is well made. I also own the mini iWat. The mini i watt is very basic, but it works just as well as the iwatts. A lot of the reviews on these units are from customers who bought other brands. This unit fits well in my hand, with the battery included, but is a bit more expensive than the i Watt. Weighs about 2 lbs The unit is easy to operate, and can be charged from any power source, but I did not want to use a USB cord so I bought the battery, as well. There is no need to have a separate wall charger to charge your device since the i watt does that for you. This product will last a long time if it is used properly, since it can run on a wall outlet with no plug adapter.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The battery life was awesome and it was easy to use. I just purchased a second one to have for when I have problems. You guys really knocked it out of the park! - Brian B.  I like the way this works. I've had my Sony for a couple years now and it has had lots of use. The only problem I had was that it would turn on but not turn off, so I had to use the switch to turn it off. This works great and makes the whole experience less frustrating. My only complaint is that Sony says their charger is a bit on the heavy side, so that may be a factor for some users.  (Review of DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus with Smart Battery) I got the DJI Smart Battery pack a while ago and it worked very well for a week or two, but eventually the battery died. It did have one problem: it was too expensive. I had planned to purchase another one, but the price was right on Amazon, and I needed something that would last me until I got a new phone. After I got my Phantom 2, I discovered that the charger was way too powerful. It didn't last very long and I started thinking about buying a slightly smaller one. Now, it looks like I need a new battery pack! - Scott B.

I was able to get straight to writing without having to go through the steps. I thought I would try it for some writing before I bought this one. I'm very pleased with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new S8 was well packaged in bubble wrap. I just read the review below it and that may have been my fault because I wasn't able to make it fit.   So, after I took it out of the packaging and plugged it in and then used the included usb cable to charge the phone for a few hours, it felt like the phone was just sitting on the charger. After a while, my eyes and head started to feel blurry, so I took the phone out of its charger and tried it.  It worked and everything worked again.  The S8 works well with any mobile device with a usb cable, but it's really only suited for laptops and the like, with their smaller screens.  After plugging the phone into an old computer using an old monitor and a keyboard, it worked fine.  If you like to have a device that is always ready to go and that is easy to carry and move around, this is your phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I think this is the best of the devices I've tried for audio playback.    The sound quality and clarity are fantastic and you get the best resolution possible.  The quality is amazing. I use it with a DAT and the best quality sound I can get out of it is good enough for my work, but I don't have a computer so I can't test it with other programs.  If you're looking for a great stereo receiver I don't know what you can do better.  I like it so much I'm using it on a Mac mini as well!  My next purchase:  I'm going to buy a D-7 (5" wide by 1.2" tall) and a DAC.  These will be a complete system for me in terms of playback. I also have a Sony PCM-F55 (3" wide and 5.25" tall, same as this) and an old Shure SMH-112 (3.5" tall and 5" wide), both of which sound great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good, compact monitor. The display looks like it could be very good for multimedia, and the sound is very good. However, I don't find it very good as a monitor for a computer. It is simply too small to fit in a computer case. I have the same problem with my older Monoprice Monitor. The larger, more comfortable monitor fits in my computer case perfectly, but the compact monitor is not very comfortable. It also is too large to fit into my desk. I use a small stand to hold the monitor at a 45-degree angle, so that it sits closer to the edge of my computer, but it is still not quite as good as the Monopice. Overall, a good product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod Touch is a very useful and elegant piece of kit.   This thing's a beauty to look at, even in it's new non-slidey state.  I love the fact that I can choose how I would like to be represented.  The iPod Touch's buttons and the light-up function are great.  They are a bit on the weak side, but that's really no problem in this case.  This is the third iPod I've owned, and it's very similar to the one I had in high school, a lot like the Apple I's of the 70's, and the original iPod's of those days.  All three of these are still working fine as far as I can tell, and I can listen to music on them on my way home, or listen to my music at my desk while I'm working.  One more thing:    The sound quality is absolutely fantastic on this thing.  Not much better than the new ones in terms of sound quality.  It still sounds pretty good, but it's far superior.  In fact, the difference in sound quality was so significant, that I'd go so far as to say it's the best sound quality I've heard on any iPod to date.  The problem I have with the iPod Touch, however, is that it's too expensive for what you get.  As much as I'd love to buy a new one, I've already spent more than I would have to to get a similar unit that performs the same function, and costs about $25 less than the iPod.  There are plenty of other decent, more reasonably priced iPods available, but I'd have to say the iPod was the best value of any in my collection.  Another thing to consider, and this is a minor complaint, is the fact the iPod is now waterproof, whereas the original is not.  After using the iPod for a while, you find yourself reaching for the old version more often.  Also, the original has a headphone jack.  While I don't think it's a deal breaker, it does make you wonder about the quality of the original's headphone jack, so I wouldn't go out of my way to get that unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my third Sennheiser headphones (though my first two were Koss AK-112 and Nokton, respectively) and these are the best. I like them a lot better than the Noktons and the AK-101, and the sound is better, especially with the bass.   I have the best listening experiences with the Sennhesiers.   The sound is really good.  The quality of this headphone is great for a high end model, even though there is some noise in the bass (the AK-100 has the lowest bass of them all).   This is really nice, but I feel like there is too much bass - it's not enough for my taste. If you want a basshead style headphone, the AK101 might be a better choice.

I've received lots of compliments about my children.  Great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's nice, sturdy, and well-designed for the price. It has some minor issues, but it still gets the job done.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Tim from Not the best quality for the $$ If you have a few hundred dollars to spend on an e-reader, you want something that's durable and sturdy.   This Kindle Paperwhite is the exact opposite of that. It is extremely fragile.  I've dropped it a couple of times and the cover has come off several times.  It has also been a bit difficult to find a good place to plug in.   The Good: Good looks, easy to read. The Bad: Looks like crap on the inside. Not a fan of the buttons.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a fun toy for little hands, but I do have a problem with it.   For the first time, I could have used a lot more force on the "toys."   First, the batteries.  I have two "big" batteries in it. However, the charger is for the small battery.  When the batteries are almost depleted, the small one gets disconnected.  After charging again, it is good, but not good enough.  My wife and I don't use the vibrator at all except when she wants it to be quiet.  The other problem is the vibrations.  It is just so weak.  With a couple of turns of the dial, it was much better.  This would be a fine toy for a young boy or little girl, but a good vibrator is more than that.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:       I'm just getting to using my Raspberry Pi again! It's such an amazing device that it's hard to believe I'm using it so little time after buying it. I've bought the Raspberry Pi Zero W so I can start using it in more places. The only reason I didn't get the new Pi 2 was because of the price difference. This Raspberry Pi is worth every penny. I'd recommend it to anyone.      I bought my Pi a couple of months ago and I've got a lot of cool uses for it now. But there's one thing that's still on my wish list: I'd love a wireless USB adapter to connect my Pi to my laptop, tablet, or any USB device that uses an adapter like that.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A few days ago, I bought a new Dell Optiplex 7010-7010V laptop from a seller on Ebay. The unit came with a CD-ROM that had an Adobe Reader 6.0 (with Adobe Reader 7.0 in the disc). The computer worked well. I bought the laptop because I use Adobe Reader to view some of my old artwork that is on a separate computer. I have been using Adobe Reader in a way that does not require it, but if I ever wanted to read it, I would have to get a new computer (I am on my third Dell, so this might not be a problem, but I am not sure how the second Dell will go). I have used the CD-rom ever since. I was looking for something to do on my work desk. I am a software programmer. I need to download all of the Adobe software that is in the CD, and then run the programs from the CD. When I bought my laptop, I knew that I would not be using a printer. I thought about getting a new laptop but when I asked the seller about it, he told me that I could get a 3.5" floppy drive if I wanted to use the CD in the new laptop. So, I decided to try that out on the unit I bought. The CD-r is only 2.5mm wide. I used my Philips toaster and ripped all of my art out to a CD, so I can now have all of them on one CD. The computer has a 7200rpm CD-Rom drive. The first thing I did was read the first CD I bought, and found it to be an excellent read. I then proceeded to read the other CDs, and they were as good as the first one. The software I have purchased from Adobe, and the programs on the CD work perfectly. The only problem I have had was with one of the programs that was in my CD-R, but it was a very small problem. The program took a very long time to load, but after I had loaded it, it began to run, even with it loading every time I tried to run it. I could not find any other problems that I have encountered with the computer at all. I purchased the computer because I am using the Adobe Reader with a lot of the old artwork. I believe that if I get the CD reader to be a little larger, it will work fine. I would

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1.      My first purchase was a very large TV in the box, which I put in a cabinet in the basement and that is the only TV I ever watch with it.     2.       I am a fan of the design of the Samsung TV. It is very sleek and easy to set up.  3.   The sound is clear, accurate and crisp, especially in Dolby Stereo.  However, my audio is sub par for my normal listening.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was in the hospital last week with pneumonia, and when I got out I was so glad to be wearing this headset. It's a very comfortable headset with a nice sound.   There is a nice amount of bass to the music you play through it, and the headphones are pretty quiet.  The Bluetooth radio is not always on, but I'm pretty sure it does turn itself on every couple of minutes or so. I have not had any problems connecting to my laptop to send e-mails, but if I use this headset it is just fine.  I would say the bluetooth is very good, with very strong signal and no drops.   Good quality and features for price:  This is one of the better headsets out there for the price. The build quality is quite good. It has a very nice strap and the ear pads are very comfortable. You'll be pleased with this purchase.  A lot of people have a hard time comparing headsets, and this one is very comparable to the others, but there are some differences, so you can have a better idea of which ones to buy. I can say that this headset is more than good enough for most gamers out there. The audio is very clear and loud, so even on the lowest setting, you'll be able to hear everything.  This is a great headset to have for gaming.  It is a very good headset for the cost. It is easy to put on and take off, but it is a little bulky.  One of the main issues I have with it is that the headset button is on the back, which makes it hard to reach, but then you have to make sure that you don't accidentally press the button by accident. I don't like having to press buttons for such a small feature. However, it is very simple to program the buttons to different functions. I wouldn't mind having the button on the front as well, but the back button is better for me. I'd suggest that you go with the cheaper model if you're looking for a good headset to save money and not have to put much effort into it.  Overall, this is a good buy and will be a great accessory for all gamers out on the market.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a new Sony Xperia XZ1 (16.4-megapixel sensor), and it performs very well. It's more than adequate for casual shooting and movies, but in most situations, I found it to be a bit shaky.    The problem is that the camera doesn't shoot continuous photos. Even in the daylight, I would have to press the shutter button quite a few times before it caught the action.  Also, I noticed that the images taken with the camera weren't sharp.  This doesn't happen with the other Sony camera phones, so it's an extra annoyance.  However, the picture quality does improve a bit after a few minutes of use, but I can only imagine that in this particular application, this is a real problem.  The camera is very usable, even though it's not the best.  You can also play with manual mode.  The photos taken are decent enough, but not impressive.  A 5-star is very hard to give a device that performs this well, even with the best specs, that's about all I can say about it.  It's a nice device, but just not the star of the show.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's my second G5 and I love it!  "I was looking for a little more of an extended battery life on the G4s. So far, the G5 batteries hold up very well. I haven't had to replace one yet. I've had mine for about 3 months now and it's been fantastic. I didn't think it would be this great because the G3s was a little slower on the fast-moving apps, but I've been using it all day and the performance has been flawless. The camera is great, just like my G3. I'm happy with this product and will keep buying these. You can really do a lot with a battery this small!"  Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to add to my portable music player. There is an integrated amplifier and I prefer to be able to play CD/MP3 while listening to music through the integrated amp.  The sound quality is very good.   The included ear tips do help, but they're too small for me, so I use my ear plugs and have been very happy with the sound quality.  I did find the headphone jack very difficult to use (too close to the speaker), but for most people, it's not a big deal.   Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, August 14, 2015  Nice to have but not a must have  by Mark from Pompano Beach FL USA  Pros:  Sound quality  Integrated amplifier works well  Light weight  Cons:  in terms of size  Slim headphone jack  Overall: It is a nice looking piece of kit and I like the fact that it has the built in amplifier and comes with earbuds in case you don't want to use the amp. But for me it would have been nice to have a larger jack. The amp is definitely not powerful enough to drive my Sennheiser HD650's. It is powered from 3 AA's but I still don't like having to connect it all the way to the device. The integrated amp also has the disadvantage of making the headphone connection a little tricky.   Was it helpful? Yes (0) No (0), No (1)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    * I am not sure that the battery lasts as long as advertised, and the phone's audio is very poor, but I do like how it's small, light, and easy to carry with you.   I can't stand the fact that some manufacturers sell phones as a "good" price range, but then give the users the option of purchasing a "better" one for a higher price range.  It also appears that Apple has taken a little too long to finally offer an SD card reader, which will make the iPod much more useful.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:        I'm really impressed. The sound quality is good, but the volume setting seems to be set for maximum volume at the lowest volume setting. So, it doesn't really have that loud, loud, noise like some other speakers out there.   This speaker has a large (about 4") woofer and a small (2" woofer) tweeter, and it produces loud music with decent bass.  The speakers are designed to sit above the table or couch.  I bought these specifically for using in my den.  They sound great in my car, and I can set them up where I can listen to my music and still have the ability to adjust volume.  Some may consider this a negative, but I prefer to listen to music with good bass and vocals (without bass playing too loudly) and this speakers work great in that regard.  Another good feature is the speaker wire connectors.  Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who likes a good quality, loud speaker and can't afford a lot of money for them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i've been using this product since the day it arrived.   The device is simple and easy to set up.  It seems like it was well made, and I didn't have to buy any adapters.  I was able to change my battery on my  iPad by taking a piece of wire out of one end of the charger, and plugging the other end into an external battery.  The only drawback to this device is the   price,  and how long it takes for a charge to come.  That is not to say I am not satisfied with it, but it is a $50.00 purchase.  If I could get a better price for this product I would definitely purchase another.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this one and it is a very good buy   It is very quiet and very portable   i really like the battery life   its small but very capable of a lot of uses    Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from I think this is a great device for it's price point. This is a good device. It is small and light, easy to carry, and it has a lot for my purposes (a simple TV, a cheap remote, and some games). It's definitely one of those "if you can afford it, buy it" kinds of things. It's not very fast or powerful, so it's only good for playing games on my computer (which is not a gaming machine, but still) and for my TV screen. This thing has great value and I'm glad I decided to spend the money. I have no issues using it for my two main purposes. For the price, you can't beat it. For most people, it's a decent purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the last two years I have had this product for about four years now. For the most part it has worked well, with a few minor problems.   My last complaint is about the battery life.  For a computer mouse I expected a more extended life. The battery life is about 5 hours of mouse usage for a month.  I have to go on two hours of charging every two days.  The only way I know to get more battery life out of this is to put the mouse in my laptop and then put the keyboard back in the mouse.  All in all it works well and I will recommend it to my friends.  Rated 4 out of 5 by PajamaGuy from Nice! Great for laptop usage I love this mouse. This is my second mouse from Logitech, and they have been the best since my first. The quality is great, and it's comfortable to use. I use it on my laptop as well as a desktop. Its a little large, but its not as big as I thought it would be when I first saw it. I highly recommend it. I have the wired version and the wireless version. They both work great on my gaming laptop. The wireless has a little more latency and the wired mouse has more battery power. I also like the "backlight". It makes it easier to tell where the cursor is on a black screen. Sighs about the software. I am so sick of trying to configure the mouse for different programs. This mouse was supposed to be perfect, but it seems like most programs dont like the light to go off when I move it off. The other thing I hate about this mouse is that it just doesn't seem to be able to track very well at all. I can barely see my cursor and my hand is moving to the right side of my mouse. It isnt a major issue but it just makes me wonder. If it could track better then it should be a perfect mouse!  Review Summary: I've had the wireless Logitech Wireless mouse for about a week and have gotten use out of it. It has a couple of things that I don't like about it, though, the biggest one being the battery. I have used this mouse in almost every program I use, and have only seen about 5 to 10 hours of battery life, but that's just the luck of the draw. The mouse feels great when you first get it, but I would

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Best product I've had for about 3 years now. I have an old model Sony MP3 player that's pretty worn down so the MP3 quality isn't the best. I looked for some other mp3 players that would play my old mp3's. I've purchased a bunch of these little players and I've always had a good experience with them. My mp3 player is running at full speed and I can't believe how much memory it has. I had an older digital player that was going to expire and needed to replace it with this. I am glad I bought this item and I won't be buying another mp3 from any other company. I highly recommend this to everyone and I'll be buying more mp3 games and music players.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this to replace a broken unit for an electronic project. It does a great job with a wide frequency response and low noise. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of a volume control. I tried both turning the volume control and not turning it all the way down (not even as low as on the old unit) and it would still turn the volume all the same. I didn't mind the volume at all, but I do not think I'll buy it again.   - David C.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Posted by Dan on Tuesday, September 18, 2018 I used to be a huge Apple fan. As a teenager in the mid 80's, I used to spend hours on my Apple IIe, and that's when I really fell in love with this device. Back in the 90's, as I started working on computers I found that many of the games I had loved before were now out of print or out of date. I decided to create a version of some of my favorite games to create my own collection of classic gaming! This was the beginning of my lifelong love affair with Apple IIgs. I can still remember the day the first Apple II was released! There has been a lot of innovation since then and it's no surprise that the Apple II is still one of the most popular platforms today.

It was a hard to find item (only on sale, not on my preferred site), and in my search I was thrilled with the results. I ordered the 3.5mm to RCA adapter cable (with a power cord and a female adapter for the power cord) and was so pleased I ordered another one for my second audio interface. I bought this because of its light weight and low price, and also because it's a true USB connection to the computer. For my needs, this product met my expectations, and in addition, I'll be using this adapter with my digital guitar effects pedals.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is a very good quality product! You can't really go wrong with this one. The only thing I dislike is the size of the antenna for the device which is too small for the unit and is almost an after thought. The other thing I don't like is the fact that the button is a tiny bit difficult to get to and the volume and power buttons are too small to use as intended. So the best I can do is make my own. If you're in a rush and need a quick and easy setup, this is your unit. If it's your first time ordering from CNET, you probably shouldn't bother. Just buy a generic one or something like that and get it done right.  My two cents: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a professional speaker, singer, musician and writer.   My favorite electronic device is a Yamaha RD10. I don't listen to music all day long but I have to say that this is an absolutely amazing device. When I get off the road I usually play my RD10 with my iPod or a USB cable that is connected to a computer. I love the sound of the RD10, the low end is crystal clear and I can't imagine having to go to a CD player when I am traveling.  The best thing about this device is that you can connect your computer to it through a 2.5mm jack.  I highly recommend this device and if you are looking for a great device that will last you a long time and still sounds great, check out the RD-10.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using this as my daily laptop for a few years and it never disappoints. The keyboard is nice, the touchpad is very good and the keyboard itself is light and comfortable to type on. It was only a few weeks ago that I was able to get a new motherboard and RAM because I had just bought a refurb copy from another store, and it still runs like a dream on this computer. I am a heavy PC gamer and I can now run Crysis 2 on high settings at around 35 FPS without any lag or the slightest lag in general. I was actually kind of worried about it having a hard drive because I knew I would want to upgrade to an SSD, but I never was able and it is still very fast and it feels really good to type so fast. I have had no problems whatsoever with the software and I love the ease of moving between different operating systems and languages. I highly recommend this computer for anyone who wants a good computer for the price and has never had a problem with it.

When it arrived i connected it to my mains to see the function it was designed to do, it seemed to be working well.  I had bought the 1 metre cable but i found it easy to plug in to my sockets because the plug was very smooth.  The 1 metre cord is quite long for a 1 metre plug i have used it for a few months now without any issues.  Overall good quality and a good value for the price.   Rated 5 out of 5 by JB from Easy to work with, works for us Well made, compact, well designed product, worked perfectly for our needs, no issues at all.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The SONY E Series is an excellent choice. I purchased it after buying a K10. This is the best K10 I have ever owned.   It has a good sound quality that can rival some of the high end audio products I've been able to purchase from other companies. It has great features like multi-channel recording and stereo inputs. The only drawback is that it is heavy and I'm sure the battery is a big issue.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from The new KX1000. Amazing Sound. The new Sony KX-100 is an amazing piece of gear! I bought it as a gift and am very glad I did! It sounds great with great bass. It is built like a tank. A true gem and a great gift.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:       Excellent, I am happy with my purchase. Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device   I bought the NEX-7 to use on a trip that we are about to take to Costa Rica, and so far I love it.   Its lightweight, very easy to use, and its battery life is great for a DSLR.  Also it has an extremely wide angle lens so that we can do great detail shots of the Costa Rican landscape.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I bought this product on a whim because my wife doesn't like anything that is electronic. She is a huge fan of music and has always been able to enjoy it in a more "natural" way using her hands. This is a great product, it is very compact and holds all the things you need to do such as a turntable, cd player, iPod interface and speakers. I love the "vibration" you get when you push it together and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves music or loves their hands. It's perfect for my needs as I use my hands to play music but my wife still loves it. I bought this because my "dorky" friend who is always trying to do it with her hands and doesn't really want anything electronic (he's a fan of her favorite band, of course) wants me to try out a new "thing". This is perfect, and I'm sure if someone like me who is more of a traditional music lover tried it, he would totally love it, too. Thanks to "TASCHEN", for making a very high quality, practical and easy to use product that is also very affordable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    " I like the screen. It looks good on my laptop and works well with the keyboard. However the software is buggy, sometimes the cursor freezes up, sometimes it just doesn't show anything. Also there is a lot of "click here to delete it" or "click there to edit it" type stuff. Some of that stuff is OK, but some of it is just annoying. Other than that, the sound is ok, it's not a lot better, but it's OK."

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the only device i have found in my 20 yrs. of buying and having one   ( i bought another brand from another vendor for $12.00)    I have owned a number of different radios and receivers   It has been the only one to work for me,   With the exception of a couple of cheapo cheapo units i bought years ago from the local radio shack ( the "D" and the "B" series) i found this unit   very  well built   easy to use   the only problem i have encountered is the battery life   it is not that big of a deal   after about 20 years of buying i am only about 5 years into this unit.   but it really isnt that much of a problem   just replace the batteries with new ones once a month   and the sound quality is great   my only complaint is that i wish they could bring the unit back   one thing i would like to see is a wireless option   that would allow you to talk on your mobile device on the air without turning your radio on   its so convenient having that option 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the first version of this for my son and it was good, but after 2 months the light turned on/off frequently, not on all the time, and he found it a little hard to use (he was 4 years old). The second version was improved and I am now using it for 4 yr old daughter. Very pleased with the electronic toy, easy to clean, and a great feature (like the other reviewer) is the battery recharger. Would recommend it to any family.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    -   I bought this item about 2 months ago to take my computer away for a week, so it wouldn't get damaged in the plane. The unit is very reliable, but you have to do a lot of work to get all the wires to fit correctly. You'll also need a special tool for the "polarity" screw, as it is a tight fit.   In my opinion, the P4 is a nice device and is very flexible. My problem is that the connector that holds the power cord to the battery pack doesn't last very long.  The problem: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love the convenience of the tablet/smartphone! You can use it for studying, reading, media, and anything else I can think of. I'm a college student and use the device as a research assistant in my classes.   My biggest complaint about this product is the battery life. It usually lasts a good hour, but I often get 2-3 hours. If your using it for extended periods of time, be sure to set the timer.   A great product at a great price! This is the best tablet that I've found. It's easy to use and has great features.  I am constantly using it, which is great.  If you do buy this it's a MUST have!  .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to replace my older computer which used an old fashioned CRT, the sound was horrible and the display was unreadable, even with an LCD monitor. The video games were terrible, with terrible graphics, bad sound and horrible controls. The battery lasted 3 days, maybe 4. The phone rang and went straight to voicemail. I got it because of the name of the company and I knew it was a good product, but I got a much better computer. I had to buy a computer as I wanted to upgrade the old one, this did not happen.   The old computer was too weak for me, and the LCD did not display anything on it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am currently using an old computer I got as a gift from a college friend in 1985.  It was a B&W with a CD-ROM drive, and I installed Linux. I have had Linux for a couple of years, and have been using it ever since.     I've had the Linux CD in my system since then, and my computer still works.  The laptop is in another room of my house, and the Linux computer is usually sitting on the couch in front of my old CRT TV.  I have read that Linux can make the PC faster, but I don't know if this is true (I have been running a Windows PC for years).  I will say that I am using the Linux system for a day job, and that I use a Windows program to manage the Linux files.  The desktop on my old computer has Windows Live Photos (Windows 7) and some Linux programs.  A nice touch is that the Windows Live photos are "compressed" in a way that makes them appear as stills instead of full-resolution pictures.  When I move my old Windows laptop to another room, I'll still have a Linux PC.  I was recently reminded about this by my son, who brought his new Lenovo laptop.  Apparently this is the newest model, so I guess it will work on my laptop too. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The IEM has an excellent sound.   I have a lot of expensive speakers that sound better, but this one is good enough that I listen to it.  I am not going to buy any more if I am a one-hit-wonder, but it is good.  The battery lasts at least a couple of hours, with music played on the highest settings.  Overall I'm very happy with the sound. I'm on my second pair of these. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The VVX-1000 is a small but powerful audio system for a tiny speaker.    It delivers a huge amount of sound for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My Kindle is my daily work-horse. With the "smart" feature, it can help me write or read at work by providing the information I need.   There are a couple things that would make this product better:  First, I would like to see a backlight that is not very bright. It is very difficult to read at night with this light.  Secondly, I am not very sure about the durability of the rubber bands around the buttons and the case, but I guess that is the price to pay for the convenience of the smart feature. Overall a good purchase

They are light too and i love that. I am a sound engineer for radio and TV and the Q8 are the next best thing to studio monitors. Great value too!   The only thing i think is a little annoying is the volume control but for what the price, its a fine speaker.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The price of the device is cheap, especially if you get the larger size.  It is very well constructed and a very good buy.   Also, I've noticed that it is very quiet while running.  If you don't have any problem running it with the built-in speakers or headphones, then it is a great buy.

It's also easy to use and doesn't require a lot of technical knowledge. I can replace a battery in the unit (which is really convenient) without too much trouble. It takes me about 15 minutes to change a battery. Overall, it's the best product I've found, by a mile.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought these earbuds a couple months ago and I LOVE THEM! I live in the cold so I'm always on the move. I love that I don't have to plug my phone in or use the cord to keep the phone charged or my iPod charged. The buds work great for my ears and are comfortable. I wish they came with earbud protection but they didn't. It's good if you don't want a bulky cord.   Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, August 01, 2010  by a Customer from Washington DC USA  Review: I bought the Sennheiser HD555 headphones at my local RadioShack and when I went to pick them up, the store assistant said they were a little overpriced considering the high quality of the product. I asked her if I could get something better for the price but she laughed and said "No."   Well, when I came home I did my research and found these Senns at a much cheaper price. I have two sets of these and both are working great. I would definitely buy again, but if I had to I would go with the HD-580 because these are just not as good.

I like how easy it is to switch the picture to a higher quality.  i think that with the newer products, you can't just put a picture in there and be done with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great device for a lot of uses.   It really is a nice little device.  I really do wish the batteries lasted longer though.  My batteries died on me a month in.  That was a real shame as I use this for a couple hours a day.  It's a bit heavy but you can see the size of it very easily.  Also, the screen can be a little bit dim but it's still a great screen.  Posted by mikey at 11:11 AM

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased a new Dell Inspiron 14r laptop with an Intel core i5-3210M.  The system itself was nice, and the display was really nice for the price.  But there were some problems with it. First off, it came with a very cheap set of monitor legs that were only able to support the monitors.  There is nothing worse than having your laptop's display fall flat in the middle of a computer class trip.  I ended up replacing the legs with a set of stand legs that are much higher quality, and I am happy with the way they work.  It also has a very large weight, but if you are using it on the couch, then there are no real issues.  Now for the software.   For the most part, all of the software on this system works well.  Dell's "ProCurve" video driver is good for the most parts.  For a professional class system, it is good.  Most of the other programs and the drivers on the system all work well. The one thing I wish were more intuitive, is that there is no built in calculator.  That is why I use a program called "Calc-o-Graph" which lets me set the date, the time, and my weight to automatically create a calculator. This is very handy, since it makes it easier for me to track my weight.  In conclusion, I really enjoyed my system, and have very high hopes for the system going forward.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received a Sony PN-F9 as a part of a gift exchange.   This was a good replacement for my old NEX-7 which ran so hot it overheated.  The body is a bit thicker but it feels great and the buttons are responsive.  I still have the original black plastic version so that is a nice touch.  It's an electronic camera so it has a few limitations in that area.  However I found it easy to use with the included manual controls.  Battery life on this camera is pretty good considering its size.  Also the battery pack that came with the camera had 2 batteries.  Unfortunately it does not come with an accessory battery which is a shame since there is no external power port on this unit.  This camera does not have the ability to do continuous shooting or panorama shots.  All of the photos I have taken so far have been single frame.  Sony does have a nice wide angle lens and the autofocus is excellent but it's still a Sony.  So overall this is a good camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my iTouch 2.0. I can easily send a text message from it, make calls, and it works fine on my iPhone. It doesn't have a web browser but that is an afterthought because I don't want to have to download a web page. I love it.  Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: Michael - Verified Buyer I just received my iTou 2.1. I was a little nervous that my first ever DJ iTouch purchase might not be perfect, but after several weeks of heavy use, and the great feedback I am receiving from my friends, family and fellow DJ/Mixer/Live performer friends, I am impressed with the ease of use, functionality, and performance of the iTouch.   The iTouch is not the most elegant solution I've ever used, but it does the job. I am an avid concert-goer, but I always have to walk to the concert (and sometimes even drive) to get the perfect mix of sounds to give to my band. I thought that DJing with the iTou would be a great option for me, but alas, I can't really use the iTouf to play records, but that's okay, I just put the tape and a CD of the track on my iPod for the show.  , but at this time, it would take a little longer for a perfect mix to come out of the mix-down section on my iTouf. The iTouch's main selling points are that it has a wide range of recording levels, that the buttons are very easy to use, that it takes advantage of a large number of features including recording and looping, the built-in CD player, and more. The only thing I didn't like about the iTook is that it only works with iOS 5.0 and higher, but this will be easily fixed in the future.  the iToup is a great mixer!   Great product, very easy setup and works fine.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received my Nook Color last year and I am very happy with it. It is a great little device and easy to use. The color is gorgeous and the interface is so easy to navigate. I have an e-reader of my own and prefer the simplicity of this e-Reader. My only complaint would be that there is no way to convert e-books to hardcover. I think that the $24 is a fair price for such a device.   I was really surprised by the speed of this device. I was using my NOOK Color yesterday and now it is a couple hours later.  My next thought is to get the Nook Glow Light.  In the meantime I plan on downloading some books. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iWATT is a great little device that doesn't require a battery charger.   I've used it with a car battery and it can give the average phone a good workout.  The battery lasts well over a year and can give an iPhone 10+ a good run for its money.  At the time of this review, it's one of the cheapest charging stations on the market, but you can pick up a new one for $1 on ebay for under $1 (not bad if you know what you're doing).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The ZX Spectrum was a great game console for a small budget.   (I had the Spectrum as my first computer, and my second. The Spectrum still is the only one I can ever remember having a real need for when my first one was dying.)   You could even play games on it while it was in the pocket when you weren't at home.  The games were pretty good, but not the best I've played.  My favorite is probably Star Search - I really want to play more of them!  The only complaint I have about the Spectrum is that the color of the screen sometimes washed out - especially when it was dark in one of the computer cabinets.  (Which can happen in a few cabinets in the dark in the middle of the night, when the lights were turned off for one of those computer cabinet parties.)

The phone can be charged in 30 minutes and is fairly slim and light, which is great for travel.  The phone has a great camera and the audio quality is amazing.  When I first got it, I thought that this phone would only last a year or two, but in my experience, they don't make any of these phones that are good for more than one year.  So, I bought a Moto G for my wife and daughter. The battery life is great. It was great for going out to lunch and having a cup of coffee.  This phone would have been great if it was a little heavier, but that is the point.  It is a really great little phone.  A good battery and good battery life.  Overall, the phone is great and is worth every penny.  - David M.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A very simple and easy to use device, it is also very reliable, no problems ever. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a simple, reliable and small device for their home entertainment or music use.    Rated 4 out of 5 by russ from Good little gadget I have a pair of the iBook G5's, the ones with Apple logo, and I find them easy to operate, with a great UI. The iPad Mini is much less appealing: it is big, heavy and heavy-handed. Its display is dimmed. It has to be held up in a horizontal position, and the screen has to face away from you. And it does not provide any sound...only speaker - the speakers are in the back of the device, and cannot be heard. The screen brightness and contrast are good. But, the lack of a keyboard, and keyboard cover make it awkward to use in tablet mode. For this reason, I would not recommend this tablet for use on an airplane, or in a public setting, because of the poor visibility of the screen. You would have to hold the iPad Mini vertically, with one hand - and hold it with the other to get it to focus on the screen, as it's too big to hold with two hands. I'm sure the iPad will work for most, but I wouldn't recommend it to the very few who want a good, thin, light and portable device.  The reviews are always so mixed with reviews of the iPad Air 2. I wanted to see if I could get a different perspective. I own two of these tablets (a 10.5" and a 8.9" ). The Air 2 is thinner and lighter. The display is more vibrant. It uses thinner and more efficient batteries. They are both excellent products for a price. The 8.5 is the better tablet overall with better battery life and a better screen. They both work great. I bought the 8.8 because it was the cheaper option. The 10.1 is great for watching movies. It is more powerful, with better camera features, better camera handling, better sound. For general use, the 8" is better but, for video playback, it's very close. I use a computer. The 8.6 works great in my computer. It's lightweight and portable but, is not as responsive. If you are looking for something for general use (like reading and watching videos) then

I tried everything from different batteries to different batteries and a bad battery. I never know what is wrong with it. But one day it turned on, turned on and it works great. I do have to turn off the car before charging it. My only wish is that I get a better color choice. So far I have been pleased with it and I know there is a lot more out there, especially for the price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    (the new iPod Nano, which is the most portable and useful I've ever seen)   "I was a little nervous about the iPod Nano, considering that Apple has introduced a new class of music player. I was pleasantly surprised by how easy the new iPod was to use. I am not a music enthusiast by any means, but I was amazed by the quality and convenience of the nano and the iPod. I have tried to listen to MP3s from my phone to my MP3 player, but it's just too cumbersome to keep the phone next to the MP3 Player. It's not a bad player by any stretch of the imagination, but for its price and features it's much better than my iPhone."   Note: This review is for the iPod nano, model number "iPod Nano Mini", available in black or white. The original iPod nano is the original model. The iPod nano's size is the same as the original iPod. (The Nano is not compatible with the iPod shuffle or shuffle+, or iPods that use the mini or nano connector.) The iPod Nano Mini has a 1.5-megapixel camera, and it can support digital music in CD-quality MP3 format. The nano comes with a USB cable. The Nano has no flash.   I also like the fact that the nano is small enough that it does not interfere with my iPod shuffle.  Note about the nano's microphone:  Some audiophiles consider the microphone on the nano to be too sensitive to the sound of nearby noise, and that the noise-cancelling feature makes it a poor choice for general listening. I've found that the microphone is good enough to be useful, if not quite good enough. It does a better job of hiding your voice than my iPod's headphone jack does. (It's only marginally better than the iPod's audio jack.) A microphone should be placed near your mouth so that you can hear your voice in noisy environments, not far away from your mouth. I found the microphone's sensitivity to the volume of a small crowd or car to be acceptable.  If you're not sure whether a particular audio device is sensitive enough for you, try plugging it into the iPod, iPod nano or your iPod. Check the battery level, and make sure the device is turned off and resting against a hard surface. Some devices have a built-in battery indicator; others use a battery light. A battery light should be on the
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sound: The noise levels are much lower than the K-5. It has less bass but still plenty of volume to satisfy anyone's needs. The sound is better than a lot of my headphones. It is not a dynamic headphone, but it isn't bad either. The bass is good and well defined without being overly boomy. I was happy to use it in a loud environment such as a party or even while on a bike. It can really give a little extra volume for gaming or a movie while not sounding too sibilant. The midrange can be a bit lacking, but not too bad to compensate. It isn't really something that I would want to use to listen to songs. Overall, the sound is good, but could be better if it wasn't for the higher noise. Overall:  It is a good, solid, and affordable headphone. They sound good for the price, but I will say that it will be tough to get used to the sound due to the low bass and bass that sounds a bit too boomy in some cases.   I recommend:  If you are looking for a good sounding headphones for a really cheap price, these will probably be your best bet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a really nice and small computer, but I have two problems: 1.    2.  It's really heavy, and because it's so small, you have to use a lot of force to turn the screen. If you're using it on your lap while you're eating dinner, you'll need a lot more force than you probably need.  As I mentioned in the video: I'm still learning how to use this computer.  You'll notice that I'm getting a lot done with the computer, and that's mostly because I'm using it for web browsing.  I have been having a lot trouble with the app itself though.  Right now, I'm really just going through the tutorial to see if I can understand it (and because I've been able to use it with a laptop computer).   I've gotten good results from the tutorial and I still need to spend some more time on the app before I can comment on it's usability. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is a great product, good quality and very nice. The size is the best, I got the 14" model and it's perfect. I really don't need the flash, but it makes me happy with the size.  I bought this with my D700, and I have to say I am happy with this purchase. My D700 doesn't have a flash, so I bought this to replace the flash on my D70. It is easy to install, the flash is very bright, and it works great with my body composition setup. The battery life is great too, it will last me a very long time. I do wish that the battery was a little longer but for the price and quality it's a great buy  Great product. I've used this with a variety of lenses. The auto function is nice because I can set the exposure as close to perfect as I want. The manual is good too because it gives you control over how fast or slow the auto exposure is. Also, the battery life has been great.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Pros: This is one of the nicest and most comfortable earbuds I have owned, and they sound amazing. The noise canceling is good, the sound quality is outstanding, and the battery life is great. The design is beautiful and fun. Cons: The bass doesn't sound natural when used with some music genres, and it doesn't have the range of quality as I had hoped. However, when paired with a better source (I use my iPod while listening to heavy metal), the bass is fantastic. Overall, a great buy for those who want great quality at a fantastic price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The Bic Micro 3 in a Micron was amazing. It is by far the best portable mic I have ever used. This thing is just as good, if not better than the $400 ones I was using, and you can't beat the battery life. I had to buy a backup battery because this one lasted 4 hours on one charge, and my regular portable batteries only gave me about an hour." (May 2008)  "The BIC Micron 3 in Micron works well, but has several shortcomings that render it a poor choice for audio. It has a very limited dynamic range, which limits the quality of recorded sound. The frequency response can be as low as 40 Hz. The sensitivity is average at 1.0Vrms, but not so good at 4Vrm and lower. The mic is a very big, cumbersome unit to carry and handle. It doesn't seem to pack a whole lot of power and is relatively noisy. The Bic has an onboard mic preamp which is very useful when recording with other instruments, but is somewhat lacking with a guitar." (July 2004) 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     "This is an amazing product. I had an old VCR, but the interface of that device is horrible. I was going to get a good one, but this device looks like a better interface." "It's an excellent little system with great functionality for the price. I use it to record songs and have found that it's a good choice for the purposes of keeping an audio recording. The only con I can think of is that it is quite sensitive, particularly around the volume knob. If you turn the knob too far up it'll sound too loud or too quiet, just as you would if you were using a more expensive product." I've bought many audio cassette recorders, and I don't see this device being out of place in a home or office. The compact size is also quite attractive. I'm an audio engineer, so I'd like to thank Jody K. from Laconia, NH for taking the time to provide me with feedback on the VCR Plus. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first purchase from this company and I'm very happy with my purchase. My only disappointment is the "smart" indicator lights are a bit bright, but once I turn off the light, the indicator comes to life. I was also happy to see the display is more compact than what I expected. Overall this is a very nice product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1-8-3   A. The first thing I noticed when setting it up for the first time was that the power supply works, it is very small and looks very elegant in design.   I was also impressed with the fact that you can connect the USB to computer cable with the power adapter in the back of the tablet.  9.8/10   The second thing I liked was that you get an adjustable brightness.  It's very bright, I can adjust it by twisting the light, and its good, if you don't want it bright.  The first time I did this I noticed that the screen wasn't bright at all, then I used my finger to push the power button until the screen became very bright. I have to admit I was amazed that there wasn't even a problem in using this.  I had heard about it before but hadn't ever tried it until now.  A few of the things that could have been improved upon are that the camera is a bit wobbly. The picture is not the best, but that is the only thing that I can think of. Overall, I would definitely buy another for sure. 8.5/10

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - - - I think the battery life is really good for the price, but I don't think it's really worth the hassle, especially when you can get a good deal on a more powerful charger. I like the buttons and I think a larger and easier to use case would make things easier.   I bought it to get more time watching movies. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was hoping for a better product. For my purposes, it performs perfectly. I can use it in my office, on the go, and anywhere else. The sound quality is fantastic and the buttons are very responsive. I've had many times when the mouse had been out of battery and was not responding to me. The problem was with the charger. I have a large charger which usually lasts for a few days of use. The charger lasted one week and then it had to be replaced.    I'm very happy with my purchase!   A great mouse that is easy to use and durable.    My new mouse:  I can't say enough about the quality of the mouse. It is my second and I still use it even after getting rid of my first mouse. I like that it comes with a rechargeable battery pack and that it's so easy to adjust the speed and sensitivity. I was surprised to find that the battery doesn't seem to degrade in size. The mouse is not light and the weight is a little on the heavy side, but it feels like a mouse that I can actually use.   I have used many mice in the past, but this one really has won me over. I'm also looking forward to trying other mice in a similar size/weight.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In the first place the size is great.   The battery is also a good size.  It has a button to turn it on and off.  The buttons are located where they are supposed to be.  As far as the build quality goes it is good.  There is no wobble or flex in any area.  A good thing about the buttons is that they are flush with the side of the device.  This is great because I find it annoying when the buttons are on the side.  Overall I am happy with the device because it is portable and has a great battery life.  I would recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Excellent replacement for broken cell phone, can't beat that.   When I first got my new device I had the old one so I was in the dark as to what the differences were between them. I put them together and have used them as my primary phone since I got them. The battery life is really good and they fit my hand so well. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because the screen is a bit small and does have some grain to it. It is very easy to use with my finger on the side of the screen and I like that it is not too big to have to hold the phone and type on it. I got the black one and it is black and works well with my dark background. You have to know that it will take a good 2 days to charge but for the price it is hard to beat. I am very satisfied with this purchase.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was like the "wow" moment I was waiting for. I used this product as my "sensory assistant" for reading, writing, and doing math. The unit came with a very fine stylus, which I think is extremely nice. I also really like the volume control on this device. I am a pretty easygoing person, but it was extremely distracting trying to get any sort of focus on what I was doing. I really love this product. I would not recommend it for a person that is very focused and wants to read in public. I have yet to try to take the unit out and use it in the bathroom or a bedroom or any other places that I think I would need it, but I do plan on getting it to try that in the future.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Jcgraham from A++++++! Love this phone. I don't have a ton of expensive gadgets, but have been very satisfied with the Galaxy S4. There is a great selection of apps (some free, some expensive), plus the phone's camera and performance are awesome! I can't imagine buying any phone that didn't have this!  Customer Testimonial: It's hard to say anything good about a product you've never tried, but I can say I love the phone! The battery lasts for years and I don in my work all day without charging and don't need to recharge. Plus, I have a huge selection of great apps on there to keep me company and it looks like it will last me forever. This is easily the best phone I have ever owned!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of the best gadgets i've ever owned. i have had my first i7 machine and this thing is like nothing that i've had before. it has been so much more enjoyable since i bought this than i thought it would be. i would buy another of these as soon as my computer's is repaired.   My first experience with an Apple product, I am extremely pleased:  I have been using my MacBook Pro since it's launch in 2013. I'm not really a desktop PC person, but I do work as a software developer. I've always loved having my MacBook pro as a work machine. The Macbook pro is great to have with me at all times. I didn't think I would be impressed with this machine, but when I got it, I knew I had to have it. I love how the screen is so high quality, and the build quality is awesome, even if it's a little flimsy. It also is nice to be able to use it with an iPad, I have an iPad Air 2 and it's great. I just wish the battery life would last longer, but that's a small complaint. It's great!  It works great! A little pricey but worth it!  to buy the machine as a gift, is a great idea, the price is right! The only problem is the delivery time. I was very frustrated when i tried to order it (had to go to the Apple store in my town) for a birthday present for my cousin. Then i discovered that the system does not ship internationally, only in the US. When i got it in the mail, i tried the connection test (the test is not included) and the system said it was not connected. The box was just in a bad way, with a big hole on the top of it and an empty case inside. i opened it up to find a dirty keyboard, unplugged all other parts of the laptop and went to the local repair shop. they fixed the system very fast and gave me a new screen and a new hard drive. I highly recommend this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was just as advertised.     The audio quality is superb.  I've been using this with an iPhone for the past couple of weeks. I use my other iphone and the audio is quite poor but this one is good.  My only complaint is the cable is a bit long (especially in comparison to the other iPod models I've used).  If you have a iphonod touch/iPhone and want an iphono interface for it this is an excellent choice.  If your looking for a quality audio interface with the latest in tech for an iPod touch/iPod Nano then look no further than the TAT1.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my new iPhone 5, but not to the extent of being able to turn it on and off without a plug in the wall!   What a godsend!  I'm a long-time user of my old Sony Walkman, which also has a built in Bluetooth. I love that I can get audio from my iPod, play music on the iPhone, then use my Sony to get the music off the iPod and onto my Walkman. I'm very pleased to have discovered this, as I have not been able to do it without getting a third device to connect.   Also, I have to say that I'm a fan of the iPhone 5. I use the latest 4.1.1 firmware, and it has gotten better with every firmware upgrade. I have no complaints and would definitely buy again.  Have you ever had a problem with your iPhone 5?

This is my second N-gage (the first one was my dad's), and I've already recommended their site to other folks. I've gotten no complaints from any of my friends and family.   If you're a vaper and want to buy a decent, quality electronic device for $15, this is the way to go.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently bought an iphone 6 and wanted to transfer all my iphones contacts and notes from an ipad 1. I used a program called "Transmogrifier" and iphoned everything and transferred to the ipod. However, Transmogrified iphons do not transfer iphon information. They do not iphoner the iphono output from the iPhone to the ipod. The iphonic data is transferred on the iplex to the PC. But they do not support iphophone out. So all you iphorners out there, I suggest you buy a iphony cable, it will do the job much faster than Transmoggification and give you the most fun experience in using an ipleg. Good Buy:  The iplegs were really fun to use. The buttons are all very nice and crisp. They feel like the real thing. I am pretty excited to start listening to my ipods, I have an ipad mini and I like to listen to my iPod but I don't have any ipods with me to transfer. I also bought a new iPod nano 2, I think it's gonna be my favorite. I think the touch screen of the mini works much better than the old one did. It also looks much more expensive.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I received my new laptop (the Asus Transformer Book T100TA, and it is awesome), I was very impressed with its speed and build quality. I love the keyboard, its light, and I love that it's a Windows 8.1 laptop. This particular model comes with a Core i5-3570U processor and 8 GB RAM, which is definitely enough for most people. The only thing I would change is the battery, but its a relatively small one, I have 2 other laptops that are slightly larger (I only buy this one as it's the only one with a screen) and I would really love to replace the battery. The battery is small so that is not an issue. I am also happy that the display is an IPS display, the screen is bright, and easy to read. The speakers are also good, and are quiet, but I don't have a surround sound system, so the speakers on this are not that important. Overall a great laptop.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iDroid was a bit expensive at $80, but it really has worked well for me.  I like that it's so easy to use.   I've found that it has an auto-stop feature and also an adjustable brightness.  It's also good at detecting when you open your ears or a closed mouth and doesn't turn itself off.  If you don't need Bluetooth or a mic, this is the device you'll want.  The battery is a little shorter than I'd like, but if you use it once and don't do anything else, it lasts a few days.  My only complaint is that it sometimes turns itself off and on, which is annoying.  Other than that, it's a pretty good device.  Review by : Michael Rating: (3.8) Excellent device! Very well built and very useful. Also, the battery is very good for the price. I like to be able to use the device with a mouthpiece. , I have to say I'm very happy with this. I have used several devices over the years but none have fit my needs so well. It's a very high quality device. I am able to listen to music, listen to a podcast or podcasting. If you can find the right battery and price, this device is a very good purchase. You just have to know what you want to use it for. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to listen with their mouth.  in a way the iDox is similar to the m-107 (a great portable mic and I like it better than the v-1). the i-Dox has a 3.5mm jack and you plug it into a headphone jack. it's small and very compact (even when connected to a computer)  It does not have a mic but it can connect to a mic through your computer. that's very convenient if you are traveling. It has a few features that make it worth buying. first you can set the device to auto-save your recordings. then you can listen back to what you just recorded. you can play your recordings over and over. so when you start the recorder, you just hear whatever you recorded. the i2ode also has a built-in mp3 player which is very nice to have and you can even send your music to your computer over the internet. if you want audio on the go, this i-dox

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     It has the capabilities of a desktop computer but can be used to do many things with an Android phone.   I am an audio/video journalist so the ability to do interviews with people and gather video material is important for me.  To me this has become the best way to do that.  So far the quality of the recordings is just as good as any other recorder.  My only complaint is that the battery runs out of power fast.  It doesn't take much.  I get about a 10 minutes of video and audio before the phone battery dies.  The sound quality is very good and has a good bass response.  There are three different recording options, including a full-screen view.  If you want the ability for the phone to record and stream the footage directly back to the computer you can do that too.  You can also download the videos to an external hard drive (which is really convenient).  For the price, I am extremely pleased with this product and I am recommending it to friends and family.  - Mike
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      This is a very impressive product. It is not perfect but is very good and I love the touch screen. I would suggest adding a battery and a usb charger, I have only had it a few days and already need to add another battery. The charger doesn't work and I didn't think that it was going to but I have had to use a battery at least once or twice now and it's just not good. This item does a good job of keeping the contents of the bag close to hand and is easy to carry for a long distance trip.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    (from a customer that uses an iDevices tablet) I would like to start by saying how I love my iphone. For a long time now i have used the iphones because i have been in a business situation where i needed a phone.   i could use the phone anywhere from home to work, it was the only one i could afford in the market and it also has unlimited talking, texting and video chatting.  i used to own a iphoyox which I thought was amazing, but i would get so many calls when i was in a rush i would have to turn it off.  my phone is so much better now because it has a really great microphone.  there is no more ringing or ringing on my speakerphone.  This is my 3rd iphony and all three are perfect. I will say the first one took forever to come in, it arrived in the mail, i opened it to find a small plastic bag and some batteries.  (review from a customer) I bought an iphono for my new iMac but could not get the case to fit. After spending a little more money i got a replacement. I love the ipsod, i cant find a better phone for a fraction of the price.  Thanks iphonomy.com  (Review from a reader) i bought the ipod 2 in august and love it. I have tried several other ipods and the ixpod is by far my best choice.  The microphone on the izipod is very nice for talking and the audio quality is great. The ipsods are a little bit more expensive but worth the money.  I can tell you from personal experience that the i-pod 2 is better than the i-pod 1 when it comes to the quality of the audio.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had the K-5 for about 3 weeks now, and I'm impressed with how good it is. I have used it mainly to listen to music on the go, and have found it to be quite fast to set up, easy to connect to my computer via the optical cable, and reasonably loud.   Overall, the K5 is a solid product for the price, and it's a great way to listen and play music while doing other things at the same time.  5/5 Excellent Product for all purposes I really love the sound quality of the unit.  The only problem I found is that the sound is not as good as it used to be. But this is still a great product. . Mavica S7i (D-PRE3) (2012) Review   As the name suggests, this is a D-PRE (Digital Pre-Amp) amp.  It is powered by a very powerful 32-bit D-Pre 3 DSP processor and offers a range of digital, analog and digital/analog output formats.  With the included cable, this amp can drive virtually all types of headphones.  At a very competitive price, this should appeal to most people.  You can download the firmware from the manufacturer's web site.  I have a couple of other products that I really like, the S6i and the S8i, but this one is definitely a keeper.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new iPod mini is a terrific value.   I can listen to a good podcast on the go.  I love the size of the device and the battery life.  It's not as portable as a real MP3 player but its very portable.  This is a great new device for an awesome price.  Recommended to everyone.   I bought my first iPOD on July 14, 2009. I have used it several times since then. It works great in a variety of situations. My only complaint is the fact that it doesn't have the iTunes software. It is also kind of expensive, but I guess it is a good investment!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:       You've discovered what an amazing tool this is for your guitar.   I have been using the E-Bow since July and can't believe how it's changed my way of playing. I've already purchased 2 for my 2 daughters so they can play as well.   I love the way it's set up. It's so easy to use and gives you enough resistance to make the string really pop.  I like having my own electronic string, and can play my guitar with ease while my wife can watch over the kids.  - David A. The E-bow is an easy to set up device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this in my possession for quite awhile now, and have used it for several tasks. It works well for these tasks, but could be better, especially when it comes to battery life. I have also had several problems with the buttons and the buttons on this are quite stiff. I can barely press a button. I don't mind if the buttons feel the same, but the stiff ones don't allow for proper, consistent button presses. Overall this is a good device for the price, but would prefer a better feel when pressing the buttons.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the lightness of the device and I do find it convenient to have on the keychain.  I am surprised that it has the features I want:  The auto backlight is great.  The LED light works even when it is off.  Easy to turn on.  All you need is a smartphone to start a video.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Mav from Nice product, not a must have It is a nice device, the color is good for an android device. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a lot of features that most people will want. I wanted it because it was the only one of the two that had auto-brightness. That was nice because my other device would go on all the time but the screen would turn off, even if I was not in use. Now I just have to remember to turn it on when I am not using it.  I really like the device. It fits into my keychain nicely. I also like the size and looks a bit like a flashlight. However, I have only had it a week. The screen is somewhat dim. There are only a few settings. The auto-flash is nice but not enough for my needs. I need a better auto-off feature, I would like a feature that would allow me to see what the device is doing (such as turning on or off based on a set of rules). It is also fairly heavy in the hand. So, this is not a great design, but the design is very simple. I was able to do all the things I wanted with it and do not intend to buy another one. I am very happy with it. It is definitely a good value.

The sound quality is excellent for the price, I have a high end sound system and the Z1 is a great upgrade. A lot of music can be enjoyed from the Z.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If I could have chosen, I would have liked an iPod. It has been on every vacation I've ever had (which I haven't been very good at), and I have an iPod just for trips outside the house (and to listen to music).   When I purchased this I was expecting a bit more than the little phone that it is. This is my first electronic device. I bought a Kindle and was thrilled with it, but didn't like the buttons, it has some of the buttons on the back that don't do anything, and I was wondering what the function of the one at the top was. I did not expect to get more than a little phone, but the sound quality was pretty good. I use my iPod a lot more than my Kindle.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had my RCA line out of this thing for 6 months now.   My wife really likes it as well.  The bass from this is just about right for her ears.  This is really a great little set up for a small studio,  It is quiet,  The built in mic is a great feature and makes recording live music easier.  It was a real pain to get the wires in from the back because they are so small.  When the cable is loose, the RCA cable can get pulled out and not fit into the mixer.  I could have used a little thinner wire, or a little less than 6 inches of the cable.  However this was a very good little set that I really enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As I said at the beginning, this blog is about my experience using my i5-3550M (as seen in the photo), i7-3610QM (the model with the heatsink on the back), and i7 980M (with the heat sink on the bottom).   It's not an official review of any of these devices.   There are several reviews that say they can't use the same processor on all of them.  There is some variance in the benchmarks and synthetic benchmarks, but I don't expect much of a difference in performance.  I've had all three at the same time, and it seems that when it comes to overall stability and performance, the i5 is the one to go for in this test.  The CPU is running at 3.2GHz in the first test, and 2.7GHz in both the second and third tests.  One thing to note is that the i7 has 3.6GHz turbo on it, which is a lot higher than the i3.  This can be attributed to the fact that the 980M is a quad core, and is thus running on the same core as the i6, but has been overclocked, which causes it to be a lot faster than the other two.  In addition to the i4 and i5, the 980 is running with 6GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, which means that it doesn't have a bunch of memory to use (the i4 is running without memory, and has just 4GB of memory).  The i7, however, has 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and 128GB of SSD storage (so there's a bit of extra RAM, but not much more).  This isn't to say that the 4GB difference between the i8 and i6 isn't a deal breaker; it isn't.  If you're in the market for a new computer, I think the i9 would be a better value than the 980 if it were to have all four cores running. The i3 is running on a pair of Gigabyte 8GB DDR3-1866 RAM sticks (the same RAM sticks the i2 was running with).  These sticks are a bit old now (and so are the 980), and are now a bit over $100.  While I think they are pretty nice, the memory is quite pricey.  They are also not that
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My F-117 was purchased by me from another web site. I found a great deal on it from another site so I ordered it from this site. Thanks for a great site with good selection of the best products out there.   It works great and is well made.   My F-9 - Jetfighter!   Reviewer: Steve S. from Lubbock, TX. on 1/18/2006  I just purchased the F-17F in a color I didn't even know existed: Navy Blue and Jet Black. It's a very cool looking aircraft. I've been flying the F35A a few times, and it's a great simulator to learn how to fly a jet. The best part about this F-18 is that it has two engines. A very nice feature. One of the big problems with the F18 is not the lack of engines, but the fact that it is too big to be a combat aircraft. It feels a bit like flying a C-130 cargo plane, so that is not a good thing. I do, however, think that it will be a good buy when the costs come down. The F-35A has very few problems, but it's not as good as I thought it was going to be. I am happy with it, though. I will have to get my buddy a second F-5 because his F-10 had engine problems. I guess we'll have to wait until after the F/A-18's are done for the price to go down. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's an incredible piece of kit. I have been using it for several months now and it has exceeded my expectations. This is a very compact, but powerful unit. I can take my guitar and have it be in tune within a few minutes. The volume is not at the loud level that my amp is but there is plenty of bass and the treble range is wide enough. It can't compete with the Marshall stack in terms of volume, but it does the job in terms on what you can do with the unit. This thing will not let you down and it does what it is designed to do, well. I highly recommend it to any guitar player.  Style of Music: Rock/Alternative

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I can not say enough good things about this receiver. I have 2 of these, one for my X-750/X-550, and one for a Sony XBR-700. I wanted a dedicated receiver for the X-Series, and I had to take a leap of faith, to spend over $2000 to get one. And I am so pleased with this receiver! The setup was easy and the sound is fantastic. I am using it in my truck to send over movies from DVD-R. The picture is so clear and crisp and the bass is so good, that I am hearing it through my speakers and the X100 is still clear through the receiver, even though my headphones are plugged into the receiver. This is by far the best product I have ever seen for the price, and now I have to find a way to get a second one.

I use it for reading, emailing, writing, and playing games. It works well. The batteries last for a good while. I don't like that you can't charge it, but they do have a plug-in charger which is very convenient. I haven't had an issue with overheating. I do find the display to be hard to read and that the keys are a little hard to press. However, there is no way to make the keyboard backlight go on or off. I think this would make the battery life a lot longer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Posted by: Jeroen at 10:41 PM   Hi,  We are using the DAP-H1. We have owned three of them. The DAPs are extremely easy to set up and use, and the best thing is the ease of adjustment in the EQ control. The best thing about them is the fact that you can set them up to a much higher frequency than we can for ourselves, so the Dap's sound great, especially at higher volumes (especially at high volumes). We would highly recommend them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first started to use this product I had an accident with my old Samsung laptop. It became very hard to operate and so I ordered a second one from the site that was a different size and color (very expensive and not what I wanted) and it fit very well. I really like that I can use my phone and tablet at the same time and my computer as well. The only thing I don't like is that I have to plug this in and out to my computer when I am doing homework because I can't put it down or close the lid.    Review of DJ0279-04 Submitted By: L. H. - Verified Buyer I love the new Apple USB hub. I have the Apple MacBook Pro 14" with a 12Gbps Thunderbolt and was worried the hub might have the same problem as the MacBook and take up too much space. Not so! It's light and small, fits nicely in the USB port and it connects to the MacBook so I can charge it as well and it makes using my Apple Cinema display with the USB hub even more convenient.  I love the updated and easy to use iUSB hub and it fits into the port just like the MacBook.

I wish I could find a cheaper model, but I know how hard it is to find good books online for free and this is not the right e-reading solution for everyone.   More information  E-books on a screen. That's what this is. There's nothing to compare it to. There are e-readers, but this one is for Kindle e-Book readers. Not for paper. So you know, there are many pros and cons to this ereader. If you are a Kindle user, this is a must-have. If your Kindle isn't capable, this eReader is perfect for your Kindle. If this is too expensive, don't buy it.

I am a science teacher who uses a lot of electronic devices for reading materials. I wanted something I could use all the time, even if I wasn't home at the time. The Touch is a good product. It is small and light enough for my needs. There is a built in USB port that is very convenient. The only thing that would make it a better option would be the fact that there is no cover for the power cord. I would also have liked to have a small battery pack, to keep the Touch charged. Other than that, I highly recommend the Kobo!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of my favorite things about the iPod is that it's small, easy to carry and comes with a variety of music. The design is great. It looks like a compact MP3 player. It plays all kinds of music, it's good-looking, it is easy to use.  Great! I have been looking for an iPod for some time. The only thing that I didn't like about the first one I bought is that the screen was too small and the screen couldn't play MP3s well. This new one works well and has plenty of memory and MP3 play capability. The speaker is good, and the design is fantastic. I'd definitely buy another for the family!  Good, but not good enough... The iPod nano has great features, but the quality is a bit lacking. The speakers are not the best, the headphone jack is not very strong, and even on a very quiet day the earbuds get very hot. The built-in speakers and micro SD card slot are great for storing music, but it's very slow to transfer music, and I wish the battery life was longer. I also have a Sony MP3 and iPod Classic and found both of them to be quite similar in their features. ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My second experience with the G-Box is a bit different than the first time I used one - it's more a matter of the product. As stated by a previous review, the G4 is actually pretty decent.   It's not quite a laptop but it is not a tablet either.  A good amount of information is included on the back of the unit, and the battery life is good enough for an average user.  The main benefit of the G3 was it's ease of use.  It allows you to watch a video with a controller and move around your home screen with ease.  In my experience, it would have been nice to have a touch screen for viewing videos (it's not like the G2 had any touch screens), but the G5 does have a good screen.  To summarize, I'm very happy with the quality of the device. I would recommend it if you're not a gamer or you have very little space at home.

It is an excellent product and worth buying just for the sound of the speakers.

I have a pretty good earphone setup already, but this one would be good to put in my iPod as well. I haven't tried it out yet to make sure it works with my iPod, but it seems to work fine on my MP3 player. So far so good. The sound is great. I will be purchasing a couple more.    - J. B. (August 2016)  5 star review   Reviewed by: KJ  iPod: MP3 Player   I was a little wary of this product after seeing so many negative reviews online about it being made in China. I was surprised at how much I really liked the device! I'm sure I'll be back for another earphone purchase!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - The unit came in a well organized packaging and the box was well secured with double sided tape. There was also a small booklet which told me which features were included and where and when I can use them. A great place to find things to do with your electronic devices.    Rated 1 out of 5 by jh from Doesn't work. Got this to replace a bad iphone with bluetooth. When I turned it on it did not work, no bluetooth, no internet, no nothing. The only way I can turn it on is to hit the power button and hold it for five seconds. No problem with a bad apple iph3.  I have a very similar iphon with a few things in the box I did differently. The first was get a replacement iph1 which comes with it's own battery. Next was get the iph5 (with bluetooth) and finally the box for my iph7. This is what is missing for a perfect iphony experience: - Bluetooth - I can not even connect my ibridge to it - The battery has to be replaced as it is not rechargeable - The power button has to stay on and I can't find it - Bluetooth has to work The good: - The speakers work well - The buttons work - I am able to connect my computer to the ibridex with no problem - The bluetooth is a great feature I use it everyday and use my phone for the same thing. I don't think it will last long. I bought the ikea version of this for about $50 which makes it slightly more expensive than the ios iphones but in the long run it is the only iphonics device I will ever buy. I have a bunch of iphona's and have never been able to bring myself to buy the ichiro iphonic and I never want to, if it were not for this one. I got mine online for a very good price and it was shipped with the box in a nice plastic bag. I will be replacing it as soon as I can and saving the irl box for when I need to replace it for a new iphono. Thanks iphons.com!  These are the best iphoning products I've used. There's no need to worry about anything breaking and they're pretty reliable (but I do believe they should be able to play mp3
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In Conclusion:  There's nothing much to say about this TV, aside from "it works". It's an excellent TV, that's true, but at $400+ I expect something a little better than what you get here.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as an upgrade to my old PC. I'm a gamer at heart and have used my main gaming PC for a few years now but wanted a small form factor machine that I could carry around to LAN parties. The design is great, the specs are not a lot, but it's a lot more portable than my old system so I can move it around. I will update in a few months with some PC benchmarks but in the meantime I can say that it is a fantastic system that's perfect for my gaming needs. Thanks guys, you did a great job and I'm very happy with my purchase!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you are looking for a reliable product for your computer and want a good design as well as a high quality product this is it. I purchased this computer to replace my old tower and it is well made. I have used the PC for 6 months and I have not had any problems other than a few annoying computer shutdowns. My only complaint is with the design. If you have a normal computer like I do then you can't really complain about the design other than that you don't need to purchase a tower computer like this one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As long as your a fan of digital audio and you want to use it to your advantage you will have a good time with the CODEC.   It's not like my previous one (Alesis ACH140) which was just plain rubbish.  Now this one is actually decent. I'm only 6 months into it now and have not experienced any drop in quality, however the noise floor has improved slightly over the old one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this as a free gift, so I have to give the company some credit. It took a lot of work to set up, but that's to be expected when using an old school modem (which doesn't have WiFi capabilities, just ethernet). This is great for the price. I can use it to connect to a printer, and then to an eSATA hard drive with a cable, or even an external hard drive that I use for my media collection. My only suggestion is that they use a better quality cable. It's just a cable!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's very easy to navigate, and the display is very bright. I also like the way the light reacts to you moving my hand to scroll through web pages on my smartphone.   I also love the fact that it has a built in microphone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:        - I'm getting a real kick out of the sound and sound quality of the K-1000 and am already thinking of getting another one.   As a former high school music teacher, I'm very pleased to find a product with the power of an analog mixer that can be used to play CDs and make digital files.  If I had an iPod, I'd probably be just as pleased.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like this a lot   In the UK, when you buy a new computer or any electronic device, the first thing you should try is to find out about the manufacturer. If you look around at the websites, do you find a range of reviews?   Yes.   Then go to the manufacturer's website and read what the reviewers are saying about their device.  You can find out the most popular brands and the most trusted brands.  The only things that you should be careful of are the "first impression" statements.  They may mean the same thing to different people, but it can mean completely different things in the market place.  There is a lot to be said about the "second impression" on the website as well, but I would not worry about that if you buy something.  Also keep an open mind and make sure the device is in good working condition, it's a good idea to look into it from a few different angles.  I would also take some time to read reviews on the internet.     There are many different types of reviews.  A manufacturer may put a short "What's in it?" review on the web, then add a "My first impressions" post after.  However, a "good first impression" has nothing to do with the "good second impression" of a company. The good reviews are often based on a limited selection of reviews from one website, some from other companies or even bloggers, sometimes in very vague ways, but this is all what we know about a product. So, if you look at a review and don't like it, that is just because the website is bad and the review is a "favourite" and so they must be right.  For example, the manufacturers of a certain model may say that "The quality is excellent, and has held up well over the years". This is an extremely broad statement.  When you look a good review of this model, you can tell from the pictures and the text that the material is "good quality", but when you read a "bad first impression", it could mean that it has a "totally inferior" build quality. The best advice I can give is to read a few reviews before you buy and decide for yourself if it's good enough for you. If it isn't, it won't make a huge difference to the final price, so I recommend you read reviews, find a good website that sells
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm using it now as my main sound recorder for home use. I purchased the unit because I was looking for a portable, all-in-one recorder. The unit works as advertised and the price is right.   Also, I used it to record a performance by my band on stage in front of a large audience.   Best of the Best   The Panasonic DMC-GX700 has been in service for nearly a year now and is without a doubt the best electronic recorder I've ever owned.  It is a powerful machine with a lot of features, especially if you buy the recorder as part of a larger system.  The recording of sound on a mobile phone can be an expensive proposition.  You have to buy a phone line and phone app for most people and even then the quality isn't great.  But with the DMC it's all possible.  I am a recording engineer and I am proud to report that we've done a few shows with it and it is still working well.  This is the only product I have owned to date that can easily record sound on my iPhone 4, 5, 6, and 7.  And of course you can also record from any SD card or even your computer's hard drive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My main issue is that the design is so old-fashioned. For the price I paid I think it's a fantastic deal. I'm so glad I bought it. The remote control is excellent, it has everything I would need, the remote works with my MP3 player, bluetooth and headphones. I am on my second one, this time I added a USB 3.0 port so that I can plug in my flash drive and computer. I love the quality of this device, and the way it works. A bit slow to boot up, but that's to be expected.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It has been a long time since I've been on a computer.  I had an older PC when I got married, and that computer was still in its box and running, but didn't have any updates.   Now that I have a Windows 7 (64 bit) machine, my old old machine is gone.  This is a wonderful device and the price is good.  Thanks for making them!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new version of the iCade is a small addition to their lineup.   The iCAD is a desktop machine that can be used with or without a tablet in a desktop setting.  With a screen size of 10.3 inches, and a resolution of 300 x 200, the iCub is a tiny desktop machine.     There is a good chance that people who prefer to do computer work will find the iCube easier to use, and less time-consuming to use than a normal computer, especially if they have a small screen and need to work with larger pieces.  For a $299 entry level unit, this was a surprisingly good deal.  There were no other products in my testing that had comparable features to the iCIade.  The machine has an LCD display that is about 1/4 the size of the old iCad, and there is a USB port.  Although there are several features in the iCode that do not work on the iIcube, it would have been nice to see an option to include this feature on the newer version of iCADE.  Additionally, there is still no word on whether the i-Cad will ever make it to the US.  I'm hoping that this is a step in the right direction, and that the US version will be a better value. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    * The USB-A port is compatible with all the latest USB-C phones. In addition, it's reversible.   I can plug in a mouse to the tablet.  * I find the display resolution is very good. It is about as sharp as the LCD, but the touch screen gives much more accurate and precise feedback.  I find it easy to read text.  It is a lot less reflective than a LCD display and also offers good viewing angles, especially in bright sunlight.  This is one of the best products I have ever owned!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A little more noise:        A little bit more power:     Faster:  The XM20 and XM40 will get you there, but the XM90 is a true beast of a rig. The XE50 is one of the few decent amplifiers I have used that doesn't make you cringe when you hear it; it just sounds good. For someone who is more of a rock/metal/punk guy than a heavy metal fan or even a music snob, this thing is the answer. I have been a fan of the XE40 for a few years now, but wanted a more powerful amp that I could live with. This is what I have always wanted. This amplifier sounds great, and has plenty of power. It's a big amp, so don't expect to plug it in and have it sound like a $10,000 monster with a subwoofer. For most people it will just be the X60.   There are a few drawbacks that I can't really explain. The most noticeable of these is that the volume control isn't fully adjustable. It takes a little adjustment and some effort to get it to sound even moderately good. The other big negative is that there are no switches to add gain or mute/unmute. In fact, you can't even turn the volume down. This could be a good or bad thing depending on your need. The first thing you should know is that I only use my amplifiers for high volumes. I never use them in my cars, where I might want more power and lower noise levels. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just got mine today, and it is amazing. I had been looking for something similar for a long time but could never afford it. This thing is beautiful, works like a charm, and is so easy to use. It is really just a little bit bigger than my iPod, so I have to hold it in a certain way, but that's fine with me. I love the fact that I can control it via a remote with a phone app that is not available on my ipod or my iPad. That is the beauty of this device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an amazing soundboard. It's not quite the quality of a high-end professional soundboard, but it's quite close.   My old school board, which I used to use on some of my own recordings and which my friends all used to listen to, is still in great shape. I didn't have to buy any new cables to use this board with. I also use the same cables with my old board that I bought at the same time.  This board is incredibly versatile.  I use it to record music, talk to my wife and kids, talk on the phone, play with my grandkids and I also used it for some guitar work and it does it all very well. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this as a gift for a friend who wants to get into electronics. I wasn't expecting a great device at all, but what I got was exactly what I was expecting and even more. I thought I had gotten a generic electronic device with no features other than a decent LED backlight. I was wrong. The LED light is actually very bright and the touch pad is great. I have the latest iPad so I expected the touchpad to be as good as the iPad but it's not even close. The size is perfect for my small hand. The only problem I have with the unit is that the charging port is in the top right corner and that's annoying since I'm usually on my iPad while the phone is charging.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You don't need to do this but it will help to know what you got. I really like the sound and quality. It works well with all my music and my movies. I had a problem with the battery going dead on it. But it's very easy to replace so that is easy to solve.  Rated 5 out of 5 by MaddyK from Perfectly Fine The product works well. It takes a little bit of practice but it's a fun experience for the first time trying this. It was a bit tricky at first, and I thought it was the product. The directions are a little unclear but once you figure them out it's soo easy. I found the manual to be a little overwhelming but luckily my husband was able to point me in the right direction. I got this to replace my old Sony receiver and I think the sound is awesome. As another reviewer mentioned, it is a bit noisy but this is the nature of a receiver, and if you don't have a lot of noise it doesn't bother me. The only negative is that the screen seems to have a yellow tinge that I can't get rid of. So far, I like the way it sounds. I also think that the price point is good. I plan to upgrade the receiver in about 6 months when it comes time to upgrade my computer. Slightly on the loud side. Loud, but very good for the price. Easy to use. The instructions are a bit confusing. I like it. So far so good. Rated 4 out of 4 by Chris from Great Sound for the Money! I bought this to go with my LG Smart TV and a pair of KEF Acoustics headphones. It doesn't sound like much and it does only go up to about 90dB, but it is quite loud for a TV receiver. The sound of the receiver is great and the picture quality is very good. It's a little on the louder side, but this receiver isn't for everyone. It is definitely a good value for the money. Included:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A lot of reviews are negative, and most reviewers seem to have no problem saying "why would you need to replace it?" (I don't have a Nexus 5 in my home, so I have no idea). However, I think if you can get past the name-calling, and focus on the actual device itself, then this is a great tablet. This is one of the best tablets I've ever used. The tablet is well-built, and has a gorgeous HD screen. You also get a lot of software for free. In addition to Android, you get a version of Firefox, Chrome, Skype, and a bunch of other apps for free, including the original Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Talk. If you're a heavy Google user, this is the one to buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - The unit works as expected. The unit itself is extremely sturdy. I do wish the remote would have come with a button so I could quickly turn it off. (it did not seem to do that on my unit).    Rated 4 out of 5 by DzPanda from Works Great!   I purchased this unit to replace an older LG digital remote with built in controls. I purchased the new remote from Home Depot. The new remote has built in buttons to turn the device on/off, change the channels, and to control the volume. I was also able to use this as an optional input to an existing digital camera that I have. My only problem is that the new model is a bit bulkier and it takes a little longer to operate than the old one. But otherwise, great product.

I really love the product and use it every day.  The screen is beautiful and is the first one that works correctly and has a reliable touch screen.  The only problem I had with this one was a small dust particle on the cover.  This would be an easy fix on the next model.  But I think there is a good reason that it's only a 6 star product, the price seems a little high for a 6″ screen.

It is not too noisy or loud, I wish it had a power button to turn it on and on but I can live with the power saving function and the backlit keyboard.  I have found it more difficult to adjust the volume and the buttons feel slightly mushy in my fingers, but overall I think it is a very good value for the money, not to mention the fact that it doesn't require a whole lot of space to keep it nice and tidy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was an easy purchase and the price is very reasonable.   My biggest complaints are the remote, the volume control is a little too sensitive, and the speakers can be a bit muddy and sometimes the music just doesn't get loud enough.  Also, I have had the same problem with this unit for a long time now that my car stereo will not play my MP3 files from my iPod in stereo with my TV on and the volume controls on the remote are way too sensitive. If someone else is going to buy this unit I would suggest replacing the volume level control on the top right corner of the remote control with a rubber bump to eliminate the annoying noise the remote make when it hits the buttons.   I just purchased this unit. It is so easy to use. Everything is in place. I am very pleased with this purchase.  Thank you so much for your help.  Rating:1  Service: drydock  City:  Fri, Feb 20,  2017 I love the new M4. It has the right amount of buttons for my style. It doesn't take up a lot of space on my dock.

I am in the habit of charging it and not having it charged at the same time. I get it in the morning, go for a 30 minute walk, get in the shower, plug it in and get back to work. I will say the phone comes with a lot of extras, but only 2 in total! The phone has a removable case and the screen covers. I like the screen covering, but for the money I expect to get more.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     The iRig G2 is a wonderful device for home studio use. The sound is very balanced, very rich and the amp has a very nice tone. The iRigs are built like a tank, with a tonal consistency that is very good. The price is great as well as the features. I use it with a pair of AKG C480's, so the iRIG's are well balanced. My only complaint is that the G2 needs a good set of stands because the bottom two feet are not quite deep enough to accommodate the pads and the feet are rather short. The G2 will stand on a desk or other place with no problem. The overall build quality of this unit is very high. The unit is well made with a very strong build. The weight of the unit is impressive and the cable has a nice solid feel. The one problem that I have is that I don't like the look of the iControl, it has the appearance of a brick. I don;t like it at all. The only improvement I think could be made is to add another speaker and change the colors. I like the looks of the original iControl. It looks classy. I also think that I may have found the perfect amp for me: It would work for a home studio with a lot of sound and no mic. I am in need of a new rig and I am looking for an amp to play with my C480 and other portable monitors.

I use it for everything including work and pleasure and I am still loving it. This is now my go-to computer and I will probably buy the original in the future.  1/5 Cheap   The first one came with a faulty power supply that was useless and couldn't be removed. After some back and forth trying to get it fixed and to get the laptop repaired, I got the second one. I had the same issue with the original one: The power supply kept going out. After doing research, I found out that the new one is a power supply problem. I contacted the company, and after 2 months of waiting, they finally got back to me to let me know the exact problem with the new power supply. After two more months of troubleshooting, they decided to pay for a new powersupply from a different company and this one works very well and is very convenient. A little more time should have been put into this, but they didn't waste any time on me. Overall, I am very happy with this product and it is the best value for the money. Thank you Best Buy! , May 21, 2016  2 out of 3 people found this review helpful  No-Reply Reviewer: A.J. - I have a Dell XPS 13 with a Touchpad. The screen is large enough for a good viewing angle and decent finger-tracking and it also has the required trackpad buttons and ports for my laptop. The only issue I have is the buttons are difficult to get to, even with the power-on button in its default position. If you are trying to reach the mouse buttons on the bottom left of the touchscreen panel, you'll have a much more difficult time. For the money, the Touchpad is great.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPhone SE with its stunning OLED screen is absolutely fantastic for its size.   I had always wanted an   iPhone but I had to wait until the   new   Apple   came out in 2016   to buy one.  When the  iPhone SE came out,   i was ecstatic!       When I received my  iPhone   and put it in my   car, I was extremely surprised that   it looked great in my car.  It   feels   comfortable in the hand and   even though the  screen size   doesn't do a whole lot to   compete with the iPhone 5S,   the  screen   is the best I have   seen.  The   battery life   of the  iPad Mini   was also great but   my iPhone SE   with the OLED screen  looks   much   nicer.  My   main complaint about the iPhone SE is that  the battery   seems to be a little weak.  I have had it on standby for an entire   day now and  I will not go beyond 3 or 4   charges.  While   this   may   not be a problem   for many of you, I do not think that many people will be   able to last a full day on the charger   because   they use the device heavily on the way home from work.  After   reviewing many other   electronic devices   that  have been released recently   from Apple, the iPhone is the  most impressive.    After buying   one   unit   in early 2016 and  continuing to use it daily for almost a year and a half,  I am very happy with   its performance. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm very pleased with my product! This is my fourth one of these products, and I have to say it was my first purchase on amazon. My first two were both defective but I was very pleased to find another that worked without any issues at all. I purchased this for my 15 year old daughter, who has had some difficulty in using a tablet on her own. She has trouble with finger typing, so this was a good alternative. I have her on it constantly now, and she can type comfortably without any trouble on it. Thanks, Goodbuy!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this device to replace a worn out, broken one that would not sync to my new phone (Android). This device is a godsend. I don't need to have two devices. I can use my phone as my computer. No need to carry a laptop. It has all of the functions of a regular phone, plus more (such as phone calls and text messaging). Also the price is a steal, you get what you pay for. I will probably not be buying another phone in the near future.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from The Ultimate Computer This is a great product, and it does it's job well. The only reason why I rated this higher is that I was considering replacing my previous phone with this. If I could give this 5 stars, I would. I'm sure it has some design flaws and bugs, but the device itself works well and is extremely simple to use. The downside of course is that it is only compatible with Android phones, so if you want to get a Kindle Fire, you'll have to spend a lot of money on a new phone. Also, the new Galaxy Note phones won't sync with this device. If you have a Samsung device, you might be better off sticking with a Galaxy. But if you're not, this is a terrific value. - Chris
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was using an old Sony MDR-Z1 for a long time and I think I'm still in love with it. It's great if you are working with old footage or old photos (which is how I do a lot of work).   The sound quality is the best ever and the ergonomic layout is a dream.   After using the Z1 a while, I'm now using a DPA4040.   So I'm not that familiar with the hardware, but the software seems to be the same as before.  The Z1 is available from http://www.sony.com/ps-z1/.   A great product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had the  Yamaha YSP-R500, which I picked up as it's a new model. I was not disappointed by the unit, it has a really high quality sound with a very nice bass response. It also has excellent battery life. The sound is very clear, not muddy or muddy at all, so it can be used for a lot of different things: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The A9LH is a nice little device for someone new to the world of DSP and analogue synthesis. This is a very basic DSP device, but I think that there's enough here to get the job done for people who are only looking for an easy way to add a small amount of analogue modulation. I think I prefer the analog signal path and the use of the internal DAC over the external DAC (and the need for the external one in this case). The price is right.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am an electronic junkie and have to say that this is a good all around device. It has a great variety of features, is easy to use, and is very quiet. My only suggestion is that the audio input should be re-arranged to a line input (or an auxiliary input) for a stereo headphone. The audio from the 2.0 has a very low level of distortion, but the headphone output is a bit too loud.

This is a well-built device and its durability, performance and ease of use are great. I'm very happy with it, it's better than most of the portable devices available and I recommend this to all of my friends.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:       I am very satisfied with my purchase! I have used it to listen to music in my car. I have been driving with the speaker connected and now I have a sound system in my van!   You can listen to mp3s and audiobooks on your speaker, which I can't say I'm a fan of!  Very good for a "home" system!  This item will keep on giving you value for the money!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My son got this unit in October of 2009, I believe, and he hasn't turned it off since. I purchased it mainly for my two year old son because he is unable to get a decent night of sleep and I wanted to try an alternative to a night light. His older brother is also a night owl, but he can only go up to 3.5. This little light is great, it's not bright enough to be considered a light, but it can get the job done. The remote is not great, but for the price it is worth the money. I've had this unit on the roof, which isn't the best setting for a nightlight, but is more than I needed. I have a couple of the LED lights, but this little one works so well. It's nice to be able to plug it into a wall outlet and not have to get up at odd hours of the night and switch it on, but you can always just put it in the closet, which was my plan.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had this monitor since April and I've used it mostly on a Macbook Pro and a Sony Vaio Z tablet.   I haven't used it in a while since I've been using a Samsung Galaxy S3 and a Samsung Note 2.  The reason I bought it was because of the built in speakers and it's been a great little sound board for me.  I bought a few of these for friends for Christmas gifts.  It's a good value, but I wish the HDMI cables were longer.  So far I've had great results, I just wish I could use my laptop screen more. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the best features about this machine is its size. The size is just right for when you're on the go. I would definitely recommend this machine.  Rated 1 out of 5 by John from Great idea but lousy design The design of this thing is just awful. The remote control was bad and the video quality is a joke. I bought this machine because it is small and I wanted to watch Youtube on my laptop. It was too bad because the first thing I tried was to turn it on. It would not turn on, I would turn it off and it would still not turn off. My last resort was to push the power button and wait until the unit shuts off. This is the only problem I have with this item. The battery life is pretty good so I'll keep buying it but I'd recommend you try to do something else with your money. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really liked the fact that it comes with a 1-month warranty, plus the option to send a photo of your device in return. The camera works very well, the screen is bright and bright and the camera is sharp and good, the only thing that would have made it better would have been to add an SD slot instead of a Micro-SD card. The battery is also a bit low, which is my only complaint about the phone, but I've had it for almost a month. I love my phone and I am not happy about the camera, but the phone is great for my needs. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was so looking forward to this because it's my favorite. I just got it a day before a work trip and it was ready to go. It comes with the headset and the remote. It has an external microphone that I'm really excited about, but there is a small issue. My left ear was too sensitive to the microphone and I couldn't hear what my fellow coworkers were saying in voice chat when we were playing on the team stage. I was also frustrated with the fact that it wasn't clear if you can hear your teammates' commands, even when they were on the other side of the room. The headset was ok. It's heavy so it's easy to carry around with you in a bag, but it's not light or compact. The remote had the perfect remote control but is just a standard remote. The voice recorder was alright. It worked ok, but I'm not sure if it was because I had to press a button just to record and not because it was recording well. The only gripe I have is how heavy this is. I'm almost afraid to leave my home because I don't want to forget to plug the headset in. If you like voice chat and have a headset that can handle it and not have to deal with the battery and remote you're in the right place.

The back of the phone is nice and flat and the battery life is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best computer I have used so far. It runs smoothly, is easy to use and has an interface that feels good and does what I want. Also, the case has a small battery indicator and a big battery in it which is great.   I am so impressed with the quality of the case!    "Best computer I've had so far!" "This computer is awesome! I got it because my old one was dying and I had to get a new one. I don't even like that I have two of the same computer. The specs are amazing (16 gigs of RAM), and they come with tons of memory (64 gigs). I'm actually saving money because I can put my games on the USB stick that comes with the computer instead of paying $100 for a new hard drive.  I'm a huge gamer and I can get this computer to run at over 60 frames per second. I have a 6 year old son who loves playing video games with me. My husband has a desktop computer that only runs at a little over 50 frames per. This computer has been great for our kids to play games and I'm able to use it when I'm out of town.  I'm really happy with it so far and I would recommend it to everyone. "  I am very happy with the new computer. It has done a great job running all my games. The only problem I have is the fan is really loud. I would buy another if they had one. The software is pretty easy to figure out too. Thanks.  Good product. I am very pleased with the product. It is very easy to setup. The hard drive is very fast and I have no issues with it. I think the only drawback would be the computer's fan, it is very loud and it is definitely the only thing that can be replaced without purchasing a new computer if you run it at 100% and use the power button, which I have done. I'm not sure how durable it is, because the other reviews were all positive. My main computer is a Dell, and I love it, so this was a great upgrade for me. It also has a little USB port on the back of it for connecting a second hard drive and for external hard drive (which is a great feature, but I didn't use it).  The laptop runs very smoothly and is a very nice device to work with. The case is a nice color

In addition to the high performance of its 1205 IC, this is also the only IC on the market which supports 5V logic.  It also has the benefit of a 1K-bit memory buffer (1Mb of storage, a very nice feature for the price point) as well as its own internal memory.  This chip is also a perfect complement to an Arduino Mega, a cheap and tiny development platform which will fit easily on the back of your breadboard. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been a big fan of Sony electronic equipment and in the past was a loyal Sony dealer. But after a while of using Sony products, and getting very unhappy results from the products, I switched to a better brand.  In a word, the new Sony is great.   It is the best and most durable I have tried yet.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the fact that the back of the earbuds do not stay in place while in the ear.  Sony, please do a better job on the back cover to hold them in place, and make the ears stay in the correct position in the ears.  Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this product to anyone.  I am very happy with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm giving 5 stars out of 5   I bought this for my son who has a chronic ear infection. He has been using earplugs since he was 6 or so, but we found that he was having a hard time sleeping without them. He can't even use ear plugs with my wife in the next room. The ear bud I have was the right size and they fit really well. The battery life lasted for quite a long time. It would have been great if it had had a charging/battery indicator like the ones that the Apple Watch comes with, but there is no way you'll know it's in your ear when you put it in. However, with the included ear bud charger, the earbuds are easy to charge.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit comes with 5 USB 2.0 cables, which is nice. The USB 2 ports are used to charge a single cell lithium battery. The battery can charge up to 10 times, which isn't as fast as what I'd like. It's pretty slow, but it does charge the unit in about 90 minutes. The cable comes with a bit of resistance, but that's normal for this kind of thing.   For the price, you can't go wrong.  It's just a bit small to fit in your pocket. It also has a very good build quality. I found the sound to be quite good.  It comes with an AC adapter which is a bonus. It works really well with my Samsung Galaxy Note3.

It is a bit heavy, but my wife is not that heavy anyway, and we both enjoy the way it feels.     The keyboard is a joy to type on. It has no flex to it. My hands feel free and comfortable while typing on it.  The only downside to this keyboard is that you need to have two extra keyboards around for your second screen.  If this were my only keyboard, I could live with it. I am also a big fan of the keyboard backlight. It lights up nicely on the bottom row, which is really nice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using my iPod Touch with the Music app (iPhone 4) and it does work with an external speaker (but it sounds really tinny, especially after using the external audio device that the iPod Touch had before I bought the model with this app). The iPod Touch works with both the music app and with a bluetooth adapter, and the audio playback is clear enough on my iPod. The app is easy to use and very simple to navigate. The only problem I had with the app (and this may be a problem with my unit) is that it would occasionally not recognize that I was playing music and would force me to skip the song. This issue happens with both music and movies, so it's not a deal breaker, but it does take me out of the flow and keep me from using the app because I have to think of skipping the song to get back to where I was.   Overall, this is a good product, but I'm not very happy with it as it only does two things I do use it for: Music and movies.

Review of DJI Phantom 3 Professional by Daniel H. on 11/28/2017 Rating: 5 of 5 Stars! The Phantom 3 is the most exciting quadcopter I've flown. After months of frustration with the GoPro Hero3, I finally had a good experience with DJI, with the DJI Inspire 2, which is a bit more expensive than the Inspire 1, but much smaller and more durable.   The Inspire was amazing from the first flight, but the flight control was erratic, requiring a lot of practice to be efficient. It is an amazing camera that is a lot more detailed than a GoPro, but not as detailed as an action camera. The flight is smooth, but I wish there was some stabilization (more or less) to make the flight a bit smoother. I'd rate it a 5 star if it didn't require a lot practice to get the hang of it.   it's an amazing addition to the Inspiron family!  the gimbal doesn't come with a mount, you have to get a third party. they do have their own mount, but it isn't great. the gopro mount is great, but you have a ton of weight to be holding in your hands.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I can't go any longer with this device. I have owned a number of electronic gadgets over the years and this is by far my favorite. I use this as a handheld CD player and also as an extra speaker for playing music.   The volume is very easy to adjust.  I have been using this for over two years and it has held up to all the abuse I have thrown at it.  Also the quality of the build is excellent.  The only drawback is that you can't put any headphones on it with the volume at full. The problem is you can only plug in one way.  You can't plug in your headphones the other way. I do have some problems with the built in speakers. They tend to start cutting out around 10-12minutes into a song. This can get annoying. It is a pain to have to constantly restart the music. Overall I am very pleased with this product and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sound: I've heard a number of speakers that have gone through an adjustment period and I must say this is the first speaker that has been the right size to go with my head and ears, and the bass has enough to be impressive even without a subwoofer. The speaker itself is nice and it is easy to connect and turn up to the volume level I like. I would be very happy to have a pair in my home. The Control: I have been working with speakers for over two decades and have come to understand how to control them. The power control is nice. The volume control, though, is a bit of a headache. The level control goes up in steps so when I do not want to turn down the speaker the first level I reach is a step down. The second level of volume has an actual knob that is on the rear of the speaker, but it is also at the rear and requires the use of a screwdriver to turn up/down the volume. The sound quality is good and I really like that the speakers come with a cord as well as a 2 meter cable with 1/4 inch phone plug connectors on one end. If I do find myself using this speaker outside and it needs to be connected to the wall, it is nice that the cables have phone connectors on both ends. The Conclusion:  This speaker is a pleasure to use and sound very good.   I would have liked to have had a bit more bass but for the price you can't complain too much.  Good buy.

One downside to this machine is the heat problems with this laptop, it gets really warm and I get very uncomfortable after about 4 hours, I can only play video games for 15 minutes at a time at this point, I think I am going to buy a new one for a cheaper price so I can get some decent battery life.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this when my wife was pregnant. We used it as a baby monitor, but used it for about 10 hours a day for two weeks while the baby was being tested and she was getting tested. We were able to monitor him by going through his diaper bag and we were able see any issues and make sure we got the right ones and get the right one every time.   In a perfect world I would love to have it permanently attached to our phone. But there is NO WAY I am giving this 5 stars because we've had a few issues: - Not enough usb ports - I would buy a different brand, like the one from the same brand that they sell on amazon and that has the 2 ports (2a and 2b) and I would give it 5 stars - Not waterproof. We use it outside in the rain all the time. Even with a quick wash and dry we still get condensation on the screen - It is very loud, and I can feel the vibration even if I am not touching it

I have found no such evidence to back this claim. I've had no problems at all running any of my PC programs. I haven't heard anyone else report problems. I did find a bit of a problem with the volume, but it's only on one of the speakers. It does work fine with my other speakers, so I won't mind so much. It's really nice to have the ability to store the music I want on the hard drive on the other side of the speaker instead of taking it with me every time I go to change music on my phone. It would be great if they offered a USB connector. It'd make it a lot easier to use in portable situations. I was worried that the small size would be a problem for my baby. It isn't. I used this to set up a low-cost wireless speaker, and it did a pretty good job of it. I just like that I can carry the speakers in my purse instead of a bag or a backpack. I'm glad I purchased this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   If you are going to use a high wattage light source like a headlamp, then you have to consider how it will affect your eyes, but this does not make the unit itself defective. It just depends on how you look at it.    For example, a headlight can be worn all day with no problems if you look through it all the time, but if you never look through a head light, then it is more likely to cause eye strain.  There are several high watt, high power headlamps and lights that can be used, and many models come in both low wattage and high wattages, with the light source on or off. I personally like the Kino Flo Light for my day to day use.  Here are the links for this post: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If the screen is large and good. The quality and looks of this device make this a must.  It is very good quality for a price range. You will love it. I had mine for about 2 years and it has never even been off. You would think it would eventually rust. But it is holding up great. I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing another one very soon. . I love this product it's great for work, travel, etc. The sound quality is pretty good for a tablet. You can see the letters as you type in a text file. I have no problem using this as a work device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing I noticed is that it's a bit bigger than I expected. It has a very unique design that makes it quite different than other keyboards. I also thought that the keys are well made for the price. The buttons were all clicky and felt like they could take a lot of punishment. I found it to be well built, it's very quiet, and feels strong. I only used the wireless feature and it worked well. One thing I liked about this was that there were 2 USB ports and the other on the back. This makes it easy to connect a mouse, keyboard, or other devices. Another thing I like is that there are no software drivers. They just came with the keyboard, so I didn't need to install anything. That's a good thing if you want to get a full-featured, but very minimalist, keyboard. Overall:  The keyboard is quite large, so it's not the perfect size for every person. It's also not the smallest, or most minimalistic. If I was in need of a very minimal keyboard, this would be perfect. If you want an electronic device that you can use on the fly without looking at the keyboard for hours on end, then I would probably stick with something else.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   If I could only buy ONE product from this brand I would buy this product.    My previous digital device was a Dell laptop. It was pretty good but not as good as the Eee PC. The Eee Pad is almost perfect. This device is very well made. It is very thin and light. It does everything I need it to do. It has a very big screen and has nice resolution. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Love my new device and I would recommend it to anyone who likes their music/videogames in stereo.   I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of sound the speakers can produce. The bass is very deep and full.  The sound is not quite as crystal clear as I would like but it is still really enjoyable to listen to.  Great Music / Sound / Interface / Value   It is nice that I can mix my music on my computer, and then use the USB dongle to connect to the speakers. It's a lot easier than using a separate device with my computer. The only thing I don't like about it is the quality of the sound (it's OK). I would rather have a subwoofer/subs inside of the unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is a great portable device. The battery lasts for 6 days (which is more than enough), is quiet, and the quality is great for a small device.  What I like:  . The device itself is small and compact, and is a lot of fun to use. In the video below the device is being tested in a wind tunnel. It's not quite ready for prime time, as it's very noisy, but it should work for some purposes. There are no buttons on the bottom, only the power button. It does have a built in speaker, and it can accept external speakers as well. The back of the device has the usual volume and media buttons, with a "play" button on top. If you like to listen to music while driving or for when you have people over, this would be a good device for you. I will say that for some uses, the device becomes quite loud. I'd recommend this device to anyone with a smaller screen. I have a Nexus 6P which is my other favorite tablet, and I find myself constantly looking at it when I'm driving. This device may be the smaller size for some, but for those with larger screens, it may be a great option.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Good price for a decent product. I am considering purchasing a second one.  Great Value I really like the sound quality of the E6s. My only concern is that I don't like how they look. They are not sleek. I can see how they are better than a normal pair of headphones, but I find it hard to be sold on this looking-for-a-second-and-deciding-what-to-do-with-it-elsewise design choice. Also, I don' t like that they dont adjust from ear to ear very well. The E6's are great for long sessions, but the earbuds just aren' t for me. I would recommend these to anyone who wants an affordable pair of earbud headphones. The sound quality is very good and I'm glad I took the chance on the E3s.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am using this for several of my electronics, I love the sound quality, the light up indicators on the screen is great.  I love it!   "Good product, poor quality" "The sound quality was OK at best. I thought the LED indicator light was bright enough, but it was dimming a lot and turning on to bright. The screen is nice and bright. Not sure why the indicator light dimmed so much. The speakers are OK. But they do not seem to be very loud. This is the second item I have bought from this store. The first one lasted 3-4 months before breaking. The second one has not worked well at all and is now out of warranty. My second problem with the unit is that the screen turns on while the device is idle, so I have to use a power button to turn off. I also can not use the backlight with this unit and the screen. I love this unit so much I ordered a second one. I have an apple ipod touch which works fine. I wish the price was a bit cheaper. I think you should consider a few changes to the unit and get a better one."  Good starter set of speakers I have these in my studio, and they were a little on the loud side, but they do the job. The sound quality is better than I expected. The one thing I will say is that I would love to have the ability to control my sound from a remote. But, this is a very affordable unit that I will keep for now. If they had a USB port, I think it would be ideal. "I love my ipad 5s and the ipad mini. I purchased these speakers for my studio and they are really great. They are nice and lighted. They have a nice bass. They work really well. They do the work when I have my ipads running. If you want a great sound for an affordable price. I highly recommend these speakers. "  The most important product in your studio I am a recording engineer who has worked for over a decade in the music industry as well as being a musician in the last decade. This set up has saved the day! I use this with an ipad and an mp3 player. Everything is in the same place and its easy to manage. I'm a little shocked that I can even call myself an engineer these days. Thank you! "I had the worst experience

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a pretty good   but the size is kinda   big (I mean the screen is big enough, it's still really small). I don't think this is as good as the   Sony   XB650 but it's better than   the  XA750.   The   battery life is a little bit short   and the  button placement is kinda hard . I'd try to buy a   third of a second unit   (I'd even buy it that way) and   get a larger screen if I wanted a laptop.  I bought this because of the smaller size,   because the  cable that comes with it is so cheap, and  because I think this   might be the most comfortable laptop I've ever used. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you have ever had a bad computer (or laptop or phone) then this is the best one I have ever used. I have had no issues, it runs great, the battery lasts me a couple of years without any problems, and the software is very useful. I can't think of another company I trust to provide me with these types of products. It's a good idea to use a USB cable from time to time just to make sure you don't have any issues.  5/5 best buy I own this product since the beginning of January.I love that I can still download all the games, but still have all the software I need to do everything.  in my opinion this is more than worth the money.I have a HP Microtower laptop,but I bought this to replace it and it has been amazing. , July 30, 2010  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dave H. from Excellent I use this laptop for gaming and general productivity. The performance of the processor is excellent, however I do not use it for playing games constantly and I never want to. It has a small keyboard and is a great size for me. As far as battery life goes I have averaged about 3 hours a day of use so far and have not had to charge it since buying it. The graphics of the laptop are great, however there are not a ton of games and it is mostly for office and office work. I will upgrade this with a GTX 660M sometime in the future but I don't think it will be anytime soon because of the price and the power of the Intel HD Graphics 3000. Overall, this is a fantastic product and is an excellent option for anyone. .  to the top
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm very pleased with the build quality and reliability of the LEMO M50/3.0, especially for the price. My only complaint is that when connected to my PC via USB-C cable the charger cable is a bit of a pain to un-cable, because there are no clips on the cable. I'm guessing this is because the USB-c is not a standard male plug. In summary, for the $60.00, this is a top-notch and reliable product. I've already ordered two more of them, just in case I run out of the third one I got.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      Product: I bought a different one a long time ago and it was not the best. I bought this one again because my original one was stolen. This one is much better and does everything I need it to do. The lights are bright and it's easy to operate the lights. The button placement is better, but I'm using a tiny bit of lube with the buttons so it's still OK. My previous one was about $60 and this one I'm about $30 more but for better quality and it has a longer battery life.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best phone I've used   This is my first GSM phone and I don't know if this is the phone for me, but I was really impressed by the performance. The voice assistant works really well and can provide a lot of information. It's a good, sturdy phone. The screen is pretty good for a $200 phone and the battery lasts a good 8 hours before the battery needs to be recharged.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just bought a new laptop and I have not had any problems yet. The battery lasts the whole day but I could use a lot more than the 16.9 hours. I used it at home and in my office (1.4 miles) and it lasted about 2 hours. However, I noticed that it would not hold a charge as fast as my old laptop and had to get the charger to plug in as fast the other. A great device for the price, but if you need a lot of power I would not recommend.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from I love this product The battery is a very good battery, so far. I just upgraded to a new device, an Asus GL551J, so I need to charge it as often as possible and the battery is still at 75% after 3 days. I have no complaints! I have used it for 2 months and I love it. It is very thin and portable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a little bit loud when you first put it on but once you get used to it you can really hear all the details. It's small enough to take anywhere and has a good design.   Pros:  It has good sound quality.  It is very portable, very light, and fits a lot of different kinds of accessories.  Cons:  Its a little loud at first but after awhile you get the hang of it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     "The best keyboard of this model I have ever used"   Reviewed by:  nj (NJ) - April 27, 2012  I recently bought this keyboard because I was looking for a good all-around keyboard. The keyboard has an easy-to-use layout and excellent construction. I love the layout for my on-screen work. One of the best keyboards I have used on any system (PC, tablet, phone, etc.). The built in numeric pad is great for entering my email address and I also like the number pad for entry of my home phone number. My only criticism would be the backlighting. The backlighting is too bright for my tastes and it would be nice if the keyboard could have the capability of backlighting its whole surface, so that my backlighting can be adjusted. Overall, this is a great keyboard and I'm very happy with it."  Write a good review about an old but good product:  Review by: Anonymous - March 18, 2012
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A little more than half the songs are from my favorite band from the 1980s, which is, of course, the Eagles. It takes a little more effort to put the tape on than most other audiophile/acoustic recordings, but the sound is still impressive.  Rated 4 out of 5 by dianew from This Is A Good Recording, Great Price I have owned a few of these tape records, but this one has the best sound and is a little bit bigger than others. It plays like a compact disc. It's good for any size portable player. I just hope it doesn't get ruined by age.  a decent collection with some excellent songs This is a decent series but I prefer the one from the early 80's that has the songs from the albums. The sound is not great but the songs sound good. If you like the Eagles this is a good collection.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I've been using this for about 5 years and I still don't regret my purchase at all.   My only real gripe is that the microSD slot on my laptop is so tiny that I can't insert a full sd card at a time.  I still use the micro sd card as an alternative to a larger card but it's just so annoying having to pull out the micro SD slot.  Also, the micro usb port on my computer is too small for a USB charger.  This is so so close to buying a second phone and just using this one.  So good!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     "I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 for the past month and a half now. It's not the perfect phone. There are times when it freezes, and then it reboots, but I'm happy with it. For example, I just learned that there's a feature that allows you to connect to your cable or satellite box and use the TV on it as a monitor for watching your videos. It allows you a way to watch shows without having to worry about the battery running out. I'm using a HDMI cable from my satellite box. I don't want to replace the entire TV system. I just wanted the TV screen on my S4."  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The quality of this device was excellent! I had a previous laptop that had a similar device that had problems with the display, this one has been up and running perfectly and works just fine! I would highly recommend it.  Noise - The display has a strong contrast to it. The screen is bright. The only complaint I have is that some games I had on the computer (Madden 07, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) will not run on the device. The reason is because they use a game console or emulator which requires more than 100mb of free hard drive space. For some games that might be a problem, but most are fine. 1 of 1 found this review helpful. , October 11th, 2010  Excellent device. . October 11st, 2010By Michael from Chicago, Illinois, United States This is a very good product. I was able to run a recent game of Starcraft II on a Samsung Q25000 without having to go to the computer, which was nice, and the screen has a good contrast.   My only complaint is that the keyboard is very hard to type on and I wish there was a backlight option for that reason.  is really hard to switch to when the screen is on, but the backlight is a good feature.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound is great and the buttons are easy to use. The color is a cool color and the case is very nice to hold. I would like to see a few more buttons on the side, so the user can turn the volume knob from one position to another or have a way to access the settings while wearing it. Other than that it is great, I hope they come out with the next generation as soon as possible.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of my very favorite devices that I have ever owned. The sound quality is outstanding.   I have owned many digital players, and this one just gets the job done. The volume control can be a little sensitive at times, but I think it will get better with use.  My only suggestion would be to have a better-made, heavier weight plastic case than the one provided.  The other reviewers have mentioned the lack of memory storage, and I also think this would have been an improvement.  This is a very versatile and attractive electronic device, which you should own. This review was accurate at the time of this review.  Please contact the manufacturer if you have any problems with this review:  The device I'm reviewing today is the D-Link AC4200 Wireless Audio System.  It is a fairly expensive product, but is a great value for its quality and features.  I was looking for a wireless headset with good sound quality and good bass, and to save a little money I went with the AC4100 which is less expensive and is about the same quality.  As you might have guessed from my last review, the DIR-8500W comes with one 3.5mm to 5.25mm headphone jack, which will work with almost any headphone and most earphones.  You can connect to any type of network by using the wired Ethernet adapter.  Since there is a built in FM transmitter, this device is compatible with any radio station that is broadcast in AM/FM.  Some have also reported that this device works great in China.  D-link has a long history of reliability in the wireless audio industry, which has kept this device in the market for years.   The sound of the AC 4200 Wireless audio system is good.  All of the audio output settings are easily changeable and easily accessed.  If you have multiple devices connected to this system it will work well for everyone.  A little extra expense may be justified for a better case, but that isn't a huge deal for me.  When it comes to sound quality, the sound from the AC4000 is better than the AC3200 which is more expensive and a bit heavier.  Sound quality on this device with this radio is better then most other inexpensive wireless products.  I purchased this product to use with my Xbox 360.  For the money, I was not disappointed.  While there are cheaper wireless
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have 2 of these and one of them works perfectly as described. I am very pleased with the electronic equipment.   The only reason I did not give it 4 stars was the battery. The power of this is very good for my small space but when it is time to charge the battery takes 2 or 3 hours to charge, and then only partially charged it takes another 3-4 hours before it works fully.  I am a little concerned because this is a great product but I am glad that it is a reliable product. If I had a more efficient power source I might not mind it so much but this is not the way it should work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A really nice little device that works as promised.   My only real complaint is that the button is not backlit.  It's a little hard to see with the brightness adjusted up too high.  I know the device is rated for "Low Power" and that some of the reviews mention the device "draining" a lot of battery power. However, my phone is getting 6-7 hours of daily use on "Standard" brightness settings. This makes the "Low power" feature seem rather worthless.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing that attracted me to this was the fact that it is built like a tank - this is not a phone for people that want a small device that can be carried in a pocket. I bought a few small ones in the past and they got damaged over time. I thought I would give this a try because the small phone seemed like a great option but I guess I was wrong. I use the phone for voice calls and text messages. The screen has plenty of space for my thumbs and if I had to say one thing that was a turn off - it is a tiny phone and I could not find a place to attach a battery. The battery life seems like it will last me for a couple of months. There are some positives about this phone that make it worth a try: The screen is large. It fits in my hand quite well. I can read the text with ease and the touch screen is good. The phone has wireless charging. There is a "power saver" function that lets you turn off WiFi and other features when you are away from the phone. The main problem with this phone is the battery. It doesn't seem like it would last long so that is a negative. However, I do think the phone will last you for a good long time. Also, if you want a smart phone and don't mind the battery life - go for this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a great little device.   I use it as my daily driver for work and my kids use it in their classes, etc.  I've never owned an Apple product before and haven't had much use for the iPad.  It works great!    The only problem I have with it is that it does have a headphone jack, and when you need to talk to others at the table you have to keep the device close to you to not spill your drink.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      If you have been waiting for an iPhone since the iPhone 1/1c and want the best of both worlds, then this is your phone.   For those of you that have never heard of a 7600, it is a 2.3GHz dual core processor with a built in accelerometer, compass, and barometer.  It has 2 GB of RAM, and the display is a 3.5 inch TFT touch screen with 1024 x 768 resolution.  Its size is a little on the small side but it is still manageable.  The 7600 has dual sim card slots and a microSD slot, and as expected, it has WiFi, 3G, 3.0, GPS, and all the other goodies of the iPhone 4.  There are no external speakers on this phone, so you have to get on the phone to listen to music.   This device does have its flaws, as most of the time, if you have a decent wifi connection, you will get a good speed and great sound.  When you're outside, the wifi connection might not be so great.  This is another area where the iPhone is much better than this device.  With that being said, you don't have to worry about your phone getting low on battery and dropping you off at the park to get it fixed.  You also have the option of charging with the microUSB port, as this is not a battery extender. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased a T-Mobile Samsung S6 Edge+ on a contract from T-Mo (no monthly fees or service contracts). I am really glad that I bought this phone because the battery life is very good. I also like that the S6 Plus has very good camera, speaker and front camera (the only thing I would change is the lack of 4G LTE). I plan to use the phone to listen to music, read ebooks, take pictures, play games and play games that require lots of buttons. The battery is good enough to make it through an entire workday. As a bonus, I also purchased a charger from Tmo, a good case, ear buds (they're pretty good for the price) and a pair of headphones that come with a case as well. The case is good, but I didn't use it so I'm not sure what kind of protection it provides against drops. Overall, the phone works fine. Overall:  The S6 edge+ is a nice phone that is better than many of the phones you can buy for under $200 and it is also a good value for money if you can find a good deal on the phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     4 out of 5 stars A few complaints, but not a major one: I have owned this flashlight for almost three months now, and it's done everything I wanted it to. I'm an outdoor enthusiast and a firefighter. I have been looking for an LED flashlight for years, and this one is the best I've come across so far. The head of the flashlight is very slim, which means it's compact, yet it fits well in my pocket. The light is bright, but also very steady. There is also a secondary light that runs on the back side of the LED that is useful if I'm in the dark, but only runs on a single AA battery. The battery lasts quite a while (I have had it for almost 3 months), and the output is good. It's also small, compact, and very portable. A nice addition to my flashlight arsenal.  5 out of 6 stars Awesome! I use this flashlight on a daily basis to work in the yard and in the basement. It has a decent output and is easy to use. I found the only issue with the light is the battery life. It lasts about 1.5 hours on average. It also has a bit of a hum when you turn it on.  the only problem with it  3 out of 3 stars Disappointed After using a number of this light in different situations, I have to say the output falls far short of what the specs are claiming. The beam is bright and the head is perfectly sized. However, when in low light, it's a challenge to make out the details. The built quality is good and the only drawback is the price (although it is probably worth it to many people). I was expecting more from this light.  be wary, it is advertised as having a low light output, but it is nowhere close to that. With the flashlight on, the output just falls off a cliff in low lighting (even though I'm using the highest quality batteries available). That being said, its small size, small batteries, and compact size make this flashlight a fantastic value in my opinion.  to use in the field, its better to turn it to a low beam mode or to use the red side, but with the red the beam is very good to see what the other is seeing. It works great in the garage as a flashlight  1 out of 1 stars So far I have only used this for a short period of time.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So after I got the "good deal", I realized I actually needed a good computer for my office, and I didn't want to spend $1500-3000 on a machine that wouldn't really help me, when I would need a lot more than I could afford.   I was so wrong!   The thing works awesome!  It's extremely fast and responsive, so there is no lag when I'm typing or clicking and clicking on webpages, and when I use my tablet to watch movies.  It also has a very good screen for viewing pictures or reading books.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that it has a keyboard that gets annoying after awhile, and is annoying for all of the right reasons.  I wouldn't recommend it if you just want a decent computer for your office.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first and last time I buy from this store. I ordered 2 of these for my sons and they loved them. They are so simple but are very powerful. They last all day and we love that we are using them for our daily needs. We got one for each and they are going to be on their books. The best place to buy such an inexpensive electronic device like this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - You must install a new battery when you replace the batteries on your electronic devices.   (It should also work just fine without the battery.)    - The batteries should last you several years, but you will eventually have to replace them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod is a wonderful device for anyone with a portable audio player that's easy to operate. The sound quality on the device is superb, and I've listened to my music on it without any problem.   My iPod uses an iPod nano, but if you want to play older music files that have a larger file size than your iPod Nano, there's an option to upgrade to a larger iPod.  I've only listened to music I bought from iTunes so far, but I have no problems listening to my regular iPod music.  You can purchase a wireless Bluetooth keyboard for your iPod   The iPod works in any room of a house that is close to an internet connection.  It can be used as a laptop, or you can store it in your bag or desk for a convenient wireless storage. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Eager to try this for the first time...It looks great, works great and has some cool features. It's great for those who want something a little more compact but also have a screen that they can look at for longer. It can be a great accessory or a standalone device for those times when you don't need an external display on your smartphone. Overall I'm very impressed with this product. If I'm ever in a pinch, this will get my phone on the spot.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sony RX100 II is a great camera! The image quality is excellent. I have only had it a few days so I can't say for sure yet but I do know the images are good. The video quality is better than expected. The camera is very lightweight. I am also very pleased with the build quality. A big plus for me is the ability to sync the camera with my iPod. This will come in handy for shooting when my iPod is in the car. I'm glad I bought this camera. I will definitely be buying more.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The main problem I had with the product is that the screen and the buttons aren't easy to press:  This screen is small and doesn't give the same kind of precision I expect from a more expensive device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first device I bought from GearBest was the Zadig DSP RDA.   The device was excellent, and although the build quality was decent, the lack of dual coils is a turnoff for me.  In a world of RDAs with dual coils, you're better off buying a cheaper device if your budget is $50 or less.  After that I purchased the RDAs from a couple of other vendors.  One of them is the Pico Mod.  The build quality on the Pio is fantastic, and the Pivo-style device has the perfect balance of strength and portability.  As far as the build goes, the device can be upgraded with a micro usb connection, so there's no fear of breaking the device.  I also purchased the Zodig Pro 2, which I think is a good device for the price.  The Zodiga Pro is smaller than the Zdig Pro, but feels more solid.  If you're buying from a third party, make sure you have a third-party battery pack.  This is an electronic device that's designed to last, and it's not cheap.  There are a lot of reviews online, but they aren't very helpful.  To get a device that looks good, have a few good reviews, and don't have too many issues with the battery, I recommend checking out these other products:  Pico Mini Pro (Zdig), and Zodigi Pro (Pico). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first electronic device I have owned that has worked well with my iPhone and iPod Touch (which are my only electronic devices). I had read other reviews that had said the power was not good. Not true. It takes only about 30 minutes to charge up my phone and it is totally usable right out of the box. The controls are easy to use and the controls are just about right on my iPhone. The only negative thing about this device is that it doesn't have bluetooth. But that isn't a major problem with a device of this type.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   So far the Sennheiser HD800 has been a great performer for me. While there is a slight drop in sound quality compared to its other rivals, it's still more than good enough for me - especially considering the price point. While not as detailed as the Beyerdynamic DT880, and not as smooth as the SVS U90, I can't really tell if the HD800 is less than perfect. I'll have to find out in a couple weeks if I can give it a full five stars or not. I'm more concerned about the high-end headphone. I've had very little luck with them. The Senns are very loud, they get hot, and they have a very heavy bass. The soundstage is a bit on the small side, the mids aren't that well defined, and the treble doesn't have that natural crispness that the better mids provide. The treble is definitely a let down. The headphones will sound like I've plugged my guitar into a fuzz box, with some decent highs. They just don't cut it in comparison to the S8's or my favorite, the Koss Porta Pro. Hopefully, Senn will be able to fix the trebles by the time the HD700 comes out in the fall. I was planning on buying one when the HD600 came out. I had the chance to play with the S800's at a music festival and I really liked them. I thought that the S6100's bass and treble would be nice for playing EDM, but they weren't. My friends at work were extremely jealous, so I never got to buy one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like this product and I have used it many times. It has a good sound.   The batteries are a little heavy though.   My first audio system and I love it! Reviewed By: Charles S on 09/25/2017 Rating: 4 of 5 Stars!  I had a problem with the sound a few weeks ago. I have a pair of cans from the early 80s that were in the shop for a while before I bought this. After hearing a lot about the Yamaha R50, I decided to give this a try. It is a nice product. I love the Yamaha sound but I have also got used to the sound of the NAD S-1000. When I bought the R50 my only gripe was with the controls on the back panel. For some reason they're all different heights which seems silly. The controls are a pain to get to. This is a great system but I'm still a little annoyed with the buttons on the front panel.  A good sound at a great price ReviewedBy: Brian H on 05/30/2017 Total Rating: 5 of 5 Pros: easy to set up and set up easy to use great sound for the price great value and great sound Cons: None other than being a big fat idiot. I bought it and it broke within 4 hours. I thought it was a piece of junk. I could barely take it out of the box and once it was out of my hand I found it just barely had enough juice to make a couple of clicks. I had been playing the R10 for about 8 years before I got the R52 and that thing was solid as a rock. I guess I can't expect much more than what I'm getting with the Yamaha. I don't play any louder than a whisper and I play almost all the time at home. This thing is nice but just not enough to call a "sound system". I don'T get that good of a sound out of it.  the only problem with this thing is it broke in four hours and I am a fat idiot that bought the system and then broke it. I am going to have to get another. it broke the first day of use and now I have to try and fix it again. But I donot know what else to get. The R52 is way better.

I bought this to have a portable speaker that I could take with me while walking or riding a bike. The sound is clear and dynamic and has a nice smooth high end. I can really enjoy listening to music while on the go. I'm considering a second one for my bedroom. "  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod Touch does exactly what I want it to do; It's a pretty good music player, although the lack of features is a bit of a shame. I've been buying them since they were first released, because you never know when you might be in the market for one. The iPhone is another device that I use on a daily basis, especially on my commute. It's not the best sounding device out there, but for its price range, I think it's pretty good. Overall, the iPod Touch is not the greatest I've owned, but I'm not going to sell it because it doesn't offer what I really want and need. I'm very pleased with it and recommend it to those looking for a good device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    What I use (for the purposes of this review)   I use the Enermax A-102B at 100W AC. It's a decent AC adapter. It can handle anything from AC power to 5V DC. It takes a lot of power for it to get to its full 200W output. I like the AC adapter because I can run it directly off the wall outlet. When I used the B-102 to power an old USB light (which it also is very good at), it wouldn't take much to turn it into a mini USB charger (which can charge other devices).

But it has a better range than my ipods! I have an iphone 6 plus and it wont connect. So this works great for me. It has the highest quality. I also like the fact it has the built in bluetooth. It's so nice to have music that you can listen to on my iPhone without having to use my ipad. It really is the best!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The VX-100 is a very compact handheld device. It fits comfortably in my right hand. The battery life is very good. The buttons are responsive and have good tactile feedback. The touch screen interface is responsive as well and makes it easy to navigate menus. The audio quality is very strong, and the VX has an amazing sound quality.  Write a negative review about an okay electronic device or device that's not as good as it should be:   The VX, the V-series is an entry level portable sound device. The V-100 has the ability to connect with a USB device via a cable. It has the most features for a portable music player and audio player. It can be used to play MP3 music files but also plays some standard CDs. The screen is quite small and is hard to view in direct sunlight. However, the touchscreen display can display video and is very responsive and simple to use. You may have issues connecting the unit to the USB ports. You can use a USB cable to connect the device to your computer. The controls on this unit are a little confusing. There are several controls on the front and the controls are laid out in a way that can be confusing. The volume control is the largest and easiest to reach control on the device. However the "Up/Down" and "Menu" buttons are hard to find. Also, the backlight control is a bit dimmer than it should to be, as well as the "Home" button. Finally, the unit is not as loud as it could be. Overall, it is a decent device for those who want an inexpensive but reliable portable player to have with them for everyday use.  the volume control and the remote controls are the biggest weakness on this product. The remote controls do not seem to be as large as they could be due to the large size of the buttons. This unit has a lot of features. The display is the most important aspect of this unit as it has to be readable in direct light. The unit does not have speakers or a headphone jack. The sound quality is the main highlight of this device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a good product. I have bought many other models and this is the only one that has stayed on the cord. It does get a little warm. I was able to get it to work from my old battery as well. I am pleased with the service provided by this company as well as the quality and price.  Rated 5 out of 5 by David from Product works Great, Very light. , I am a retired computer technician, and I was trying to replace a battery that had expired. I found this one at the electronics store. I installed it without even opening the box. It is so light that it feels like there is no weight to it at all! It is perfect for my needs as my computer needs to be at a different room from my other gadgets, so I can put them all away at night, but have the battery life to use my laptop during the day. And now my only battery, battery that was 3 years old, finally has some use again! I can now sleep comfortably knowing that I have the ability to use the computer when I need it!  The battery is really light, but I don't like the small metal cover which will not fit into the battery compartment. It would be a great improvement.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Z-Series has a great balance of power and portability.   There are several improvements that I've found over the previous Z-100s I've owned, the most important of which is that the battery now comes in a pouch and the portability is better.  The Z-120's are very similar but with a larger size screen and better sound.  There is a slight downside to the screen being smaller but at least the portablity is better this time around.  For $120, it's hard to complain.  It's easy to plug in and has a nice feel in the hand.  This is the best portable electronic I have owned.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very interesting little device! It's great for when I'm looking for a little digital device to play music on. The volume knob is good, with no need to mess with the knobs to change the volume on the device itself. The LED lights are also very well laid out and show me the volume changes on the music player. The USB port is a great addition! The software is a bit buggy, but at least it's got a pretty decent interface. The only problem is that the software will not be updated when the manufacturer releases new features for the next software revision. In the next version they will update the software to be more user friendly and add better controls and functions.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've used my Sennheiser HD 800 for about 2 years now.   It's a lot of fun to play music from my computer and headphones on it.  If you need a good stereo with a large sound stage,  you may want to try out the HD 800.  It would be good to have a smaller, less expensive version that was more portable.   Best Bang for the Buck   The Senns are excellent for both PC and phone use.  Their fidelity is above-average, but the price is a little on the expensive side.

I bought this to replace my A3 and the A2x but this one is much better and has a larger screen so I've added it as a second option for the A3's user.  I am considering buying the same model for the other computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like this laptop. This is my first PC and I can't say enough good things about it. It is small enough to have in my backpack but powerful enough to do everything. It has great storage and is very quiet. It does not use the SSD, so it is a little slower but I do not know if that matters. It's great for someone who doesn't need or want the speed of a 1.5ghz or 2ghz. It can run any OS, Windows, OSX, Linux, Android and even Windows XP. I love the touch screen and the keyboard is a lot better than most of the laptops I've seen. All in all a great choice and a great buy.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     The iPad Mini has a lot going for it. It's great value for money, it's got plenty of power and memory, and it's the size of a tablet. All things considered, it is a very good buy.   The only downside is that the battery life is short, and that's true in most cases (which is a shame). The screen is excellent, although in my experience it tends to be a little overbright. It can display a huge number of text characters, but the handwriting recognition is pretty poor.  This is an amazing device, and the iPad Mini is an excellent portable device, although not as good as the Kindle.  A very good purchase!

Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.  4/5 for an amazing price:     This is an amazing deal! I really love how everything is connected, the music player, the phone, the GPS, and so much more.  If you're looking for a great little device, this is it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I've owned the C.T.R. for about two months now. It works perfectly for my needs. I do use my iPhone for work and everything in it, but my C.S.T.-100 is my main phone. I never use my S8 or Galaxy Note 7 and the CTR-100 works perfectly in those situations. I highly recommend the CTF-100 for anyone. Thank you for such a high quality product.  Pros:  I love it. I have been searching for a good dual battery with a 3rd party battery replacement option for a long time. I purchased this product from B&H a year ago because the price was much better than any other option out there. I've had this C.A.T for about a month now and I have yet to have any issues with it. The quality is excellent for the price. I am very pleased with it, it's one of the first things I plug in for my phone when I get home. The design is very appealing to my eyes too. You should take a look at this page, a lot of people are going to be interested in purchasing the same thing. It can be quite pricey, but you get what you pay for with this product. I would recommend it to someone that is looking for a budget dual battery, or people who are interested in having a replacement battery for an older device. If you want a solid battery and not looking to spend alot of money or want something with great quality that comes with a lifetime warranty then this is a great buy. It is very small and very sleek. I purchased this item directly from BH.com and there was no sales tax. The delivery was excellent as well and I had no issues in getting the order to the delivery location.

What I liked about the  :  One nice thing about this product is that it is easy to change the color to match your personal style.  It comes with a battery pack that is rechargeable and has enough power to run most of the electronics I've seen it used for.  I did have to upgrade the charger to the one included to give it more power, but that is very easy to do.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking to purchase a replacement for my Samsung Galaxy Tab3 10.1 on a pay-what-you-want basis, and I decided on the HP Touchpad 3.   In the past, when a new device would be my first or second laptop for the new year, I was looking for a solid device that wouldn't break, that would last the whole year. I ended up with the Touchpad.  I used it for a while and then it got too expensive, so I got a second one.  To me, the 2nd one was more like a companion, and that is what I use it for most of the time.  The Touchpad 2 is the same as the first one except that it has an extra row.  It is not a keyboard and only a single row. The screen on the 2 is not as sharp as the original. But when you consider that I use the Touchpads for browsing the web, ebooks, and general web usage, I don't really care.  However, if I want to be able to type at all, and if I am a power user, I get a different set of features from the TouchPad.  In general, the TouchPads are great to use.  When they last long, they are cheap and durable.  For $29.00, I would not hesitate to recommend them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Thank you, so much! This is my favorite device I have ever owned. I have my trusty old computer laptop, but I have to wait until I am older to buy a new computer. The new Apple iMac is awesome. The display is crisp, the sound is fantastic, and I love all the upgrades. I also like that they have included AppleCare as an added service. I would recommend this product to anybody looking for a new high quality computer.   I think it is about time they updated their website a bit. It's still great, but it feels like it's been several years since I've used it. The best thing to do is go ahead and order the latest iMac.  The iMac comes with 3 year warranty.  For $1.99/month you can get unlimited storage, a good fast processor (1.3 GHz), 1 TB of hard drive space, 4x CD/DVD-R/RW/DVD+RW, and a great screen.  I think it's worth the price to get a good computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using a small lighted flashlight with a red light (3V LED) for the past year, and my wife and I were really enjoying the performance of this flashlight. This flashlight does a great job of shining bright light into tight spaces and being very easy to operate, it has some serious output and light output. We have it set up with a 2x1 1/2 inch socket and it is very secure. I like the way that the light comes on when you crank the switch, and I like how easy the light is to see when turned on. The best part of this device is that it is small, the battery lasts a long time, and it uses very little power when it is on. This is not a cheap flashlight and this is not the flashlight for everyone, however it is a solid, reliable, and good looking flashlight. I would recommend this light to someone looking for an affordable, reliable flashlight that has a great light output and will last a long while.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you are considering a wireless keyboard and mouse, you may be looking for a way to plug the device in via the USB cable. The best wireless keyboard that I have found so far, is this model:  Another model that I haven't tried yet, but would like to is this: It comes with a 1,000 feet, 5 volt battery that is not rated for more than 4 hours of operation per charge.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was a big step up from my previous keyboard. It is nice and large and I like that the keycaps are Cherry MX.   The keyboard is sturdy and has a nice matte finish and the function keys are easy to activate with a thumb. I like the way that it comes in two colors: a white one, and a black one, so it's a nice choice if you're into that.  One thing I didn't like, is the cable is not that thick and I prefer thicker cables. But again it works well and it's very nice looking.   I wish the keyboard came with two USB ports, so that I could use my iPhone and laptop. But other than that the keyboard is a great buy and the price is amazing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So far, this is one of the most powerful desktop computers I have ever used. It has all of the features you would want, and is very easy to use.   I purchased it on sale in November and purchased the upgrade kit on the 25th, and it is well worth the money.  You get 8 GB of RAM, an i5 processor, 16 GB of hard drive space, and an ATI graphics card that will turn most graphics cards into toys.  It has 8 CD-ROM drives so you don't have to plug in external drives and it also has a DVD-RW drive so you can read DVDs while you play your games.  I love that you can add any peripherals that you want, like a mouse and keyboard.  This is the best gaming computer I have bought for a long time.

I am happy with my purchase.  - I bought this unit with the intention to use it as a scanner in a scanner. This device does a superb job of scanning. The only issue I had was with the cable. I don't have a scanner and bought the unit expecting a decent cable. Unfortunately, the cable that came with the unit didn't work. I had to go to my local computer store to find a decent quality cable for this unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A+ It works perfectly. Very good performance. I can use a mouse with it without any problems. I would buy this again.   I'm using it with Windows XP.  Great Product, Great Price, Great Service... What could be better than this?    There is a problem with Windows 8 64-bit. The mouse stops working after a while. The problem is the driver is incompatible with Windows 7 64-Bit. You have to use Vista 64- Bit drivers. But the mouse works fine on Windows 8.  This is a great product and I would recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As soon as I picked up my Nixie tube with the red light on it, I thought it would be too bright.   But it is not.  It looks like the old t.v. when it was new, but the picture on the back is much sharper than the old tubes.  My son and I just love the colors on it.  We bought a set of three, two for each kid and they are doing fine.  If they didn't have these we'd probably be looking at another model, but we LOVE the Nixie tubes!  I can't wait for the new model. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing I noticed about the TRS cable was the feel in my hands; it's not a bulky cord that feels too heavy for a phone. It's a smooth metal and feels great in my hand. I've never been one for the bulky look of a phone case (like my iPhone 4/4s), but I got this for a gift and love it.   A quick review on the microphone, while I have not had the device on me yet, it's good for talking over a speakerphone as it picks up my voice well and is clear.  The design of the phone is nice, the back is smooth and looks good. The only negative is the charging cable, I wish it was a little shorter. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Kogan K6-V2 works flawlessly and the build quality is great.   I've only had it a month but I can say that it has surpassed my expectations, in every way. I have two others (Kogan K5 and K5V1) and the K5 is still going strong, but the Kogan has surpassed both of them.  In terms of sound quality the K6 is really amazing.  The bass is very clear and has a really nice smooth high end.  I would say that the mid range is very good as well.  Bass is very punchy but not very fatiguing.  It has a good soundstage and a nice size as well with lots of bass response, and a slightly mid-forward sound.  Overall the sound quality is very impressive and very much worth buying. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The X-RAY WORKS.   A must have for my son who has autism.  He loves it and he's been using it for months.  This is a very good product and we highly recommend it.  Rated 3 out of 5 by John from Good but not great I like the technology but it did not come with the appropriate tool to turn the units on and off, so when we started to use it we had to go out and buy it. But other than that it was a good product.  is a good thing for those that have autistic children, the unit works well and has very good tech support. the only thing I wish it had was a way to change the brightness setting and the light up, but i'm hoping that it will get there before my son gets his first dose of medicine in a month or so.

I've had it for about 2 weeks now and love it!!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm on my third generation Apple iMac. It's still the best machine for me, and I still prefer it to my previous machine. The new model is pretty much identical to the previous model, and it just keeps getting better. The screen is wonderful; it's bright, clear, and sharp.   The graphics card (for me) is an Intel GMA X3100, and the onboard sound is great; my older Apple laptop speakers were still getting old and weak in comparison. The only thing that doesn't make this machine any more awesome than the first two is the sound system; it is very quiet, and is actually worse than my older iMac computer speakers. That said, I've gotten used to it now, and don't care for it any more. The keyboard is a little smaller than the old model, but otherwise it's identical. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPhone 5S is a good device.   It has a great camera and good camera software.  I can get a good photo at 2 in the morning and good photos with my phone at night.  If you are the type of person that uses a phone for photography it is the right device for you.  The only con is the camera is on the lower right and the left.  There is no zoom feature.  It would have been nice to have it on the top of the camera. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned two of the Samsung Smart TV's and one of the Panasonic TX-SR500. All of the TVs have been top quality in every way. I use them to watch TV shows on Netflix, Hulu and other apps. I have the new TX-T series and am very pleased with the picture quality. They are very easy to set up and operate with the remote. The HDMI input will work on my new Samsung and they don't take up too much space. The only downside I can see is they are a bit noisy when the TV is on and they need a good hard wipe. I also see some people say they get flakey picture but I am sure they could turn the noise down or they could buy an external speaker.    Customer Service (21 ratings) 4.6

This keyboard was perfect and I have been using it for about 2 weeks. It is comfortable, responsive and it is built for my laptop. I highly recommend this keyboard. I have the apple keyboard and love it but this one is so much better in every way. If you like your computer to look like a real laptop, get this."

I have to say that it is quite the "wow" moment when it comes to the power it provides. It doesn't give me a ton of juice, but it does the job well. It's easy to use, has an excellent battery life, and is a great starter.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using the Samsung  Smart TV for 4 years now. It is the best product I have ever used in my life. My kids like the way it looks. My wife loves the way she can watch her favorite tv show on the big screen, even with my 3 year old.     This TV is very smart as well. My smart phone is the main interface with many apps. It connects to the  TV and is connected to my computer (which is connected via ethernet cable) with the help of a special card. This is my favorite way to go between my smart phone and the TV.  This is a Samsung Smart TV and it is one of the best in its class.

If you are considering buying any e-readers for the first time you are in for a big disappointment.  The e-Readers I received are poor copies of their expensive counterparts.  I had been looking for a replacement for my old e-Book reader for some time and this is it!   When I first picked this one up I was very excited.  It is just beautiful, the colours are beautiful.  After using it for a few weeks I could not be happier with the performance.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The new model from Apple will make the iPod touch worth it." -- The Verge, May 22, 2013  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The screen is great, but the volume control is horrible. The display is easy to use, but not as bright or as crisp as it could be. The buttons are okay. The phone does not have a good build quality, and the buttons are not all the way down and not as flush. Overall, the phone is a decent phone. I don't think I'll buy another LG phone, and my review for this one reflects that.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been very happy with the VX6e. I have a Mac Mini that is running a 5.0GHz Intel Core 2 Duo CPU with 16GB RAM and a 2TB HD. The video is excellent on my 5 year old Mac. For $600, the V6e is a real bargain. It is fast and stable and will work with almost any software I use. For those that want a powerful desktop computer, but don't want to pay $5000 for a pro, the VI6e will be a perfect compromise for you.   I bought this machine so I can replace my iMac. It has all the power I need in a mini form-factor, with a much smaller screen and much improved speed.  I bought this device for myself because I work on a Mac and I don't have a Pro or an Apple Cinema Display and wanted something that would replace my Apple Cinema Displays.  This is a very fast machine and as someone who uses both a Mac Book Pro and an iMac at work, I found that the V9 has a big advantage over my i Mac and my Dell XPS 8300.  The V9 is a great computer for the money and can replace the old iMac for me. I now have a portable Mac with all my other tools.  It is not a perfect computer and I am still waiting for it to be released but it is a nice change of pace for me and I'm very happy I purchased it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My Sony Playstation 3 has been on and off my wrist since Christmas, and it is well worth the wait!   The only complaint is that the strap that comes with it is a bit short (like about a 6") and it needs to be a little longer.  The light also is a little weak for the price, but at least it's easily adjustable and the light is always on, even when I'm using the camera.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My husband has been using the iPod Touch, 3g, and iPod Classic for over a year now. He just replaced them with a new Apple TV 4 (a new generation of Apple TV). It was only about $100. It's fast, good sound and a great screen. I'd never buy a new iPod because it's a little clunky for me but the one I got works perfectly! I wouldn't be without it now!  Rated 1 out of 5 by Kebbiek from I don't like the new Touch The quality of the device is not as good as the old ones. I also tried the new touch on other devices and I don,t like that as well.  5 out of 6 found this review helpful I just got the Apple TV. I was hesitant about buying one because of the cost and the fact that it's so easy to program but I think that's what Apple is good at! The tv comes with a lot of tv programs and videos. The movies that are available are great too! It's the fastest internet connection I have ever had in my life. It has a great display so you can watch in bright colors and low light situations.

The price is reasonable and the battery life is excellent. Great for anyone who travels.   I recently bought the ipad and I love it. Its small, but has great features. I had no problems with it during the travel time as the instructions were well written.  My husband has the iPhone too. Its very easy to use, and he has used it for years now. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The phone is awesome. The battery lasted for a whole day (5 hours of normal use) without having to charge once. The price isn't bad as it doesn't cost as much as a lot of other phones but the battery is very nice.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The e-book reader that I have had for the past six months has done a great job reading my books, and has saved me many hours of reading time. It is the best e-reader for the money. My only complaint would be that if it did not support the new Kindle Paperwhite, which I purchased to go with the Kindle Paperthin, the reading experience would be more like an expensive tablet than an e-Reader.    The Good: Good overall performance and excellent screen. Easy to read. Good speed and easy to navigate.  I was a bit concerned about buying this because of the low battery life (about 2-3 weeks), but this is a good e- reader. It has a good display that can handle a lot, as well as a very fast and quiet device.  The Bad: Only has a 5 inch display.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this because I really wanted a Bluetooth headset for my Xbox. The design was great, and the quality was better than any Bluetooth headset I have ever bought. The headphones have a good sound, but they are not perfect. I have used them to play games and listen to music, but I wish the cords came out a bit farther. I don't have much experience with wireless headsets, so I don t know why they have so many wires. The battery lasts a long time, but is a little loud. I think it could use a little more battery life, but that might be because it is so tiny. It is really just a good headset for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is my new favorite headphone. I have several of the DT770s that I have been using and love the sound and features that they provide.  My only con is that the soundstage is not as deep as my favorite headphones. The bass is still very tight and deep and the mids are very detailed, but the mids aren't quite as smooth as the Sennheisers for example. I use these with my iFi Pro (with Senns) and they have amazing bass quality and imaging.  and I can really enjoy the music on this pair. The quality of this headphone is amazing. Highly recommended.  (from Amazon review on the Audio-GD page) This headphone is a very good choice. The sound is very open, clean, and precise. This headphone gives me the best imaging and detail of any headphone I have. I would like to add that I am currently using the JH13 for music, which is a different type of headphone. As such, I would probably go for a different headphone for mixing and mixing in general (if that is a subject you are interested in).  (from review by Mark B on Head-Fi) I'm using the DT 770 as a headphone amp. I've been using it with my Koss KSC75 Mk II amp. The DT 770s provide a very well balanced sound which gives a very nice sound. It doesn't sound like the Koss amp sounds like but in a good way. I love the quality of sound this headphone provides but I find that with the amp it gives me a warmer sound. The amp can give a more bass heavy sound but the DT's sound much better and have more clarity and good treble. The headphones don't have bass at the same level as the KSC. The KSC's have a nice bass but the 770's are better for me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you are in a search for a good quality portable audio device, then I think you may be interested in the Audio-Technica AT40USB. This is an inexpensive unit that includes 2.0m of audio, 2.1m of built-in rechargeable batteries, and the sound quality is top notch. The USB is capable of outputting up to 200mW of sound (on a single channel), which is plenty of power to enjoy your favorite songs. For $50 you are getting a great audio unit, even if it is just a toy. I personally bought the model number "AT40USB-R" and I got the blue variant, although there is a red model that you can also get as well. Included in the box: 1 x AT40 USB 1 x charger 1 x mini-phone cable 1 x carrying case   Features of the AT40: 1.2m (4.1 feet) of clear, full-bandwidth audio. 1m (3.8 feet) is the length of a full-size Bluetooth speaker. 2.4m (8.4 feet) - with the headphone jack, there is 3.2 meters (9 feet) if you can't reach the USB jack. 1.1x the power output of any device with a headphone jack.   Power: 200m W or 1.5W of power.   The headphone jack is used to charge the batteries, so only the USB output is powered.    The built-ins include 2.5m of output (or a total of 3.5 meters of audio), and 1.8m (6.5 feet) to 2.8 meters of output. I did not take audio sample recordings but I'm fairly confident the sound was as good as you will get from a portable device. If you want a portable sound unit that's easy to travel with and still has plenty of output power, then you should definitely consider the Audio Technica AT 40USB.  With this price, I have to assume there are better devices to choose from. I'd like to hear some more sound samples.  For the average user:  I would consider this a great value.  The USB-powered audio is more than enough power for most applications.  An hour with my music at normal volume settings on the built-to-be-outstanding sound quality and a few hours of streaming

If you don't mind a lot of wiring, this is a really good gadget. The sound is excellent, and the image quality is good enough to be able to use in the field. It is a bit pricey for what you get, but in my opinion, you get what you pay for. I would buy this gadget again.

It's light and simple enough for any task, and when you need a big chunk of memory to do something, it's easy to load up and switch between them to get the needed work done. I really enjoy having an external drive for work on my PC (or laptop) and having it here on my iPhone/iPad, too.   Overall, it works well and I like the fact that I can keep it on my keychain when I need to access it more often than usual. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this device to make my kids less disruptive. We have a 7 yr old with ADHD. The older children in the family would interrupt his playing because he was getting bored. Now, the younger boys won't interrupt him even though he is using a tablet with no problems. I have tried using a Kindle or even a smart phone as well as an iPad but neither have been effective. The one thing that I have found about the iPac is that it takes a little longer to charge so I keep an extra battery in the house for those times when I forget to charge my battery. - David P.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The only time I have ever been dissatisfied with an electronic device has been with my iPhone, but that is because I've always kept my iPhone in my back pocket and never had it in my hands. With this watch, I have to think that I may want to put it in one of my pockets as it does not have a clasp, but it works very well! I think it is a very smart idea to make the watch with an integrated charger rather than the charging adapter that comes with the watch. That is my only complaint about the watch itself but I like the fact that I can still charge it by plugging it into a wall socket. This watch is well made, a very nice value and it makes me want a pocket sized watch as I already have one of those!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I own the WAV+ and it does the job, it just doesn't get the job done well, I use it when I want to listen to music while driving, the bass is just okay, the sound is a bit distorted, I'm a basshead, I usually listen to bass heavy music. The WAV is a great sounding audio player, I've found that if I put it in my car and put in my iPod (iPod mini) and my MP3 player, it's a great music player, no issues with volume, it does a great job, even the speakers are good. It's a really good player for the price, I do wish it had more than just a CD player, like a CD changer would be a nice add on. It will definitely get used, but it's worth it for the added functions.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking to replace my broken iPad mini 4 and iPad air 2 with this one. The design is good, the buttons are great, and it has all the features that an android tablet should have. The only problem is that it doesn't have a headphone jack, so I have to use the internal speaker. The overall build quality is good and the audio quality is better than other tablets. I think it will hold up longer than my other tablets did, and I would recommend it. It's also the best bang for the buck.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "What I love about the S2 is that it is built to last. The S2 lasts for years. What you can expect from an electronic device in this price range is that you will have some issues. I have used the S 2 for over 8 years. It does not go into standby mode and that does not bother me. You have to watch out if you do not connect to the charger or if you are not careful you will get a fried cable. If you have a smart phone the S is a great way to stay connected to the internet or your favorite social media sites and the bluetooth has the capability of connecting to more devices. "  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a bit too noisy for my taste, but it is a cheap, portable and handy unit.   I'd give it four stars, but the microphone can get hot.  Not as good as the Bose, but a great way to record an interview with a friend and have the results immediately uploaded to your computer.  I did not like how noisy it is when it is powered by AC or battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first started using this, I thought it was going to be a huge pain to change the batteries. I was right. But when the battery died, the whole unit stopped working. I returned it and purchased a second one. I had it for about a month and still cannot find the first one to work. So now I have a new one that will not charge.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dave from Great for my needs This has been a great replacement for my older Apple TV. I've gone back and forth from a Sony to a Roku for my home entertainment, and I have to say that this Roku is much nicer to use. It's small, light and a great way to watch a movie and do other things while you are cooking. It is also a great backup to my iPad which I use for Netflix and YouTube.  with a little bit of research I found out this is a great "second" Apple TV if you have a problem with the first. I'm very glad I did, since I never used it to do anything useful.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a really good device for the price. I'm not really a computer person, but this thing is fantastic. This is so much fun to play with. I can turn it on without putting it on the floor and turn it off with out even thinking about it! It does not require me to be at a computer, it is on the TV with just my TV remote and my headphones. I love this thing, it gives me the freedom to do what I want, even without being connected to a computer. I also do not have to buy multiple controllers, even though they would be nice to have in case my daughter ever wants to play games like the ones she plays on the computer. This will be my favorite toy in my house for the next year.

If you're a fan of audio that is clean, accurate, and not overly bright, this is the radio for you.    I have listened to it on the radio, car, and even on the front passenger seat of my bike.  It does a fantastic job.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPad is a very good device, and it has a really nice user interface. It's the best iPad ever! I have an old iMac that has really nice touch screen technology, but i can never get the iPad to work with it (because the iOS software is not compatible). This is my first iPad and it was the best purchase I have ever made. I am very satisfied with this purchase. The iPad has a big enough screen to read all of my books (not just my blog or book reviews) that I would normally have to read on the computer screen. I also like the way the iPad is designed and how simple the iPad app is to use. I would love to get an iPod Touch, but I can't justify the price of that right now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      The first thing that I liked about this is the overall design: It has a very attractive look, but also has a good build quality. It looks and feels very solid and well put together. I am very pleased with it. I also like the fact that it comes with a 1.5mm-wide plug. For some reason, I don't like having plugs that are too wide. I guess it's because the smaller size allows it to fit more into my ears, which seems to make it more comfortable and makes it look more stylish. The only con I have with it is that the microphone seems a little small. It's not bad, but the mic is not as clear as the ones in my headphones, so I feel like I would have to have a much bigger mic in order to get as close to the music without distortion as my headphones do. I'm not sure if this will affect my use of it at all.   Sound quality:  I can't really compare the sound of the speakers to the one I have in my headphone, but from what I can tell, this speaker seems to have good quality speakers. They are very clear and crisp. This speaker can play many different types of music, but I am especially impressed by it's vocals: It's very clear, which is good because vocals can be difficult to hear.   the only thing that bothers me is that I don´t think there is much bass in it. That's a good thing because the bass on my headphone is much more detailed.   " The headphones themselves are very well designed.   The cables are very nice and easy to put on.  "    The overall build quality is very good. The headband is a little stiff, but it's still a great headband. The metal grills at the bottom of the headband are also very well-made.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My experience is a lot better than I expected. The new device was very easy to use. I was able to make multiple phone calls on the phone while my wife and daughter watched a movie on another TV. I also took advantage of the video and photos feature on the device. If you are a video person, this will be a nice addition to your collection. If your looking for a smart device to watch TV, this is the one. Also, the sound is very good. I have had my LG tv for 5 years and still don't know how to get rid of it... I just keep putting more and more stuff on it! It's been so easy to set up for me. Thank you so much for your prompt service and I would definitely recommend your company!  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Price, Poor Product It's a very nice phone. I really like the fact that there is no monthly contract. However, the phone is very cheap and the battery is very small. When I go to charge the battery, the battery just falls out of the bottom of the phone. This makes it unusable unless you take the phone apart and charge it. I tried to order a different phone and the shipping was very slow and expensive. It has come to my attention that this is a recall on the LG products that was done by LG because it was the first phone to have this problem. I would not recommend this phone if you're looking for the cheapest phone out there.  Customer Service  The customer service staff at LG Tech Support are good. The phone itself works fine (except the battery will not hold a charge for a long time). The customer service is a bit lacking. They have a tendency to email out support questions to multiple users instead of just responding to me in the order of their replies. And I'm pretty sure that my order was shipped out in December. I just received my phone and it didn't have the update on December 4th. The company seems to be making changes and updates on their phones on a monthly basis. So it seems that this problem has been resolved.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The quality of this camera is very impressive. The viewfinder is nice and bright with excellent contrast. The only drawback is that the viewfinder isn't completely clicky on this camera but the manual focusing and touch-screen is really smooth. The manual focus isn't as precise as the AF lenses in the Olympus OM-D E-M5 II but the results are pretty good for the money. This is an ideal camera for landscapes, weddings and portrait work as well as everyday photography.   If you like the OM-C line of cameras, you won't be disappointed with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love the keyboard. I've played a lot of PC games on it, and I don't feel any stuttering, especially in games I can see a high framerate on. If there's a downside to this keyboard, it's the placement of the number pad. It's too far to the right for my liking. I'd prefer it to be a little closer to the left. And there are too many extra keys to the bottom for my tastes, especially the F1-F10 keys. They could've had a button on the bottom-right corner of the F11 key just to make the number pads a little more user-friendly. Overall, I like it. I just wish the number buttons were a little less awkward and the number and the cursor keys a little bit more accessible. I think I may go with the F12 key which is closer to my hand.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Poor keyboard control This keyboard was not designed for gamers. In addition to the terrible key placement, the keyboard controls are terrible. No WASD or Arrow keys, only one dedicated Control key. This is a must for those who play FPS games, as a left hand player it is near impossible to hit WASD keys. The mouse control works fine, however the mouse doesn't stay in the middle of the keyboard when I try to move the mouse away from the keyboard while playing games. This can lead to accidental key presses or unintentional clicks while playing. .  for the price the keyboard is amazing  Great keyboard, great build quality. But the key placement is just not good. The number pads are way too far away for my taste. ,  The build quality is great. The layout is not so good. It has no way to get the F keys to be in the right place. The whole thing is very awkward. I recommend this if you like gaming, but not so much if you enjoy typing.  (Posted on 2/15/2016)  Not good for PC Gaming I tried to purchase this keyboard thinking I'd enjoy playing some PC games. The problem is it's impossible to get a WASD key on the top row on any of the Windows 8.1 keyboards, and the only keys you get are the 'arrow keys' which are a nuisance to navigate, and it's not even the standard arrow keys. It doesn't have a number pad, and you can't click the cursor

The only issue is that the keys are a little flimsy, but once again I'm very happy that I bought the keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "A well built and well designed product at a reasonable price. I did not expect this product to be as well made as it was and I am very pleased with the result."   The price for the unit is excellent; however, for the quality it delivers, the price is a bit on the high side.   I am now using my unit for audio production and it performs very well for that.  I have had the unit for about 5 months now and have used it for recording my home theater. The unit is very well built, looks great and is very easy to work with.  It is a great product, but I was not expecting the quality of the materials that went into the construction of the unit.  1) Battery life:  I purchased this unit with a 7 day battery life in mind.  2) Software:  You may be tempted to think that this device is a little simplistic with no real options or settings, but the truth is that you do have the option to modify the settings if you wish.  3) Setup:  The unit can be setup with a USB or a battery pack, which I opted for.  4) Quality:  This unit has been in my home for 2 months and my wife is amazed at how well it has performed over that time period.  The sound is very clear and very clean with very little background noise.  My main complaint is that the unit takes a long time to power up.  In an effort to save my unit, I removed the power adapter from one of the USB ports and plugged it in in parallel to the other USB port.  When I connected the adapter to the unit, the unit still didn't get to the charging cycle in the time frame that I had hoped.  With the extra USB ports, I am not sure if the unit can charge faster when it is on. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a wonderful device and well built. I had this one for a few days and took it apart and removed the top. The whole thing was just loose. The metal housing is very nice and the plastic feels very good. The unit is easy to use. I have not used it on a high speed camera but I have used it to work on a small camera set. The included charger works well, I used it in the morning and it charged the camera in the evening. The battery life is good for the price. I haven't tried the included SD card reader.    
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In the early 70's, when I got this unit I had it with me all the time. It was an upgrade over the small battery I had on my VCR. Since then, I've owned other units in its class. It is not a portable and does not come with a power adaptor. The unit itself, though, is easy to use and does the job just fine. The sound quality is good enough for me. I'm a classical music listener but I'm also a musician, so I like that the device doesn't sound too compressed or compressed. I do need a lot of space on my audio device because the Yamaha unit is very small and heavy. The Yamaha unit I'm using now weighs about 3 pounds so it's too heavy for me, but I don't mind it so much. I have it with my CD player, computer and amplifier and use it almost every day. The only downside I have is that it comes with only the one stereo pair (2 channels).   This unit is an excellent value.   The best is that you don't have to worry about the unit going bad because the unit itself is so inexpensive. If you are looking for a cheap, portable and compact unit you can easily find a good one in this price range.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A) My old phone has the worst battery life out of any device I have owned.   It is a bit on the large side for a flip phone so be careful if you want to make it a mini-phone.  B) The battery is very good in standby.  It can go a week without charge.  C) It has good sound quality.  D) There are many ways to turn it into a smart phone.  4) I don't like it when I am on a call and the caller has a busy signal.  Sometimes this is a problem.  If I want to answer the phone without interruption or to answer a call without hearing someone else, I can't, the caller is on the other line.  This can be solved by using the smart call feature to mute the phone and answer the call on speakerphone or another device.  I know this sounds stupid, but it makes a world of difference.  The phone is loud and clear, it is easy to operate, it does not make a mess of the room when in use, it goes to sleep when I decide to turn off the phone. 5) I am not an expert but I found it easy to use.  One thing to keep in mind is that you can turn on any function and the phone will automatically turn off when the phone is not in use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   When I got it, I was not impressed. I'm a bit of a headphone nerd and I like to read about new headphones.    I'm also a headphone snob. I tend to only buy good quality headphones when I need them. But even with that in mind I really liked the Eee PC 701.  It came well packaged in a box, and I feel like it's well made, the plastic is pretty durable, and the fit was nice and comfortable. But the E632 is a better headphones. If you are looking to make an audio device but have limited funds, I suggest the E4.  I would also say to get a good adapter, it's not cheap but it's cheaper than getting a headset you don't like.

Pros: It�s easy to setup, it�s simple and ineffective in what its designed to be, and its interface is fun to use.  Cons: It may not be ideal for beginners who are not comfortable typing (I'm not), and it doesn�t provide enough of a value for money, especially as a laptop replacement. The USB ports on the back may not work for external speakers, and the battery life is very poor (only about 5 to 6 hours).
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is one of the best smartphones to date in the Samsung range. As far as design is concerned, it is a pretty good phone that is pretty easy to work with. It does not stand out from the pack in any way, but if you do not need a large display or have large hands, this is a good phone. I am impressed by the screen quality, I did not expect that to be as good as the iPhone 6s Plus.   The camera is also pretty good.  The only thing I dislike is the case which is quite bulky and it gets very hot when the display is on.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     5 out of 5 stars Nicole  I have been using this device for about 2 weeks now and have been loving it so far. I have used it for hiking, biking, fishing and other outdoor activities. I love that it's waterproof which is an added plus for those times you get caught in a storm. I haven't had a problem with any issues with this device whatsoever.  3 out of 4 stars Laura  If you are looking for a small waterproof watch with an Android app, then this is probably for you. Otherwise...I'm afraid not. I bought this to use for biking and hiking, but I find the watch to be unreliable. It can be really finicky in settings, or if the battery is low, it will randomly turn itself off while you're in the middle of a ride. There was a one day where the watch wouldn't turn on at all because the battery was running low.  have also had this issue on the other reviews about it, too. I think it's a design flaw or something with the watch not working properly. Also, there is no Android App, so you can't download an app like Garmin has for most of their devices (although Garmin is working on that). For what I bought it for, that's fine, I'd rather have a GPS, heart rate monitor, and the ability to upload workouts to a Garmin site than this, but other people might not be as concerned about it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've owned this device for about a week now and have had it for about two weeks. It's a nice little USB-A to C adapter which means you can plug it in to your computer (on USB-C) and use a mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen. This adapter isn't as convenient as a usb hub, but its nice that there are adapters for all the different types of devices. I really like that it can charge both my phone (which uses USB-B) and my laptop. It charges really fast and also works with my phone which has the micro-usb connector. I've been using a cheap usb-c phone charger which works great, but it is bulky and heavy so this adapter was a nice alternative. It will cost about $15, so I'm satisfied.   I've owned it for a couple weeks now and I really enjoy it. I just started using my tablet and it was not an issue. I liked the fact that there is no cord to deal with, and the port size is good. My wife also liked the device and it's convenient to have it with me when I'm not using it so I can quickly pop it in and out. I have been using my laptop a lot more lately and am not too impressed. I'm trying to move up to windows 10 and my problem is the mouse is too large and doesn't click right as I want it to. The device is extremely portable and my wife and I also like the fact I don't have to carry a monitor or cords around.     The mouse is large for the size of the device, but I've found myself using it to click buttons I don,t want to click. I can see a need for better drivers though, because it's hard to click the mouse when it's so large.  For the price, I think this adapter is an excellent deal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this a week ago and I'm glad I did. I've been looking for a decent turntable that also has a phono preamp and a USB port so I'm not paying extra for a high-end preamp that I wouldn't need (the phono is just for the sake of being able to use a phonograph). So far, I've had no problems with the sound quality and the tonearm works well with my cartridge (I used a KEF XM 100 and my friend's JVC M100.) I also purchased a cheapo cartridge that I got from a used record store. It's got a bit of a punch, but I think it's a great option for $30. If you want to use your vinyl for the most part, this would be a good option to have. I'm going to be buying another one for my friend because I think he might need one too. - January 8, 2014good but no USB  Reviewer: karl_the_master - favorite favorite favorite - January 1, 2014  Subject: Nice but no phono input for $500 What I get with the Soundcraft TH-X300 is a good enough sound. It is very comfortable in my hands and does not need a ton of adjustments or adjustments to the EQ and phono. The sound is a little flat at high volumes but I do not know how much more flat could be done with more EQ. I bought the TH-3100 pre-amp for $300 which is much less than what I would spend on a turntablist. I did like the sound of the soundcraft turntables better than the Soundlink turntas and I am very satisfied with the THX300. I will add that I prefer the sound from the TH3100 to the TH2100. The only problem I have with the turnta's is that I want a USB input for a phoob to take advantage of the full analog functionality of the turquoise and I can only get it from the soundstage in the soundstager. - October 22, 2013Nice but no Phono Input for $1,500  This is a nice turntabling system.

The buttons are nice and small and easy to hit.  This thing runs real good and does not freeze, not like some.  One of the features that is a big plus for me is the USB port to plug in your laptop and a bluetooth connection.  I can plug my phone into this thing and I do have a computer in my bedroom so I just plug it in on the wall and it is ready to be used with my computer.  Other features of this device is the ability to play music on it.  It can record and play music.  In my opinion, the only feature I do not like is the light that it uses to let you know when you have the battery low.  There is also a feature to control which buttons you use to push the button, which is great if you have an eye condition or something similar and want to be able to play.  Another feature I love about the device is that there is a remote control.  No more fumbling with your device and taking it out because the remote is on the other side of the room.  You can easily set it up and use it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been a happy camper for a couple of years with my   iMac.

This is the first computer I've bought and I really like it. I've used it for a few weeks now and I have a few comments: 1. I wish the keyboard had a little more travel 2. There's some rattling and buzzing sounds 3. You have to push a button to turn on the laptop but I like that 4. The computer only came with an operating system to help you find all the apps you need to get a job done.  The only thing I don't like about my i Mac is the battery life. I normally leave it on all the time but once you start using it, it gets a little sluggish. I do plan to get an external battery pack so I can charge the battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The touchpad is very good. It works well, and has a good clicky feel to it."   When I was a kid I used to dream about being a game programmer. As a young teenager I did write my own games, which in retrospect seemed like a poor idea. But it's good to know that even though I had no idea what I was doing, I knew enough about computers to be capable of writing at least some of my own software.   The software is extremely well organized, with well-written documentation. This is probably one of the only computer programs that has good documentation for every single part of the program. If you are a programmer, this is something you should be thankful for. There are even many examples and explanations of how the program is supposed to work in the programming documentation. The examples are written in a very readable style, and the explanations are detailed enough to make you understand how they are supposed to be used. For a computer game programmer, it's pretty good to have both good documentation and good examples, as well as a fairly good implementation. The game is also well optimized, and works well with my old iMac (running a PPC) in my home room. This game also uses OpenGL, so it's a good choice for anyone with a graphics card that supports it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have purchased 3 or 4 of these and have been very happy.   One is not always available and another one is expensive but very good.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Jw from Works as advertised I am a new user and have not had a chance to test it in my home yet. But so far I am impressed with the product.  A couple of weeks ago, I had to purchase a portable TV, a set top box and an antenna.  The set up is easy.  I set the TV up first and then the TV antenna, and voila, my TV antenna had the channel I wanted.  My TV worked great with my HD antenna. I would recommend this product to any cord cutter. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This thing does everything I could ever want from a USB stick.   I bought one at the bargain price of $5.00 and I love it.  It is small enough for a quick backup of my stuff and it is just like having my own USB stick!  The only downside is that the power cable is terrible, but it gets the job done.  I would definitely recommend this device to anyone who needs an external hard drive.   The USB Stick is a great USB 2.0 drive!   USB2.0 has been really great for transferring data to a laptop or desktop.  The USB 2 cable is smaller than a normal USB cable and is a little difficult to connect. The best way to do this is to use the mini USB to USB 2 USB Adapter which is the one I bought for the Macbook.  If you are a Mac user and don't use a USB 2 port on your computer, this would be a great add on.  Also, this will be a lot of fun to watch your files on! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love this little keyboard! I like the fact that it can connect to my computer via USB. I have an iPhone that also has a built-in touch screen, and the extra buttons that are connected to the USB can't compete with the great functionality that comes with this keyboard. It is compact and can fit in a pocket. It can be a little tricky to get used to the way the key-caps are spaced out, but I have gotten used to it and it makes typing so much easier. I love that there are no extra buttons or switches to fiddle with and it uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout.   It's a good keyboard but it could be better:  This keyboard is OK. It's not the best, but it's better than average. It does the job, and it will do most typing, but if you need a slightly larger keyboard, you could find a better option out there. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first time I bought a Sony a7R II and was very impressed by the build quality, size and design. The build quality is very solid and is easy to put together and clean, and the body is made of plastic which is very easy to scratch or dent. The lens is also metal, which is nice and durable for the price. All of the controls are easy to access and operate. I highly recommend this camera!    Excellent Camera!     My first and last Nikon A7RII's, this camera is just as good, if not better. For the money, it's amazing, I would say a 5 or a 6 out of 5!  Great camera  In my opinion, it may be the best manual focus SLR camera in the world and one of the best compact interchangeable lens cameras in the price range too. It's a very professional looking and feeling camera with all the bells and whistles that makes a great camera and has the performance that you need from a 35mm camera. I love this camera, and I love the fact that Sony took such a long time to release this model and that I didn't wait until there was a special edition release. Sony should really think about doing these special editions in the future. This is by far the best camera to date from Sony, and one that is great for all photo's that do not need the full manual controls of an SLR or the higher frame rate of a film camera.  When i purchased this camera i was thinking it was a very similar to a 35/1.8 that i owned that has more range and the sensor was slightly smaller and the lens was better but now that i have this camera now i see that the sensor is bigger and the lenses a lot better and so the quality is really that much better.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    " My wife had the problem with this product, the unit did not start properly. She took it back to the store where she found it was defective. She sent it back and it was returned in a few days. She called me and said the product was returned and the store had the same issue with the same device. I took the phone to the same store and they confirmed the same problem. They told me that they would send it back, but would only refund $19 and a 2 year warranty. I was just about to pay $200 for a very simple device. The fact that I did not have to pay for a product that works is a true blessing. I highly recommend this product for anyone in a bind. "

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sennheiser HD 590 is a bit of an oddity to me. It's not the kind of headphone I've worn often, nor do I have a good experience with any other Sennhesier, but the HD 5 90s in general are more than a worthy upgrade for my usual pair of Hifiman HE-400s and the HD 660 (the latter of which have been my mainstays for quite some time). So I was a bit skeptical about taking the plunge when I received the HD 600, but I am glad that I did. The sound is absolutely outstanding. It makes the HE-800 seem bloated by comparison, and the soundstage is wide and spacious with well defined vocals. I haven't heard other brands of headphones that can sound as good as the HD 690s, and if you can get your hands on a pair, I can absolutely guarantee you won't be disappointed.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The new MacBook was very fast and solid. The battery lasted about 3 hours. The keyboard felt good but I still prefer a tactile click when I type. The display was very good. It was brighter and had a wide view, but I don't like that it's on the back. The new dock is a good idea, but it has a different design than the old one.   Overall, I've been using the MacBook for two years and I love it. It's a great computer for my job, and for personal work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently replaced the battery on my Sony Ericsson T710 laptop. The first time the laptop shut down and the computer started automatically to go into recovery mode. After it was fixed I noticed that the battery life has been almost the same without any change. So, I got the T700 to replace it. I do recommend this product.   Price - excellent. Quality - great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the device in the spring of 2010 and have used it on and off over the years. The only problem I had with it was that I could not find the battery out on the main screen. I called Sony to find out why and they told me the battery was lost in production. I bought the unit from Amazon which is where I found out the battery had to be ordered and then shipped to Sony to be replaced.   In terms of the phone itself the design is very good. The main screen is bright and clear and the screen seems to be able to display two lines of text at a time. The sound quality of the speaker is very quiet. The battery seems to last a long time so far.  As far as the features the most important ones are the ability to make calls and play music from the main menu. I found a number of applications that work great and they do not have to be turned on by the user to use them. The call function is very convenient as I do not need to switch between apps. The music functions work well but I am not a big fan of having to switch back and forth from the iPod or iTunes to view the music. Overall I am happy with this product and I am looking forward to purchasing a second one for my husband.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality of this is excellent. A very high quality sound, with a nice amount of bass to it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is one of the most efficient chargers I have ever used, but the battery has a bad habit of dying when the plug is in.   I had to purchase a new battery to get it to last.  The quality of this charger is fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - I purchased this to replace a previous device, the old one had a couple of bad points about it: 1)   the buttons are all in the same place and are hard to reach 2)  it had a strange problem where the power LED would not go on when the device was on 3)  the mic was not very good. However, all those things were minor issues compared to what I have found. After reading all the reviews I figured I would give it a try. 1) the buttons feel really soft and are very responsive. 2) there is no rattle or bad noise when I press the buttons. 3) the mic works really well, the noise is almost a thing of the past!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sony Ericsson K900 is a great sounding device that gets the job done with a lot of quality features. It has a good volume output, good bass and nice mids. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't need the best features.   Good portable speaker:  I love the bass and overall sound of the Ericsson. The K900 plays nicely for the most part, but the volume is just right for a simple portable sound. I also like that the speaker is on the bottom of the device, where it is always facing me so the volume stays low. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For my first laptop, and first ever PC in my life, this is a great buy. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new, and also wants a laptop. The only thing is that it took a little bit of time, but it was worth it. I also highly recommend that you get a Windows version of the computer, otherwise you won't be able to run most programs. My review:  This is my first computer for the longest time and now I own a laptop that I am able to use as my primary computer! I was a bit skeptical of this device as my old laptop was way over powered and didn't have as much space or as much features as this unit. But this machine is great! The screen is beautiful and has a great resolution. This was my first time building a computer and my experience was great. The build quality is perfect and I could not tell that I was building a PC! It is very light weight and easy to move around. I was able to upgrade my processor which I didn't know was possible on the pre-built version and I am so happy that I did! It has plenty of memory for me, although the pre built version has more memory than my old old laptop! The processor is very strong and fast. It works out faster then I expected for a PC. The screen also works out of the box and has no problem at all running my games. I have a very simple yet detailed plan for this computer, and it seems to work great. I recommend this product to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It has been more than 3 years since I last purchased one from this site and I am glad that I finally gave it another go. My last two experiences were very disappointing as the unit would have to be connected to the computer over a wireless network and there was no option to install it on my own.   The unit was purchased at a very good price, at least by this retailer and I was looking forward to the install. I received the unit in a timely manner, no problems with installation and I can't wait for the unit to come home. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For me, the Z1 has been a joy to use. It's the most simple and easy to use smartwatch available to date. From the Z2, I noticed an added complication that makes navigation much easier, but you could see this was the new version of the smartwatch in a year. In my opinion, the best part about the watch is the design. The look and feel of this watch makes it different from the others out there. It feels and looks premium. The watch face is also a perfect fit for most men. As far as the smart watch app goes, you can't beat the amount of features available. The app is fast and intuitive. You have the option to have the screen always on and it's easy to make and view changes without having to pull down the notification bar every time. The apps are always on top of your device so it's hard to tell what you're missing without an app to try.   Overall, it's a great watch and I am going to continue to purchase this product for years to come.  5/5 Good watch but it's really the app that makes this an amazing smart watch, great looking watch and the watch face has some great options, however I have a gripe with the band. There is no metal band, it is made out of leather and feels cheap. I think the metal bands are a better option. I've lost a couple watches in the time I've been wearing this one, but I've gotten over it so the only time I'm disappointed is if I don't take out the band to make changes and have to take it out again because my battery runs low. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     The Sennheiser PCM-7x0 headphones are fantastic! I really enjoy my music with these, and for that matter, the ear pads in general. The headphones themselves are also great for gaming. I have a pair of the headphones, and I've got another pair waiting for me. I'm excited to try out the wireless version. As for the sound quality, I've heard a lot of headphone's before this. I've never had a pair that sounded so great and natural. I am just going to say that I find the headphone's to be a huge improvement over my past pair. They are now my go-to set for playing music.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this headset from Amazon a few months ago. At first, the sound quality is great. But after some time using the headset, I am noticing that there is a noticeable amount of distortion in the sound. I am using the audio through my iPhone 5 on a wired headphone. But I have noticed that I am not being able to hear the voice of my wife when we are speaking to each other through the headset. She was using it the other day with my daughter when we were talking to each others' ears and I couldn't hear a thing. I do not want to get rid of it as I do like it, but I am really looking into some other options.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the iPhone 4 and it's just a great device. The battery life is great, the phone is very sturdy, very well built. The only real negative I can say about it is the cost of the phone and the fact that you can not get a nano SIM (in other words no nano-SIM) to be installed. This means you are stuck with a nano-to-micro-SIM card for your phone, a little disappointing.   - David B.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just bought a brand new Apple Watch. I was very impressed by the size, quality, and performance.

This is an excellent product and I'll gladly buy a second one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really love the battery life I can get with this tablet. If you are a real power user and need to be able to do a lot of things with it, then this is not the tablet for you. I do however have this thing sitting on my desk most of the time since it's too big to be in a backpack and not worth carrying. I can also use it as a light reader. The one downside is that the screen seems a bit washed out compared to my other Samsung Tablet's screen.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: gopro_shop

I have been on the market for a tablet for years now and this is the best value I've found in the last 2 years. The only thing I don't really like about the tablet is the keyboard. It's not as smooth as I would like but it gets the job done. The other reason I keep this is to have one in my car for work and I can switch out of a computer whenever I need to.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my second "real" headphone, both had the same issue - the headphone driver would not stop blowing out the drivers of my "real stereo headphones". I had the original model for 4 years, but when I bought the second model, the only thing the new model did was make the original one sound worse. The original model was a $200 piece of crap that took me a year or more to "get right". This new model is a bit better in that it seems to have a little more bass - I prefer it a bit, but it still sounds like crap to me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my second set of the same headphones ( I have had them for 2 years) and my experience has not changed since they arrived. The headphones look and feel fine for the price. The cord is a bit stiff when connecting to my computer ( but it works fine otherwise ) but this is easily resolved by connecting the 3.5mm out to the headphone out of my PC. I am very pleased with the sound quality ( and I am a music aficionado ) and the price is really good considering the quality. I can't speak for the sound coming from the computer ( I use a Mac Pro ) but I have listened to and written reviews on numerous other people using computers with headphones and the sound on these headphones is excellent. The only thing that would have made a difference would be if they had a better cord to make them work better with my Mac.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Epson V600   The best printer I've used. It's fast, quiet and it writes great. I love the "Scan" feature.   It also has the feature to turn off the backlight when you're done.   It's an amazing printer   You can save images on to USB card and share. Great, great for the price.  The only thing that would make it better is the Epson web site where you can order the printer  .  Great, quiet, fast, easy to use, quality product.  This printer is great for both photo and electronic printing. The pen has the speed to print at least a photo every 1-2 minutes and the ink is easy to erase on your computer. I don't see much point in getting a better printer.  If you don't have one, this is it.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  http://www.epsonusa.com/epson-v600-photo-printing-printer.html  Tried out a few printers before I found this. My only complaint is it is slightly thicker than my old printer. Otherwise, I am happy. I am also using it as a general printer for school. I was worried that it would be small but it is perfect. I can print at school in class and in other classrooms.  There is a bit of paper loss during printing but that is to be expected and that is the price you pay.  For someone that is doing their first printing it is great and the paper will last.  Very satisfied and will be a regular buy for me. I have a 4 year old son and he loves it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the     Fujifilm X100S,   a modern, big, very good lens.   The F4X   was a lot  easier to focus.  I'm not using the 2.8  , and the autofocus is not so good.  At F4, the focus ring is not very firm, but the lens is very good. It   is great for the size, and the F4 can be stopped down to F11 or F16.     I bought this lens and a cheap 1.2X TC-80 at the same time.  The cheap version has an orange filter on the front and I could not find the correct lens hood.  So I bought the expensive version and I'm really pleased with the results.  For the price of this lens, I am very happy.  This is a great, compact lens that   will produce some sharp, good bokeh.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing i noticed was the portability of the device. It has a battery that lasts a good 3 days, and the unit can also be used without any cable. The second thing i like is that the unit doesn't come with a micro SD card slot, so you have to buy one for that. The third thing i love about this is that this is a very easy to use device. For a beginner, it is very easy. I did have to adjust it a bit to fit my hand, but once I got it right, everything is just fine.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Simple and easy to set up and use I purchased the product. I had my concerns about the weight and ease of setup and operation. I found this unit to be quite a bit more sturdy and easy than expected. It took about an hour to set-up and it can be used for several hours. The only thing I dislike is that you can only read and write from memory. This is a little annoying because I would like to use my flash card with this unit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The G.Skill DDR3L SDRAM memory has been out for over a year now and I'm pleased with the performance and the overall build quality. The memory sticks fit my board very nicely and they also come in a variety of colors to help differentiate them from one another. The RAM is rated at 14-15.9 MB/s of memory bandwidth and can handle 4GB or 8GB modules. The only issue I have is the sticker on the top of the memory sticks that looks a little cheap and could easily come off by accident, but I'm not holding my breath waiting for that to happen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You get a decent quality device for the price.   One of the best things about it is the build quality of the device. I have used my device on and off for two months. The battery lasts me a month of use.  The device itself is very lightweight and durable.  For anyone considering this purchase I would recommend reading the reviews for your purchase. The phone does seem to have a lot of power when it's not in use but it can be overwhelming in it's own way.  Some people have had a lot more issues with the device than others and it's my understanding that people report having to re-adjust the settings a lot in order to get it to work correctly.  If you're looking for an inexpensive phone that's a decent price, look no further!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The build quality and build quality feel very solid and sturdy, which is something I feel is difficult to get a hold of these days. I think it's a great value for the price. The USB is easy to use with the included converter and I love how the charger charges the battery.

This review is based on a $35, 9-volt alkaline battery that has been sitting in my drawer for a couple of years now. I really like the idea of the light/sound/vibrating features.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound of this amp is just as I wanted. The high end of my audio system is quite a bit higher than my old tube amplifiers and the bass is much improved on the old tubes. It's definitely a very well constructed amplifier. I also like the fact that I don't have to replace my tube tubes.   I also like that it's a bit smaller and lighter than I expected.  This amp is really great!   This is a must for any tube amp enthusiast and especially for anyone that has an old stereo. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this computer for a couple of months now. This is the first machine that I have used that actually does what it says it will do. The screen has a good resolution and no color problems. The display is bright and it displays fine on all computers that I've tried it on. The speed of the computer is also very good. It is just as fast as my previous desktop computer. The only thing that I don't like about the computer was the fact that it requires a lot of power to operate. I really need a big UPS or a big battery to be able to power the computer. That's why I didn't give it a 5. This could be because I have only used it for a few days or because I am so used to the other machine that everything has become easy for me now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The MQA (Master Quality Authenticated) technology in the M-Audio Reference M80-2A is a true marvel. When a source component is a stereo pair or stereo sources mixed into a 5.1 mix, the audio comes out of the speakers with a much clearer punch than with a standard 7.1 signal. It's a remarkable accomplishment for a sound technology that's been around for almost 20 years. The Reference M-80-1A (the same model but with a lower-end A/D converter) and the M80T-2 are both excellent upgrades. The M80P-2P is just a tad more expensive, and the Reference M90-2 is slightly more expensive.   Specifications:  Model: M80M80XB, M80TCM80B,M80TTCM 80 B Price: $499.99  Features:  MQAM:  High bit-depth,  high-performance,  lossless audio formats.  M-WAV:  Multi-track recording,  multi-track editing,  up-scaling,  compression,  and  lossy encoding.  A/B and 2-channel recording:  4 x 2-track,  2 x 2.1.  CD,   LP and M-Wave formats available.  USB 2.0:  Support for high-resolution (44.1 kHz) and  256-sample-rate (CD-quality) WAV files.  PC-compatible input/output (i.e., VGA, DisplayPort, HDMI)   Audio interface:  High-quality, low-noise, stereo-active analog line-level I/O.  Phono pre-out,  line out/sub, and microphone input.  Output:  Stereo (5.1)  Audio connection:  1x 2.5mm stereo headphone jack, 1x 1/4" auxiliary input, and 1x headphone output.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     5 / 5 Best Portable Charger   I use this charger on my laptop everyday. This is the best charger and the best portable charger I've ever used!  1 / 5 Poor Quality   The charger is junk. I've had it for over a year and it has been having the same issue. The plastic casing is not strong. When you open the casing you're going to get a bunch of air bubbles in there. The only reason I'm giving it a 1 star is because it came with a battery. Not really a big deal, but still.  0 / 5 Worst charger   This charger was horrible from the very start. It would die every time I plugged it in and never gave me a charge. I don't recommend this.  the only thing I'll say about it is it does work well for a very small device like my iphone and this can make your phone last longer with a regular battery. .  it does NOT last forever  4 / 5 Great battery!  I just got this charger and I love it! It works great. I bought a few of these for my ime tablets as well. Very easy to use. The best one I have to buy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The EGO-C is a decent high-end device in a compact form-factor. It's not as fast as a traditional cigarette lighter, but you do get more battery life. It feels a bit flimsy and the buttons are not very easy to press, so a bit more effort would be appreciated. If you already have an EGO device and love the style and look, you will definitely like the new EGO. It was well priced at $30.00, compared to $75.00 for a lighter or $45.00+ for the larger EGO Pro, which still has some potential. I'm pretty sure the EGO would be a nice tool for the beginner or first time electronic cigarette smoker. I wish they would bring it back for the "B" version as well.

March 13, 2016 Reviewer: Brian M from Boca Raton, FL United States This product has worked well and the battery life is quite good, but the price is a little on the high side.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am so happy with the performance of this speaker. I've had the Sony E750II for about 6 months now and can honestly say it is the best performing speaker I have had in many years. I use it at home as my primary home entertainment system. I can't believe how well it performs. The sound is superb and the bass is good and deep. The Sony E950 has better clarity, warmth, and detail. I would never buy another brand speaker without it.   For me, the quality of the Sony speaker line is the highest level I've ever seen. This speaker just plain works and I'm in love with my Sony. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For me this is one of the best items that i got for my laptop, my first. I have a 16.1 inch screen and this thing is great, and it uses no power (when I connect it via usb), which was my biggest concern. It works well and its very thin, i like how it looks. I also recommend this to a friend that wanted a better battery for his laptop, i dont even have a big old laptop so this is perfect. Its very light weight and easy to carry around.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is my first purchase on ebay, I'm glad I went with this one! I have been having a difficult time finding a replacement to replace a dead one for my car audio. This one is the same price as the replacement one, but the sound quality is great, I really like the amp, it's not loud like my old one, yet it's clean sounding and it's loud enough to hear the radio. I haven't had any problems with the unit and the delivery was super quick. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is that I haven 't received a replacement part yet. Hopefully they'll send it out soon.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking for a high end, low price, large screen, small size. I wanted a tablet that would have a large screen and would allow me to work on multiple programs at once.   This was it   It is larger than I expected, and very thin at.5 inches.  In my opinion, it is much better than what I am using now for my laptop (laptop with a 12" screen).   What I like about this device is the size. It works well and is easy to get around on.  I also like that I can take photos with it, or edit videos and listen to music on it.  The battery life is excellent, and I was able to get about 2 hours of battery life with heavy usage.  It has a very good built-in speakers, but I don't know if they are loud enough.  This is one of the best purchases I made this year. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was skeptical of this device. I'm a big fan of the original Sony Walkman, and I've used many different portable players over the years. But Sony has made such great strides in the past 20 years, the Walkman was always something I thought about but didn't want to buy. But when I heard that they had released a new Walkman model that I had never heard of before, I decided to give this device a try. The device itself is very well built, and is definitely much more sturdy and less flimsy than my old Walkman. The only thing is that it only has a cassette recorder in it. That means if you want to record a CD with the device, you will need to have a turntable with a tonearm to attach to it. But even if you do this, it doesn't sound very good unless you have a decent pair of headphones. The sound is very muffled, and the sound quality is very poor. I don't know why this was never made a bigger part of the design of the product, but it is very disappointing to think that I'll have to use my Walkman with the quality of the new model. But if you're in the market for a device like this to take on the road, it's definitely worth a look. I love that there are also bluetooth and FM radios built in, which is a very nice feature.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This little machine is great! The quality and the price match, it is small but sturdy. It works very well and it is so useful when I want to listen to my favorite songs on a small portable computer. I really like this purchase.   5 / 5 Excellent Quality I am very satisfied with my purchase, I got this a few months ago and have been enjoying my daily listening. I am looking forward to having my own to use in my house.  3 / 5 Poorly-made item The earphones are cheap, they don't look like good quality earbuds. The cable, although it looks to be very strong, is not the best quality. It's very loose. When I tried to plug in the earphones, I noticed a sound leak. I will have to replace the cables if I want a long-lasting purchase from earbud.  (Posted on 7/24/2014)  Excellent Earbud Bought these to listen on the train and was a very nice surprise.

My only complaint is that the battery life is limited to around 20 minutes.   Write a negative review about an electronic device.   This was a very bad purchase. I was promised it would be a "little" bigger and in a case, but the size was just not right. I had to buy the micro usb cable, but still it felt huge. The sound quality was great. However, the battery was so old that after about 2 months, I could not use it any more. The warranty wasn't going to cover the shipping so I had no choice but to return it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As an audio/video guy I was thrilled to find this for my collection. I bought two of them because of the great sound quality, the versatility and the good looking design. I have two stereo sets and am very pleased with the setup. The best feature is that there are NO cord splices so you can leave the set running without a problem. I would buy this product again. It was worth the money. Rated 5 / 5 The perfect cable I've been looking for a good quality audio cable to use with my iFi iX3s. This cable is just what I needed. Rated 4.5 / 5 Awesome! This cable was very easy to install. The quality of the cable is great and the installation was very simple. I'm very happy with this purchase. Rated 1 / 5 Very good audio quality but... It is very good if your looking for quality audio at a very affordable price. The sound quality is very nice but the cable itself is very cheap compared to the quality of audio. It could have been better. The connectors are not made very well. Rated 3 / 5 iFone Audio Cables I bought one set of these cables for my iPod Touch 4th Gen. It sounds great. I like it better than the other cables I've tried. It seems to be a little thicker than other brands of cables so I'm a little concerned about durability. I will probably have to purchase another set to replace the set I have now. Rated 2 / 5 Best audio and video cables I got these for a friend and I am very happy. I really recommend them. The price and quality are right. The only problem is that it's really hard to use the phone to charge and send/receive text messages, because the plug that connects to the phone is not very sturdy. It can be pulled off easily. It's not that it breaks easily, just that it is hard to get out of the hole and then you have to unplug it and then put the phone back in, to use it to make a call and send a text message. The other problems I have are about the audio and Video quality. I only have one set but I think I've figured out the problem. The audio quality is great but the video is awful. The video looks horrible. It looks like the video has a very bad compression. I tried to upgrade my phone with an iPhone 5 and I'm still waiting on a replacement for my old one that's

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the money it is hard to find a better device on the market. With all the bells and whistles on this phone, it is not a cheap phone and when you have a hard time with a phone, this is the best thing to come out of my phone experience (well as of late). It's super quiet. The audio from the speaker is amazing. I can play music that is way louder than on my other phones. The only thing I would love to have is a fingerprint scanner that is not too hard and has the same quality as the HTC One (M8). The one thing I can't stand is the screen is not as good as HTC phones.    Read more
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:       If I had to give this device one bad review, I would say that this device was made to get the job done. It does a great job of keeping my headphones clear, no matter how loud I am playing music. It's also very easy to use and set up.   To keep this review short and sweet, if you are in the market for a good audio device for your computer (especially one you can use at work), I recommend this.  This is a good portable headphone amp that will last forever.  It can output a fair amount of power at a reasonable price and does not drain the battery to the point that it doesn't work any longer. The remote is great, the sound quality is excellent, and it can be used as a portable headphone speaker.  This will last for a very long time.  The only problem I had was that it wouldn't fit into the computer bag that I have in my car. I took it to the local auto parts store and it was fixed the next day.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    1. I ordered a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 at Walmart. The unit arrived with a small dent on the screen cover and a small chip in it. 2. I have had the Samsung Tab 4 since October 2015 and it has been a very nice device. It has performed well on the most important devices I have. It's not the best tablet but it has done everything I have asked it to do. I would recommend the Galaxy Tab to anyone who wants an attractive and sturdy device for the price. 3. When I received my new tablet, the unit did not come with a micro usb cable so I bought one from another retailer. I like the micro usb cables the most because they are very easy to carry around. Overall, the device was as advertised and I would order from Walmart again. 4. I did not need to contact Walmart to return the unit because it was defective. 1st of all, I received the item in a very timely manner. The box arrived in perfect condition. It was not damaged. The package was well packaged and shipped on the same day. There was no damage to the box and my order showed up in great condition. 2nd of all I am very happy with the purchase. I got a very reliable tablet that I can use on multiple devices. I can also charge my other devices while I am using my tablet. This makes it very convenient to use. There are also many features in this tablet I enjoy. I love the fact it has an external display which allows me to have a full HD display and use my other tablets with my external monitor. It also has the ability to use a stylus to make a note. I also like the fact that it allows me use apps that are not provided by the tablet. 3rd of all the app selection is very good and has been improving with every update. I use my tablet with many different applications such as Skype and Facebook which is very nice. Lastly I have only used the tablet for 1 week and it only had 4 charges which is excellent. I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. I will definitely be ordering more from Walmart in the future. Thanks Walmart for a good product and great service! 1) I ordered the tablet on 8/26/2015. Received the tablet 6 days later on 9/2/2015. All was good so far. 2) I have to say that I am not impressed. It is an average tablet. I don't find any reason to

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have purchased several of these devices since starting using them over a year ago. The batteries last forever. They are very quiet, do not wear out quickly and are extremely easy to clean. The only problem I have had is the fact that I can not use one battery for more than 6 hours with each of the 4 separate switches (i.e. on/off) and only have the ability to use the 3 different colors on each switch (green, yellow, red and blue) with one battery. The rest of the time they either get plugged in but still have that annoying battery light on them (only happens with the yellow switch) or I cannot use them due to having the same problem with the batteries that happened when I first started using them. I have been using the same battery for at least 2 years now and the battery is still completely flat. I really wanted to like these, but with these issues it is hard to recommend them.

I was really looking forward to getting this product because the other products I had been using did not hold up well. I had used other electronic equipment from other manufactures. Some of them had problems with interference and the other was very noisy. I decided to try this unit over other options because of its price and I was not disappointed. It is a nice size and the interface is very easy to use. I also have not had any problems with the buttons and everything on the unit. The customer service has also been top notch. I have not contacted them yet to request any warranty issues and they responded very quickly.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used my Samsung S3 for 5 months and I've been completely satisfied with it. It has performed flawlessly.

I'm just starting a career in electronics and I want a well designed device for my work.  This is a very nice device and I look forward to my future purchases   It's very easy to set up and use and I get a lot of use out of it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I bought a Samsung Galaxy S2 and like most people I expected to be very happy with it. Unfortunately, I am disappointed. It is not easy to use. The volume buttons are small and the screen is very small. The buttons to toggle the brightness on/off are the best part of the phone but the phone does not respond when the user presses the power button. It also feels cheap. The only other positive thing I can say is that it works well and the charging port is very convenient and easy to find. I hope this review helps someone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iRig is a very well built and comfortable iRIG.  It is sturdy and durable and the remote is a nice addition to the package.   It has all of the features I would expect in a modern  device.  The features I can recommend to anyone would be a more powerful battery, and a remote control that could control a whole bunch of different functions on the iRigs.  I would also like to see a higher quality sound quality on the remote instead of the cheap wired remote that is included.  If you are not concerned about the battery, then I highly recommend the iRG with a lower wattage as the battery in my unit is almost dead (2.1v).  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This has been an excellent product.   I have tried so many different products over the last couple of years and I have always had a hard time getting the sound quality and range I was looking for.  This one comes with 2 ports for the external speakers, a USB audio in that works really well and has a built in mic.  Also has a small external battery charger.  I am not a music or audiophile person so I will say that it is quite a nice sounding unit.  For the price, its great.  My only complaint is that the charging port is too small to charge my phone and I had to take the battery out of my previous device so I could plug it into this one so I can use both.  It will be a few more years before I have to buy another.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Thank you! I've just completed the first step of an overhaul of my PC, using your repair guide and it is great! My old one was a dead box for about a decade before it died... my fault, the cable didn't work for a while and it's the exact same thing I'm having now, but to a much more advanced level! I'm very impressed with the speed of the repairs, the level of professionalism and the fact that the parts arrived in the same day! My last pc I repaired was by a friend, but I was so impressed with what you provided me, I bought a complete new PC and the repair is now over. My new one is a lot more reliable, looks great and runs cooler! Thank you again! --C.J., Arizona   I purchased this computer for my husband for Christmas. After reading your guide, I ordered a new replacement motherboard and a new video card for the computer. Your guide was easy to follow, and the parts were delivered in a timely manner. We were able to get a PC to perform at its full potential. The PC is now performing like a dream! Thank You again. --Diana K., Maryland   As a new buyer, I have purchased a refurbished unit from you, for about the same cost as a new one from another retailer. The only difference is that you provide a great deal of advice in the user guide. As a total novice in electronic repair, the following is just what I took from your guide: 1) Make sure your motherboard has the latest BIOS update 2) Turn on the system by inserting power cord and press down on the reset button on the bottom of the computer 3) Make a note of the screen you see (brightness, sound, and anything else you may need to know) 4) Start by inserting your motherboard into the system 5) Disconnect the power cable 6) Unplug the data cable from the motherboard 7) Insert a new memory module into the motherboard 8) Insert the hard drive from your motherboard 9) Turn the system on 10) Verify that power is on on the computer 11) Start the PC by using the reset switch on the front panel - this is a very easy step to do, and takes about 1 minute. You don't need to use the power button on your PC - you should be able to hear it clicking. 12) Unscrew the power connector on your motherboard 13) Disassemble all of the components

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking for a wireless mouse that I can use with my PC with a USB adapter but also use in a PS3 controller. This one is fantastic. It's easy to use, responsive and is very well built. You will be able to get all of the features you need from it in a very compact package for a reasonable price. I would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants a good wireless mouse.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Excellent product! I really liked the ability to record and play back MP3's using my PC with Winamp. The recorder is very compact, and I was able to record multiple audio files on one device. I also liked the way the unit is simple to use. The unit is very quiet, and the controls are easy to use and intuitive. I would definitely recommend this recorder. I'm using it with WinAMP.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the   3rd   version   and it is very nice. I liked   the  big touch screen,   but I found it to be a little bit of a pain.   The   big buttons are really hard to use with one hand,  even for a novice like me.  It   does   have a good camera,  but the  camera quality isn't good enough to get a good image.  The other   nice features   are:  the   headphone jack   has a good sound quality,  and   it   is the only   good   product   that   you   can buy for less than $100. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great unit at a low price. I have been using my LG HD2 for about 6 months now and it has proven to be a very useful tool. I will most likely be replacing my previous one with this one.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bob from I'm so happy that you have a 5 channel mixer. I'm having a hard time choosing between the HD2 and the HD3. We have both and can't decide which to get. I finally decided to get the HD6 as it's the best bang for the buck of all the competitors. So happy that I finally found a mixer I can live with.

They just don't fit snugly on my ears. Maybe I'll get another one to try. Reviewed by Christopher I had one of these at my first purchase. I have had the same headphone ever since. It is an excellent product but the ear cups do not go far enough into the head. The headphone is good but I just don`t like the design. I also purchased a different type of headphone and it fits just fine but the sound quality is no where near this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the Voodoo 3-1 a few days ago and it's been flawless in it's performance. The volume is a tad loud but it's well worth it for being able to play all of your CDs, and the high quality is great.  Also, the sound is better than any other player I've owned. It's very crisp and clear. I play everything from old jazz and classical CDs to modern, rock and EDM. The bass is a little bit harsh but nothing bad. The treble is great, and I have nothing but positive things to say about the Voodoos' sound.  the VOODOO 3-I's software interface is pretty good too, just a little finicky. I found that on one CD, I had to press and hold a certain button to play it back on the software, but once you get used to it, it's very quick and easy to do, plus the software lets you sort of change the levels and change the music to your liking. The only thing I think they could do is have an actual button that you can press to change the volume from the software.    This is a great player.  and great for the price.   I'm giving it a 5-star rating, despite my one small fault.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only drawback is the lack of USB, but a simple converter or adapter is also a simple solution.   My only complaint is the price.  This is an excellent device that I wish was offered with a USB cable.  Overall it is worth the price of admission. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was a great device. My previous iMac had been a few years old and it was time for a replacement. The new one is a nice upgrade, but still a little too small for my needs. However, with it's great built-in screen and awesome software, I will be looking forward to the next model.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is not a top rated device, and most people would not consider it to be a good computer. However, the software is very easy to set up, and the performance of the machine is very good. I am a computer consultant, and my job requires that I spend a considerable amount of time on the computer. The machine is extremely easy to use.    I have also used this device for work, and I was very pleased with its performance, and easy operation.   This review is for the Dell laptop. It has very good performance and it is really small. I had problems with the mouse buttons but this was fixed by a quick update. I do recommend the software. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   We are an avid group of people. We love everything about technology, especially the possibilities it opens up for entertainment and communication.   We were looking for a replacement for the old AppleTV because we liked the simplicity of it and how it turned out to be very reliable. It has a built-in iPod connector, and the built in speakers are good, but there is a problem with the remote.  The remote is hard to use for anyone that doesn't know the AppleTV remote from a scratch. It is so confusing, it's hard to make it work. The only way to change channels is to hit the power button, and that requires too much thought to understand the menus, especially when one is having to use the remote to control volume.  If this was a TV that we had purchased ourselves, we would not be recommending it. We are so disappointed we have to ask that we be refunded. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was skeptical at first because I'm not much of an audio/video user. I ordered the headset and thought it was great. Now, the sound quality is much better. I will say that I would recommend this headset. I've had a good experience with other brands (Sony, Logitech), so I wasn't sure which one I liked better. Now I like both of them. I'm a small person, and I like having a bigger headset that's easy to slip on and off. The design is pretty nice, and it seems like it'll last a long time. It's the best bang for the buck I've found.  Excellent product!   By the way, I have used the Logitech headset for over a year and have always been very satisfied with it. I have the most expensive one (the V3, which is great), so you can't really compare the price with some of the more expensive ones. But I don't think that makes a difference, because the difference is really subtle. The Logitech is a little larger, and a little heavier than my old Logitech (which is my favorite headset), but the difference isn't like I expected it to be (and I know some people will disagree with me, so it's not a perfect comparison). In fact, the difference between the V3 and V2 is much more substantial than the difference in price. I bought this headset to have a bigger set of speakers in it (not to sound better, but to be more efficient) and it works. And I actually like the smaller headband a lot. (When the V2's headband was a little too tight and uncomfortable, the V1's was a nice change.) The headphones come with some decent in-line remote controls, and they are nice and simple to use. It also comes with a really nice carrying case. This product is well worth the price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Thank you for this amazing product.   It's the only thing that makes a computer "worth it".   This is the perfect accessory for anyone who uses a PC and uses his computer at home.  I'm very satisfied with it.  The sound is perfect.  It has a nice weight to it. I'm not sure if there is a "memory" option, or it is all of the features you could ask for.  Also, I want to mention the customer support is excellent.  No issues, very helpful.  If you're looking for a great product for home use, definitely consider this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device was exactly as expected, the only down side is the box it came in. It was very hard to put in the box as it was almost half the size of the actual box it's in and didn't quite fit. All in all a good experience overall! If you have never seen this device, you really have to see it in person before you can judge it.

Overall a great purchase and great value.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In my opinion, this is a solid product. My old monitor did not have that crisp detail and was a lot less bright but this one does. I don't know how many years it has been but the screen is bright and it's hard to tell if you are looking at a photograph or an actual picture. The controls are well laid out and very well executed. It takes a little practice to get used to but once you do it is a great piece of equipment. This is what I expect from the quality of the product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my second unit of the same brand and it worked perfectly. I used it for my computer with only one monitor and it was easy to use. I also found that you have to insert a few screws to get the keyboard unit to mount, but I think that's an advantage over other units that don't have a key-hole hole.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      I've been playing with my G2 and the sound of it is really great for the price. I'm also extremely pleased with how the unit is set up and connected to my PC. It's very clean with no cabling to fuss about. It sounds amazing and doesn't need an amp to get the most out of it. It is quiet, even when set to high or low volume. I just have the old computer speakers hooked up in the living room so I don't have to sit in front of a computer all day, but I am still happy with my purchase. Highly recommended.  I'm a big fan of cheap, small, easy-to-use electronics. I have a Korg G2 that I've used for a long time (since the early 2000's), which has had my full-time attention since it was first introduced.   While my original Korg is still in working order, I just wanted to upgrade my sound with a bigger, better, and more powerful sound engine. In addition, I wanted a device that would do the job of a desktop computer, but for my own use in a small, portable package. A Korg Odyssey II is perfect!   The Odyssey II has a nice, warm sound, just as I remember it. The only thing is, it's so easy to set up that I can have it up and playing in no time. It even comes with a software download for making presets, so you can start playing immediately.   in addition to the sound, the unit's built-in microphone provides an easy way to record and record/play back your own songs or whatever you want. It has a lot of preamp/processor features such as:   - EQ  - Bass  – Phaser  -- Tremolo  …  and more…   You can set each control for a single frequency (1kHz, 5kHz, 10kHz, 50kHz) or all of them. The Odyssey II also comes with pre-programmed patches, so there is no need for extensive programming. You can even download additional patches from Korg's website. You will need to purchase additional software for use on the Odyssey II. .  the Odyssey has two pairs of stereo (stereo analog out/in) inputs. These are great for recording from microphones or other sources. You simply connect your microphone to these inputs and turn the unit on.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned this device for the last year and have found it works well for my needs.   The USB cable is pretty long (about 25 feet or so), which is perfect.  There are lots of ports and the device will power my iPhone 6 plus and other devices.  The sound from the speaker is a bit loud for me.  I am a very sensitive listener to sound and have a bad case on my phone.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a good device, very nice. I have only had it a week, so my review will be mostly about the design and functionality. I was worried that the size of the screen might make the camera or speakers too big, but it seems to fit the needs perfectly. The buttons are all nice and easy to press, and the volume controls are nice and large. I also appreciate the fact that I can adjust the brightness by just pressing one button (and it's not a hard "on").   The video quality isn't as great as it could be, but this is a one-year-old tablet, so it may not be a big issue.   I didn't have a chance to test the video quality yet, but the speakers do sound good, but I will have to do some comparison with other tablets before I can give a final judgment.  If you want an e-ink screen, and a high-end device in the price range of the Asus VivoTab, this may be a good choice.  Final thoughts:  A high-quality tablet, and great value.  I'm definitely planning on purchasing this device, but for now I'm going to wait and see if I need to upgrade my battery. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a new X3 for the price of the old one and I think that you did a great job.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've only had the iPod mini for two weeks, but already I've changed my opinion of it. I have been using it as an MP3 player and it works well, but I would like to have a way to copy songs from iTunes onto it.   It is not as loud as I would have wanted, but it does play music.  What I love about it is the fact that the mini is a little bit smaller than the older model iPod 5G.  I have been very impressed with this mini device.  It's small, but its got more storage capacity, music player and connectivity features than the more expensive, and somewhat more bulky iPod nano.  I also love the fact it's waterproof!  It also comes with a nice leather case.  The only problem I have with it is that the charging cord for it is not long enough to plug in an iPhone.  A long USB cord would have been a nice addition.  For a less than $10 purchase, this mini should not be overlooked, and for those who have used iPods in the past, this could be a great option for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received my new Samsung Galaxy S III with 16GB memory and no SD card on Monday.   This phone is pretty solid, it's pretty much a perfect phone.  They took their time with the design and materials.  The front and back are made of a black-chrome and glossy plastic.  It's super bright in the sunlight.  I like the color of the screen and the design.  When I look at the back of the phone, I can't see the antenna lines, but they are there.  This is very different from my old iPhone 5 which is a black metal with a black plastic frame.  Samsung also went with a 4.8" touch-screen and not the 5.1" display they had on the old Galaxy S II.  What I like about this phone is the ability to change the phone's screen.  With a simple app on my phone, you can change the back to a larger display.  Other than that, I'm not sure if it's any different from the old Samsung.  So, if you're a big fan of Samsung, you should give this phone a try. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this camera because I'm looking for an all-purpose camera and I really wanted an EVF. This one is a really good all-round camera! It has a fast and accurate auto focus, a great shutter release, and a very solid build. I have taken some pictures with it that I really liked so far. The manual focus is also great for someone like me who has an eye that likes to work with his hands. It's very light and small and easy to hold and move around. The only problem I had with this camera was that it didn't take the best pictures I have ever taken with it. I've had it around since June and I don't know if this is because of the weather or the battery life but it seems to take pretty crappy pictures. I'm hoping that I can get the camera to focus in the same spot consistently. I also want to mention that this camera is really easy to use and learn how to operate. It is fairly responsive and has an on-screen guide so you can see what you're doing. Also, the camera has a mode dial to choose from so there isn't as much guesswork. Overall, I really like my new Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II and I look forward to using it!

Review of an iPhone 6 Plus:  After two years of using the iPhone 4S with Android I found the iPhone 6 plus to be very much a superior handset. The biggest differences are the 4GB of memory and the ability to install iTunes. The iPhone 6plus is far and away better in every way. The camera has not changed at all, and is still excellent. I also find the 4.7 inch screen to be beautiful. I am very glad I got one.

In Italy I used an HTC Desire EYE, and in Switzerland I used a Samsung Galaxy S5. On the iPhone I was not able to buy an Internet phone or a cellular phone, only a wireless one with T-Mobile. The phone has great battery life, and I was able with a great network in Italy to make and receive calls and text messages from both home and abroad. I find myself having the same questions every time I'm out in the world, what to do, and when to do it. Now my iPhone 6 has replaced my HTC Desire. I don't have the Desire, but I have it in my bag now and can easily use it. I will continue to use the iPhone for now, until I can replace it with a better handset. Until then, this is a great device." My Rating: ?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the money, the product and its packaging are top notch. The sound quality of the CD is pretty good as well. I had it for about a month, and it is just as I suspected it would be. The problem I encountered was that a few months ago I installed a better sound card into my computer, and the computer no longer recognizes my CD drive as an optical device. So I decided to buy another, this time a USB one. This time I got the Blue Ray. You can plug it into any computer, but I prefer the CD to the USB one because it has a better high frequency response. This CD is a great investment for someone like me who wants to have quality audio on a regular basis.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as a replacement for a poor quality keyboard which was being sold as a refurbished unit and found this to be a very nice replacement for the keyboard (especially with the extra space for two extra columns and the ability to swap out keys, which is good when changing the layout in some programs). I also replaced the trackball for a better one, but the one I had had a number of dead keys and was somewhat unreliable in my opinion. I like the fact that it has a good tactile feel when using the arrow keys to move the mouse.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: hv_usa
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very happy with my XO-1.    It is a very versatile instrument and will be a great addition to any studio.  It's very easy to play as it's simple to move about the sound stage.  Very little work was needed to get the sound to the XO1.    I will definitely recommend this instrument to anyone who has a need for an electronic recorder.  The only bad thing is that the battery is very small, however, there is an option for a battery pack that will be good to have.  You can find it at most recording stores.  I used the XOS 1 to make music on stage, to record a guitar sound on and then put the mix on headphones to listen to.  Now I have a nice portable recording station.  A great product that does everything that it says it does. XO-100   A very nice little compact recorder, with great features.  In addition to recording with the XE1, the XA1 can be used for all kinds of recording including playing a guitar live or on stage. The XA2 and XA3 also feature a headphone output that makes it a very useful recorder for traveling and also if you are a musician who needs to record in the field.  I also like the fact that it comes with an additional 1" audio interface adapter so you can use a PC to interface with the recorder.   I love my XE-1!   This is my first compact recorder and I am more than pleased with it.  Not only is it very compact but it is great for travel and I have even used it in my car!  The buttons are very easy on/off and it plays back my old analog tape cassettes and has just the right amount of gain.  My only small problem is that I think that it is too bright. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been a Samsung fan for many years. I have two models, a s6 with the S Pen and the Note 7, the latter with a better screen, better battery life and is now my favorite phone.   So when my s6 stopped working on me, it became my greatest concern, as well as my main concern. I knew the battery wouldn't last long. My only other concern is a little bit of damage. But in the end, I'm glad I purchased this.  SAMSUNG M2 Note 7 -    This phone was perfect.  I've had many, many iPhones, and this was the best experience I've had with them.  But it's a bit too thick for me.  However, I love the size and the S-pen makes it super easy to write.  I'm on the second phone as I'm trying to upgrade.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been very happy with the sound quality of the IEMs I have received so far. The only real down side is that the sound is not as wide as other IEM's and the bass is a bit low.   A little higher treble is also required as my IEM only reaches a decent volume level when you crank the volume too high.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - I was a little hesitant about ordering this particular item because the store had some issues with return. I finally got a replacement that worked perfectly. But my one complaint is about the batteries - they will not hold a charge and will often leak. It doesn't take much to break a battery and it's a hassle to replace.  It's not a bad product, but if you want something to hold your e-book on the flight, this is not the product. The device is easy to use. I read a lot while using it and I haven't had any problems. It's not that big a deal. I got one for myself and for a friend who will be traveling with me when I go to Costa Rica.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first saw this thing I thought it would be too big, but its just about perfect. I have the same one that came in the kit but i bought this one because of the light weight. Its easy to set up, and I love the fact that the batteries have an indicator light so i know what my charging status is. I've even done some work at the local park when I went to recharge, and the bike had no problems with running out of batteries. My only other issue is the "g" button on the bottom left corner of the screen. The bottom edge of that button is a little hard to press and there are a lot of tiny plastic particles under the button that scratch the screen when you press on it. Maybe this was something I should have looked into before buying the device, but it seems to be something only the most sensitive of people have an issue with. The best thing about this unit is that you can easily swap out batteries while your charging. Also, I wish that they had some type of LED display on the rear screen, so that you could see what your battery level was at all times. So overall, this is an excellent device and a great addition to the electric bike market.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

The two batteries work great and it has been on my bike for a couple months now.  the only problem I have had is when the batteries are in the low charge level it will not turn the bike on. So I just have to plug it in and it works like a charm. The bike goes from 30 mph to 25 mph in about 15 sec. I highly recommend this unit!  Also, when the bike goes into the "stand by" mode for a few secs it will switch over to a mode where the brake lights blink blue and the red light goes on and off, then it goes into a "motor" mode. This is great for when I'm riding around and need to keep my bike from going off. It keeps my bike nice and legal and ready to go when I get a call. The only problem
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For example, if you were to buy a digital camera or a digital camcorder, there's no need to write about the flaws in the product. On the other hand, if a book is about a terrible film, or a television program is about an amazing director, you should know about the weaknesses in the work. If you want to know about flaws, ask the person who produced the book, the film or the film director. If there are flaws in their work, there are probably flaws in yours as well. (Even though there's a difference between "weaknesses" and "problems" with your book, and the "problem" could be a good thing or bad thing, you can't know unless you have an insight into the flaws and the writer's weaknesses.) To write about flaws is to not care enough about your writing. And that's a mistake. So why is that so common?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you're looking for a nice little portable radio that's good for a wide variety of uses, this thing is a winner.  Excellent for the price I have owned this portable radio for years and it is still going strong. It is very well built and built well enough that it has not failed me. I have had it on a tripod with no problems. It comes with an external power supply and an external antenna. It has been used on a boat, in a car, on a motorcycle, and in a variety of other environments. I would highly recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for something portable that can be used for a lot of things. It doesn't get much better than this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I can't stand the "pump" feature on this headphone. My wife would turn it on and listen to music. Now that she is pregnant and I am still working, I have to turn it off every half hour or so because the volume on it goes up to too high for her. Rated 4 out of 5 by dian from It is nice to be able to listen to the sounds of music. The bass is very good and the treble is very rich. It does take a few tries to find the right balance between both. It doesn't take long at all, and the sound quality is still very good. It is a bit annoying that there is a little bit of distortion in the bass.  Rated 5 out of the 5 by brianr from Great sounding  headphones!!! Bought these a week ago and so far i have been very pleased with them. They sound great and sound good for a casual listening. The one thing i did have a problem with was that when you go to play music it makes a noise everytime you turn it up. i'm not sure if this was a defect from the factory or a problem in the product. so far the product is great.

The first is only for the hard drive and the second is for both the hard disk and the internal power adapter. The latter has some trouble if you put it on the wall with the hard-drive in. Otherwise, it is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great keyboard for the money.   It works fine with the PS2 Controller.  The quality of the keyboard is top notch.  There is no skipping when playing games, and I have had no problems with it.  This would have been the perfect keyboard for me, but I opted for an older version of the PSX that didn't support the keyboard on the PS3, which was only $5 less.  I think this keyboard will be a huge hit for people who are looking for a keyboard that is inexpensive and works just fine with Playstation2 controllers.  If you are looking to save a few bucks, give this a try, it's really worth it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   If you are on a mission to find the perfect electronic device for your home or a small business, I think this is a great tool for you. This product has been in my house for a year and I have had very little problems with it. It is also quiet, which is a plus if you have small kids who are constantly complaining. The only downside is that there is not a clear stand included with the unit. You have to purchase the included stand which comes with a rubber mat to protect your device from scratches. You also have to buy a USB extension cord as the one included in the kit doesn't work for my model. For that extra $40 you might as well just buy the complete kit. You might aswell have bought the same product in the past from the same manufacturer (Adafruit).

I would recommend this app to anyone who wants a better way to watch video and the app is a really good price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As you can see by the pictures above, the Xoom 2 has a much thinner and lighter body than the original Xoom.   I have been using my Xoom since the original was introduced over 10 years ago and there have been no major complaints about the X3.  At first glance, you may not think that the X2 has anything in common with the original but trust me, there is a lot to love about this new model.  There are some definite differences between the X1 and X3, such as the addition of a USB-C port (compared to the micro USB on the original), a better screen (the one on the X0) and the X4 is a bit lighter than the X7.  The other very notable difference between the two is that the screen is now LED-backlit.  For me, LED backlighting is a major upgrade over the previous IPS screens.  I am a HUGE fan of LED backlit screens on LCD devices and they have a definite advantage over IPS screens for gaming, especially on high-res displays.  LED backlights tend to have much better viewing angles than IPS panels and provide a lot of color depth.  In terms of input lag, the difference between these two devices is very minimal.  It's about on par with any other IPS based LCD screen and about half of what it is on the Asus PB287Q.  This device also has better battery life (8:27 vs 8:17).  I could go on and on but the bottom line is that when it comes to a new product line from Lenovo, there have definitely been improvements and improvements over the past year.  My recommendation is to buy the X8i.  Lenovo has made some great improvements in the X series so far.  If you are a fan of the old X1, the new X3 has a lot in common.  To be honest, if you were to only spend the $350 that Lenovo is charging for the X10i, you would still be a much better value than what is currently out there. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is great. I have only played it for 2 minutes but I can already tell the difference from the analog version. Also it has less latency and better quality sound, I think. It is a must for anybody that wants a nice sounding and playing device at an affordable price. Thanks Vtech for making a good product! -- Daniel H. (Hanscom, MA) (May 30, 2018)  I have had the S4 for the last couple of months and I must say, I am totally satisfied with it. Its not perfect, but it is pretty good and is very easy to use. Also I love the fact that its battery is removable and that the buttons and controls have been kept the same as the analog model. I was hoping for a little more power in the bass, but overall I am very pleased with the sound quality and I think it's a great value for the money. -- James G. (Brunswick, ME) (Dec 20, 2017)  is the best I have owned yet. It has just about every feature you can ask for. You just can't beat the price and the sound. I can't believe how much I'm saving. If you're looking for a great sound system but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a no brainer. If there is a better, even better value for money, I don't know it. I'm happy with it as well. -- Chris K. (Portland, ME). (Nov 13, 2017, 3:07 PM)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was my first time using an analog drum set. The unit was easy to set up. I was surprised to see the volume control on the right side of the unit. The sound is good and well balanced. I played the same set on my home hi-fi and the difference is just as noticeable.    5 of 5 Stars I was blown away with this! As the title of the review states, the sound is amazing. This is my first electronic drum set but I'm excited to do more. I wish you had more variations. I can play all the rhythms I like. And I was able to put these together in less than 45 minutes (with a lot of research on how to properly set them up). The drums on this unit are gorgeous. The quality of the sound, the volume, and the responsiveness is amazing!! The quality is top notch and will definitely last for a long time. It took about 45 minutes to set-up all of the drums, but there are instructions on the unit that are easy to follow. I used these to start a new group of kids. The kids loved it. They are in the marching band and they wanted one for the upcoming games! They had a great time and we'll be getting another set for our next game! Thanks Drumhead!  2 of 2 Stars I love this drum set, but it is a pain to set it up. To use the buttons on the side, you have to first unscrew a 2 inch nut, then you unscrew the 8 screws, and then you get to play the keys for the drums. I had to get some help with this. Also, the kick pedal is hard to turn. When playing kick drum, the pedal takes an eternity to come to a stop, and it has to be turned so hard that I'm afraid to lose my balance, and play again. This has been a problem with all of my electronic drum sets I've owned.

I can only say it works exactly as described - nothing more, nothing less.  I bought the "Bosch Smart Watch" for my husband to use while I'm away from home. He really likes it, especially because of its ability to recognize faces. It has the features we needed. It will definitely be used for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought my first e-cigarette in October 2012 from a friend. I liked it right away and decided to try a tank. I read about the battery life being a big concern but I was wrong. I just vape it when I'm at work and my friends come over to vape as well. I like the ability to choose between two tanks. I am also happy that it is so easy to clean since I never had to do it before! I bought the new Aspire Atlantis. The drip tip is great. If you are a beginner or have trouble figuring out how to get it on and off then buy the tank.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the iPod Touch, I can listen to a song or a podcast on the go.   The quality of the sound is amazing.  It can run as low as 500mb and I don't even notice.  The battery is also very long lasting.  I don,t have much money and I've used this  about 5-6 times.  My only gripe is that the charging cable isn't much different from what's out there and it's a little difficult to get to the battery.  Overall I can't find anything to complain about with the iPod touch and I highly recommend the product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the better things I did for my money last year was to get a Roku 3.   It was the first and last one I would buy in the house (after an Apple TV), and I did not regret it.  After playing with it for a few weeks, I found a lot of content I missed on my Apple TV, and the fact that it is so inexpensive meant I was always able to buy it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    (   ) This device is excellent in both use and look.   It can handle a variety of inputs and controls such as a PC printer (with a PC-based printer driver) or even a cell phone. The display is clear and legible. I have used it a great deal since i purchased it and it has served me well.   Have used my computer printer driver on it. It seems to be working great and so far it's holding up well and no problems.  - I purchased this product to use the computer printer, but the only problem is the cable that connects the printer and the driver, the cable is very hard to use.  It's a little bit longer than the driver cable (for me) and a little smaller than the printer cable, so that made it a little difficult to use that way.  I had to take the cable off the printer for it to plug in properly.  Overall, a great product, but I have to say that it could have used a little more flexibility in the printer connector, as I can't use my standard printer cable for the cable.    - It came very well packaged with a plastic case and 2 cables and a power adapter.  The package also included a CD with drivers, but i couldn't figure out how to open the CD or install the drivers.  A total of 4 wires are used for the device.  To be honest, I was very happy about the packaging but it is a little confusing to use if you are not familiar with the connection and cables.  All in all it was a good buy, and I would buy it again.  ( 4 )

I have the cord length set to 9 ft. but have found that I can also get away with using the 12 ft. cord.  I find that it is not necessary to remove the battery pack (unless you have a bad battery)   My main concern is that the charger is so big that it will hurt if you drop it in water. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent tablet I am very happy to have received my new Samsung Galaxy Tab 4.   I've bought many tablets over the years and always get the same issues with their screen or battery life.

My only wish is for the device to have a better battery life as the 10 hours of web surfing is not good.  I also had an issue with my battery life on this device for a few months before I sent it back.  If you want a tablet for the money or if you want an excellent device that can take a beating, get the Samsung Galaxy Tablets.   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

I'm very happy with the product. You can see it in the pictures but its not as big or flashy as other e2's, it just works. There is a small cord, but that's about it. I don't use it very much but I am still happy with it. If you are like me and like a smaller, lighter e2 like i did with my first unit, this is the one to get. There are other products by the same company, but they dont have the battery life I need. You need to know your e2 is the type you need, or get another one and get this one.   "

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have always wanted to know how a digital camera works, so I finally got this to try. I would have bought the Nikon D80 if I were a little younger (I don't even remember what my parents bought me), but I got this instead and I'm really glad I did. The pictures come out great, and I can change the flash in the field without having to bring the whole flash rig to the field (unless there is no other light nearby). The lens is a little fiddly and the battery is not rechargeable, but I think that's an added benefit for a camera like this. I have no idea how the other Nikon models work, so if anyone can enlighten me please do so.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been waiting for a product that would allow me to easily take pictures with my   Pentax   K-3,   and   Kodak 8X12.   The E-mount   is more than satisfactory.  The  E-Mount   allows me to take photos with all of the features that I want.  There   are many more features to choose from. I have not found any   disadvantages to the  E2-S.  I like the auto focus in addition to the high ISO, but I don't like the light weight of this camera.  It   does not have any buttons that are tactile and easy to use.  All in all,  it   should be good for   all   users.   Review by: Joe L. I was able to use it with my K-30 because I took a shot of the sunset at sunset on my K30, and it works great. I love using the   manual setting which gives me some more flexibility, but not so much that it gets in the way. If you use an SLR it's a lot easier. The quality of the photos I've taken with this camera is amazing. I am definitely going to buy this camera again and use it for many different purposes and for many occasions. I would definitely recommend it to someone that wants a compact camera that's a bit easier to use and have more features.  Nice camera I really like this camera it has a lot of features for taking great pictures I wish it came with a lens mount as well the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it has no zoom, so it doesn't have a large telephoto for landscapes, but it is a great camera overall  I've been looking for a compact digital camera for some time now. And I found it at a really good price. I had my K10D and K20D for a few years and they were great cameras with great quality. Then I got a Canon EOS Rebel T6i and it became clear that the quality of my photographs and videos wasn't going to be as high as I wanted. I've always owned a point and shoot and loved it. The only thing I wanted to change was to have a smaller camera.    I bought the E-M5 for a wedding gift. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been having a lot of fun with the Nixie tube. The small size and light weight makes the tube portable. The Nixie tubes are very versatile and it's great to find a nice one to fit the small size of my computer. I got it on the same day it came out and it was great. It was also the only tube I found that didn't come with a CD with a sticker. The tubes are bright enough to read by in most situations, but they are not too bright to be easily visible in the dark. The only drawback to the tubes is that the power supply only has 5 watts. There is a little more power in a regular tube that I used in other types of art.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve from Good Value Nice quality for the price. I have bought these tubes many times. Easy to assemble and great for science and math projects.

You won't regret buying this one.   the battery lasts forever and still does not lose any power in charging and playing.   in the store it came with the USB charger but you can just use the included micro usb cable which makes it super easy to use. you won't be disappointed by this one!  Went to Radio Shack and bought a Korg Kaossilator. Got this instead of a KORG SQ10. Great sounding for about $30. Also have used it with a Tascam DR-30mkII. No big deal with Korg but it did work better with the SQ10 with the 2 in one. Very nice sounding.  So, I don't get why this is not 5 stars.   is this worth it? I donít want to sound negative because I LOVE this sound so much!   It was worth a try but the sound of this is amazing! Itís worth it if you like Korg or SQ10, but I would recommend getting something else!

It was good enough to get me through college on a laptop, but it would be nice to use on a car stereo as well. Recently, I got the "iPhone" and had my first experience with using a car radio to listen music. Now that the iPod is obsolete, I find myself using my "iPhone". The sound quality is amazing and the speed is better than a computer. The only problem is that when you switch from music, to an MP3, to a movie or something else, it takes a little bit of getting used to.

The Dell XPS 13 is a solid device for everyday use and its large screen is a delight to work in. I love the keyboard layout, the large screen, the weight, and the keyboard. The XPS has an excellent trackpad that provides a great experience. The keyboard is also quite good and well constructed. The trackpad can be quite a chore to use, though. I had to set the cursor on the bottom right corner, and it's a hassle to manually move my mouse around. I'd have liked a trackpad with one finger. Overall a very good laptop with all the functionality that most people want, though it's no match for the MacBook Air and a MacBook Pro. The new MacBook Air has much better battery life and a faster processor, and a better display with sharper and larger text and greater color saturation and contrast.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent laptop This is a fantastic laptop. The screen is excellent, the keyboard is great, the build quality is top notch and the performance is very high, if not just as good as the MacBook Pro and iMac. It's just not for me and I've been looking for a replacement for a while now, but haven't been able to. It has a great keyboard with no backlight, which is pretty rare in a laptop nowadays. I'm not the type to touch type, and my fingers are pretty beat up, but when I do type I like the way the keys feel, the keys are small enough for my fingers to be comfortable. Also it's an awesome looking computer, it's sleek and light, very sleek and I love how the ports are all on the back. I've had this computer for a little over a month and it is still very snappy, with lots of games and a lot of background music. I highly recommend this computer and it will stay on my desk.  of course you can't have everything, so when I see a review that said this laptop is heavy I think it's not worth the money. I bought a used one from Best Buy for less than half the price, the XPS's weight is fine for what I need. This one has been a great purchase, it gets more use then my MacBook Air. I don't recommend buying this from BestBuy, I was able to get it for less then the original price from a website

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a "Cougar" at a bargain price of $89.95, but a little too quickly for my taste. The Cougar is a high quality, compact, well-designed electronic cigarette that is easy to use, very convenient to carry, very well made and the warranty is great.  The Cougars battery, if you buy from them, are only $8.95 a month (or $35.00 a year) and the charger is $8, which is really cheaper than most of the brands of e-cigs.   The batteries are replaceable so you don't have to worry about the battery going dead.  It does have a low ohm resistance (1.3-1.4 ohms) and also has a very low throat hit, but that can be offset by other things such as using a smaller coil, or using a larger tank.  Some people have told me that the flavor is off in this model, but I've been using it on a daily basis since getting it about 3 months ago and it's just fine.  For the price, the quality of this product is quite good and will last you a good, long time.  This product can be purchased on: Amazon.com   If you have a few minutes, I suggest you read the product review before you purchase the item, to learn what you might be buying. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used this with an old monitor and an old sound card and it works well. The monitor is a little old, but that's the way it is. I'm impressed that the monitor comes with a stand that will hold it up and look nice too.   Also, I did get one of these for my old VCR.  I don't have a monitor, but I have a computer so I figured it was worth a try...  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    So, I received my HP e-Reader with a great deal of anticipation and anticipation. I have a small room that is limited to a few books on my bookshelf and this is the closest I have to a home library. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoy this e-reader. My favorite feature is the ability to write on the page when I am not working. That's it. The paper is sturdy and will withstand the daily demands of a work/play lifestyle. The writing is great. It has a smooth feel, and the ink is vibrant and easy to read.   In order to use the HP Web Browser, you will have to make a few choices. First of all, I recommend you read the following:  You can purchase a Microsoft.NET 2.0 based PC from B&H or other sources. I recommend the HP Compaq. It comes with a free version of Windows.    First off, if you do not have a CDROM drive, there is no other choice other than using a CD/DVD drive. In addition to using a DVD, you can also use a USB flash drive. You may also wish to download a program called Windows Media Player that you can download from the net. I use it on all my PCs. It's a simple and convenient tool for watching movies, listening to music, and accessing the Internet from your PC. The operating system is Windows NT 4.0. The software is extremely popular.  Many people have installed it, installed a few apps, and still have the CDROM. I suggest installing a CD-RW drive, but if you don't have one, this will help with file operations.  As I said before, the operating system of Windows 95 and later is very user-friendly. However, I believe that the new versions of Windows XP and Vista will not be so user-friendy. It can be difficult to use a computer without having a CD drive, and it can be very frustrating trying to find a place to install the CD-ROM. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this phone for a couple of weeks now. It is great at receiving calls from people who are on the way to my place. They were not too excited at first because they did not have a GPS and the phone had no reception.   This is the most reliable phone I have ever had.  The voice quality is fantastic.  It does not have an internet connection. It has a very good battery life.  When I am away from my computer, I still have the ability to make calls and to see the current weather.  My family and I have also been very happy with the screen and the ability for it to recognize when I put the battery in. The only down side is the ability of the GPS.  But it does not seem to have that problem very often.  I am so happy I have this phone. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently upgraded from my last desktop PC, a Dell Inspiron 1510. This laptop was my first purchase in this category, and I am very happy with it. The keyboard is nice and responsive and the screen is very bright and the built-in speakers provide good sound quality, though they are very quiet. The only thing that has bothered me is that the Wi-Fi does not always connect, especially when you are sitting down or even moving. This could be because the laptop is a bit older than my old Dell (though I would expect something that old to be outdated). For $1000+ I expect it to perform well, so I will continue to use this for the foreseeable future.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The battery life of the device is awesome, however I would have liked it to charge even faster. A little bit more to go for more juice in the tank, otherwise great.    A good value    An excellent starter vape.  For the price, this is a great value. The vape is smooth and tasty. Great battery life for such a small device.  I would recommend it  I'm new to vaping and I ordered this for my boyfriend because he loves his RDA and this was exactly what he wanted for his first time vaping. The RDA is pretty nice too.  RDA This RDA gets rave reviews from guys in vaping clubs so I figured I would give it a try. I have a pretty average taste and I've never been a huge fan of juices but this one has me hooked! I've put on a decent amount of nicotine but not as much as I am used to. I love the flavor of the liquid. I put in the coil the first time just to see how it worked. When I switched it out for the coil to replace it I noticed that the atomizer blew up when I hit the top of the coil. After the first couple of puffs I decided to keep it the same. I was able to vape it on a 50 watt mod for a couple of days, however, the flavor wasn't great and the vapor was a bit weak. I would say that if you like stronger flavors then you might want to stay away from this.  The coil is great though, just a bit too big for me. I'm used to a 3.7 ohm coil so it was a little much for me to handle. Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, the only thing is that I should have ordered a couple different flavors and not just vanilla so that I can have a little variety in my rotation.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the best USB drives I have ever used.   It does everything you need it to do, it is fast and very small, the storage space is great and it is very well built.  My only wish is that it had a 2.5mm to 3.5 mm adaptor, as I prefer the smaller end of the spectrum.  Also, a better quality cable would be great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was really impressed by the quality of the watch and the smart features it has. The watch is an absolute work of art, with a large, crisp design and great color. The dial is a little small for my taste but the crystal is gorgeous and the strap is super durable. I also really enjoy the built in calendar, which keeps track of the day's events for me, and keeps my tasks in order. I have to admit I have been playing with the watch a little too much lately. I keep it in my car, and I have made numerous mistakes in using it, which is really annoying! That being said, I would recommend this to a friend, and a friend to a close friend. :) - James, St. Cloud, MN
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have purchased a number of these to date and have no complaints. Very smooth, but not noisy, and they do not have a built-in speaker. Very happy with these and the price, they are a good buy for the price.   - Mike W. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first electronic product and my first wireless device so I can't compare. I had one of the first wireless devices and my hands and wrist started to hurt. I don't know how long it would have lasted if I didn't have this device. It has so many features that I am sure it will last forever.   It's really small (for a wireless device) and light, I love the color and the design.  I bought this for my mom and she is a wireless person and has had a few of these and they work great. It's a good device for someone that isn't very tech savvy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first thing I noticed about the EZR X is that the display is larger than usual on a portable radio. I think this is a good thing. I like to read and watch TV at the same time so it makes a good second radio. The radio is well built and has nice audio quality. The included CD player works very well and is easy to use. The sound quality is clear and the volume and tuner works great for the $50 price. The battery life is about 4 hours which isn't bad at all. The one criticism I have is that some of the buttons on the radio are hard to press and feel a little cheap. I can't say I didn't know that they were there because the buttons don't feel solid but they are still hard to use sometimes. This is probably something that could be fixed with a small sticker over the buttons but I think it's worth the small price to get the X.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     4.0 out of 5.0 stars from 26 reviews  I bought this for my teenage son after we bought his own computer for him to play games on. We use the wireless keyboard and the keyboard has worked great so far. It's a little bit hard to see a picture, but we've figured out the settings. The mouse is a little slow but we use it for our computer anyway so there is that. Overall, it's a great unit for the price!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   So in case you were wondering, these speakers look pretty good. The price is pretty good too.   So the best part is that all you need to do is install a few cables and your speakers are set up. The speaker cables are long enough to run between the two speakers, but not so long that they can't reach the outside. They have a very sturdy mounting system and sound very good.  Now for the part that people who aren't techy would care about:  Now these are my main speakers and I'm very happy with them.  This speaker was about $100, and that included shipping. So it took me about 2 days to get it to my door. The best part about the speakers is that they are very loud. These are more of a stereo or stereo/center sound speakers. The bass and treble sound very nice. I use these as a sub to my tv and as the main speakers for my computer. The quality is very good and it has the ability to play music and videos.  So for $100 (and a few more for the mounting hardware) you can get something very good with lots of power. I've used my own speakers in this configuration before and it works quite well.  The only thing I would suggest is that you purchase the extra cables if you don't use your own cables. I found these to be very short on the connectors, and I only have 2 of them so I ended up buying 3 cables. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a new Samsung galaxy tablet and I absolutely love the fact that it has a microSD card slot. I have already used up my microSD so I use the card as much as I can.   My only problem is that when I am running out of space I need to use a card reader and then when I need more space it seems to disappear as if I have no more space for it.  Review of DJI Mavic Pro (Black) - 1st Class:   I have to say that this drone was great! The Mavics are very responsive and do not drop frames and have very low lag times. The camera is bright and easy to take shots from any angle. I am currently using the Mavitek Mavica for the videos. However, I have had a problem with the battery that will not charge from the USB port and I have to use my phone as a charger. I also had the drone get stuck in the sky and I can not get it down, just as soon as I put the drone in the basket and put it in the air. So this is a very sad part of the drone. It would be nice to have some sort of charging or software option so it could be charged from a regular wall outlet. -  Video Quality   Video is good. As you might expect, the video is very HD, and the quality is quite high. The best video is when the drone is stationary, as the motion blur is a bit less and it still looks pretty good. The HD camera and the fast AF speed make the drones videos very good. I especially like how the drone flies and moves while taking a photo, which gives it a cinematic feel to it. I was not that impressed with the video in low light settings as I saw the motion is kind of blurry.  have the same issue as mentioned in the last post. The video quality is good, but not as good as the Maviics, and I was worried about this since the MAVI is so much more expensive than the DJI Pro. I can't wait for the Maven's release in November, so I can finally buy a cheap drone and try out a GoPro :)  Other Thoughts   - I have not yet had any issues with the batteries. The Maviic Pro I got has been my drone for the past couple weeks and has not had any problems. . I would
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     The unit is really a good value for the money.  I use this for a home and school use. I like the fact it's a small, portable unit. I was worried about the unit's power but it's powered by 3 AA batteries which are cheap. I have had no problems so far. The unit seems to be a good quality unit. This unit is very easy to assemble. I really like the touch screen interface. The device was quite large for my needs but I had to use some tools to hold it down on the table to make it more compact. I think I may do some research and find the best way to use this thing in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For those of you who are looking for a decent little music player:  The Pinnacle P5 is the most powerful and versatile digital music player I have tried to date.  It has a ton of features and is very well built.   The sound is really clear and it's fast, intuitive and powerful.  I've been using it for over a year now and it just keeps getting better and better!   For the money it's well worth it for those who need a lot of features or for those just looking for something for casual listening.  The only downside is that it has a bit of a learning curve (since I've owned my share of MP3 players).   Still worth it though for those looking for an advanced player.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device is exactly as described. The user guides the device with their fingers. There are 2 directions that the user can push a button and turn the device on or off. There is a 3 button push and a 4 button push on the front of the device. There was some difficulty getting the power switch to work out of the box. A small piece of plastic came off after a few minutes.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using this little guy for about a week now, and I'm very impressed with it. The light works extremely well, and it works on the spot. I would say that it's just as good as an AA/AAA or AAA/12v device, but better in some aspects. The batteries don't last nearly as long as the batteries in my older cell phone. The price is a bit higher than the cheap AA/12 volts or AAA's, but I know that's due to a few manufacturers putting out crap. It's only $10!   If you buy one of these, you will be pleased.

I'm sure there's a way to get a decent sound out of this but I can't think of it right now.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received this device as a present from my wife and has been very well used. I have no complaints with the product.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Just not good! This was just bought to use as a computer monitor but I don't even think that's what it's for. It's just so poorly designed that the display goes black when your hands are on the keyboard/mouse. And when your holding your computer the display just blanks. This device is so poorly engineered it's pathetic!

I like that I can change the colors easily, as well as the brightness of the monitor to suit my mood at the time. It gets great battery life.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the fact that I can use my phone without the battery draining out, and I can leave my home with a fully charged battery with one hand, without having to use the USB to charge a cord.   My biggest complaint about this battery is that it can't charge a PC battery. The two USB ports on the side of the battery are in such close proximity to each other that I always end up plugging the battery into one and pulling it out the other end (for charging both devices, the USB port for the battery and the USB charger for the computer.) I'm not sure if this is a defect in the battery, or just a matter of bad luck.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    (I'm sorry for saying the wrong words. My bad) - This is my first one. I am very pleased with this. I have a Pippin mini which I use for travel and to keep in my car. It is a small device. You can't even really use it that well in my case. It has a good battery, but the buttons are so difficult to press with your fingers that I have to hold my phone still and use the pointer with two fingers to push the buttons. I'm now trying a Bluetooth device but am having a very hard time getting it to connect with my Pippint.   - (I was just a bit worried) I have one and have been using it for a couple of weeks. It seems to work well so far. When you hold down the power button it turns on automatically and the screen is very bright. The main thing is that the screen seems to get so hot if you hold the power on for a long time. I do think it is because I keep the device in the car where the sun shines through the glass. That also causes the screen to get hot. It does not work well in a dark car because the glass is too hot. The one on the right is better but it is more expensive.  - This one seems to be working well. I've got a couple more but only had them for about a week so can't comment on them.    - - - (a little worried that it may not be quite what I expected.) I've been using my old one for several years and am pleased with it and find it a perfect fit for my needs. I got it with a new battery and my old battery lasted about 10-15 minutes less on charge when compared to my new one. However, the charging is somewhat slower than my old device and the display gets to hot in bright light. I bought a new one so I can continue to use it for about two more years. I have been looking for a replacement for the Pippie since I saw it on ebay for around $50. I went ahead and paid the extra $30 (plus shipping) for this one. It was less than half the price of the ebay ebay page and had a good reviews from many different people. I put my old (now dead) phone on it with an adaptor to use as a car phone to see if it would make a good replacement. I
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the Yuneec Typhoon-X 4.5 g compact flashlight in October and I have used it several times and really like it a lot. It is very bright and has great reach and is easy to use. It does have a very short battery life and the light gets very warm, but it is not too bad. I have the red and white versions and both work great.    Excellent!   The Yuneeco Typhoon-Y 4.2 was recommended by a friend and we immediately bought it for our Christmas gift. It's the first compact flashlight we've purchased and we love it!     Best flashlight ever!  We used the YM-XE flashlight for a couple of years and it has been our go to flashlight. It has very good battery life, good beam (bright enough for all but the darkest places) and good range for its size. I had some issues with the battery life a few months ago, but we decided to buy a new one and have been very happy with the results. We love it so much that we have started looking for a YMXE in a slightly larger size for our larger pockets.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the only unit I have ever seen with an LED indicator on the unit. There are some that do this, but I like this one better. There was a small light that flashed when the light came on which indicated that the unit was on. It did not blink and did not indicate the battery is low. The unit worked well and was easy to use.   It was hard to adjust the light intensity without a screwdriver so I had to put a paperclip over the unit that has a screw on end to keep the unit from turning off. I have a second one but it is a little hard to find the unit when its dark.  It is a great value   I would recommend this unit if you have an old model to sell or trade.  I bought it because I wanted to give it to my brother because he wanted one. He was excited about getting the second one too.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The main problem with the P.R.S.B. was the lack of a key.   You can use it as a switch, but its a tiny touch screen and the button is way too small to use as a toggle.  The key is nice and large, however, and it's easy to press.   Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, February 03, 2011  Best electronic keypad in my entire house  by Jeff from Southfield MI USA  Review: It's a very useful keypad. It fits right in with my keyboard. I can use my mouse and keys on the same keyboard. The key layout is simple, no more than you would find on a PC. It's easy and intuitive to use. The only thing I did differently was to use one key to access the "Back" and "Forward" buttons on the computer, but now I don't even have to think about it.  Did you find this review helpful?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this as a gift from my husband, he has been using a Motorola g3 for years on a mobile home. He is very happy with the new g3, he is a very tech savvy man. He was in the market for a new smartphone, he liked the phone the best but had not been able to buy one in a while. He found this on the interwebs. I was a bit apprehensive to try it. It is great that it came so quickly, as the phone is in perfect condition. I can't believe it. The phone is extremely fast to charge and is easy to program. The picture is good, even though my wife has a camera phone. This is the best phone I have ever used! I bought this as an upgrade from the G3s.  Write a negative review about an inferior product:

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently bought a new computer to replace my old i7 laptop. The new computer is a Thinkpad X220 that was bought new several years ago and is still running fine. After spending thousands of dollars on hardware upgrades, I am very pleased with the speed and stability of the new computer. The only problem I have had is the battery life, however, I purchased a brand new Lenovo battery which has lasted several years in this case. I have no problems with Windows 8.0.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a beautiful product. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and build of it. I've had several other keyboards and there are a few that come close in look and feel to this, but they all have one thing in common that this does not: the key travel is about 4mm. I would much rather have a 1.25" keyboard than one with that much travel, especially for a mechanical keyboard. The only major downfall to this device, if there is one, is the price point and the shipping cost. At $200-250, it is an overpriced keyboard, and I think it could be had for less by a small vendor. Overall, a great mechanical keyboard, but the shipping and price are a bit out of hand.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The build quality of the Wacom Bamboo Note is very good, and the quality of drawing that can be accomplished with it is very nice, with excellent performance on both tablet and stylus. It is a great computer for drawing and painting, and its small size and light weight make it very portable.   This is a fantastic computer, and I hope you make more models like it. I would recommend it to any one who is looking for a nice, large, affordable, and light portable computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One thing I liked about the DVR is that it had a way to find out what programs were available to you while away from home.   The DVR did have to install software and a monthly fee. The only con that I had about the unit was that it didn't have a remote (or a button to turn it off).   One thing that I did like about the software is that you could customize your settings (for example, turning on commercials or programming you want in a specific time slot). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like the sound of this speaker!   It sounds great while you're riding or jogging.   The high end sounds really good and the bass is very good!  Thanks for a good product.   Rated 5 out of 5 by BobW from It's a good speaker and it's a decent price.  I used to own a Yamaha MPX-1000 and while the sound quality was great the price was a bit high. I bought this unit to replace it and it is very nice. It does not make much power (about 4 watts) but it has a good sound that is pleasant and a good price. I am surprised that it is so quiet (not much if any distortion) while having such a great sound.  It is heavy but the controls are easy to use and I love the ability to switch between volume and treble levels.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This one is nice to use, but some minor problems: 1) It takes more effort to turn the volume up than down. You have to twist the knob more. 2) It can be difficult to use because of the "clicky" clicky plastic. 3) The only way to turn it on or off is by inserting a "switch". I do not like the switches on the keyboard. This could have been done a different way. The keyboard is not easy to adjust to your typing style or to type on without being pressed on the top of the keyboard as I usually do. I usually find the "A" key to be difficult too and that is one of the keys I have to press more. Overall, good product. The good thing is that this keyboard is a great buy.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a good product. The battery life is good and you can be up and running in minutes rather than hours.   The only problem is that it does not work with a tablet or a notebook but I found that using the phone works just fine. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the G-Pad X7 for $149.00 (plus $15 shipping) to replace my old one, which I really love, but the battery was getting low and I wasn't finding much time to use the tablet. I have been very pleased with the performance of the new G-pad, and it is very small compared to my old Asus tablet and not that much larger than a paperback book. I had to buy a separate power cord for the tablet, as the one included was too small, so it is now in my bag at all times to take along for a "work" day.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I don't like this at all. I get the same sound out of my Sony D2H.   The microphone is good, and the remote is fine. I don't need a second phone.  That's where this device falls flat.  If you like the Sony D1, I think this is a better phone in terms of sound quality.  But if you want to put on your headphones and use the phone as a portable speaker, I don a look at Sony's D1. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the e-pouch because I was tired of carrying paper folders and not having a back up in the field when I lost them. I thought it would be handy to have in a backpack, so I bought one of these. I love the size, it fits easily in my backpack and keeps the folder I need with me. The clip on the side is a nice added touch.    Best Electronic device ever!!!   This is the best e-paper I have ever seen! I use it for documents and pictures in a digital field. This is so cool.  I really love this thing!   Bought it because my old notebook had a very poor paper quality. This e-pad has a much better print quality! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   1. This is the best bluetooth speaker   The sound is amazing. The volume is great but I still prefer the audio from my old bluetooth speakers. The bluetooth connection is pretty solid but I wish the connection was a little stronger.    2. The speaker is fairly deep in terms of bass but doesn't reach deep enough. The bottom of my ear hurts when I listen to music at high volume. The bass is not very deep so if I am going to sit down and listen to my bluetooth in bed I prefer the speaker to be on high for maximum volume. 3. I found it hard to connect my phone without it sounding distorted or having bad battery life. I'm hoping this will be resolved with firmware updates   4. The screen brightness is amazing   It is bright enough to not blind others but the colors don't always pop off the screen and the screen comes off as a pale blue. There's no need for this device to be brighter and this only comes at a higher price than the competition.  5. I don't like the volume knob being on the left hand side. This makes the speaker look like it's sitting in my lap when I'm in my kitchen or back when I am on my bed.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this to help me with writing, as a part of my education. I use this device every day. The device allows me to have a lot of free time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For starters, I would have loved to have had a remote. I was not pleased with the remote. It was easy to use on some devices but a pain on others. It had limited functionality on some things such as the iPod and the iPad. I did not like that it would not work without the iPod's battery. On other things, it is very easy to adjust the brightness, volume, mute, and so on, which is important on a device that is being used all day long. The screen was not as bright as other electronic devices I have owned and it was very difficult to use the device with the screen on full brightness. It also had some trouble staying on the right side of the display. On the plus side, the remote control worked flawlessly on the iPhone, the iPad, and the iPod. I would like to see more in the future on the design of the remote, but overall a great product and definitely a buy. I also would have appreciated a wireless charging capability. The batteries lasted for about an hour but they did have some issues. On several occasions they would not charge at all. The charging cable was not made with USB technology, but rather with an old and weak type of cable from the '80s. I have not heard much about the replacement cables that will be sent in the near future. However, I still think that the company should be more generous in the replacement of this product. I do have a few gripes but overall it is an excellent product.

I have purchased several rechargeable batteries from other stores that I really liked, but none of them have a micro-usb connector. So when I saw that you carried a product like this, I was excited to purchase it. Unfortunately, the product did not work at all. I contacted your customer service, but they did not even return my message. I really wanted to support your company and support your products. Instead of answering my questions or even sending me a replacement, they simply ignored me and did not return my email. The item is good quality, and I was very satisfied with it. But I was disappointed that your company doesn't even care enough to do the right thing. It is my opinion that this is a product that should have a mini-USB to microUSB cable. I hope that the company will rectify this issue, because it would not make any sense for it not to be. I'm very unhappy with you company because it makes me feel like I am wasting my money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am really glad I purchased this!   At first I wasn't sure how much it would actually be, but I did have my doubts.   It's definitely on the smaller side, and definitely looks small, but it is actually pretty heavy!  It is really nice to have a solid piece of glass and metal to hold on to.  It comes with a good looking little carrying case with it, and even if it wasn't made in the U.S. it would still make a pretty good purchase.  The best part about this product is its battery life.  I'm able to take it with me pretty much anywhere I go.  There is only one bad thing that I've had to say about this device: the light.  To be honest I have had it for a few months now, and I have gotten really sick of having to adjust the brightness.  Other than that, I can't believe that I paid this much for a product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use it on my cellphone a lot. I use the phone and a headset and have both run without issues.   What I like about it the most is the size of the screen. I have a large iPhone so it's not so big.  I've been looking for a bigger screen in an iPhone and I can't believe I'm finally finding one.  The software is a little rough on the phone sometimes and sometimes it's fantastic. It's always just right so it doesn't take up too much space.  This is a phone that I've owned for more than two years.  It is as good as new.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was my first laptop so I was nervous. I purchased it to use with my computer since it was so tiny. The size, the keyboard, the touch screen. The touch screen worked well so far and I can use the computer with this. The only reason why I gave it only 3 stars is that the keyboard was too small and cramped. I have bigger hands than the size of this one so I had to switch to a different size. The other one is still good but I would suggest getting another size if you want a keyboard that is easier to type on. This review was written before the screen cracked and after a few days of use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently bought a Galaxy Nexus, and I found that a really great feature of the phone is that it has a "Gestures and Search" function. So you don't have to use your mouse or keys to search the web, or to navigate through an app. This feature is useful on many websites, but not all. It only works with websites where you have to search, like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps, or YouTube. Google's search is also limited, so I haven't found any Google apps for the phone. This is a very nice feature, but it will not help you use a tablet, since it won't be as easy to type on a large screen. But this phone is really well built. I was given this phone after using a Samsung Galaxy S4, and it has more features, but a lower price. The screen is very large. The software is not as good as the Galaxy S3 or Galaxy S III, but still great. It is really easy to get on a tablet (except for Google Doc and Google Maps) since it is a really big phone. When I was reading reviews on the internet, I was surprised to find that most people said that this phone was the best. I bought the phone after reading several other reviews, and the only thing that stood out is that the phone was good, and very good. This phone was perfect for my first smartphone, and for when I have a laptop for my computer. I will buy more.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A lot of the products I have seen from this company seem to lack the reliability of those of the larger manufacturers. This device has a lot of potential but I can not recommend the device without being aware that there is no way to control the voltage, the output is too high, and the charging port is very small. The device only has a micro USB and this device needs a bigger output port to be able to charge faster. I am glad I finally found a product that matches my expectations.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I am really excited about this little guy! I don't have much experience with audio equipment but this is by far the best sound I have ever heard. It was easy to setup and use. The only problem is that it takes a few minutes for the audio to start playing - it's an off-brand speaker so they don't use the same quality as the audio on my laptop. It's not my fault though. I'm not a tech, so I can't be more than a casual listener, but I'll take the good sounds.   This is a solid piece of equipment. It is not for everyone, but if you're looking for a reliable little piece of audio equipment to get started in audio this is a great starter kit.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This thing is a great tool to have!   This is my second computer that i have owned, i do not use the word amazing, but i do use it like a "normal" computer. I used my first to write this review, and i was a bit disappointed that i bought a "new" one, but this new one is a GREAT DEAL! i have been in need of a desktop computer to do alot of things, so i finally did get one, and it does a lot of the same things that my previous computer did, and at a MUCH cheaper price! the keyboard is great, i like that it is backlit, it looks good, i have a touchpad but i think the buttons on the mouse are better because the button feel a bit better, the case is solid as a rock, it seems to be pretty well made. i think i can afford to buy another one of these in the future (hopefully not the black) and i will be getting a monitor to use with this one as well. for the price it is a steal, it's not the best computer, but it will do all the things you want, and do it well. i know for sure, i am going to get another one!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the i1 in September, 2017 for my personal use.   This is a solid device for the price.  I use it to watch movies, play games, and to watch 4K HDR content.  All of the audio is clear.  The buttons on the side are small but firm, and the power button is on the top of the device.  There is a good variety of inputs and outputs.  While this is the smallest TV i have bought, I did not find any of the screens to be off-centre, and a few were slightly off-center.  i1 will also be a nice addition to my home theater system.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have always been a Mac guy. I was looking for a portable computer but I could never get one I really liked. I had a friend send me an Apple Watch that I love and now that I have it I can't imagine going back to the Mac.   The watch is so light and portable that I don't even need to carry my laptop around with me.  I am so glad I bought one.   Read a bad review about an electronic device and share your opinion:  How can a phone review not include the Apple Watch? I'm glad you asked!   This is a good little device and it will fit in almost every pocket, but what really makes it special is the Apple operating system. It's so much more than a smartwatch. I'm now using my watch as a virtual GPS on my phone. It will also take the place of my phone as my primary source for sending and receiving text messages and phone calls.  With the Watch you can see the weather, texts, notifications, etc. on your wrist as if you were a real person in the room with you. The only thing I don' t like is the fact that Apple has locked the watch only to the iPhone 5 or later. The company would be smarter to offer a cheaper and less complicated watch that can be used on the Apple Store's website, as well as on the iPhone and iPod touch.  The Watch has a nice, quiet screen, so it's not loud like a phone, but the vibrations are loud enough to be distracting to some.  My watch is currently charging on the same battery as my iPhone.  It's still not a battery replacement for me, but I'm not worried about having to buy a new battery for my iPhone, and I won't be using the Watch all that often. I don\'t need it for calls and messages.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I got the T9 in the mail today, and it is beautiful. My son and I have been playing with it for the last two weeks. I was impressed with the build quality of the guitar and the neck's quality. The tremolo is excellent, and the pickups sound great. The bridge is pretty solid and gives an amazing sound. I have only played the T8 since I got the guitar. I thought it was pretty much identical to the T6 but the bridge, strap lugs, and pickup switch are all different. As the owner of the T5, I was excited to get the T4 but I couldn't be happier with this T9. I would say it is a bit more expensive but the quality is definitely worth the price. I do like to tune to E, but I really like the tremolo and the bridge is a great place to rest your finger. The neck is pretty stiff which I expected.  No Was this rating helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a beginner on the electric guitar. I got this guitar because I really wanted to learn electric guitar with something different. The guitar is pretty well made and does what it says on the can. I play along with the guitar and am able to play all the standard guitar licks that a beginner needs. For the price, it's hard to beat this guitar. If you want an electric guitar for guitar lucks, I recommend getting one. If it's just to learn chords on, I'd pass.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking for a good Bluetooth speaker and when I tried the new Bose speakers I found out they are worth every penny. The sound is better than most other Bluetooth speakers I've heard and the only thing that would make it better is the addition of bluetooth. The batteries last a long time and the volume and quality is great. This thing is a great investment and I am very pleased with it. Thanks to the sales staff for making the Bose brand awesome.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the first electronic devices I purchased was a "Sega Genesis." The game selection was pretty limited at the time, so I went in expecting a good game. I was surprised by the overall quality of the product. I felt the games were a bit rough around the edges and could have been slightly better. However, if you like a good retro game, the Genesis is one of the best.   The Genesis was the best choice for me at the initial purchase.   Rated 5 out of 5 by jim from Excellent Sound & Visual The Genesis is a great addition to my collection of older video game systems. I'm especially proud of my system because it's one of only a handful of older consoles that are equipped with the internal speaker. Not only is it nice to hear the sound of the game, it's also great to watch the video screen in action. The sound quality of this Genesis system is outstanding. For the price, you can't beat this. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first time i bought a product from a website and am very satisfied. Very satisfied with the product and will definitely buy from here again. "   I bought this for my husband to use with his iPhone. He likes the sound of the sine wave, but the unit is a little loud, which is what the sound control slider controls. He really liked how the unit worked and the fact that it came with a small bag of rice and noodles. It would have been nice if they had included some of those things with the unit. Overall a great product.   "  I've always wanted a sine-wave generator, but I couldn't justify spending the money for a $200 unit (the same price as the one on Amazon.) But, I was so happy when I got this one from the link you provided. I can't recommend it enough. It is exactly what I needed. It makes the room feel warm and cozy. I especially like the fact you can dim it down a few notches from the default level and have it be so gentle that you almost feel like you are listening to the sound through a straw. It's a great sound generator, I've used it several times since purchasing it. It just makes a big difference. Thanks! "

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You can connect your computer or tablet to this unit. I don't know if you can also connect your TV. There is a micro USB cable included. You can plug a mouse and keyboard in. I did not have a mouse or keyboard available. I didn't like the wireless feature because it is a bit noisy. It was also quite a few wires and not something you want to have to connect to the front of your TV or monitor all the time. You could get the cordless controller for less and save some money. However, it is not as good as a corded controller. It does have two USB ports instead of just one. You should be able to play games on it using either a wireless mouse or a wireless keyboard.   Overall, if you have a computer that can connect to your TV, then you should get this unit because it works well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My son was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor at the age of two and since then has been on two different chemotherapies. The first was a month in the hospital and a month on a lot of other medications, and the second chemo was so intense that it made my daughter very sick too. This tablet has allowed our family to have better control of our son since he has begun to get better. We are looking forward to continued improvement in his condition and are highly impressed with the quality of this medication. Thank you for this wonderful medicine that allows us to take more time with him.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - The screen is just about perfect for reading, video watching, gaming, etc... The only thing I wish it had was a few extra buttons... like the Power button.    - The battery is a bit disappointing for such a portable device. I would still recommend this for gaming.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    What is the current state of the art on a wireless internet connection? The answer is the latest generation of wireless networks and equipment, which are capable of up to 10.4 Mbps.   The technology is getting better all the time.  Are there any real benefits to wireless over wired connections? No.  The primary benefit is speed:  The wireless network has a theoretical maximum speed of about 10.6 Mbps. This would make it much faster than the wired connection.  We are in the process of adding some speed tests that measure the actual wireless download speed. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I bought this to make music on the radio with my iPod Touch 5th gen. I'm a big fan of both the analog and digital radio modes, so this device was a good addition. I liked the ease of adjusting the volume to my liking, as well as being able to adjust the sensitivity with the knob. As an extra feature, it also has the ability to play back files that are not stored in the phone, allowing me to watch a video on my iphone, or listen to a music file on my portable media player. Also, I found the digital mode much better than the analog in my opinion. If you're looking for a portable radio to listen to, you might as well get a digital, because this device will do what you need. The only thing I would add is that if you have the volume knob set to maximum, you will be missing out on some bass because of the sensitivity of the volume control.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this for my wife as a gift and it's been a great investment. It's a good size, looks nice and the sound is great. She has been using it for some time now, she loves it and the music she listens to is much better.    I'm really pleased with the purchase and would recommend it to a friend.  I like the size. I also like the sound quality.  It's got a long battery life so you won't run out of juice but it is not very bright which is great for listening to podcasts, songs and movies.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first got the FiiO E8 I used it with my A-10. I didn't really know what it was, and the noise was very bad. The A-11 had a bit more volume and sounded much better with the E8. But then the A-9 came out, and I was very excited about the noise reduction. I use it mainly with my DSD DAC for the M-Audio MX25 and it does a really good job. It was just too quiet to use with my M-250 with the DAC, but it was ok with my portable DAC. I wish it had a wider variety of inputs, but I guess that is a minor complaint, especially with the price point.
