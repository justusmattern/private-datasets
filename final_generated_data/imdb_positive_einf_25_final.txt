Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't have any expectations when I got into the theater for this movie. I expected to be entertained and maybe even entertained, but this movie was not only entertaining, it was really good, and I'm glad I finally watched it. The action scenes were very well done.   As always, this movie reminded me of the old "Rambo" movies, and it definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.  The way the story was told was perfect. This movie is also a great example of a "Hollywood" movie with a real plot.  When they said it was a thriller, it really was. I didn 't really feel the tension, and the plot didn't seem to have a logical starting point and then it all happened on its own.  All that being said, there is one movie out there that I don't mind watching over and over again, and that is "The Shawshank Redemption".

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was well written and the acting was good. The film was set in the early 1950's, and was written to promote a new movie, The Old Time Players, so it made sense for the people to dress like they were from the old time.  The music was good, and even though the film was a little silly and the characters were not very original, it was still good entertainment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie and enjoyed the chemistry between all the main characters. It was fun to see how all their various personalities come out in different ways. The film was just so well done and made the characters really come to life. It also gave us a glimpse of a younger version of Paul Newman. I also really liked the way that the characters in the film got older and less naive.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason you should watch this movie is:  A) There is NO BULL**** in this movie. I mean, I've seen a couple bad movies with a B-movie plot, but this one is just too funny!   This movie is based on a novel by James McBride (another great writer), and it was made in 1946.   I think they have done an excellent job of recreating a movie that we remember fondly as a kid!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had no idea about this movie or any of the others on the list, but I'm glad I found it. When I heard about it, I knew right away that I needed to see it. It has some of the most bizarre special effects ever created, and it's just plain hilarious! I don't remember the exact line, but it was something along the lines of "No, I'm sorry, I can't get the movie to work."   The acting is on point, and the humor is just insane.   For a movie about something so ridiculous, the production values are incredible!   It would have been a great film for the late, great Frank Oz, but that's a question for another time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story starts out strong with a scene that will stick with you for a while.   It is a great set up for what happens next.  A young, attractive woman gets kidnapped by a mysterious stranger with a strange weapon.  While trying to get away, she is attacked by a large, muscular, and almost feral man in a leather and black vest.  He is extremely strong and will make you fight the clock to escape from him.  This guy is more than just your average "bad guy."  This is an action movie that does not skimp on the action.  The scenes are very well lit and have a great sense of urgency.  Director/Writer Timur Bekmambetov (The Grudge) has done a great job of capturing that perfect atmosphere of an unknown location with nothing but the wildest imagination to pull off an action film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie a long time ago and haven't watched since, so I'll review it here as a good action movie.   The movie is set in the early seventies. The film features one of the most badass women of that era:  Barbara Bain. Barbara, who played the role of "Lily" in the original movie, had a long career with different films, but she never acted like the "damsel in distress" movie we see today. It was her talent that brought her the most roles.  The plot involves a group of criminals that are trying to rob a bank that's run by a wealthy, well known businessman.  When they enter the bank, the plan goes wrong and they're captured. The criminals, led by "The Butcher", decide to get back at the rich guy by making him suffer for his crimes.  One of the prisoners who was released at the end of the movie is a girl named "Molly". Â  Molly is one of several girls that are taken to the house of the butcher. She soon finds out that she has to kill the "butcher" or be raped. After she is raped, the "Butcher" takes her to the top of the mountain to kill him.  Before he can do that, he must face a girl that also was a prisoner in the previous scene.  This movie really packs a punch and has many great fight scenes.  I think that the best fights are the ones that feature the female characters.  It was probably shot a few years after the original but the action is still very realistic.  In one scene, the villain is thrown off a high building and his head is hanging in the air.  As if he wasn't already hard enough, when he lands, his head hits the ground and bounces into the trees, where it comes to a halt.  While the scene is great, the ending is a bit sad. I can't imagine the murderer is smiling after killing the man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of my favorite movies of all time!   This movie is one of those classic films that I'm not too sure has been made yet but is certainly worth watching. It's a mix of crime and mystery and is one amazing detective movie.   In the late 60's, a murder took place in the small town of Tiverton, Massachusetts. The town's detective, Bill Hickok, is given the case and goes out looking for the killer.  This is one very good looking movie that looks great.  The director and cinematographer did a great job with this film.  John Williams does an amazing job scoring it.  There is a scene in this movie where a cop has to break into a man's house and is forced to use a ladder to reach a second story window. It makes you think, "how could this happen in real life?"   The movie takes you on a journey to Tiverland and gives you a really good glimpse of the town.  For anyone who has never heard of Tiverson, I highly recommend checking this movie out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie. It is a great homage to the old horror movie serials. I do not remember the name of the serials, but I think it is called "The Wolf Man" or something. Anyway, I remember seeing it on TV as a kid and being very creeped out. But in this movie, it really came to life. The Wolf Man is scary, creepy, and has a great sense of humor. I remember when I saw it, there was a really long shot of the Wolf Man running up the hill, but there were no other humans running up there. It gave me a little goosebumps.   The Wolfman has a few variations on his costume, such as a black outfit or a white one with a red collar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film I saw at a film festival in the autumn of 2007. It is about the last days of the Soviet era and its relationship to the Cold War. It was made for a prize-winning film company by a Russian director. It does a nice job showing how the Soviet Union was torn apart in the early 1960's. The film shows a very real time period and the characters portrayed are very much believable. It also highlights a good aspect about the film-the sense of humor. There is a scene in the film where two characters stand in a supermarket while a Russian woman in an apron talks to them about the food. It's one of my favorite scenes in the movie and also has a great sense of comedy. It has great lines to go along with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Lord of the Rings " trilogy in the first half of the noughties was the pinnacle of an exciting, but ultimately unsatisfying franchise. " The "Lord of the Ring: Return of the King" is a return to the films that started it all. It continues where Peter Jackson left off with a very faithful version of the source material that, for all its limitations, is a truly great film. The plot is excellent. The performances are great. The visuals are brilliant. And, yes, I did feel that when Saruman is sent away to Mordor, you know what will happen next... The final battle, with the army of Mordor at the Gate of Utumno, is incredible. The camera is often on a breathtaking high, and there are moments that rival the final battle in "Return of the Jedi" with the awesome score of Jerry Goldsmith. " Lord of The Rings: Return Of The King" opens on a bleak, windy day. The army of the Dark Lord Sauron is nearing the fortress of the One Ring that Sauron once wore before his death at the hands of Aragorn. As a small army of human soldiers, mounted on horses, makes its way to the gates, a group of Uruk-hai come out of the gates and charge at them. The humans are taken prisoner and sent to Minas Ithil, but the Uruks hold them prisoner as well, and a large part of the movie concerns how Sauron's forces will deal with the Urdh, a race of hobbits and men from Eriador who have been enslaved by the Dwarves for years. It's an exciting film, and the acting is spectacular. The dwarves are excellent as always. The acting, as always, is perfect. I remember seeing the first film in a theater on opening night and not being moved at all by the performances of the dwarfs. This is a great film, though. The special effects are spectacular, especially during the battle, and I loved every minute of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a hard time deciding whether to see this movie or to watch any other one. It was too good not to see. The actors did a marvelous job. The whole movie seemed like a dream in slow motion. A true "time machine" to watch some of our more ancient history. It is true that we are going back in time and it is just a short film. I was not expecting this. This is my first time watching a movie in a time machine and I must say I enjoyed it. The characters are very realistic and you can feel the emotion from the actors.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie a couple times, in different theaters, and I'm pretty sure it's the same guy, even though I saw it in a different town in the mid 80's and he looked different. The director had to hire a few extra extras to play the cops so the police wouldn't bother him or his crew, but the extras looked the same, with a few variations in their costumes and the actors were all pretty good and I've never seen a worse movie.   The movie has no impact and is simply a re-enactment of the events that occurred on the night of November 11, 1986.  The cops had been called to the home of a neighbor in the early morning hours, because a man with a gun had opened fire.  Two officers arrived at the scene, but by the time they entered the house the gun had disappeared and the only evidence of a shooting was the man's bloody body.  Once the police got into the house and went upstairs, they found the neighbor still lying dead with a bullet wound in his head, but he was no longer a threat to the officers.  A couple of the neighbors came up from the basement and told the officers they had seen someone in the basement, and so the officers searched the basement while one of the cops got some breakfast.  While the officers were searching the basement one of them heard something in the attic.  At this point in the movie, one of one of these neighbors suddenly springs up from a hiding place in the ceiling, shoots the officers, and makes for the attic where he tries to shoot his former neighbors.  I must say that this film was a huge disappointment to me, and not one of those movies that will always stick with you long after you've seen it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this at a film festival, and I didn't think much of it, but after watching it again a couple of years later, I love this movie so much. The actors are just amazing, and the story really is a true one. A family has just moved in across the street from this neighborhood, and is now trying to cope with a child with mental illness. It's such a real story, and you can't help but relate to all the problems they face.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film a few years ago and never got around to it until now.  It was just about what I expected it to be: a fun romp through a world of fantastic, fantastic animals.   It does a nice job of having a unique and fresh world.  The creatures and their behavior reminded me a lot of a Disney film in style.  There was a lot going on but it was all fun and entertaining.  A definite recommendation for kids.  I highly recommend it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film that launched the careers of both Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone was a film I saw in the late 70s. I was a little less than 10 years old, but I'm certain I would have had the time to look back on the film years later.  The acting was great. Stallone is terrific as the cop who gets shot through the head at point blank range. Willis has to act as a hostage, then is played off as a cop. The film is about a police chase and the characters act as if they have been in the scene before.   I wish I had seen the original version, which has a nice ending.

The best part about it is that it makes you laugh out loud each time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is an action adventure film with a pretty good story. The plot is quite interesting, with the main character fighting a giant alien that is searching for a way to go to the surface. The alien is a very interesting looking alien, and the movie uses the alien in interesting ways. The monster effects are pretty good, and that part of the film is really well done. I was really pleased with the action sequences, the aliens were cool. The aliens in the movie really look like they are in the middle of a nuclear power plant. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really wanted to like this movie! I read the plot synopsis and it sounded interesting, but it's nothing like what I saw. It doesn't really go anywhere, but the acting is fine, and it's a decent enough story to boot.    My only problem was that it takes a little long for the movie to get going.  After a brief prologue, we are introduced to a boy named Tom who is being stalked and shot at by his brother. They are going to a nearby country park called Cremator's Hill (where he once went to camp with his brother) when Tom is shot. He awakens the next day and finds that his brother has already killed himself.  And then he meets the rest of the gang...it's a bunch of kids who have been there for a week and are all dealing with a lot of their own inner issues.  This movie is so much more than a straightforward horror film. The main theme is how a normal kid with normal problems can be drawn out into a life of madness and violence by people who love him. And that theme is played out wonderfully.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought I'd ever love a horror movie as much as I love the classic ones like Frankenstein, Dracula, Nosferatu, and The Wolfman.   My son saw it a few years back at a family birthday, and he was hooked.  My husband was too.  When we watched it at home I was surprised by how much I loved it.  I'm glad we had it when we did.  The original is a great film, and this remake, while a bit on the campy side, still works.  It is scary, and it is a bit of a love story.  We've seen it a couple of times, and each time we had to remind ourselves it is horror.  This is the best of the genre.

I mean...a whole movie has been ruined! The scenes that had to be shot again just didn't work as well. It was so obvious that the people involved didn't care what they were doing, but they had to make it look real and so the whole movie was a hoax, made up for the money. They even had the cameraman in the bathtub!

My brother and I came from a theater that had a showing of The Day The Earth Stood Still, and we both laughed more at that movie than this one.   This movie was so funny, it made me chuckle and giggle like crazy.  The scenes where the dogs are chasing the birds were so funny. The scene where the woman tries to make a pie is pretty funny.  I also enjoyed the scenes with the "cat-people". It made me laugh so hard, it was one of those special moments.  It is a strange movie, but one that you won't soon forget.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's hard to be disappointed with a movie that has been in the making for some time, and is quite enjoyable to watch.    What sets this apart is the director's ability to seamlessly combine several different scenes into a seamless story.  As the movie opens, we are in a small village near the border of China and Korea.  It seems to be a rather typical farming town, with farmers and their children working on their land.  The kids of the village are a bit of a problem; as they often act out of character, and it seems like they have not been properly trained, or maybe even know who they are.  Then we are told that there are two soldiers guarding the border between China and South Korea, and that they can sense that something is wrong.  Their superiors (who are also the soldiers) call for a meeting, and a small meeting is called for.  They tell the children that their behavior is unacceptable, and the leader says to the children, "The army is watching you".  A few of the children seem to be enjoying themselves, but we are meant to understand that they know what they are doing.  So, they make up a story that they need to protect this place and this place only.  And, of course, the commander tells the commander and the other soldiers to go to sleep; but the children know better; they tell the soldiers to keep sleeping.  Eventually the commander finds out, and calls for a special operation, and we are shown the results of that special operation in the next few minutes.  These soldiers are very young, and have only been in this area for a short time; they are on the border in the midst of a huge battle, and they are told to destroy the enemy.  We are told, later, that they have been able to take out a large number of tanks, and so the enemy is retreating, but the commander says the enemy has many tanks, they will soon find them.  In the ensuing battle, we see many tanks destroyed; but it is not over.  A large tank is seen on the side of the road, and as it approaches, the children are told by a sergeant to stand aside, and not to go near it; they must destroy the tank.  This is where the story really begins to take off.  Once the tank is on the road and the sergeant tells the soldiers not to approach, the tank moves back; but then a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when I was 15 years old. It was a Friday night and my mom took me to see a movie at a movie theater. I remember I had a good time, and it really was a fun movie. The movie was about a kid who lives in an old abandoned house, and the reason why he came home to it, he had lost his family in an accident. He is the only one left in the house. He has never had anyone in there, but he never let go. It seemed like a little character movie for the kids back then. I was in my high school drama class in the middle of the semester. We all talked about this movie and what was so special about it. I have seen it 3 times and I still like it. It is an old movie and the actors were great. I think it is a really good film to watch for adults.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only thing I can complain about is that the movie ends too quickly and then there's a very long montage of shots showing that the aliens are really good at killing the humans.   I thought that at least it would make more sense if this movie was in the original trilogy, then it would have made more sense to show the final battle and then the aliens would have had more time to finish it.  The movie has a lot of flaws but I'm really glad to see them in the new movie because I know that this is the ending to a trilogy.

I have been watching TV programs on the dark side for years now, but have never had the opportunity to see any of these shows.   This show was very well made and creepy. I would suggest watching it alone.  Very interesting and well put together.   Read 5 reviews.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a solid comedy that works on almost every level, with an intriguing story to tell. The director is able to bring in the best actors and actresses to play their roles, and is able bring out some of the silliness in them.   This is a very well made comedy with great characters and great performances.  I am very glad I saw this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I was so very impressed with the performances of the children in this movie. They all have great personality and it was so nice to see them in a movie where they can be children, not little adults!   It is definitely one of the best movies I have seen so far this year. I also enjoyed the fact that it has a very different vibe from the other movies I saw at the summer festival (even though they were all excellent!).   Â 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The opening scene was amazing. I was like a kid again on a big screen. The whole scene was incredible. I also loved the scene with the cop. He was so badass and acted very well. I never have been as entertained as I was that day.   I am also very glad the film was made. I always feel bad when a good film is never made into a TV show. It's something I wish more people did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a wonderful movie about a very simple and yet very powerful story. I had been told by a friend that it would be good for "dark nights." He wasn't far off.   This film is one of those that makes one really think about the "dark" part of the world.  And of course the film is a real eye opener on human nature and what can lead people to become so cruel.  This movie is a must see for all who want to know and understand the dark side of humanity. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a good comedy, this is a funny movie.   I love the actors, especially for this one.  I'm a big fan of Bill Murray and this film is funny, but you never feel sorry for him, he's just an awesome dude, and the other roles are great.  If I'm ever in the mood for a good laugh, I'm going to this one!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was introduced to this movie at a young age. It's really the most perfect horror movie. A small town is invaded by the evil forces of the dead. There's some pretty creepy scenes in the background of the film. The movie is just scary as hell.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, and I loved the way that the directors put their own twist on the story. It's got some good acting, and a nice visual style. The movie is just a little dated, but it still has a little charm. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It has a great sense of humor, it is quite clever and not at all silly or stupid. It is also very dark and at the same time quite realistic. There are some disturbing parts in it and yet the plot is very easy to follow and the character interactions are excellent. One of my favorites.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was fun and exciting, and the action scenes were great.   My only gripe is that the actors were a bit older for their roles.  Also, they could have made more of a movie out of the kids. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been looking forward to this movie since I heard about it years ago. It is definitely worth the time and money for any fan of science fiction and/or action.   If I had to give this movie one word of advice, it would be to watch it a few times before the whole film. If you don't like the script, just go to YouTube and see a movie that is similar in subject matter and is not being censored. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Just another typical story of a couple of bikers trying to get away from some shady-looking guys. This film was a bit long for the average Biker movie (which would be like playing a typical old Western). So if you like a bit more of a story than an action movie, then this might be for you.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is fantastic, well done. The plot, acting and action are all great.   The film is so original it could have been made by a director that hasn't seen a lot of the films that have been done recently. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The best part of The Shining is what you're not seeing," said Stanley Kubrick. "In the film, there are three people, but the camera's always on the camera. In this film, one of them is always in front, and the other two are behind. And the whole thing is shot with a double exposure. So, what's really happening is that the person is just one of the people. And what they see, what they don't see, is just another one of those people, who's doing the exact same thing that they're doing. And that's the most exciting thing about the film. You think, 'Oh, you know what? They're all watching each other, and each of them's doing exactly what they think they're supposed to be doing. No one's looking. It's very much a dream world.' You're seeing this dream world without realizing that this is really happening. That's the thrill of The Overlook. It doesn't give you any sense that there's anything else out there. The camera has been in every corner of that hotel, and you've just seen what it sees. It didn't make you feel that there was a huge world out there of other people, other people watching it. It really leaves you feeling alone in the darkness. There are no monsters. There's nothing lurking in the shadows. It does give you the sensation that the people are watching you. And they're watching the other people. So it's a pretty fascinating experience, I must say."   There are certain things you have to do to get a film made, such as getting a studio to back a production or a director to accept a budget of $7.5 million and make a film with his own money. Kubrick's Overlook Hotel is a story of what happens when you open up a hotel for the night. And, if you're a filmmaker, it is a classic story that can be used to great effect. Stanley Kubrick had a knack for putting together films that would not only be exciting on the surface but are really thought provoking as well.Â  So, while you're watching Overlook, you may be wondering if the movie is based on a true story. Well, it certainly wasn't. The first time I heard about Stanley Kubrick and The Shining was from my friend David, an avid Kubrick fan.Â  David asked me if I'd like to go see a Stanley
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story was quite funny. I liked it so much and I got to see a really weird guy. He was very well done.   Very Funny.  A very funny movie. I think it would have been funnier if they had left it alone a bit longer. I did not have a problem with it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I saw this in a Cineplex in Toronto a few weeks ago and the entire theatre was full. I got the popcorn and it was delicious.   This movie was a bit confusing at times but it's the kind of film you watch on an airplane or a long road trip with friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is well made. The actor playing the policeman is great and has a very good personality. This movie does a good job with the "tough cop" role.   The only issue that I had was that the film was very long, but that is because of all the action scenes. I really enjoyed this film and I would highly recommend it to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first "Jurassic Park" movie made me fall in love with movies again. I always loved seeing Spielberg's "Titanic" and "Jaws" movies, but I didn't really watch them until recently. When I saw "JURASSIC PARK", it made me want to see all of Spielberg's films. It's a very entertaining movie, and the writing is spot on.     The "Jury" of the movie is a very important element in the movie.  I love that the audience is divided between those who are afraid of the monster and those who want to live and let live.  In a very interesting scene, one of the characters is talking to his wife about how he and his brother had a dream that they were the only people on the island. It is this scene that really shows how people were afraid to live in such a dangerous environment.   The dinosaurs look absolutely perfect.  The special effects are superb. I wish they had been used on "JUPITER".  It's quite sad that the characters don't survive the movie, but we don't really know how it will end. Â There are two very interesting scenes, the one with the "Jaguar" and the one in the swamp.  It is just incredible that the "PAN" can get into the "MARS" so easily. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a movie that's like a cross between Gremlins and Aliens   there's something different and yet familiar about it.   The director, Peter Jackson, has always been a good director, even before this, his most impressive movie ever was "The Lord of the Rings".   It's got some cool effects in it, especially for a day and age when CGI was still new, but in a "classic" horror movie kind of way.  While the story isn't particularly scary or thrilling, it does have a very cool sense of humor, and it makes a nice change from the typical gory slasher movie.  It also has some great characters and there's some great gore.  This movie is a must see and a great action film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The most frightening movie I have ever seen.   You may have to get the old run down TV to watch this one, the quality of the picture is great and this movie is a horror masterpiece."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a classic that will stand the test of time. I think it is the best film made about the Vietnam War ever made.   I loved it, and it is my favorite Vietnam movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am so sorry this movie is so poor quality and the sound is so bad that I don't want to see the movie. I hope you can make a better movie.   The acting is very weak. The director seems to know his way around film, but doesn't know how to write a film. If this was a film that was directed by a good filmmaker, I would have enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My brother and I got this movie as an anniversary gift, and it did not disappoint. I think we were on a bit of a sugar rush to watch this movie. The film is very entertaining, and the cast did a great job of pulling it off. We were not in a happy place in our lives at the time, and we appreciated the film for what it was. We enjoyed it for what this is, not what we want it to be.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. It's funny and really well made. I liked all the characters so much. I don't think you can ever have enough laughs, and the whole story is funny. If you love "Buddy Holly" or "It's a Wonderful Life," you should like this movie too. If I was not interested in a movie about a car race, I would never have seen this movie, it's too entertaining.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director's cut of the film is a good addition to this film series. This is a great "action" film with a wonderful soundtrack and great performances.   For those who love the original, this is the sequel for you.  The story is similar to that of the first but a little more intense with a few twists.  As a movie fan, you won't be disappointed with this film.

It is very atmospheric and dark. The story is not like any other. It has many twists and turns and is not a normal story. This film makes you feel really intrigued and is a very good watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie a couple of times in a row, but this is one of the few times I've actually seen it. I don't know why I've never seen it before. I'm glad that I finally saw it.   This movie is so good that it's actually scary. Not scary in the way "Scream" is scary (that's too obvious), but in a more "I don't want to be here, but it looks like fun" kind of way.  I can see how it could be an annoying movie, but the fact that it actually works at making you fear for your life and a good portion of the film is about a "scary car chase" is really amazing.  So it's not scary on a technical level, but as I said, it works at doing something I'm not sure how anyone could make a movie do.  My only gripe with the film was that I felt that there were a couple times that the actors acted a little too high-strung for what was going on. They seemed so out of control, and the way they were walking made me nervous. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this film about a year ago and just recently watched it again. It is still one of my favorites. I really wish the whole movie had been left out because it could have made a great thriller, but it has a really great mystery to it. A great movie that I recommend!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I have been watching a lot of new films lately. The new film this week, A Single Man, is definitely a great movie. We watched it together and we both enjoyed it a lot.Â  The acting is great, the director had an excellent script, and the whole movie was great. We also have seen other films by Wes Anderson, and this one really stands out to me as a great film. I wish we could see more of his films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to give this movie a 9 out of 10 because the acting is just so good. You just don't see this type of acting in a "bad" movie. I mean, there are a few actors who you could not trust and they could not bring you to the edge of your seat, but these guys nailed it. They all gave it their all in every shot and there is no bad acting here. There is just such an authentic portrayal of people living their life, from the best and the worst, it all comes together very well. It's not perfect and there are not many laughs, but this movie is worth a look because of it's genuine acting and acting by all the cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I had no idea the movie was called The Man Who Killed Kennedy, but I was immediately drawn to it. The story is a little different, but still is very interesting. I had a feeling it might be too strange for me to understand, but I think that just made it better.   It is certainly a great movie.  I enjoyed this movie very much. It was very interesting and well done.  I loved the characters and the plot and I hope to see more movies like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this movie in the theater while visiting with a girlfriend from out of town, who had seen it in the past. We saw it again when I got back to the states, and I still enjoy this one. The original was a fun, racy, and very entertaining story about a couple who go on a road trip and end up at an isolated motel in the middle of nowhere to spend the night with the girl's dad (who is married), who doesn't know anything about them, and is an alcoholic. It was also an interesting change of pace from the classic "girl next door" movies of the 70s, which were also great, and the original was not as dark as some of the others. The music (both original and covers) is wonderful. The characters were interesting and the characters themselves were fun to watch. In fact, my girlfriend loved this movie. It has been on for over 20 years and is one of my favorites.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It has a very simple plot but the actors give so much emotion that the movie never loses sight of it.   The two actors in this movie are great.  One is the guy you see in most action films as a bad ass. The other is the young guy who plays his uncle in the movie and the young girl who plays a friend of the uncle.  When the movie is in a good mood they act really well together.  If you watch this movie make sure you don't mind watching the movie in 2 hours then you can watch the action sequences in the evening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-made and enjoyable romp about a beautiful girl from the past (now a sad lady).   The plot is simple:  He has no memory of the past, but is given a present for his father's anniversary. This presents itself as a love story, but it is actually more about memories and loss.   Not one thing is contrived or pretentious, yet the story manages to keep a delicate touch.  The acting is excellent and all the characters are interesting and believable.  If you are a lover of romance and romance films, this is one to consider. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was so happy I finally got to see the new Star Trek movie after so many years. It is much better than the previous film. It was nice to see Kirk and Spock again.    The actors all looked great.  I really enjoyed it.  The acting was great. The characters all had great chemistry.  This was a good sequel and it is getting better with every viewing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - This movie is a classic. I first watched it as a kid in the 50's with my Dad. My parents both have been to the World Cup. They knew all the greats. We had the World cup game on VHS. I still have it. My brother, son and I are all watching it now.   A great movie to watch on a rainy day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this movie is great and a very funny movie with an excellent acting job and a funny screenplay.   It is very well produced with excellent cinematography and good effects and action sequences.  There are a couple of minor problems like some of the special effects don't look so real in some scenes, but they are not that serious.  This movie is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is a classic. I loved the concept, the acting, the music, the costumes, the plot and the cinematography. It is truly timeless, yet it still holds up today.    It's a great story that has so much more to say than most films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is great and a must-see.   This movie was great in many ways and not just in the storyline.  It is a wonderful film and I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in the history of aviation.  There were lots of things to talk about in this movie.  One of my favorite things is that the story is told by the people in the airplane, not just the pilots.  I also found that the flying was very accurate.  Overall, the movie is very well written and told, and I enjoyed it very much.   The movie was produced in the 1950s, but has much more to it than I thought it did.  In the 1950's, flying was a lot more dangerous than it is today.  Some people even died in these airplanes, especially in the early years of aviation (the movie was made in the 1930s).  There was also a lot of excitement about what was happening in aviation, which included the introduction of the twin engine airplane, the "winged propeller airplane" (WOPA) and the jet airplane.  Many of these airplanes were the result of the development of new materials.  Another major point was the development and production of the "Supermarine" airplane. This airplane is an amazing piece of engineering, and was the first airplane with a full body design.  The movie was very informative, although not as entertaining as the movie "Skylab" from "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1968) because of the long production times.  Also, if you watch it with a sound set, there is a brief conversation between the pilot and a ground control that may be a little funny or interesting.  This is a pretty good movie, but it will take some time to get through all the information. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have had so many good and bad experiences with this movie and this is probably one of the better ones.   This is the one in which my boyfriend (who was really sick at the time) became obsessed with.  He would call me almost every day to tell me the whole plot, the movie and how much he liked it.  My favorite scenes were the first two where the dog and cat get involved with each other.  At the time we couldn't imagine our little dog with a cat and I just thought it was going to be crazy and scary and the only thing that was real was the dog.  The scenes were just amazing and it made me love my little dog even more.  This movie is about a family that is living in a small cottage and all of a sudden their dog becomes very ill and goes insane. They want to know why the dog became so crazy and they believe he is possessed.  If you want a good scary movie with some really good acting, and just a bit of comedy, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie, but I don't agree with a lot of it. I thought that it had some interesting aspects to it. If it wasn't for one particular scene it would be a good film. It is a movie I hope I watch again, it is very well made, and it is the sort of movie that is fun to watch and would have you asking "why did we wait so long to see this movie?" It has some very original things to say about race, about gender and about what it means to be gay. It's a fun movie that I recommend to people who want something more from their movies, not too much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie. Just look at all of the great performances. My favorite parts are when all the actors sing together. It brings tears to my eyes.   The best part of the movie is when everyone sings their own part.  The ending song is the best part too.  This was really fun movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot more than the one I saw years ago in the theaters. The acting is great in this movie. Even with a little girl who can't even speak, you can't help but feel like she's really there. I always loved that "Cary Grant" routine where he would just act his way through everything and get really excited about it.   Cary's character is the perfect example of what makes the movie great. This is a character who is both vulnerable and strong at the same time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love that a movie like this exists and is able to reach a wide audience.   While I don't care for the first movie, it was fun to watch this one.  This movie was great to me and it really shows a little of what it's like to live through the civil rights movement.  They really gave it their best shot and made it seem real.  It really shows what it is like to be on the ground and not have any power to defend yourself.  If you want to see what it was like, then watch the first one and just be a part of it.  The whole thing was so entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is about a group of people who are on the run from the law, but they don't know where they are or who they are. They get a car and find that they are being pursued by a guy with a red hat and a gun who wants them dead.  This is one of the greatest chase movies ever made. The actors were great, the cars looked great and the chase was incredible.   For a movie like this, there is not much in the way of action, which really fits this movie. However, if you like a good thriller, this is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you who do not want to bother with the details of this movie: it is a great movie, it was based on a book (but not a very good one) and it was done by the great Sam Peckinpah (who is not well known as an actor).   It is a bit long, but not too long, it gives you a good amount of information about the life of the man who was the inspiration for the character played by Laurence Olivier.   The acting is good, and the characters are all well drawn.  I believe that the movie makes a good point: that it is good to be able to look the way you want to look, without being too embarrassed.  All the characters in the movie were real people.  It would make a very interesting movie to watch, I would recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, it had some really interesting ideas, and great acting and characters. It's a bit slow at times but it's a very good movie. I had to wait a while for it to start, but at one point the audience in the theater was chanting "BELIEVE" which made me laugh.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â As much as I love these two movies, there's one that seems to get lost in the shuffle.   In this movie you will learn that "the American way" was really just a few different versions of an idea, which could have come from many different places.  The movie has a great soundtrack, great acting, and some truly great dialogue.  In the end this movie is just fun and great to watch.  You should see it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The most fun I have ever had watching a movie.   I love movies like this because they don't just have a premise to get a good laugh. It is the whole cast. It has to be a special movie to me.  It is an excellent story that takes a lot of twists and turns to get to the point of what is going on.  I hope this movie is still in production so I can see how it turns out.  This is a fun movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In short: A great adventure story and the music and editing are top notch! It's very hard to make a film that is funny, interesting and well written, and this film definitely does that, especially for the amount of time that's devoted to it.  The story follows a young man named Alex, a soldier in the French Foreign Legion, who gets into trouble by running away from his duties. Alex is recruited by a man named Gabriel, who promises him that he will get out of trouble. Unfortunately, Gabriel is corrupt and makes Alex commit crimes in order to pay off his debts, while his father has died of illness. In his attempt to get away, Alex ends up on an adventure with two very strange men who are looking for an old map that Gabriel has found. The film also takes on an interesting theme regarding the way that people act and how it affects their future.  This is a good film with some good acting and a good screenplay, and is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a classic Western, but not an over the top Western.   It is not cheesy or saccharine but rather interesting and with a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An odd film in a lot of ways. It's a pretty simple story but it's all told very simply and very well. The story is told with a very simple style. There's just one man named Steve and the story is that he's a car salesman but he's getting old and he's lonely and he needs something to do to pass the time. He decides that he has to get a job as a mailman. The mailman job is simple but it can be very fulfilling. The film is about the loneliness and the sadness that comes with it. The way the film is told is almost as if the whole thing is the protagonist's nightmare.   I really like it when a film makes you feel lonely.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of films make the mistake of trying to do too much and it just turns into an overstuffed mess.   With a few exceptions I think it gets away with it here.  To me it was all really interesting and the characters were very likeable.  It's also a nice departure from the usual zombie films which are so overdone it's hard to watch.  Overall I enjoyed it.

It's worth a watch as it has something to say about life and the human condition.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie several times, probably more. It is a funny, if you don't laugh at the ridiculousness. This movie is about a couple, their son is autistic, and the dad is in love with a girl, they love each other. It's a pretty nice movie, but I guess the movie got cut because of budget or time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is something very beautiful about this movie. It is very sad, but very emotional, and it makes you care for a little girl who has just lost her father. It makes you feel like she was a child herself at that moment. Her mother, who didn't even know that her daughter had lost her, is very brave. The little girl is in total shock, and she can't speak. As the film progresses, you will understand more and more what she went through. This is a very good movie for the whole family.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is awesome, and has all the potential to be a really great movie.   There are a lot of good actors who are all doing well.  I had no idea who the characters were.  They all had really great performances, and were all interesting, and had their own individual personalities.  The plot is great.  It takes a bit of getting used to, but it is worth it.  "The Biggest Loser" has great acting and great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this for the first time in its original English title when it was released in France in 1970. The movie is an excellent and interesting one, and I was very much surprised when I started to see it again for the 70th anniversary (the movie had been released in other countries before and its reputation wasn't very well known). It's a very good, but very dark and suspenseful movie about a former Nazi officer who is sent to fight against the Communists in the streets of Paris, and it's great fun.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at the theater and it was a real disappointment. There was way too much violence, blood, and sex. I didn't care for the sex, but it was really hot. The action was so fake, it wasn't even scary, but just very graphic. The actors who played the bad guys were great. I think they were probably supposed to be bad guys.   Â A great movie for a good cause:  There are so many great causes that benefit from movies like this, and this one does an excellent job of spreading the word.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is a very interesting one about three college buddies who travel to a remote island to film a porno movie. They don't expect anything, especially not the porno. They stumble across a big and nasty shark who bites one of the guys. The other two guys try to find a boat to take them back home and to the mainland, and they are pursued by the shark. One by one the guys are eaten by the big shark and a lot of action takes place on the beach. The sharks are really impressive. Very real, very scary. Great movie, lots of action.   Recommended if you like action, and like the shark attacks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you're a horror movie fan then you've probably seen this movie. I loved it when it was first released and it really has aged quite well. I always love a good scary movie and when I saw this movie I was completely terrified from start to finish. The best part of this movie was that it gave me a great scare without being cheap.   The movie really gets going from the first scene with the boy running home from school. I was so scared when I first saw this trailer because I didn't know what to expect. The trailer definitely put me in a better state of mind than when the movie actually began.  It's a very well made movie that features some of the most amazing acting I've seen. When the camera pans over the boy, you can see his terrified face. I thought that the camera was moving so fast and you couldn't tell what he was doing, but to be honest it was easy to identify his movements.  The acting is good and it's all on such a small budget. It definitely made for a good horror film, so it's a shame that it was so short. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think the best thing about this movie is that it's not a rehashing of the same old horror movies (which have been done many times) and it's just not scary at all. Even though the acting is poor, this movie doesn't have a bad performance and I think that it will scare your kids too!    For a horror movie it's a good one but I would think that if this movie was about vampires this would be the best of all times.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was good! The movie was good but it was made very fast and had no depth.   And it was very bad with the scenes where there are so many bad people!   The scenes were very fake and uninteresting.  The actors acting was very stupid and very uninteresting too.  It is like they just took the best parts of the "saga" and made it very bad and bad acting and not well written!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was able to attend the movie of a friend who had just returned to the city after a year in Florida. The theater was very small and had a lot of empty seats. I was surprised to find out the movie was The Hunger Games. I had never heard of it until seeing it on the big screen. While the movie played it was very quiet. The people were very nice and didn't seem to be nervous at all. It seemed very realistic to me, as it looked and sounded like a very well made movie. I thought it was great!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was actually pretty good.  It was a bit over long for me.  The actors were all really good and believable.  I enjoyed the fact that this movie showed the characters as real people and not just fictional characters.  They all had good chemistry and the plot flowed quite well.  If this is your first movie, don't worry it will be worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good.  The story is interesting, and the acting is solid. The story goes a little far off into weird areas, but it's a fun movie.  It's got a lot of action and is well made.   There are some pretty dark twists and turns along the way, and it's pretty creepy to see a character who has been in the army for most of their life in a mental hospital.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was very well acted. The film is not very long and when it ended, it ended on a great note.   One thing that disappointed me, is how the movie ended on the wrong note. I'm not talking about the last 5 minutes, but the last 30 minutes of the movie.  For me, there were a few things that could have been more effective and less over the top.  The ending seemed a bit rushed. I would have liked to see a more natural and less cheesy twist of fate.  But in the end, it was an excellent film.  If you're looking for a good thriller, and the characters don't pull your heartstrings and make you want to see what happens next, check out this film. It will keep you interested all the way to the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.   I think the film and the music have a lot in common, which is exactly what I love about them.  My favorite actor in the movie is Tom Hanks.  He is so sweet and so funny and so confident.  I would love to see him as James Bond, just like he does in'Forrest Gump '. I also love the music in this movie: The beautiful piano piece, 'You're Beautiful' is brilliant.  It was so beautiful, and it was so sad, and I felt really sad that this beautiful man had died.  As far as a film with a great cast, and a good story, is concerned, this is a wonderful film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film has a fantastic cast and an interesting story. I was very interested to see if the director would be able to get the right balance of horror and romance. Unfortunately, the romance is not a strong part of this movie.   After viewing it, I had to stop watching it. The acting was way too over-the-top, and it just didn't work.  It is still good to see someone try and bring some romance into the horror genre, and if it wasn't too far off, it could have been good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that I watched during a time in my life when I had to reevaluate my entire life philosophy. I saw this movie as a wake up call, that if I was going to become a drug dealer, I had better start off with a bang. I didn't care if it was a black comedy, or a crime thriller, or whatever, I was in it for the cash. My wife and I went to a screening of the movie, I don't remember what it was called, but I remember this woman who worked for a drug cartel come up to me, and told me that I should be in prison. I thought it was quite an insult to my family, who never did anything wrong, and who never even had a disagreement with me in my whole life, and to tell me that they would be sorry to have me back in prison because of something that happened when I was a kid. I never did drugs, never did any crime, and I was doing it for a living, that's all that I ever did. This woman took something from me, something that I had worked for all my life and tried to destroy my family over. Now this woman was just some dumb bitch, but she was right, I am in a bad place, and my family is in a worse one. I wish that I could say that I didn not go through with it, but it was too late.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Good:  The acting is pretty good, the characters are likable and the story is very entertaining.   A good movie, I wouldn't watch it again but if you enjoy an action movie and don't mind watching a few extras, watch this movie.  The music is good and the way the action is portrayed is cool.   The Bad:  Some parts of the film can be a little repetitive and boring. The movie takes a long time to get to where it wants to go and some parts are a bit too long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on TV one Sunday morning and went right to the theater. I went with my wife and she was very impressed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing that really got my attention, was the fact that there were no subtitles for the whole movie, and no sign of a "making of".   And yes, the title makes it sound very much like it was supposed to be a French film, but it's not - no one has the clue as to what the hell is going on.   It was very interesting to see how the filmmakers went about capturing the atmosphere of the "caves" in France during World War II - especially with all the shots of the French soldiers, and the German artillery that's firing.  The plot is a bit like a film version of the novel, but a little more over the top than most would like.  It is worth seeing - but you don't need to be an expert in WW2 to enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say that this is a very well acted movie. It has been in my mind for a long time now. The movie is about a girl who goes to Vietnam to look for her missing brother. A Vietnam guy is following her around and following her back. When she is in a hospital, the guy falls asleep and she wakes up in bed with him and has sex with him. The only thing that I did not like was when the guy went to the police station and said that he did not do it. He said that it was all a dream, but it was really like he was there with her. I like it because of how he was really serious about it. I also like how this movie made me think of real war. The ending where the guy was arrested and the girl was left in the hospital was really great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film at the Cinema Arts Center in Seattle, WA. My only complaints are that the editing was a bit on the sloppy side. I am not sure what exactly I was supposed to take from this film.   A few days ago I took a walk out in the city and saw a guy carrying a giant plastic bucket up the side of the building. When I got closer, I realized the bucket had a picture of a lady's foot inside. I wondered if it was a sign saying that the guy thought this woman had an infection and was in the hospital for the rest of her life. He probably thought the lady was a prostitute, and he was going to get paid to kill her. He was probably crazy, but that's not the kind of thing you see every day. I really wish they'd let the movie play in the theater, and not just on video, because it's a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those who like the "ticking clock" vibe of "I, Robot", this is a great little action thriller. It's easy to forget when it's all about the robot (Eugene Levy) and his pursuit of the assassin (Richard Widmark). They work together in an underground "robot-world", and the plot is about trying to stop an assassination that's going to get the robots killed. It starts out light and funny, then gets heavy and depressing and the ending is very dramatic.   The effects are great. The fight scenes are fantastic, but the action of the robot trying to kill Widmark, and the robot falling and being crushed into the "robo-hole" is just amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie about a couple of years ago in a movie theater on the way to a movie night with my fiance, and it made me feel like the most bad ass. It was the only movie I saw at a theater I have seen at where the popcorn was real.    The movie took place during the Korean war and was based on a novel about a Korean man who fought against the Japanese during WWII.  I feel this movie needs to be made into a movie of the year.  The whole movie was shot like a WWII movie with a great atmosphere, and the whole thing was very well done.  From the beginning of the film until the end when it was over I really had a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was pleasantly surprised at the way the film was presented. It was not a flashy presentation but was well put together. I have always thought that the black and white images in early silent films were beautiful, and they were. In the same way, the presentation of the film in its early silent era is beautiful. The use of the black, and the use of its colors, is also quite remarkable. The only thing that really bugs me is the fact that there are no subtitles. I believe that the silent film era could have done without them, and I wish that there had been more films available in the early silent film period. The film is very entertaining, and shows some of the techniques and stories that were used in silent film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've watched this before but I love the film. It is one of those great horror films where it shows the true horrors of the American military. I especially like the scenes at the POW camp, where you feel like you are on a movie set.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so surprised I had not heard of this movie. It was so different from everything else that came out at the time. It had great acting and story lines, but what really made it great was that it was written by two brothers, Paul and Joseph Pinter, and directed by a third, Joseph Losey. This is the only movie I can remember where I was more excited by the plot than the actors. You know, you want to know what will happen before the end, and the answer was a lot of unexpected things. A great cast and a great script made this a really cool movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just got my copy of "Passion of the Christ". I'm a very serious movie buff and, as a result, I can be quite judgmental about films that I see. And in this case, I have to say that I really liked it. I'll admit, there are parts where the acting is mediocre but that is a small price to pay for having the movie as an entertaining and well made movie. I loved the music, it was beautiful. And of course I have the most favorite scenes of the movie. One scene is the "piercing eyes" scene which was a very moving scene to watch and I especially loved the way the director used the camera to show us the depth of the eyes. It was very effective and the movie has a great plot which, like the movie, had some funny moments along the way. The only thing that could have been better was the dialogue. I really didn't like hearing the dialogue, it sounds like it came from a 1950s radio show. It might have been a bit overdone and overdramatic but I found it interesting, especially the way it is written in the movie (I'm not sure about the movie itself but I know it is an excellent movie and it deserves more than two stars).   A young girl, who is very poor, and lives in the ghetto with her two children, falls in love with a man who is working in a factory in the city.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. I never saw it before but now that I have, I loved it. This movie has everything. Great acting, interesting plot, great music. The acting and writing made this movie, to me, better than the other movies in the "Hollywood" series.   The best acting was by Meryl Streep. She is always great in any movie she is in. She showed so much emotion in this movie and the story of her character.  The music is great too.  I never heard this song before but I love it. I think it is the best music of the time.  For anyone who is looking for something to watch on a rainy day or day you want to relax, go to this movie before you go to bed.  This is a good time, to watch this movie at night when you have time to do nothing.  Also, the only problem I found in this film, is that the first half is a little cheesy, but then it goes into the other side of it.  It is a fun movie to watch when you want something different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very enjoyable movie that you should definitely watch before seeing    The best movie of 2010! It was fun, interesting, and full of action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I didn't think I could enjoy a movie like this. I guess I was mistaken.  The premise is really good.  It was very well written.  There was a lot of suspense.   The acting was very good. I would have liked to have seen more of the characters.  I enjoyed the way the movie took me back to when I was just a kid.  Some people can't handle how a kid should act. I have two children so I understand that.  A lot of the movie was about growing up.  Not to sound too much of a baby, but the kid on the side of the road who gives you his change and rides off...that was hilarious.  This movie was fun. I don't know what the director was trying to accomplish here, but it was pretty successful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is quite excellent. It's about a "black man" in the South who gets involved in a murder, and discovers that he might not be the first one.   It is an incredibly gripping story, told with a mixture of mystery and romance.  The performances are top notch. John Travolta is a very talented actor, but he does not overplay his role.  I highly recommend it, and for its time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was so good I had to write a review.   I watched this movie in college and it was like watching a horror movie. I was not expecting it to be as good as it was.  The movie was about a college kid who has his best friend killed in a freak accident and becomes a killer.  One thing the movie did not have was a happy ending but this was not a movie about a happy end.  It was a dark film about a killer that has done wrong things in his life and who kills in the best way he knows how.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very different take on the classic noir. It's not a perfect movie, but it is well made, with terrific performances and a great story. The story, the action, and the costumes are great. It has that real noir feeling, like you're on the street with a bunch of characters who've been in more movies than you can count.    This movie is the kind that takes the concept and subverts it, creating a movie you'll remember.  It's got a killer soundtrack and a dark and gritty look, but never loses it's sense of humor or it's original take on a classic noire character.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was pretty bad. The acting is all cheesy and the special effects are all fake. It was all over the place.

This is a must watch and a good film that any horror fan should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad this movie will be out of circulation. In my opinion, it is one of the best films ever made about a cult. It was well produced, well shot, well acted and has been widely praised as a great film.   A great movie for everyone to watch.  I saw it when I was a teenager and I never thought that it would be a cult classic.  In my eyes, it should be on the level of other films made by the same director, John Waters. The actors were great.  The music is great. But I have to admit that the ending of this movie is not what I would have liked.  For some reason, the cult went up in arms about it and said it is "blasphemous".  A cult film is different. It is created by a group of people that are concerned with the good of the whole.  So the cult does not agree with the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy. I grew up on them.  I love this movie because it was so different.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first real taste of Japanese cinema (I'm really bad at foreign films, as you can tell by the fact that I still haven't seen Spirited Away... yet) and it was like seeing a whole different film than the one I was used to. It took me a few minutes to get my head around how it would be translated into English, but I was instantly hooked. I'd go as far to say that this is probably the best anime movie that I've seen in a very long time. There's a depth to it that was completely unheard of in the genre of anime before and to be completely honest, if it wasn't for this film, I would not have become interested in anime in the first place. I've been a huge fan of Ghibli's since I saw Princess Mononoke and it is a real shame that I won't be able to see them for years to come. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the film that inspired the whole "Punch-Drunk Love" thing and everyone loves it, even the most ignorant and/or politically-correct hipsters. I had a copy in my library for years, then went to see it for the first time and I felt like I was in high school again with that stupid, obnoxious punk rock band. A true American movie. The best part of the film is that it is also one of the only films of the '70s that was actually made in America (although I doubt it was shot in LA).   Recommended to anyone who appreciates a good, gritty Hollywood satire or to those who think "Pulp Fiction" was better.   The film has the look of a 1960s screwball comedy and this version has a much darker, darker edge to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason this movie has only a 1 out of 10 is because it isn't funny, but it is good. I didn't know I wanted to laugh out loud like this movie made me laugh out.   I watched this movie on a rainy day with my friends and it made my day. I just love this movie and it has that old school feeling. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a kid my parents got me a copy of the original Harry Potter film. It was the first one I ever saw. I remember the first scene and how it went from "Oh, this is going to be great" to "OMG THIS IS GOING TO BE MESSED UP". That is just the kind of film this is. It is not for the faint of heart or the easily angered. It does not do much in the way of story. It doesn't even do much of the basic characters justice. There are some scenes that make me wish the movie was better, but overall it is a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved it!   One of the better action flicks of all time.   The action scene that takes place is one of the best I have ever seen.  I love the fact that there are different cars in the action scene, it looks cool.  The only problem I had was that the soundtrack was too loud. I think this movie would have been better if it had a more subdued score.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the movies of this director, I saw all of his films when I was a kid. The plot is simple. When your best friend is killed, you search for him. He ends up in a creepy house, where you are attacked by various creatures. He makes it out alive and you see how he's been framed. You start to question who and how you are. I've never liked the monster movies before this one. He takes them seriously and there are a lot of gory scenes. The gore is real and intense.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching a movie called The Manchurian Candidate when I saw this movie. I hadn't seen it before. I'm sure it's a brilliant movie. This movie gave me a glimpse into the mind of a very disturbed man. It's great! I have never seen such a movie. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous. The special effects are also wonderful. There are no scenes in this film that are too violent. This is a must watch!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always enjoyed the classic movies with the stars of the time. Even with some very poor acting. But there's something so charming about this movie from the very beginning. I love the ending too.   "Tarantino is more than a director - he is the master of his own art." (Peter Bogdanovich)   What an actor John Carradine is, and why did he have to be in so many bad movies.  "A masterful and brilliant director" (Robert Mitchum)  I think that Robert Mitchum has to be on this list too. He has done more movies that made me laugh than anything else, but I'm only talking about the classics.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie very much, and for the time it was released it was an outstanding movie.   The only thing I can think of that would have made it better would have been to include some action scenes that were longer.  To give it an 11 would be generous.

The story is so original and amazing that you will be caught up with the movie from the first moment you open it. It isn't too long but it keeps you hooked from the minute you open the movie. The acting was top-notch.   The acting in this movie was amazing, and there were so many different characters to get hooked into.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a true gem and really shows what it's like when you put on an honest to goodness, hard-hitting, hardass, no bullshit film, you can't help but laugh your ass off when you watch it. If you like hard-knocks stories like Dirty Harry, you are going to love this movie.  Â I don't really like to give out too much of a review to movies that I have never seen before but this movie was well worth the watch for me and I would totally recommend it to anyone.  It's definitely a movie that you have to watch and I hope to see more of this guy in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that this movie is pretty underrated. It's just too bad that the movie was made before the 90's.  There are several things that I like in this movie. First of all, it's not a western. Second, there is a great scene when Mr. Jackson (Gerald McRaney) talks with a Native American man (Bert Weeden) about how he is going to settle his problems with the Indians.  The second great scene is the battle scene.  I'm amazed how many of the battles were real.  It really looks as though they were taken from history.  For example, the British Army is really a "mixed" company of Irish, Welsh, and Scottish men.  In one battle they have Scottish, Irish, and English soldiers.  Then the British go into the "Indian" camp, and they are just a bunch of Indians, but it's actually the Irish.  They all act like Indians, which makes them feel less bad about killing people.  A lot of people like the movie because it shows that war is not just a scary thing.  Overall, this movie should be on everyone's must watch list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was very well done and the director did a very good job of keeping a calm, non-distressing approach to a very dark subject.  It has a really chilling atmosphere with many things happening in the background.   I had a very difficult time sleeping the night after watching this movie, and was worried about my family as we were staying up late at night.  You really need to watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in the theater for a private screening. It was a fantastic film. It had a real emotional impact on me. I can't remember much of what was said or done. All that I remember was hearing all the characters names and saying them out loud. The movie was very well acted and really set the scene. It is a very emotional film. There is not much plot to speak of, but it was very good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a time where the word "diversity" has lost all meaning and becomes an excuse for the film industry to keep producing a homogenous film, this film tells a tale about a black man from Baltimore, in the early 1960s, who becomes a part of the civil rights movement. The film is a fantastic mix of action, politics, family, and love. This film is one that I would watch again and again to get a feeling of what those times were like in the 1960s. This was a must see. - December 7, 2006A good movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing I noticed about this movie was how damn good the dialogue was. It was like a live action, very well written, and very enjoyable movie.  The story is very interesting and has some dark undertones, but it is never over the top.  It is one of those films that I would rather watch a few times than the same one over and over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       This movie is good and is worth a watch even if you've seen it many times.   It's the first of a series of movies with the same theme of a man who gets a call to go back in time and stop a bad guy. The movie doesn't have much of a plot. It's just the story of a time traveller who goes back in history to stop a war between the USA and USSR and he has to make a lot of choices which really make him think about what is right.  I really enjoyed this movie and the way the plot developed.  The acting is good as well as the directing.  You will learn a lot about the time travel and what makes a good time traveller.  This was a movie that you can watch as an adult and still enjoy it.  It will make you think about different decisions and you will learn to appreciate a good story.  A great movie that will definitely help you learn more about time travel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie numerous times and each time I am always surprised by how good it is. It is fun and silly, but also so well made, you can really feel it.   As for the plot, I don't think it is important; it's just a bunch of silly, fun things that happen to a group of kids in the 60's. Â I mean, who needs plot?   It is funny and well acted, so I think you can just enjoy the characters, the music, and the plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a great film! It was the beginning of the horror film boom of the 70s. The film is scary, but not in the "the end of the world" kind of way. It's a really good film.   There's no "f" word in it.  You really don't want to be one of the victims of a serial killer who's planning on going to sleep in a motel.  I love this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know about you, but I love a good thriller. This one has a twisty, dark feel about it, but you'll be in for a good time, and the ending is just as cool as the beginning. If you like thrillers, this is a good one.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was actually very surprised by this movie, it was actually a very well acted and very well produced movie that had a very solid message. It's not your usual gangster movie, there was more of a political element to it and it showed what it was like to be under the thumb of a corrupt cop and that we can do much more than just shoot each other with semi automatic weapons and smoke pot and drink beer at a party. I really liked the way they portrayed the cops as people as opposed to bad cops or bad people and that really added a new dimension to it.   It also showed that there is a real war going on in this country and we have to take care of each other and our communities and that in turn will help bring about peace in the world. This was a really good movie and if it wasn't for the fact that I saw it in the early 80's when this movie was coming out and the fact I saw all the great gangster movies it is very easy to overlook. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really love this movie. This is not your typical Hollywood thriller.   The movie is a story about a woman's life in her 40's where she is trying to build a career and has no direction.  She moves into an apartment complex in the middle of nowhere.  For reasons unknown to her, one of the tenants turns into a werewolf and attacks her.  It takes the best part of two hours to get to that point.  In that time, she has a run in with a man, who is not quite human, but is quite powerful.  The werewolf is so well written that you do not quite believe the person you are seeing.  There is so much mystery, but this is a movie, not a soap opera.  I found the final confrontation to be suspenseful.  Unfortunately, this is not a movie for kids.  This movie is very dark and it doesn't have any laughter. Â  However, it is a great movie with great acting.  My husband and I were in love with this movie from the first second. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a huge fan of the first, but I was really looking forward to this. I actually cried during the first part.   "Luna is a child, but she has her own life - her own thoughts, her own memories. Her father is dead. She wants to know why and how her mother was murdered. She can not afford a lawyer. She does not dare reveal her secret to anyone. The police do not believe her, but Luna is determined. She starts to see a psychiatrist who treats people with schizophrenia. Her mother tells her that they are in love. But Luna can see how wrong it is. Why would her mother want her to be alone? But when the psychiatrist tells her he believes Luna is seeing things, and is delusional, she has to decide whether she can trust this doctor. And she must decide if she wants to tell her mother." - I cried. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It's got a nice style, and the actors do a good job with the roles.   This film is set in England and is mostly set in London. The story takes place during the war when an American pilot named Jack Scott (Michael Keaton) is flying a plane with the RAF. He is on a bombing mission, but when he and his co-pilot (Julian Sands) crash land in Scotland, they are attacked and taken prisoner. In their captivity, Scott and Sands get into a little trouble and their captors become convinced that they are Nazis and they must be exchanged for German soldiers that have been taken prisoner in France. The film is a real action film. There's a lot of fighting and they keep it interesting.  At the end of the film, the Germans offer to exchange them, but they won't take prisoners. They will only take Americans. The Americans don't want to take prisoners, but as they are the ones that they've been after all along, they take the offer.  I'd definitely recommend this movie to any fan of action movies.  A classic Hollywood film.  A must see!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had seen this film in the theater and liked it.  The actor that played the villain was very different from the one in the book.  This movie was made in 1970 but I think it looks great.   It has a great score and great scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film itself is an interesting take on the film noir genre. I felt like the film was somewhat over acted at times and there were a few scenes that seemed a little out of place.    Overall the film is a decent watch.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â The only thing I could say about this movie that has nothing to do with the action was that it's a good film!    I really liked the direction by Jodorowsky and I had a great time watching it, the acting was good and the costumes were beautiful.   It has no idea what to do in the beginning of the movie, but by the time it reaches the ending it is a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie that started it all. You know when a good filmmaker takes an old horror film (like The Hills Have Eyes or The Shining) and gives it a new look and it just works so well? This was that film.   For those of you that haven't seen it yet, it's just a little horror movie about a girl named Lila who lives in the woods with her mother. Lila is being stalked by a little girl (who is also the monster, but she never lets it show. It's always hiding behind the camera or something. I think it's a really good idea to have it lurking around the kids' bedrooms or something) and when she finally gets a good look at her, it scares her so much that she begins to get sick and begins to go into a catatonic state. She then runs away from home, only to be chased down by the little girl who is trying to get Lila. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so awesome. I don't think there is a better movie from this decade! There is tons of action in this movie and it really puts your mind to the test as you are in a car crash, getting shot, being dragged, jumping from a car, and getting shot at. The music is amazing and so is the special effects. It's just a blast to watch. I highly recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For anyone who has never seen this movie, I highly recommend it. It's well made and it's got great acting and a story that can only be told well. I always loved the books by George R. R. Martin.   This film takes place on a large, uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean with very little civilization on it. The movie is about a group of survivors who are trying to survive. They are not given much food and they are on a long journey.  If you ever had a desire to travel the world and see the things that are out there, this is the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is about an old man who lost his job and who takes a job with the company that employs him, but that doesn't last long because he starts having strange dreams. As they go on, he starts to become obsessed with the people he sleeps with. Then he becomes a victim of his own fantasies, when he ends up getting drunk with the woman he slept with.   The movie is really entertaining and enjoyable, and it is also funny and really funny. It's a movie that's worth watching over and over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to see this movie as part of a group of people who wanted to watch some horror movies. I can't say it was my favorite film but I did like it.    It was a very original film.  The concept was brilliant.  It seemed like the cast had done their homework on the original.  I don't know how many actors are known for playing vampires in the horror genre but they really worked on the vampire aspects.  What was even better was that it was an excellent makeup job.  You really felt as though you were there.  After the end credits rolled the audience went into the theater and that was it. No follow-up.  This was just a very fun film. I recommend seeing it in the theater. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was really good! There was something that I never really thought of until I watched it... the movie is not long enough to be long-winded. The actors were wonderful. And, to be honest, the movie wasn't really for me... but to someone who loved Hitchcock in the 40's, it was pretty fantastic.   A very well acted movie that just keeps on giving.  In a way, this movie is the only movie that i saw that was truly "mystery." That is why it will always be my favorite. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A truly good film. A man who goes from being a good man to a very bad man in the space of a few months has just started a new job. He decides that the best way to improve his self-image is to take his friends on a tour of old American towns, but a change in the weather, and his friends suddenly don't want to go.   He decides to have some fun and ends up in the small town of Poughkeepsie.  He meets a girl (who happens to be a police officer) who seems very nice and wants to go out for a beer.  Unfortunately, she becomes suspicious when her husband is missing.  This all leads to a big situation with the FBI and his girlfriend's sister.  Very interesting, well acted and quite funny.  The only problem I have with it is that it wasn't really written for a wide audience. It was written for the masses, who will enjoy it just the same.  If you want something with heart in it then this is definitely the film for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good action movie.Â  The first half is very good, the second half is not as good, but not bad.   In this movie you see two different types of combat-sounds-guns-fighters-fights.  In the first half you have a lot of combat, in the second we see very little of it, but we are still getting to know the characters and their personalities.    A real "action" movie.  "You can tell that the writers really like to make a good action film," said my friend.  This movie looks and feels like a legitimate Hollywood movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been wanting to see a "Watership Down" film for a while. It's a really great adaptation and it shows. The movie was done with such care and attention to detail, it really looks like a very long movie. The film shows what a huge difference an army could make. The effects are great, the characters are great and the scenes where the kids were running through the trenches were really awesome. The music was fantastic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is not enough information about the story on the DVD, but the DVD version is a good film. It is an unusual film in that it is based on the story of a man who, in his early 20s, gets a letter from his father. The letter tells him that a man named George Gershwin had died, and that George was his father's firstborn child. He was raised as a son and as a grandson of the deceased Gershi-wan. When George's mother, Alice (played by an excellent Joan Fontaine), dies and Alice gives birth to a son named Harry (Sammy Davis, Jr.), she and George want him to call himself Harry Gersho-wan (Gersho as in George Gerson). His father died young, of a broken heart. Harry, then a baby, has no one to talk to, and Alice is alone with him in a small apartment. Her life is very poor. She is a nurse who is paid a little and spends much of her time washing dishes. When she is alone, she sings the "Hallelujah Chorus." The story is interesting because it focuses on a young child who feels as if she is trapped in her own life.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first saw this film at a theatre, and was really surprised with the quality of this film.   It is so dark that it's scary at times, but it also has a great balance of suspense, horror, and suspense-thriller elements, which keep you interested and keep your attention.  It's definitely not a mindless movie, but has a good mystery.  As for the actors... it's a solid cast, and the actors portray their characters perfectly.  I also like that they did a few new characters in the sequel, which gives us even more suspense and suspenseful characters to watch out for.  There are a few plot points in this film that are pretty neat, and I am looking forward to seeing them brought up.  Thanks to the directors for keeping me interested for this film, and keeping it interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this movie very interesting. I was skeptical at first because the director had been accused of being a big-time producer, but he was not. His wife and producer were the ones in charge. The movie was a bit overrated and I didn't like it as much as some of the reviews. The plot was okay. The acting was fine, but the acting wasn't like the other films of the year and that was very important for a movie like this.   The movie has the typical "movie" structure of a big city street-crime film with a few scenes.  I think it's a very realistic movie and it is worth watching because it shows that there is good and bad in any city.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was great, but the movie was also pretty dull. The movie isn't really a good science fiction movie, but it definitely gets a lot right about the culture of a future society. It is still a fun movie with great action and the aliens are fun to watch as well. The special effects were pretty cool, but at times the CGI was just not there and it kind of lost its edge. The writing was pretty good too.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a fan of horror movies, this was an interesting film. It really reminded me of some of the films by the original director, George Romero. A couple of the zombies looked a little cheap and it really felt like the actor in them was having a lot of fun. The special effects are not as good as they are in some other Romero movies, but I found the zombies in this film to be scary. The ending was also pretty cool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Waking Life" is a hauntingly beautiful and affecting film.   Director James Marsh is a master of atmosphere.  The story is told in a voice over from a man who is having a dream.  In the dream, the man sees a young boy and a giant spider.  This story is so powerful that it leaves a haunting memory and a sense of loneliness.  It is so beautiful that it takes you into another world.  For all the beauty of the film it is also a very serious film about an old man who has just lost his wife and family.  A very sad film.

The music, the plot, the acting and the acting by J.C. is just amazing, if it wasn't for the movie not being long enough and not being as strong as some of the others it may have been a masterpiece.

This film is the sort that a few of us would like to see on a regular basis.  It's a fun and entertaining film that I'm glad I found the time for on my recent vacation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why you haven't seen this movie yet. It's a beautiful little movie, and has a perfect pace. This movie is about a group of kids, the "troubled," who take on an adventure for their father. This is one of those movies you watch as a kid to learn something new. The characters and their situations are relatable to me. I have the feeling of being the "spokesperson" of this family as they have to work hard and make sacrifices just like I have. It took me awhile to get into this movie, but it was well worth the wait.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The action was very good and even though they didn't get any of the weapons, they still used them.   In the beginning when he was a boy the family went into the jungle with him in a canoe.  They got a little lost but they got out and met a friendly tribe.  This tribe had a long history.  I think they would have done well in an epic like Conan or The Black Bands.  If only they had had more time to learn English.

It had a very real look about it and I am a big fan of the movies from the 60's and 70's. The story was well done, with a nice twist at the end. The soundtrack was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always loved horror movies from the 30's and 40's. As a child, my mom got me a lot of "survival horror" on VHS tapes when we moved. I also remember my first movie being a slasher. This was my first one to actually take me into a killer's mind.   The ending to this film really left me scared as hell.  This movie is a great film, with a great ending and a great cast!   Recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Hair and the Devil" is a classic thriller. The plot is straightforward: A young woman is murdered in her home. She is buried in a shallow grave, covered with her husband's old, dirty rags. She leaves a note that reads: "I love you." As time goes on, the killer begins to hunt her down. He breaks into the house of her ex-lover, a prominent attorney. And she finds out he is a sadist and a master criminal. She knows he will find her and that he will kill her. But she will find a way to save herself. I liked it a lot because it's a nice twist on a crime story, and it's made with great acting and suspenseful editing. A wonderful and frightening story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My brother had just been born and it was Christmas time. He was sitting in the car waiting for his mom to pick him up so we could go to the movie. I had just finished my first movie and I just wanted to go see a movie. Well my mother got a ticket for us so I waited for my brother. When we got into the theater I could hear the movie was starting. I knew something was wrong because there was a huge line out the door and a huge commotion around me in the lobby. I looked at my brother and he was freaking out. He said something about how he's never seen anything like this before. I thought he was exaggerating but then he said something else. I realized what it was and it freaked me out even more. After the movie I went to sit down by the exit and when I turned the corner I saw this huge mess all over the floor and chairs. People were tripping and yelling and it looked like the movie had gone crazy on them. I grabbed my purse and ran out of the theater and I ran all the way to my house in a daze. It freaked the hell out of me. I was scared to sleep that night.

If you like action and the classic 'The Terminator' is one that you should watch, you will probably love this movie.   I have seen a lot of different versions of the story, but I like it best with the original.  The movie was made in 1994, but it feels dated, like a prequel.  I liked it a lot more than the newer version, but that doesn't make it bad.  This is a great movie and a fun one, even if you aren't a 'The...
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am glad I saw this in the theater because the movie was enjoyable. It reminded me of a modern day story about an old-school detective and his female partner who had a difficult time trying to bring the murderers to justice. The movie is great on action with lots of fast paced car chases. The characters are well played with the exception of one but it is not worth noting since the movie is good. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of detective/police movies and are looking for a good time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In "Tombstone," John Carradine shows us the man who was once in his prime.   This is a great film.  The acting is great.  John Carstene is perfect.  He's not the first actor to get his share of the action, but he never lets it get in his way.  Carradines character is a man who will not change no matter what.  His fight is only as good as the fight he had.  I give it a 10 for good acting and a fantastic movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a world where Hollywood has gone to such extremes to make movies that have to have a plot (or at least that was the thinking with "The Day After Tomorrow"), this movie is still a great movie.  The film is very well acted (especially the two actors as the CIA agents who play in the plot), and the movie is full of action that is exciting, fun and well choreographed.  I just hope that we will see a sequel to this movie. Â   A movie like this that was made in the 50's when the idea of a plot was not considered necessary (and even if they did, the film wouldn't be "made" by Hollywood) is very rare and deserves to be seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie does have a lot of problems. The script is not what you would expect out of a comedy. It doesn't have any real wit and is just kind of a one-dimensional character-driven comedy. The acting is pretty decent, but you can tell that they put a lot more work into the lines than is necessary. I can't think of a single time I laughed while watching this. There are a few funny scenes, but they never really work. They just come and go and come and gone. This movie is not worth watching.

A lot of people in America think we should hate on the UK, because it is a much richer and more cultured society, but the UK has so much more to offer the world.  The UK also has a much more diverse, exciting film industry, which shows the world that they do have other great films to show as well.  A real pleasure to see the British talent on show.  Thanks to Peter Jackson, director of "The Hobbit" trilogy, and Peter Jackson again for making a movie which will bring a lot of attention to the UK.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie I was very impressed with how it handled its characters.   I think it was also great that it not only treated its characters like real people, but gave them a backstory as well.  They're all just normal people with normal problems that we are all familiar with.  The only problem with this film is that the second half of the movie is completely uninteresting, and the third half (at least, for me) isn't very good either.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the very best movies about the American West that I have seen.   It shows exactly the type of people that were there.  The westerns that came out during that time were usually made in a small town or the wilderness.  And here are people who were really the pioneers and their towns.  So they had a very different outlook on life than they did a few years later.  They were not really into the big cities and all the things they saw there. They lived there for the solitude.  There is some humor in this film too.  It does not have the same kind of humor that you get from the films of James Stewart and Gene Hackman, but it is very well done.  If you are a history buff or a cowboy fan then this is the movie for you.  Highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie to watch at your home with a good laugh, and it has a special place in my heart for being the first film of mine I ever saw.   If you like comedy and are not into the genre of science fiction, then I would not recommend this movie.  If, however, you enjoy seeing the science fiction genre take over the stage, and if you love the science, it's a very good film.  I have seen some people complain that it is "boring", but I find it funny and amusing, and in fact it's more funny than the humor that the movie contains.  The writing for the science in this movie is pretty good, but the humor is pretty offbeat.  So if you can appreciate the comedy, and you don't mind a little science, this is a good choice.

It has an adorable message about kids being too young to understand the world, and I thought it was so moving, and it really made you understand that this was all the adults were ever telling us about what was going on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been looking for a good old fashioned black and white horror movie with a good plot for a while now.  I'm so glad that the great Mr. Scorsese did a remake of the old Hammer Films version that I've seen many times before.  The new version is really much better in every way.   The great Mr, ScorsESE has managed to make it into a great movie.  It has a great soundtrack, great actors in it and an interesting story line.  This is one of my favorite Scorsesi movies because of the wonderful dialogue.  And it has got a great creepy soundtrack by David Crosby.  There are many good old black and whites out there but this is the one that I think I will always watch again.

The acting in this movie is very good and the action scene is pretty cool too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had watched this movie once in the theatre and had forgotten all about it. The film had been out for several years and I just felt as if I had been there. In the years since I have had the opportunity to revisit the film and really see it at the time.   The story revolves around a boy named Peter who has a terrible problem. His grandfather has passed away and as a child he must do things to pay off a debt. I was amazed at the scenes of the film in the 1950's where kids were throwing rocks at the car of a car full of adults.  After that, Peter is sent to a reformatory for children and is there for a couple years. It was at this time that Peter's real problems begin.  Peter is forced to work with a group of boys in a dangerous workhouse and after a while he becomes aware of a secret that is going on at the workhouse.  When Peter is finally released from the reformatory he finds that he has to fight against those who want to steal his money from him.  The acting in this movie is very strong and you can tell that it was meant to be seen on the big screen.  As a side note, the ending of the movie is a little over the top for my taste but if you can get past that it is still a good flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a blast.   The movie starts out slow and then the pace picks up a little.  The plot and characters are really cool.  One of my favorite characters was the one with a beard.  When he saw the truck he ran to it and went in with the other guy. He got out of the truck, went back to it, and took the wheel.  This one is a must see for anyone who enjoys action movies.  I was actually shocked when I realized that I was watching a movie about a guy who jumped out of a truck into a field with a bunch of armed men and shot at them.  That is pretty much the plot of the movie.

She sat in front of the TV and yelled out the movie title.  When she saw the opening credits, she sat up and stared at the screen.  For me, the opening scene was as important as the rest of the movie.  The story of the boy who goes on a camping trip is just the right blend of childish fun and scary.   I highly recommend this movie for families that like scary movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "A great love story that leaves a lasting impression."   -Cyrus L. Â     This film is one of the best love stories of all time and if you like a good romantic comedy, this movie will blow you away.   The story is fantastic, and the lead actors, especially Bruce Dern, are so incredibly good.  In fact, I think this movie is one the greatest love stories ever written.  And when Bruce Dennett plays a good guy and you see him at the end of the movie, you know this was a good man.  The movie is a comedy, but it isn't a silly comedy.  It tells a really good love story.  When Bruce Dennen plays a bad guy and he is walking into a bar, and he gets in and he tries to fight the bartender, and it is one a good fight.  Bruce DENNEN is so good in this movie that he just takes your breath away. Â  He gives the best performances in all of cinema in this flick.  This movie is so incredibly funny and the plot is so incredible, that you just can't believe there is a love story at the beginning of the flick. The plot is unbelievable.  I have seen the movie three times now, and I still can't get over how good this movie actually is.  One of the great movie stars in the movie is the great Gene Hackman.  He is one awesome actor and you feel his presence every time he is on screen.  Â  A great movie and a must see.

But I did laugh at the ending. I remember saying to my mom after the movie that I thought it was so funny, but my dad just looked confused. This movie has such bad acting, it is hard to get it out of your head. If you have a bad attitude, or a bad laugh, you will love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is the best thing I have ever seen on the silver screen. It's an incredibly good time. I have never seen such a funny movie and it is made even funnier by the fact that it takes place in the past.   The script is written by a writer/director known for writing comedies. The characters are all real. And the acting is great. The best actor is Sam Elliott as the writer of the movie and the best actress is Julie Andrews as the girl who helps him.  They all have to act with their lives. And each one of them has his own idea of how to do this. One idea will not work for the other.  This film is not only about a guy's idea of what he wants to do and who he wants his movie to be about. It also has to deal with his wife who has had problems with her life since the war.  The ending is pretty great.

Williams The movie:Â  In the year 2075, the planet Cyberspace is overrun by the cyber-fascist known as Cybermen. The Doctor has been assigned to help the human resistance fight back against the invading Cybermen, but when the Cybermen get hold of his companion Donna Noble and kidnap her to be used as a Cybermatrix slave, he goes on the run in search of her before she's taken to Cybermats. A huge space battle ensues as the Doctor and Donna battle to save themselves and save the Earth from Cybermageddon. The effects are great. The acting is incredible. And the special effects were incredible. The soundtrack is amazing. In the end the story is very moving. It has a huge impact on the human race. "This isn't just a movie about a space battle and a cyborg, it's about life and love, and the human spirit and the power of love. That's why this movie is the film that I will remember.   The plot:  To save the world from Cybermen in Cybersport, the Doctor has to stop the Cyber-fascist Baron Talbot from detonating a nuclear warhead, destroying the Cybermating devices on all the Earth's cyberspace. The script is extremely well done. The story is excellent. It is set in a very interesting time period with many twists and turns. I really liked this movie.  The characters:  It was great to see the Doctor again and Donna is brilliant as the companion of the Doctor. Both the Doctor/Donna and Talbot/Rani are wonderful. I don't like it when the companions of the heroes of the story wear very revealing outfits. However, the Cyberman costumes are beautiful. They really get you in the mood for the movie. The actors are just amazing. It's amazing to watch them work.  How was the editing?  In the beginning the scene where Donna is captured by the Cyber mapper and the Cybermat and the cybermapping device gets her in the Cyberport in the future was edited so you can only see Donna's head through the screen when it was shot. Then they added more stuff to make the scene more interesting.  This is why the movie is so much better than the previous two Doctor Who movies.  "I know you're

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, it's just not funny. It's got a little romance going for it, but this movie is so boring and predictable. There is no conflict between characters, no tension, nothing to keep you from getting bored.   You don't know who's going to be murdered, who's on the outs with who, and who is the "bad guy" in this movie. The movie is boring and cliche and doesn't really have any depth. It is like seeing the same scene over and over again.

I remember watching it in the late 80's when it came out and being enthralled with it. I was fascinated with the story and had no idea there was a sequel, but I knew this was gonna be a hit. I've never seen it so I can't comment on the special effects, but even with the limitations, it was still a wonderful film to watch. I liked the characters very much, even though I thought they were not quite the characters I saw in the movie. I'd definitely recommend this film to fans of the original movie, although I don't think you'll be as taken with the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good film. I like it.   The acting is excellent. The special effects are good. The story is fine. This is not a great film but it has a good story.  I have seen better films than this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most unique action movie I've ever seen.   This is a true crime story with all the twists, turns and turns.  With the amazing performances from the cast and excellent direction this is one that should not be missed.  The story and execution is truly amazing.  It is really a mystery with twists and turns that will have you wondering what happened to everyone.  There were so many characters that had to be handled in such a short period of time.  Some things are left up to interpretation.  A special thanks to director Tony Scott.  He is a genius and this is a must watch.  I highly recommend this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw this at my local theater. I'm not really a horror movie person. I wasn't afraid to go to the movies with my boyfriend and saw a few horror films but nothing like this. This movie is good and if you see it it will be a good horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie a few years back. It was released in the early 90's, and it was a major sleeper hit. It has some great performances from Harrison Ford, Ronny Cox, and Barbara Bach. The story follows the life of a young woman, who gets pregnant and has a difficult pregnancy. The woman's life is changed when her baby boy is born and becomes an orphan after she goes back to the US for medical care. I liked this movie, although some of the scenes were a little confusing, but it was still a pretty fun movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friend and I were watching this on our first date. It was the first time we've seen each other in a while and I asked her if she was watching a movie with me. She responded, "Yeah, it's a funny movie." It was such a great movie!   For those who have never heard of the movie, here's a synopsis from Wikipedia   - An aging star player in the Chicago Cubs is a hero to the fans because of his work on the field. But as he gets older, his body begins to betray him. When a cancer scare leaves him a paraplegic and his wife leaves him for a younger man, he looks to a baseball writer for a comeback.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was surprised to see that the plot of the movie was somewhat similar to the original book. Both books have the main character go through some pretty horrible things and then get out of that hell. Both the books also have people who see their destiny and are determined to get the girl that has it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never seen a movie this beautiful and funny, and the acting is top notch. The cast is so wonderful, that you will laugh throughout the entire movie.   If you are a fan of Paul Reubens films, this is one you will not want to miss!   In the movie, this dude (a real estate agent named Paul Reuben) is having a hard time finding a tenant for an old apartment he's owned for the last fifteen years. The guy (Robert Carradine) wants to rent it and is going to pay him what it's worth. Paul doesn't like Robert, he thinks he's rude, and so he goes to the police. They find out that Robert has been cheating on his wife (Judi Dench) with a new woman named Susan, and they want Paul to help them catch him. He agrees. The only problem is that Susan's not who she says she is, and Robert knows this. The problem is, the woman (Diane Keaton) is a stripper! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that deserves to be seen! It's a dark comedy set in the 1930s, and I can tell you it's one of the best films in the genre.  Â There's lots of wonderful performances (the best being byÂ  Michael J. Pollard, who is just so damn charming as a man trying to make a living. Â I loved watchingÂ  John Wayne as a tough old sheriffÂ who gets involved in the business), and the production values are perfect.  And, what's a perfect film without a strong ending, and a great ending is provided.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved the movie.   From the movie opening scene, I knew that the film was going to be a fun ride.  The actors did a wonderful job and the movie had a wonderful pace.  There were some wonderful scenes, but I felt that the characters were a bit flat.  One of the more interesting characters was a German Jew who was living in France in 1944.  He was living with his parents and three of his sisters.  It was very nice to see the relationship between the three sisters and the German Jew.  We know that they were all victims of the Nazi's and their lives were very difficult, but it was nice to learn that they had some humor and fun and had friends around the house.  And it was very cool to see how they all got together to watch a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love movies about people doing great things.   These two guys are the two greatest skiers ever.  Both have made some of the most amazing moves ever in snowboarding.  The first half of the movie is great, then they stop, and a few of their best shots aren't in the movie because they can't use them.  They have a great storyline, and some great back to back shots.  There are other skiing films from the 60's and 70's that have better skiing, but this is not one of them. My favorite scenes are when they are backpacking, and when they get back to their cars at the end of the day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â This film is a bit more on the surreal side than most of their films, but is still a good film to watch. The director, George Romero, is a great film-maker, who created some really amazing films in the 70s and 80s.   The plot is very simple: A young man, named Bill, is working at a gas station. One day he meets a female passenger, who falls asleep on the train car. When she wakes up she has a very odd face, she doesn't have a nose or mouth, the bones are all bent, and a black mist is hanging over her. This woman seems to be some sort of spirit, and Bill must follow her, or go insane. The first half of the movie has an almost surreal feel to it, it is very well shot and the scenes are very well made. The film ends when Bill sees the woman again, she has changed back to a young woman, and it is implied that Bill is somehow responsible for her change.  The final part of the film is even more bizarre, it has some truly great acting (mostly from Peter O'Toole) and really cool effects.

There is some sex in it, but it was not as bad as some of the other movies I have seen recently and I liked the idea. I am a little disappointed that the guy got shot, but other than that it is a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the original Ghostbusters.   The story of four women who use their talents to solve mysteries that go back into the past of New York City is perfect for the time period.  The two women and their three male co-stars are great.  It is an amazing movie.  I never knew that the ghosts were real.  A true masterpiece of comedy and science fiction.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's got a great script, great cast and a great director.   He really makes you feel like a member of a small town that was hit with a sudden wave of change.  There are plenty of scenes in the movie that will make you smile, even when they are painful, and there are plenty that will leave you with an uncomfortable feeling of having been taken advantage of.  I have not seen this movie in many years and it still makes me smile when I think of how it looks and feels.  It will still be in my mind when I watch it again, but there are times when it makes me wonder what might have been.  A great movie to have in your collection.     My thoughts on the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on a whim and it was awesome. A couple of years ago, my mom was sick and was in the hospital. I asked her to buy me some popcorn. A neighbor was standing outside the door so she went in to get it. She came back in and said she forgot it and couldn't find it. I saw her looking for it and I thought, "How cool is it that this movie is based on her story? " So I said, "why don't you watch this movie with me and we will find her popcorn. I'm sure she would love it." We sat outside on a porch and waited. Well, my dad was the first person to come out to watch the movie with us. He loved it. My dad told my mom it was his favorite movie of all time. I love the old 80s era so that is why it is so cool.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember seeing this movie as a child and it left a very bad taste in my mouth. After a while I couldn't look at it anymore and didn't even remember the name of the movie. Now that I'm older and have seen other movies in theaters I am glad I didn't see it as a kid because this one ruined me for a good horror movie. I love the story but it's really silly and goofy in places and the acting is pretty bad. I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie. It was the perfect time to go out with friends and scare the bejesus out of each other.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this movie several times and the performance of John Travolta is great.

Travolos then you should watch this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "The Mummy" film series has been quite the success story over the last decade or so. The films seem to be in high demand and have a lot of great actors in them.  This is one of those films.  I have been waiting for this one for quite some time now, so it was great to get to see this one at the end of the run of this great franchise.    The story follows the main character played by Tom Cruise, he is on a mission when he finds a crypt which has the head of an ancient Egyptian mummy, they were trying to find the mummy for a project.  The mummy they found is in a box and there are many weapons that need to be put into it and to complete the mission.  After putting all of the weapons into the mummy the ship goes out to sea, however it is attacked by an all powerful sea serpent. The mummy is sucked into the ocean, Tom Cruise is knocked out and is seen in a trance as the serpent begins to eat him.  However, Tom was not dead, in fact he was being controlled by a mummy and so the mummy had to be stopped.  When he awoke he was in a cave with his wife who was also in a stupor from having taken a deadly poison. He tries to find help but doesn't get very far.  During the film he is attacked and taken to a hospital, however the mummy has found a way to break him out of his trance and take over. Â    It is hard to believe that this was a "Tom Cruise" movie.  As the story goes on you can really see how much thought has gone into the making of this film.  In the film you are introduced to a great cast of actors. The story is really well put together, well directed and really a great film. Â  Â    As mentioned the story is very good and I highly recommend seeing it, it really is a shame that this film did not come out in the late 80's and early 90's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I've ever seen. I was born into it and I am still in love with it. I think its one of the first films where people actually got the idea that the people being murdered were not really evil. The camera moves around them like they are just living life. The actors are brilliant. And I think that in a time when the medium was still in its infancy and you had all these cheap horror movies that were not scary, this really helped show what made horror movies truly scary.   It was also the first film that I could take my kids to and show them. They loved it and the adults loved it too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is like a dream, but it's a really strange dream where the dream-like state is very surreal. It's just like it's just too strange to be real, and it's too surreal that even real it's all surreal. The best thing is that it is so hard to explain, like it makes no sense but it is true, I hope this movie will be remembered. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Day The Earth Stood Still" was a fantastic adventure film.   I loved that all the parts had such great characters, from the crew and the people on the ship, to the scientists that were doing experiments and the astronauts.  Even the alien characters were believable and well-realized.  I found the special effects to be really beautiful.  "A good time" was the main theme.  It was a very well-paced film that you could watch over and over again.  One of my favorite movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie a few years ago and didn't think much of it. I was never really a fan of the TV shows, but I had seen the movie and enjoyed it. This movie took on a different kind of life since its release. I don't believe the TV series lasted for very long (I'm still hoping they will get a remake). This movie was made by a director who had a lot of success in movies such as "The Fugitive", "The Last Detail", "Crocodile Dundee", "Jaws" and others. It is one of my favorite films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie, and one that's not likely to be in my regular rotation. It's set in the late 19th century and shows us a group of men (mostly men) playing poker at a local saloon. They're all very wealthy and the owner is not only very rich, but is also a brilliant and generous businessman. When he sees that his best players aren't coming back he makes it his mission to create a good show for all of them to enjoy. This is not the story of any of the real life millionaires, and even the people at the poker table are fictitious. The actors are excellent, the music is very entertaining, and it's just a fun watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had no idea what this movie was like, but now I can confirm its a great movie! The director was a guy from England and wrote it himself.

The DVD is worth the price,  I will definitely get my wife to watch this on DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As the title says, this film is really about how the characters interact with one another. It is interesting to see two kids at different age levels and their interactions. The older character, Maxine is clearly the more mature and more outgoing. Maxine and her little brother, Ben, do not interact well at all. Ben is the "fun" one and Maxine the "hard" one. Max and Ben have some nice moments and the best dialogue is between the two. The film also shows how Ben's father, Jack, and Max's mother, Margaret, try to help Ben grow up. Ben's mom is quite strict and Ben does not understand what is happening. However, Ben tries his best to keep his promise to go on the school field trip as Maxine did.   I had never seen a film that showed Maxine so well before and after. She had so much more to do in this film than just being the mother. Max was a wonderful character, one I could have played myself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't know much about the original film, so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this remake. It wasn't just the casting or the production, but the fact that the filmmakers got so much right in adapting the story.   This movie is a real treat for fans of the original, and I found myself rooting for the kids in a way I haven't been able to in the series, which is always hard for me.  In fact, I actually had tears in my eyes at times, as I enjoyed the humor of the story more than I had in the originals.  It's a great remake, and one I would recommend to fans of either series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember hearing about this film when I was a teenager, in my teens, and watching it every summer. I saw it once before and got hooked for life. This was a pretty great movie, I think, and a little ironic since it is about a group of young girls, who do their best to save their friend from suicide after learning about her death by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.   The girl who commits suicide gets saved by the group, as the older guys were a little less than supportive of the suicide attempt and didn't want to hear it, but when they realized they couldn't stop her, they decided to try and save her life.  They did all this without getting caught.  Â  This is a movie about friendship, and trust, and doing the right thing, and even doing it without the right intentions, and it is a very uplifting and beautiful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I watched this I was so angry and disappointed.  I loved the cast and the music and the way that they had all of the actors on the set as well.  So then I went back and watched it again and was so much more into it.  There is a beautiful sadness to the story and it seems that each of the main characters was looking for something to believe in and for their relationship to be meaningful.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just found this and I liked it! I am not going to talk about the movie but this was a good action movie for when you want some good action.   A really good movie that you should get.  A friend told me this was based on a real incident in which the guys were in a restaurant.  The guy was sitting by himself and the girls came in a group and said, "you can't sit here, you'll get us fired!" so the guy turned around and the guy grabbed the girls by the hair and choked them to death.  They called the police and a murder charge was filed against the guy and he was in jail for 2 years.  If you don't want to watch it, then just watch the news version.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The good: The movie doesn't try to be anything.Â It doesn't use any special effects or anything.  It's just a simple story.  The movie is very short.  There are only about six or seven minutes of action.   It also has some good music.  This movie is the one film I saw a couple weeks ago where the film really made me think.  In the first two minutes of the movie, the plot has the audience hooked!   For me, this movie is not very good, but it is a good time, and I recommend it!  The bad:  It doesn't have anything really new to say.  A lot of the actors who play the people in the movies that the characters in this movie go to don't appear in this one.  I feel that some of the people who are in this were cast for a reason, but they were cast in a way that they aren't that great at what they do.Â  I also think that it didn't make sense for this movie to be set in Africa.  But I guess I am just not really into Africa. I wish this film was a little more "good" in my opinion. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I found out about this movie it really took me by surprise. It's a great and fun sci-fi movie with some good twists to it. The whole story and concept are great, it's a little weird to see a woman as a main character, and she has a really great role.   For those that have not seen it I recommend you watch it for yourself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I love all the "modern" films that are shot with very high resolution cameras and digitally altered. I love this film as well and I'm glad it's getting some attention as a must see!   I like it's look and feel to it and it's funny! The movie was made in the early 90's and shows a woman who's really trying to live her life. She gets married to a man that doesn't share her philosophy. She has a lot of sex with this guy and I mean A LOT of sex. It's not a happy movie!  The music is great, the editing is excellent, and the acting is top notch. It was directed by John Hughes and I just love the fact that it looks so good in 3-D! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at the movie theater and it was very good. The people in it were real and they were playing really well. It was a really good movie.   The movie is pretty much the same as the one in the movie theatre. The only difference is the music and the way it was shot.  The thing is though, this was a movie from the 60s and it looks great! The colors are bright, the clothes are bright and the people are bright.  Also the background music and background of the city are very clear and vivid. It gives you a feeling of how the city looks like in the 60's.  It is a fun movie that I really enjoyed watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When the first trailer of The Good Dinosaur came out, I knew it was going to be great. As an old dinosaur fan, it's always great to see another classic. With Pixar's track record, I felt they had the right idea in bringing back this beloved dinosaur. Pixar knows dinosaurs so well and I think the dinosaurs are at their best when they're on a prehistoric adventure.    My only qualm was that there weren't as many dinosaurs in the movie as I was hoping for. The CGI dinosaurs are great, but I'd like to see some actual dinosaurs in this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first experience with this movie was in the theatre with my mother, and I can remember being excited to see a movie like this.   I remember my reaction to it: I didn't even see a body. The film was so moving that I just didn't care if there was an actual body on the screen.  The movie was well written and well acted, and it's probably my favourite movie about love.  I have never been in love myself, and this film gave me that very feeling. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't realize how much I missed Michael Douglas until I saw this movie. He plays a successful writer, and he is having marital problems with his wife and his kids. He's also suffering from depression and, as you can see, it comes out. This is a very funny movie with a great performance by Douglas.    A good comedy with great performances from the leads.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would highly recommend this movie. This is not some low budget horror movie, this is a highly original story about a doctor that is able to create life from his body. This movie is not for everyone. It may not scare you, or give you goosebumps, but it will make you feel a little bit uncomfortable. The movie is very well written and directed, and I hope to see it on the big screen at some point.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film in a new, and very interesting, series. Great story, great acting, and a wonderful cast.

The only thing is that the picture is quite small, but it is a nice touch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's the best of the first season of the series that had already been cut from the original theatrical release. The original film was a fine action film with fantastic characters and a great storyline. However, the first two episodes felt like they were cut to the bone for a quick cash-in to get back on the silver screen. This was all to be the next film in the franchise, but the movie that was made was a great action film that had the good action that had been lost in the first 2 episodes. It is a shame that it wasn't released as a proper "feature-length" film, but it is still an entertaining film.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so happy to see this movie at the local video store when it came out. It was one of the first things that reminded me of the 80's. I'm really glad that the remake was done in 2d.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this on DVD and watched it right away on the theater screen. This movie is fantastic and my favorite Hitchcock movie.   The plot is fantastic, it just gets better.  This is a great movie and is very easy to follow.  I hope we see more movies made like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an amazing movie. I have seen a lot of great movies in the cinema and this one in particular has a real feel about it. I am a big fan of the movies that make it a challenge for the audience to remember what is going on and I enjoyed this one more than most. The story line is well paced and has many different characters to play with.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that is so good, it really gets your heart pounding and you want to see more!   It's not your typical western, but it's a really good western.  This movie is a lot of fun and a great addition to the western genre.  I just wanted to see the two cowboy and his son shoot each other to pieces.   I saw this one for a friend who doesn't watch westerns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It's a very enjoyable comedy, and it has a lot of great laughs.   You might want to watch this with some friends, or if you have a group of people that aren't too mature.  You'll enjoy this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "If you've ever wondered what an actor looks like in real life, here's your chance!" - Kevin Spacey's character is so over the top it's hard to take him seriously as a person, and the acting is just atrocious. I had never seen the movie before and thought this was a parody of "Titanic," but when I saw the movie it was clear that it was not.   The acting is so bad that I'm not even sure why the plot is important.  That was the first scene in the movie. I knew what it was, and I knew why it was funny, but still, the acting was so bad I just couldn't look at it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was a blast to watch. The action was great, the acting was top notch. The movie made me feel like I was on the set. The special effects were amazing, and the story and characters were perfect. I felt like I got to be on set with the filmmakers.   Â  A good movie with amazing special effects and good acting and story.  A really cool movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie! You're watching the story of a girl who went from being just a quiet, shy girl to the most powerful person in a small town, and then the most wanted woman in the world. There were so many incredible scenes in this movie. And they were all so real. The acting was excellent and the story was so well developed. The plot was so awesome. The story of how she was a girl with a crush on the hot detective played by James Woods was so realistic. If you're looking for a movie about a girl trying to find her dream and how she gets involved with two men, you will not be disappointed!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My brother and I went on a family vacation to the coast for a few days. The family thought that we would see the sights, but we were just looking for a quiet place to escape from the noisy kids. We found a small cabin where we were welcomed by a sweet, but shy, man and his lovely wife. We were amazed at the view of the water. I don't know the language well, but it was clearly different from anything I'd ever seen. It looked so peaceful. Our stay was very pleasant, with our hostess and his wife giving us a wonderful welcome. We went outside every morning and talked in Spanish. The only problem was that we were always thirsty after our hikes. We stayed out all night one day because the water was still clear and crystal clear. Our hostess made sure to keep the windows closed. Our only complaint was that the food didn't taste that good. I guess that's because we had to spend so much time outside. In retrospect, I wonder how many other cabins were like it. This is one of the most relaxing places I've been to. We will return and we hope to see more of this place.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a wonderful story about love, death, and what it means to die, with all the tension of the most dramatic scenes.  I saw it as a film at my high school graduation ceremony, and I've watched it often since.  A great film from a great director. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best of the old, classic movies that are not so much about the actors themselves (although you will see some of them), but are about the relationships and the times they were in, and the way that they interacted with each other.   It's a little bit like the great Italian-American drama in the 60's, in the sense that there are a lot of young men on both sides and lots of drinking, but the relationships are stronger.  The story isn't as complex as some of the other films I've seen about this era, but it's a good one and it shows a lot about the times.  This movie will stay with me for a long time, and I can imagine the young stars sitting around on the porch in the rain, talking about the movies and their lives and their past, and even making out in the kitchen while they wait for the next train to take them back to their homes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most exciting part of this movie was seeing Michael Caine in a classic film. Caine's performance is on a different level than he's ever shown in any other movie, and his character is one of the most original and intriguing he's done. There is so much to see in this film, it almost feels like you could spend an entire day just watching the movie (at times I did), and I can say that it did well enough to earn a 4 out of 5.    A must-see for anyone who has seen it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like this movie. It's a good time. It has a lot of jokes, and it's kind of good at what it's trying to do. It was fun to watch and the whole movie had lots of good jokes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but I have to say I felt like I was watching a bad version of "Babe". I had hoped it would be a bit better, but alas it was pretty much just a knockoff of that movie. The main difference is that the main character is older and a real jerk. However, even though he is a jerk, there was not really any malice or any really bad lines that really got me to want to bash his head in.   This is a very funny movie. I was laughing out loud at some of the jokes.  The only thing that was a little bad was the ending (which is actually pretty bad), but I guess the guy doesn't need any more money so it doesn't really matter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a few films that have gotten my hopes up for the future of horror and they are usually the ones that give me nightmares. It's a little depressing that I didn't give the film a better rating and I am glad it will stay in my top 10s as a film that has the potential to be a true classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite of the bunch.   This one has an original premise that works quite well.  The story is interesting, but I can't help but wonder how the filmmakers managed to get all the characters and scenes to be this close to each other.  It doesn't always work, but the concept makes it worthwhile. Â I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - The way the story is told, the characters, the plot and even the music are superb.   One of the best movies that I have seen.  A very well written movie and the best actors in the world put on the best acting show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never seen a movie that impressed me as much as the movie "The Exorcist" and I think that it's the best movie ever made on the subject of that demon. The film is not for the weak-minded, it is a great film to watch for people who love to think about the supernatural.   The Exorcists is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. If you have seen the movie, you should watch this too, you might find yourself thinking, "What is going on? This isn't what I thought it was."   "The Devil's Advocate" is a documentary of the case that was brought against Father Coughlin for the murder of a girl in New York.  The movie also shows the trial, the jury, and the press reactions to the case.  "There are many stories about the man who was accused of the crime. The most famous story is of the night the priest found a dead girl in a basement. The woman had been sexually assaulted. The priest tried to save the girl's life by wrapping her in a sheet but he failed. He then gave her a dose of pills and then left her to die. She died. Father Conell thought he had been responsible. He went to the police and told them what had happened but they did not believe him. His reputation was ruined, he was never ordained again.  A few years after that story was published, Father Coughtn was accused by a young girl who had gone to see him in the confessional for the first time. She told him about the sexual assault. He was called into court to face charges but it was clear that the girl had lied and she had not been raped. The man went to jail and died before he could stand trial."  This is a true classic and a must see for all those who want to get a real insight into what the Church and the Catholic Church was like in its time and the attitudes towards homosexuality in America. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of a young man (a kid) and a girl (a teenager) traveling the world and meeting each other is very moving and romantic. I like the way that the filmmakers did not focus on the sex itself. The story is very slow and a true mystery. In the middle of the movie you realize that you are watching something great. And when they finally get to the final destination in Europe, it was just too good to be true. A film that you can enjoy watching and then go back and watch again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My son and I watched it yesterday at the theater. We loved it. It's a good old-fashioned good-time movie. And there is lots of fun to be had. It has all the right characters - everyone has a good time - it's a joy to watch and enjoy.    There's something about that movie that just grabs the heart. It is the epitome of fun and good-times. I will definitely see this movie again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - Excellent action movie, set in the early 50's and starring a couple of Hollywood movie stars.   This is a really enjoyable movie that tells the story of a gangster and a beautiful, sexy girl, who are out looking for a man who has left her behind and taken her girlfriend.  They stumble into the life of a man called John Henry (played by Frank Sinatra).  The film gives you the perfect balance between sex and violence and the romance in the film is very good.  The movie was also a huge success and it was shown all over the world.  I really enjoyed it and I would recommend it to any fan of gangster films.  This movie also features a beautiful performance by Jane Fonda.  Thanks for posting this movie, i will remember this film for many years to come,  - A true classic!   I'm sure this movie was a huge hit in the movie theaters of the 50's,   in a movie where John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe are in love with each other.  - I loved this movie so much.  What a great film!  - What a wonderful film!Â  I'd been wanting to watch this one for a long time.Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, I love the movie The Thing. It is one of my favorites.   This movie takes place around 1940's. The characters are different and the story was well thought out.  It's a good thriller that had me hooked from the very beginning.  It was a great action movie, even if it was a little too long. I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a great time watching this movie. I think the acting is great, especially in the scenes with the people on the subway. I found myself thinking about the people and how they were on their way to work everyday. This movie is not about the good old days, it is a very thought provoking movie, and it will give you a lot to think about.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off with two people in a car talking.  They are looking at a map of Mexico and talking about what is on it. They have not been there yet and the two are looking for something.  In the middle of this conversation a guy walks up to the two and tells them a place is on the map.  He says they have to go there.  The two ask where and he explains that the two have to find the person who made it.  Both of them agree.  A little while later the two find a small shack.  Then one of them starts knocking on the door to get inside.  This happens a few times and the other guy is yelling at him for it. One of them is having a hard time getting into the shack. Â  Then the other one walks up and says that the person in the shack is not coming out until the first guy is in the car. Â  The second guy comes out and looks at the person from the shack and says, "What are you doing?  I told you, I have not found this guy,  he goes inside the shack with the other person and starts knocking more times on the shack door.  As soon as the first one goes in the second guy starts to go in.  It is the same guy who was outside,  but it seems like he has gotten stronger.  After a while he starts running toward the shack as well. Â  This was a great movie and it was amazing to see how much they were looking for this place.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. I've seen a lot of horror movies in the past, but this one stood out for me. The first half of the movie is great, as you would expect from a B-movie, with the cast doing all kinds of insane stuff, and the second half is just crazy as it should be.   "B-movie" in this movie is definitely a bad thing. It's pretty good, and doesn't hold up very well on the first viewing, but after you see the first half a few more times, you will see why this movie was made, and why it was such a big hit.  This movie is a true "fun" horror film, and is definitely not for the faint of heart. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit, this film was a huge hit for the studio. It was the first film directed by David Lynch (who has since gone on to make "Blue Velvet" and "Eraserhead"). It was also the first feature length film shot entirely on film. It's got a fantastic sense of eerie beauty and mystery.   The characters are fascinating.  I found myself watching the film on and off for months.  The film's title is a clue as to what to expect.  You'll be sitting there in silence for a while.  Lynch shot the film in black and white and in color, which was great because it made the whole film feel more like a painting.  It's a wonderful mystery, which makes you feel that much more lost and isolated.  This film is really good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie when it came out.   It is a fun movie, but has one problem.  It was made in the fifties, and if you were trying to make a comedy, you would have done better by making a film like "Mr. Deeds" or "Buck Privates".   This is the only one of its kind that I can remember in terms of its style and the characters that appear.  I think the script by Harold Ramis was written for an animated series of cartoons, and not a film.  There is a very nice soundtrack (a little more than the other Ramis films, but I liked it).   When I first saw this movie I was a little disappointed with the story.  My thought was, "Where were all the good movies in the sixties?"  The "Lazy Sunday" movie had just come out, so I was hoping this would be something like that.  The plot is nothing, just some old man is going around looking for people who have lost their job.  Unfortunately, the old man ends up getting trapped by a group of people in a room full of old people that can see him.  Now this is something that could happen in any movie.  He ends up going back in time to find out who is in the room with him and end up losing his job again.  However, this movie is enjoyable in a very simple kind of way.  Just watch the movie and forget all the other things going on.  As a young man, I was never able to see anything funny.  Even the movies that came out at that time were filled with sex and violence.  When watching this movie, I can't help but think about my generation.  People were so afraid of being different, and everyone was so happy with the way they were.  This film helps keep that in the forefront of my mind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is awesome! My husband and I have been fans of the series since the original series, so when they finally made this movie, we watched it right away. The actors were good and I enjoyed it very much. It is a story that has always been told, and I think it's good to see it done well again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.  I was lucky enough to see it when it was out on VOD, so I know it's not the most polished film, but it has an amazing and amazing soundtrack, an amazing story line, and a great acting cast.   The acting isn't perfect but the story is great.  The director obviously had a great time making this movie, he really puts a lot of heart and soul into it, so if you're looking for a good action flick with a great story, this is the one to watch.  There isn't really a scene in the movie that can't be enjoyed, it's a movie that anyone who likes action should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is a fun take on the story. It's a very different story with a fun script. I love the movie.   It was well acted.  The actors were great.  My daughter loved the movie, and my son liked it.  This is a great movie to have around. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am surprised at how much I like this film.   This film has some of the best acting of any of the movies I've seen this year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think "The Exorcist" is an excellent movie, with many great scenes and ideas. It's hard to talk about one of the great movies, but "The Conjuring" is certainly an excellent and well made movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great idea.   I've seen many movies that use the "sick" theme in their title, and this movie certainly fit the bill.  I didn't expect the sicker theme to be used in the plot line of this movie, but as it turned out, it is.  The movie has a good balance between the action, comedy, and a lot of the psychological aspects.  It's quite entertaining.  What sets the movie above other horror movies of the time was the actors, and the actors did a wonderful job.  A lot of young talent like Gary Lockwood and Lola Jones are featured in this movie.  My only complaint is that the original ending was cut down.  For years after it was released, there were many movies with the same idea that followed it, and it never seemed to be a success.  But then, the movie "lost" its original ending, and most movies today don't have it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this movie was a lot of fun. It was great when the main couple finally got together and it was a perfect marriage of the two main characters. The guy was the best at giving head and they really made each other happy. The only thing I wish were different about this movie would be that if they had done it earlier in their relationship it might have had a better ending and made a better movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A beautiful, poignant, emotional film. The movie takes place during a family vacation on the East coast, and we see how it would be as if we are there, and how our friends are affected by the whole thing.   The movie shows us how they deal with their emotions and the effect it has on everyone.  The music is wonderful, and all the actors did an excellent job.  There are a lot of shots in this film that are beautiful.  This is the kind of movie that you watch on vacation with a beautiful day, and you look back and think about the events that have happened over the past few years.  If you want to watch a wonderful movie, this is it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, however, due to my poor internet connection I couldn't actually watch it until the day of the premiere. I got it early and was really excited to watch the movie. It was very well made, it had a great plot, and a great cast.   The acting was really strong and the music was really great. I really liked the chemistry between them.  When I first saw the movie, I thought it was a parody of the "80's" movies. However, I don't think it was parody, it was very true to the era of the movie and did a fantastic job of being true to it.  I highly recommend this movie to people who like comedy, but aren't a big fan of the typical "80s" type of comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good thriller and I thought it was fun to watch. The actor, Billy Zane, and the production were excellent. My only problem was that the film felt rushed. The movie ended on a cliffhanger and I wanted more...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a good start. It was a well made movie with good actors and good dialogue. It is a story about a woman, who is traveling with her boyfriend on a yacht with a crew and their captain. On the boat a very rich man gets into a fight with another boat. When the captain gets in a fight back he loses control of the boat and it begins to sink. He is taken by the crew into the hold of the ship. The captain is arrested and the ship sinks. The crew tries to save the man but there is no life vial in his pockets and they are all drowned in the hold. This woman and her boyfriend try to save all of them. They are trapped in the sea, with no hope of help. The boat is going down and one of the crew members tells them to jump into the sea and swim toward land. The only problem is the boat is sinking fast and there are no life jackets in the boat. I enjoyed the movie a lot and this is a good addition to the cult film series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie, very entertaining. A nice mix of comedy and action.   This movie is really funny and full of action, but at the same time very realistic.  This was a great movie to watch in my late teens, since we were only 15 at the time, and it really made me feel like a teenage girl.  A lot of the guys in this movie were really cool guys.  The movie had a pretty good ending too, since the guys were out of the prison by the end of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen "A Good Life" yet, but the reviews are pretty positive, so I'm looking forward to it.   The film tells the true story of a high school football star and his journey to becoming a high-school athlete and then football star. It also gives a great portrayal of the relationship between the two.  A young man who makes it to the top of his sport and then goes on to be successful in other areas of life.  The ending is pretty dramatic and well-executed as well.  It was quite a surprise when I saw this movie, because it hasn't been on any top lists of my favorite movie of all time.  I think the movie really shows how athletes can make it to their dream if they get the opportunity. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a big fan of this movie as a kid. The plot was very simple and I think it just sort of fell into place.  I wish they made this movie for an audience with little to no knowledge of the subject matter.  This film was kind of interesting because it was so different from all the other movies I had seen as a child.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed the film and thought it was very well acted. The acting was very natural and well done, I especially enjoyed the small roles played by the two actors. This film was great and I recommend it highly to fans of the genre.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An all around good film.   This is a really good film that has been re-edited so that it's more palatable.  The only problem I had with this film was that the ending was a little predictable.  It was supposed to be like a thriller or a horror film but the ending left a lot of viewers hanging.  However, I can understand that they had to try and make it more entertaining so I can see this being a good film for a laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was really worth seeing. I enjoyed it from start to finish. It's not very plot driven and doesn't hold your attention for too long but I definitely recommend watching this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was one of the most interesting films that I saw in this year. As a kid who grew up watching all the James Bond films, it was a bit of a let down to see the James Bonds of the 80's being so much cooler. This movie showed that even at their best, they were still not as cool as the ones in the early 00's films.   A good thing about this film is that it shows how they were able to change from the more serious James Bond of the previous films into the goofy, action-packed characters we love to love.  My wife's parents who are both doctors and nurses were in this movie, so I imagine that they would have been a big influence on some of the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie ever made by a living director. A very intelligent, moving, poetic movie. And the fact that it was shot on location in the '50s in South America gives it authenticity. The costumes were beautiful, and the music was very subtle and understated. It's a must see for all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie that was well shot and the best of the early '50's.   A lot of people think it was a one shot but it's a full length film.  I know there was a TV series but it was not done well.  The plot is not that good, but I like the look of it.  It's an odd thing to do but they use the music, especially at the end of the film. If you don't want to watch it you can't really complain too much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that most of us would like to see some kind of a sequel to this movie with more characters and more scenes, but this one has some of the most amazing visual effects ever done for a movie and is still pretty entertaining to watch.   This is a very funny movie with great music and I recommend it to anyone who likes the John Hughes films and comedies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not going to tell you what I think of the movie and that is because I don't know it well enough. I watched this movie when it came out and it was good. Not great, but good. Now when I saw the sequel I knew it was a rip-off of some other movie that I hadn't seen. When I saw this one I felt like it was going to be an attempt to pay tribute to the original. The way they used the original music in the second film was interesting and very fun to listen to.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film follows a band of young punk rockers that travels around England with a cardboard record, and they are pursued by an evil group of old men that are also pursuing them. The lead singer, Andy Warhol, goes through many strange and exciting situations while attempting to get his band back together. The story is really great. I'm glad I watched this movie. I've seen it twice, and I will watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a gem, it is a fantastic and emotional journey to watch from the beginning to the end.  This is the best movie of the year for me and I would say the best of the 80s.   The cast is great and it has some great acting.  You will enjoy this movie as much as I did and that is saying a lot.  Thank you for making a movie of this caliber that was never made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was good but not worth a re-watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this movie multiple times and was always impressed by the amazing story line, the actors and the excellent sound.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very excited to see this movie, a good sequel to a great movie. The movie is actually really good, and not just for a childrens movie, like it should be.   It was fun to watch the "Moms" get involved in the movie and they were the stars of it.  They were fun to see how much they had grown.  The movie had a lot of laughs.  There was so much more to this movie than just the kids.  This movie is a real classic, and it would have been even better with more time in the making.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a fun movie with a good story, with good acting.

And this one is the same as that one, only the first one is with different actors, but the same plot and some of the same characters.  Â There's also something different about this movie than the others, as it is a different kind of war film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The way this movie makes us feel is fantastic. It shows how even the smallest of actions can affect the world in the wrong way and change it. This movie reminds me of when a certain film was released a few years ago and I was shocked by how similar it was to this movie. I was even more shocked how much of this movie could have been in a different film, this movie shows how we can easily influence the world we live in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been a fan of horror for quite some time, and I have to admit that the majority of the movies I saw in the '80s and '90s were just crap.   Even "Paranormal Activity" was a train wreck.  But when I saw "House on Haunted Hill", I couldn't help but fall in love with this movie.  I'm a sucker for horror films and I'm glad I saw it.  The acting in this movie is pretty good, but it is the special effects that really make this a memorable movie. And don't think that the special effect is done just to entertain the audience, they actually created a good scare.  "House" is one of the better films out there, it even manages to scare me at times!   And for those of you who don't know what the "House of Leaves" book is about, this movie actually contains a lot of stuff that you might have seen in the book.  It's really a shame that the movie didn't come out in the 1980s, it would have been a great movie. (view spoiler)   I can't say anything bad about this movie, it is good, it just doesn't stand up to the best of the 80s or 90s.  This is a film that I would recommend to the fans of the horror genre or anyone who is looking for a good old fashioned fright.  Don't be surprised if you see a sequel to this one.  If you liked this movie you might want to watch "Halloween".

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If I lived in New York, I'd buy this movie for my birthday every year. I remember the feeling of the screen when I first saw it, and then it was the first movie I saw after having moved here. It was the most beautiful and realistic movie I had ever seen. The only thing that's not realistic, is that most of the people in this movie are a few years younger than me, as most of these actors, even the ones who played teens, were teenagers in the 80's when this was made.

It was very well-written, and I had a blast.Â  The film has so much potential and I can't wait to see where the story will take the story. I highly recommend this film to fans of the "Lois & Clark" series and those who are just looking for a good, light-hearted comedy. I really hope that this film becomes a big-budget hit and that other comic book movie producers start making their own films. I definitely recommend this to those who like the classic, yet light-spirited, comedies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like this movie. It was definitely a little more violent than I was expecting and really takes the suspense of the whole story to a whole new level. The whole movie is really suspenseful and a great way to get into the mood of the movie, which is a pretty sad movie, at least for me. It also helps a lot that the actors really bring it in and show their true talents.   This movie is definitely worth seeing and watching for the performance of the actors in the movie and if you have a spare 30 minutes you should definitely check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film was not only the best of the series, but it is by far the most entertaining and well written of the 3.  The pacing was great, it was set up brilliantly, and it was truly wonderful how we got to spend time with these characters.  It has a real sense of humor, which I like, and is not one to go into a movie expecting an "over the top" horror film.   The music is wonderful as well, and the acting is great too, the actors are great.  You just want to laugh and enjoy this film. The ending is especially good and it is the most believable ending that I have seen in a horror film yet.  A classic of the horror genre, and a movie that has not been made a million times yet.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie is just a couple of old-fashioned adventure stories in which the characters travel all over the place to solve a murder or some other mysterious occurrence. It is really only the last part of the second half of this movie that is really funny.   When the film switched from adventure stories to horror it worked, because it added some freshness to the old fashioned genre.  The actors did a very good job in bringing all these old-timey characters to life, and it makes for a good scare.  However, there is a serious flaw in the first half and it is really hard to see past it.  I found it very difficult to understand how the "real" characters who were in the stories were killed, because the "new" characters in these stories don't seem to be the same people.  There is one old woman (Patricia Neal) who, after the death of her husband, gets haunted by a ghostly voice that says, "you don't believe in ghosts?"  This is the first time we have seen a ghost in a movie and there are only a couple people around who know what it is and who can believe.  It's a big problem because the whole movie could be just a bunch of ghost stories.  This could have been solved by having an extra scene that was set during the "good" parts of the old-style tales and the ghosts wouldn't have appeared.  A nice suggestion.  The second half starts off in a slightly different way and is mostly set in the present day.  But there is more mystery and suspense here, especially in the scene when a woman (Pamela Elizabeth) meets her husband's murderer, and learns that he had already been dead for twenty years before his daughter found him dead.  So it turns out that this man was the murderer who was caught and tried for the murder many years ago, but was acquitted because he was too sick to stand trial.  Unfortunately, there isn't much suspense in this part of this film because we don't really learn what happened and we don' t really get a true story of how the murderer got away with it. Â  Â  There are some great "real life" characters here, but none of them seem to have any real depth.  If you can't figure out who the bad guy is in this case, then this movie isn't for you.  We meet two more old-world characters in the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie, but I have to give it four stars because its the type of movie that everyone seems to think is great, except its not.   The actors did a great job.  Unfortunately, the dialogue and action was just really bad.  The plot was ridiculous and the humor seemed like they were all just playing off each other.  I would give this one a 2 or a 3 because I didn't think it was going to be as good as I thought it would be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has a great story line, and a very good performance by the lead actor, who really took the role on the chin. The movie is very original, as it deals with the aftermath of a war with very unusual rules and regulations.   A very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember when I was a kid, this movie was soo big and everyone on the street knew the plot of the movie. Then when I got older, I couldn't find the movie anywhere. I remember there was a TV version of this movie, but I don't think it was ever remade. The last time I saw it, I got to see this movie on my very first day of college.   The actors were all so good.  This movie was made in the 80s so there is some nostalgia to it.  For the young and old, this is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in the theater this night. First time seeing this movie and it had me smiling as I remembered the story. I was a little worried about the fact that my first movie ever was about a kid and his dog but it wasn't. It was all the little things the kid said like: "I will show you the right way" and "you're my best friend" that got me thinking of what it's like being a little kid and I loved every minute of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best film ever made.   This film is like nothing you have seen before.  The story is just as exciting as any Hollywood blockbuster, yet it still feels very real.  It's just as good if not better than all the other great action films in the past decade.  This is the first time I've seen a film so intense that it's hard to look away from the screen.  There are so many twists and turns, you really have no idea what's going to happen next.  My only complaint is that the film is missing an epic, over the top finish that could have really made this film the most memorable.  I highly recommend this film and to those who haven't seen it, give it a go!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Crimson Tide"    This is one of the first movies I have ever seen on cable TV when I was a kid, and I loved it. It was one of those movies where you really felt like you were in the middle of the ocean and watching something that really made you feel like you should go and help people by going and saving some of them.   The soundtrack was amazing as well as the cinematography and writing of the story.  The acting was outstanding.  My brother and I watched this together, and it gave us a really good feeling as if we were there together.  I have since seen it again when I had time and it is a great movie.  This movie will always be one of my favorites.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a good watch.  The way it is set up, it is like a crime drama with a twist.  A big city detective, John Munch (William Powell) is asked to go back to the old city, where he worked in his early police days, to search for some missing kids.  While there, he uncovers an organization that is kidnapping little girls for ransom.  But, he discovers that the organization is a part of a government conspiracy involving the CIA and a rogue agency called The Black Dahlia.  It is all a mystery.   It has a good cast with a strong, believable, lead.  Powell is good at playing a policeman, but you can't get enough of Munch's sarcastic yet caring side.  And the story is cleverly told.  For someone as smart as Munch, he has some very bad decisions to make.  If you haven't seen a good old Hollywood crime drama, and you like the genre, it's a good one to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't the best and it's not going to top the other zombie films out there but it has its charm.   When you think of a good zombie movie and you think "zombieman" you don't think of the cool zombie looking dude with the cool hat, but of the shambling undead. And the shambler does it better than most.  In this movie the characters were really well done. The actors were all in top shape. The scenery is nice and the movie moves along at a good pace. I'm a zombie fan and this movie was really well made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was given a copy of this movie as part of a package that included a couple of old films. I was so enthused by this film, I quickly bought the complete set, and have watched it on a weekly basis ever since. There are so many things going on here, I can't possibly go into it all, but I will share what I think is a few of the highlights: - The cinematography is beautiful. The film has such a wonderful look about it, that makes you want to turn the volume up on your speakers. - The acting is wonderful. This film is full of great characters, and even though I've seen this film several times, I've never tired of watching these actors play them. They are always so different, and very relatable. The main characters are so realistic, and there's an innocence and care about them that makes it easy to relate to. - This is a film of life, and you can tell that these people are doing their best, and doing what they love. They will go through some hardships, but it's all done with a smile on their face. - I love that there is a lot of violence in this film. I always like that, and that's what makes it so great. The only thing that I found annoying was that the movie didn't really go after the kids who hurt them so much. They weren't as good as the adults, but that's not to say they aren't good people. - Overall, this is a very good movie, with some great characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you want a "good" movie, don't bother with the remake. The first one, from 1973, had some great performances and is an excellent example of the style of the time, where a gang of toughs are forced to do their duty on an isolated island where they have their own language, rules, and culture. This one is a little more recent and has a great script and some terrific performances from the gang of criminals. They take it more seriously and have much more acting chemistry than the original, even though it looks a lot like the original.    This movie is fun to watch and has some pretty great moments in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a very good one, it tells the story of an elderly man who lost his life while trying to retrieve a dog that was left to die on a train in the snow. This is the story from the beginning of the movie. The train was going over a hill and a man fell down and died. We never find out what happened to him. The elderly man got up and went to the nearest farm. He found his dog, and when he got home, the family told him that they didn't want to bring him back to the farm. So he started the road back, and never came home again.    It is a movie that shows us how cruel humans can be, and shows that love can overcome all things.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't find this movie to be much of a comedy.  The movie itself is funny enough. I didn'st find it funny to be completely honest.  What kept it from being a comedy is the character of Mr. McElroy. Mr McElroys acting was really weak.  He seemed to think that he was going to be a comedic character and that's what he really became.  For the last 15 minutes of the movie he got in some awkward and embarrassing situations.   The first 30 minutes or so was good.  McElory was annoying.  It's not that he's just a bad actor. He's got some really bad acting skills.  I was trying to figure out why he would say and do such dumb things.  My favourite part was when he talks to his friend and tells him that he'll have to go on his diet.  That part was good   Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As usual, David Lean does a very fine job at portraying a war on two fronts.   The action sequences are real and effective, and the war scenes are not only interesting, but also beautifully done.  Unfortunately, the film suffers from a bit of bad writing that makes the film seem more like a training film for the French Navy than a film about the war itself.  The French Navy never shows up on screen, and it is unclear whether they did participate in the battle or not, even though the film does not show French ships in the area at the time of the battle.  This scene of the Battle of Agincourt in the film is quite amusing and makes for some very interesting viewing.  There is a long sequence in the middle of the film where the French are running from a group of British tanks and cavalry.  At one point, one of the French officers, an old man named Guillaume (Maurice Chevalier) is captured by a British officer and the camera cuts to a closeup of Guillaum's bloody face and he exclaims "The British have made me a prisoner!"  The camera then zooms out to show that the British soldier is standing over the old man and pointing at him.  While this sequence is funny, it also makes me very uncomfortable and causes me to wonder what the Frenchman was doing in that particular place at that time.  In the end, it is not a problem as it seems the British did not even realize what had happened to Guillaumen, but I do hope that the filmmakers did an extra take to make this scene seem more plausible.  I give the movie a B-.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an underrated classic.  It was written by the great writer, Howard Hawks.  He created the perfect storm when he set this in New Orleans,  filled with music,  social strife and violence.  The main character was very complex and believable.  His mother was a prostitute and he was born in the slums of New Orleans.  Even the police were corrupt and the city was in a bad state when the film was made.  This film is a great example of social realism and great film making.  I still watch it as an example of how black characters are portrayed in films.  All the actors in this movie are great.  Their performances were great and the ending is just perfect.

I remember seeing this on the big screen. The reviews I have read were not very positive. But this movie is so good. It has everything a movie like this should have. It's a great mix of humor, action and horror. A great movie. The only negative thing I can say is that the opening and ending credit sequences aren't so great. And the ending is probably one of the most disappointing endings I have ever seen. But I have seen worse. I highly recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this at the Toronto Film Festival, and loved it. It has great character depth and a great performance.   As for the story, it is actually a sequel to The Shining.  A couple of years after the events of the first film, we follow Danny (Jack Nicholson) and Wendy (Sandra Bullock) as they attempt to rescue their daughter.  This movie has a wonderful feeling of innocence, which was extremely refreshing in this more recent horror/psychological thriller.  The characters are very complex and have an extremely interesting back story to them.  It is so easy to care for these characters, and this movie captures that very well.  I can highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a real good horror film.

There is so much blood, and the film takes place in a desert in South America, which I loved.  The actors are so believable that you believe them, it is the best film I've seen in years.

There's a beautiful scene with a very large waterfall as the hero and his girl cross it.  And then he falls, and the girl comes up to save him.  When they finally land in a cave, they find the cavemen guarding the gold, and they're killed by the woman's father.  The story is about how the woman must decide how much she will fight to save the boy, so she must make all the decisions for him. The movie is pretty much made up of these small decisions, which is exactly what the story needs.  I like that the heroine, who's been living in this remote town all her life, is forced to confront all these obstacles.  -James W. Farrell
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this film is well-written and the production is top notch. I enjoyed the film for its comedy and the acting. I wish that they had put a bit more effort into the scenes that were supposed to be a comedy. The film did not have the dramatic tension that other films had (most of which were made in the '70s). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie to watch if you want to see some pretty good, mature action movies.   This film isn't about anything in particular other than the guns. If you really enjoy good action movies, this one will tickle your funny bone.  The action in this film is a lot better than the sequels, but it is still pretty well done.  If you love guns, this is a very good film to check out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only way to describe this movie is in one word: Demented.  What I mean is this: all you can see of the characters are in black and white, and when you get to see them, you get a sense of what's going on, and what's happening to them.  This is what I have seen in a movie in a long time, and it's really quite scary.   This movie will have you on the edge of your seat, but not for the wrong reasons.  It's a really well-written, suspenseful movie.  The writing and directing is great, and if you're a horror fan, this movie should be on your list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie a lot of times and it's always a nice time and I'm always looking forward to it.   It's a very funny comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie so much I am re-watching it on repeat. The story was so well paced and the actors (who I thought were terrific) were all fantastic in their respective parts. It was hard to believe the movie took a little over one hour to shoot.   It's definitely on my must watch list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had an opportunity to see the movie before it was released and I can't remember much, but it had some interesting things in it: an awesome cast, amazing music, and some really funny acting.   If you have some friends that like to do stupid things, then they'll love this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like The French Connection.   The whole movie is set in a hotel that is the scene of one of the largest drug rings in the world.  While most of it takes place in a super fancy hotel with plenty of high priced food, this is where the action takes place.  The movie is not a must see, but it is very entertaining.  One thing you have to watch for is the famous "Shake it off".  I do not remember the exact line, but at one point, a man in a wheelchair is standing by the phone looking at his son. The wheelchair person shakes it off, so the son is back to normal. Â  I guess some people might find it strange to see a guy in a handicap chair on the phone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie isn't a movie that can really be called "good" or "bad".  It's just a movie, with a bad story.   The bad story is the only thing that keeps it from being a "complete" and interesting movie.  It does have some cool shots and sequences that make it look like a real "drama".  Unfortunately, the movie is way too long and too boring to be a "comic book" or a movie about a "movie".    What the movie needs is some sort of "movie" that it can be a real adventure story. Like a movie like "Fatal Attraction" where you see a real story about a movie. I've watched that movie many times and think it is pretty awesome.  Maybe it's time for a movie to be made with real life and real actors playing real life characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie twice in the last year, and once was the best movie I have ever seen. I was a little hesitant about this movie at first, because the trailer had a creepy feeling to it, but it is all just made up to make the movie more entertaining. The best part of this movie is the acting. The movie is full of great performances, like that of Christopher Lloyd who plays the evil Mr. Hyde. In this movie he is an actor playing himself. The way he is portrayed is what makes this movie so much more entertaining than most. I also like that the movie has a strong and original message to it. I think the movie is also a great lesson in how to live. You should never let your guard down in a situation like this one. You have to be able to be yourself and be honest with yourself. I thought the movie was worth it, and it will be remembered as one of the best horror movies ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a good story about a tough guy. He has all the rights to say "I am the best" but only the truth is heard.  It would be better to listen to the radio, the news, the newspaper, the magazines or a book about the Vietnam war.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a little shocked at the high ratings this movie gets. In truth it is not very good. It has some decent acting but some weak plot elements and a very lame ending. My first time seeing this movie and it gave me chills. The first part of the movie is a bit hard to watch and it really is a shame because there is some good acting here. I was shocked to find out that the plot isn't very good either.  I hope that the director will do some editing and make this movie better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really impressed with the acting by the main characters.   A strong performance from each one!   The movie is set in England during the early 1900's and it's a great period to tell a story like this.  The characters are all well developed.  In addition to the main male characters, there are several minor characters that get some screen time.  Some of the little characters do get some good scenes, but the movie never gets into deep enough to really learn more about them.  I also liked that the movie takes the time to introduce some of the more minor characters before they get into the main plot.  A fun way to tell the story! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good story told with great production value and a very good screenplay by William Goldman. The story is one of the best ones ever written in Hollywood. The characters are complex and the plot makes sense.   I love this movie.  A must see for anyone interested in the true story of the outlaws who made the West their home.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was great, but it would have been so much better if the actors had a stronger dialogue in the scenes where they were talking. In the movies, when the actors talk, you get this weird sort of movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason to see this film is if you like sci-fi and horror. It has a very good story, as well as some very well done special effects, as the story focuses on a group of people who were infected by a virus, that makes people see dead people.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was really good, I really enjoyed it, and I enjoyed watching it a lot. The writing and the acting is great, and there are some really funny lines, it's really good to see.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not have an idea what to expect when I decided to watch this movie. I really liked the movie. The actors were really good. I think it would have been really fun to be in the movie if it had been made during the 60's. It looked amazing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "We are the survivors, we are the heroes."   From a movie that doesn't go for gore and extreme violence and goes for the gritty, realistic story of a group of people struggling to survive in a devastated world and all the bad things that may happen in their path.   And I love how it comes together as a film with the right balance of suspense and comedy.  It's an excellent film and one of the best I've seen since "Tombstone." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Saw...The movie is as it should be; a good thriller with a good twist. If you are looking for a movie with a nice plot and good suspense then this one is for you." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â This movie was very well done. It is a good mystery thriller with a very good acting team. I have seen this movie once before on tv and loved it.   I do not know if it is because of my childhood but this movie was pretty damn good for its time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first heard about The Hunger Games movie, I never dreamed it would be as good as it was. The story was interesting, the characters were well done, and the direction was top notch. The acting was good, and I loved Katniss's portrayal of the young girl on the path to becoming the future leader of a nation. The songs were amazing. This movie will always have a special place in my heart.    I highly recommend this movie to fans of the novels. The Hunger games is easily one of my favorite books to watch. It's a great action/thriller movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this on a Sunday and it was pretty amazing. It was really well made and it made me think about the people in the movie. They were very relatable. I'd recommend it for anyone who likes a good thriller or thriller-like movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So I read this book before watching The Dark Knight Rises and it made me go into the movie thinking I was watching a bad Batman movie. What I found was a fantastic film. The writing in this movie was excellent. The characters were well-written. The acting was amazing. The cinematography was wonderful. There was so much action going on that it was hard to tell what was happening. I never thought Batman was going to beat the Dark Knight, but he did and we all were happy for him. What more could you want? This movie makes me love the Batman so much more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a must see. It will change your view on how we view the world and will give you an insight into why people need to watch the movie and not let it get in the way of life. I wish I would have seen it years ago and I would be an educated, better educated person. This is the perfect film to put you to sleep as you watch it for a while.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie with my cousins. We had not seen this movie together before so it was nice to do this movie alone. We all loved this movie. It had great performances and amazing plot. The story was well executed and was an entertaining watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great adaptation of a great novel, with a great cast, and terrific direction.   The story revolves around a gang of four criminals who take their victim's stolen money, while leaving him with a $10,000 bounty.  I thought it was very well shot, and the villains were both scary and charismatic.  The movie was also a bit confusing, but the characters were all well portrayed.  When I saw the trailer, I was a bit skeptical, but this is a great adaptation.  If you are into the "whodunit" kind of movies, this is for you.  This movie really impressed me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a strange way, "Fruitvale Station" seems to be a love story in reverse, with the young man (played by Oscar Isaac) as the hero. There are some moments of good-natured ribbing, and the love story at its heart is not without charm. Isaac is an actor with a natural ease and talent, and he makes every character seem a real human being. Isaac's character, an Oakland native named Amos, is a drug dealer who is desperate for a change. He runs into a young woman, played by Kate Winslet, on the street, and as he talks to her, she explains the importance of a clean life, and why she is willing to risk a car crash to get it. As the story goes on, Amos and the girl become involved in an epic battle with the police for freedom. (In fact, it is not always clear how the police are able to keep the two apart, and what happens to them afterward.) I enjoyed seeing the love interests interact, as their relationship is so complex, and their fates seem so intertwined. Winslet has an amazing beauty, and Isaac is a fine actor in a difficult role. (The best scene in the film is when Amos's father, played with a kind of ghoulish charm by Ray Wise, takes a bullet and survives -- with a little help from Winslet's character.) Isaac and Wise's characters, and others in the cast, are very well written, and are filled with great dialogue. The music in the movie, mostly from the 1960s, is also well done. "F Fruitvale Station," written and directed by Ryan Coogler, is the kind of film you might find on Netflix if you like a good action film with a lot of fun dialogue.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty good. This is a family movie, but it is also more fun than I expected. The dialogue is well done, and there is enough action to keep you wanting to see more. I did not find the violence to be very graphic, but that could be my age. The children are not too young to be given realistic consequences for their actions.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is a little slow, but this kind of thing is OK. The movie deals with a little bit of a paranormal/mystical/psychological angle which has no business to be treated in a thriller genre, but it does it very well, and it is handled well.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a must see for fans of the original film. This movie takes the plot and characters of the film, and adds some new twists to the story.   There is only one minor fault I have to say.  In the beginning of the movie, when the two main characters are at the hotel, we see a black and white picture of a young woman on the wall of a room. We do not hear a name, but the picture is obviously the woman's face. It looks like she is sleeping on the bed.  The man and the girl go upstairs to check on the woman, and in the movie it seems that they are in a bedroom.  It is later revealed that the woman is in a different room, sleeping on a floor that is not a bed. This was the only minor flaw that bothered me a little, but it does not detract from this great film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a great movie. A really great movie! A fun story and a great ending! It had some great moments like the one when they went out for a swim and saw the penguin. A funny, funny ending. If I could have seen the movie again it would be perfect.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as this film is concerned, I think it's a good, decent film and I have no complaints at all. I think that it could be better. I've seen worse movies, but this is better than a lot of them. I do have some nitpicking to do, but I'll come back to it.   I'm happy that this movie made so much money and I really hope that it does well.  The movie was directed by Peter Bogdanovich and the cast were good. This is a really good movie and I highly recommend it. I also would like to add that, as with most of the other Bogdanov movies I've enjoyed, this was a terrific story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best way I can describe this movie is that it's a "lost in the woods" adventure that's about a kid who gets lost in the forest and has to find his way home (he did it just by walking around)   If you're looking for a kid's adventure that shows a child's imagination, but also has a good story to it, then look no further.   "The Lost Boy" is an entertaining movie that definitely has a unique charm to it that you won't find in a lot of kids movies these days.  It was a very different kind of adventure than I've seen, and it really shows that the director of this movie (Paul Weitz) knows exactly what he's doing, even though the movie is rated R. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was able to watch this on a Sunday morning and after sitting through a movie the night before I found myself really enjoying this one. The plot was the perfect combination of suspenseful, funny, and heart pounding. I am a sucker for a suspense movie, and this one just gets me every time.   A good cast and director kept the film fresh.  The pacing was perfect, and the ending was just enough to make the film great.  A must see!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie and am glad that it got made. The plot is really good and the acting is perfect. There are a lot of great scenes in this movie which make you want to watch it over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think there was ever any doubt that this was going to be a huge hit. It made a lot of people who wouldn't have seen the movie before happy enough to check it out. The acting is really strong all around, with James Woods and David Niven being the standouts. The writing is terrific. There are some really good surprises in the film which keep things fresh.   Some of the best stuff is in the final scene where the gang is all playing golf. The ending is perfect, but not easy to swallow. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a "must see". It has everything: suspense, violence, adventure, sex and suspenseful scenes.   I always enjoyed the way the film used various actors (including Dennis Hopper as a drug dealer) to bring a sense of realism to a "superhero" story.  I think the director did a very good job of making the action very realistic and real.  There are some scenes where it looks like a stunt man is hanging from the ceiling.  One of the best sequences is when the "heroes" make a heist and go out in a limo!   It would be hard for me to think of another film that can have as much action as this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had the pleasure of seeing this film during the run of The Magnificent Seven. It's a great film and one that is not too often mentioned as a must see.   The film has a great ensemble cast, a great soundtrack, and one of the best and most action packed film ever made. Â I really liked this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never watched a movie with a great performance in a role likeÂ  James Caan in this movie. He is just great. He really brings out the heart of the main character, who is a former army man named Bob Gomie (Kevin Kline). The movie itself is really well made, with great characters, good acting, and good scenery.   The one thing that really ruined this movie was the poor acting by the young people. I think this movie is more about the characters and the storyline than about the acting.  A lot of people talk about the great story line, but the acting was so bad that it ruined the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great romantic comedy about a woman who was a maid in a very different time and a woman trying to find her place in a new one. The film is wonderful, well done and with great acting and direction. The screenplay has a wonderful style and writing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of The Fast and the Furious series and this film was pretty awesome.   The cars are all awesome and this one really is a work of art.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was funny, heartwarming and an entertaining story that I really enjoyed. I enjoyed this movie so much that I am planning on watching it again. I highly recommend this film for fans of horror and fantasy. The plot is fairly simple and it made me feel really sorry for the killer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie of the summer.   I have watched it 3 times now.  I love this movie. Â I just can't believe that it's already out.  My husband and I were driving home and had to stop for gas.  When we arrived, we stopped at the Shell gas station.  We didn't get out of the car until the attendant started to give out directions.  They showed us where to go, then got out to get some fuel, but they didn't stop.  She came back and said, "What's the matter? Why aren't you paying attention?"   They were so busy, I almost passed out. I was so happy.  Â    Now I've seen it many times.  The only reason I kept coming back was to see those cars drive by.  That's when it really got my attention. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie, it has a great vibe about it, and the characters are all great.  I liked the soundtrack too.    The only thing that I didn't like was the film's ending, it didn't really make me angry or disappointed, but it was kind of a let down. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am so happy that they made a sequel. They have the same amazing actors and actresses in it, but I love the original movie because it was such an action packed time.   For me, this movie made me fall in love with those actors!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was really good, I loved it. I can watch this movie over and over again, I highly recommend it. It has great characters and an excellent plot. A good story to tell.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching this film back in the late 80s when it came out and really loved it. It was about a young guy who goes to a school for kids who are autistic, and he's the only kid who talks (or is capable of talking) but he has some pretty funny moments.   This film got some pretty good reviews back in 1988.  It also has some excellent performances by some fantastic actors like Bill Paxton, Bruce Willis, and Bruce Willis' brother David.  This movie is a classic that I'd recommend for everyone to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is fun, and I really enjoyed the cast.   I was expecting a good horror movie, but this one takes it to a whole other level.  For starters, the acting is great.  The actors do a great job bringing this movie to life.  I felt they were all likeable people.  There is definitely some gore in the movie, and you have to be careful to not miss anything.  They also did a good job of making the "monster" scary.  This movie is very intense and scary, and it's worth a watch.  If you have not seen this movie, you should go see it, or if you are someone who has seen it and enjoyed it, you can always watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite scene is the car chase on the freeway. The film makes you feel like you're on top of the world, even with the music.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best film of the year in my book. This movie is great! Great acting, amazing effects and great plot. The story about the little girl in the attic in the 60s, and her relationship with the boys in the 40s. This film is just amazing and has a great vibe. This is my favorite film from 2001 and maybe in the entire series.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been wanting to see this movie ever since I first heard about it. This movie is a bit different from the usual "hero with great powers" type of movies. This is more a superhero story with some super powered people in it. It does feel like it is a little different because of the way they handled it. You really feel like you are seeing a different kind of superhero movie. I don't really know what else to say that wasn't already said about the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. The characters are well drawn and the acting was great.   There was no sexual tension, it was more a friendship/romance/love story. The only thing that could have made the movie better would have been if they had gotten the right actors to play the right roles, but the ones they got did a good job. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was so excited to see this movie when I heard about it. After the disappointment of "Jurassic Park" I thought that Spielberg might try to make a real masterpiece out of a story he had already done.   It was a movie I felt was well made and entertaining.  It reminded me a lot of the "Back to the Future" films because they both had a great cast and a plot that was easy to follow.  I thought it would be a little confusing for the audiences but I guess the director was just too good at the writing to make that mistake.  Even though this film was not as good as the first one it was still fun and very well done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â This movie is a beautiful film, filled with emotion and beautiful landscapes.   It is an experience you won't forget. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen the movie more than twice. It's a pretty good one.   This movie is about an aging actress (Sandra Dee) who's going through a rough patch. She comes to her friend, (Crispin Glover), and asks him to help her out with a job. The job is to make some kind of music for a new movie. They get into a fight about whether the music will be a hit or a flop. After she blows him off and walks away he gets a letter from her saying she's going to Hollywood. He drives to Hollywood but she's already there. They go to the studio and talk about the project. He's given the script and an advance but when they arrive, they realize the movie's not going to work. They have to start over on a new project.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fun action movie with a strong villain. I think that the villain is the best part about this film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the beginning, I wasn't going to like the movie. It felt like a generic sci-fi flick with generic characters and a generic setting. The whole thing was just too much for me. But once I got started, I had to watch it. I just had to.   I think the reason I got into the movie is because I had been thinking a lot about the end of my relationship. I was always getting back together with the girl I dumped. I mean, we were in different times. So it was weird to watch a man who I thought I really wanted end up getting married to someone else.  Â  The movie gives you the opportunity to learn about both sides of the situation, and to watch as a couple comes to terms with how they will live together for the rest of their lives.  To me, the movie captures a good marriage very well, and shows how a couple really comes together as a team, instead of just being two people fighting over each other.  I've been thinking about this movie for years and years, and still haven't gotten through it. It is definitely one of my all time favorite movies, and I don't think I could ever really get over it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is good. It is not as good as I remember, but it is good nonetheless.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite movies and is a good follow-up to the fantastic "Escape From New York".   It is very well done.   The music was great.  The only thing that I wish was changed was the scene where we are shown a picture of the plane that crashed at the end of the movie.  It would have been interesting to see the plane and what it would have looked like from the ground.  In the movie the plane was seen from a very high angle so it would be easy to see what the plane looked like and could have been a great addition to the movie if that part had been done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was the second time I saw this movie and for the first time I really enjoyed it. I love the way they have the children be little kids and all play games at the same time, with each person using different types of language and talking about different things. This was definitely the perfect ending for the movie and I'm glad that they were able to end the movie on such a good note. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was only at the film for about 30 minutes, but was completely mesmerized by it. It's a modern take on the classic tale, with a very dark, psychological and dramatic touch. The acting is really excellent and the film is completely well done. I love that there are no cheap jump scares and the pace really keeps the film from getting boring. The plot is complex and even though I didn't get it, I was very interested in what it would be like to meet these people in this world.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very enjoyable movie and is full of comedy and great characters. I just hope they get a sequel soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film was amazing, just watch it! The story was good, the acting was good and so was the soundtrack. It had so much going on in it, and it really has a great ending. I would watch it over and over again. The acting and the story really made this film a great one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The main reason why I enjoyed this movie is that this was a good thriller. It was well done and gave me many great action scenes.  It reminded me of a John Carpenter movie where you can tell there is a lot of planning on how to finish off the bad guys.  This is not for everyone but you really need to watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've enjoyed almost all of the Tom Cruise movies, including Mission Impossible and Top Gun. This is one of his best and most enjoyable to date. The best aspect about it is that all the actors are really good. It's obvious that the producers made sure that everyone was getting the most out of their talents and skills.   The acting is on a much higher level than I've ever seen Cruise do. It comes off like a good acting class or even a full on audition. He's very well developed and it shows.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was so excited to get this movie that I spent so much time thinking about it. The acting was so fantastic, and it was so sad that this movie didn't get made into a TV series or something.    It has a lot of great acting, great set pieces, and beautiful cinematography. I'd really like to see an American TV show about this guy.  I don't even understand how he can get away with what he does to his women.

I love it when the characters come together on screen and it really makes you love them. This is a movie that I highly recommend. It does have a few weak parts but it is still enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best sci-fi I've seen in a very long time. I've always been a sucker for time travel stories, and I was pleasantly surprised by this film, which has some incredible actors in it. Great visuals, good direction, and good writing all make this film worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My boyfriend and I took a trip to LA last year and got to see two movies there: "Fantastic Mr. Fox" and "Bad Santa." These are both great movies and I loved them. We were both excited to go and I remember feeling like they were movies that we had seen a thousand times before.    I didn't think I would like them, but I did. They are both very funny and very entertaining.  A couple of the jokes are so old they feel like they could've been made the day before. But they are still funny.  "FANTASTIC MR. FOX" is a very silly movie. There is a great little story here about a fox who is the king of the animals, but he needs a new set of clothes and a house and some help from the humans in the town. I love this movie.  And, "BAD SANTA" is just as silly. A small boy is trying to scare Santa with a giant monster, and it just isn't working.  It is a fun movie with very good acting and great writing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. It was well made, with wonderful performances by the cast, and it was funny, too. The humor was very well put together. The acting was good, and the humor was always funny. It would have been better if it had been a more serious film, like a Martin Scorsese movie, but there's nothing wrong with a silly movie like this, so I'll forgive that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies of the year that also happened to be a film of the summer.   A great mix of humor and action, it is a great little movie.  A little bit lighter on the sex and violence than the recent films of the directors of this genre, but the film has some very funny and great moments.  The character development, the action and the humor make this a great action film.  If you are looking for a good time, this is a good place to go.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A really good, if slightly too "simple" spy thriller with a terrific supporting cast, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is fun, and well-acted.   The action is great, and the plot is well-constructed.  A brilliant, if somewhat silly, concept. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoy this movie a lot! It's been a while since I've seen this type of movie and I love how it is so different. It doesn't make fun of anything like it's contemporaries, it's realistic. I think it shows that we aren't always what we seem. I love the use of color, especially in the night scenes. I really don't think it was meant to be serious or scary, but it definitely made you question everything.   - Good movie  - It's scary but it's a fun watch - It has some good effects - Some nice performances  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film at the Cinema Guild in 1981 and never missed it. If you have never seen a movie by Stanley Kubrick and want a glimpse into his oeuvre, this film is a must.   The first half of the film shows the crew of the Enterprise as they are preparing for a deep space mission to take place in the heart of the alien world known as the Kreetassan Nebula. Â   The ship is docked in a small starport which is home to a little girl who lives with her mother. The parents are being attacked by a hostile race of aliens known as Ch'thr. Â  This film is an action film at heart. Â  The crew takes on a variety of aliens, all of whom are portrayed in excellent costumes and makeup. Â  Â  The action sequences are very exciting and the creatures look awesome in the film. Â  While the story is more than entertaining, it isn't terribly deep. Â  One interesting aspect to the film is the alien race of Ch'terr. Â  They are extremely tall with human like heads and human like bodies. Â  Their leader is a chubby man that has an extremely large head. Â  His name is G'Kar. Â  He is the leader of the Ch'thrd and the one who rules his people. Â  It would have been interesting to see more about his people and their beliefs. Â  Although the plot is extremely basic, it still manages to leave a lasting impression on the audience. Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like a lot of other people, I bought this film on DVD because I had heard such good things about it, but didn't know it was on DVD. I think the only problem with it is that there is a lot in the story that is unnecessary or confusing, or has nothing to do with the plot.  I'm sorry that I didn't get to see this earlier, but as a movie about two guys who fall in love, I think it would have been better without the extra scenes.   Recommended only for people who like action and romance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is in black and white and the camera never pans. It never looks like it is panning at all. It is just there as a lens through which the film is shown. There is no other sound except for a distant wailing in the background. This gives it a claustrophobic effect. The actors are good, and some of them do not even know who they are, much less why the director is showing them this and that. The film's title should have been "The Silence of the Silent World".   I was shocked at the end of this film.   It was not only disturbing, but very funny, and very realistic.  The music was excellent and I love it when film makers create songs for their films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A pretty good movie with great special effects.  It is not very good in plot but the actors are excellent and very good, and this is the kind of film that has a sense of reality that most of the movies are lacking these days.   I think I have seen most of these kind of movies at one point or another and they are all too fake in the plot.  I have always enjoyed this movie and now that I am a bit older and wiser I can really appreciate it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pretty bad.  I got it as a special on VHS for my father when he was young.  It's a pretty good movie for kids.  There are a lot of bad things going on with this movie, but it still entertains.  This is a movie you shouldn't get unless you like bad movies or you're a big fan of bad movies.  The acting is really bad and the story is bad. This is not a good horror movie.  If you're in to bad horror movies, this is not for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoy action movies like I do, you will love this film. I've seen the trailer a dozen times and still it is the best trailer for the film.Â  The movie is very entertaining. This is the first movie that I have seen where you do not feel like you are watching a rehash of some sort. There are plenty of familiar faces and action to keep you guessing and entertained.Â  One thing that surprised me is the level of technical skill of the stunt men, but it is not distracting. The fight scenes in the movie were very well choreographed and very intense. The way the stuntmen hit the car is impressive and it gives the film a very gritty look to it. The camera work is great. The cinematography of this film is very slick and detailed. I cannot wait to see this movie when it is in release.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I've watched the first season of the show Â and I've always enjoyed it, even though the shows usually seemed a little "fluffy". This is very similar, but a little less silly and a little more mature. I love that these guys didn't just play themselves and had some real chemistry together.   - I like the characters, especially Dr. Strangelove himself. Â If there had been a bit more of an emphasis on the war, this would be a 10 out of 10.  - The production values are top notch, and I especially like the "realistic" effects for the atomic bomb scenes.  A solid little movie that is a little offbeat, but not boring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen this movie in theaters at a film festival. It looked good and it had a great cast. My friend said it was worth the ticket price so I bought a ticket. I wasn't disappointed. I loved it and loved the action and comedy. It had great action scenes and great acting. I was amazed at how much of a professional the actors were.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is probably my favorite movie of all time.    The acting is excellent, and this film shows us a whole new side of the Hollywood stars.  I was always a fan of Tom Cruise when he was a young, cocky, handsome actor, but he's really become a man in his later years and this is a great example of it.  Cruise plays a man who was a star in his own life and now has to deal with the consequences of his actions.  This film also explores some very dark topics, such as adultery, and drug use, and it does a great job of capturing the chaos and desperation of those who are affected by it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this movie was good. My main problems were the pacing, which is a major problem for a horror movie. It was rushed, and the ending was not what I had expected, and also a bit too over the top. The acting and plot was really good though, and I thought it really showed that in this film that people could be so much worse than the monsters.    I enjoyed watching the movie. The music and the acting were top notch. It's not great, but the story is good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are so many people who say they like movies like this, but never see one of them.  The one they do see is a "filler" movie like so many "fatter" ones that came out in the 60's-70's.  I'm surprised that no one has done a remake of this classic yet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening scene is amazing.   I love the sound and the animation.  I didn't really know what to expect but i had high hopes and was pleasantly surprised.  The story has a very old school feel and i liked it.  It has a nice mystery and it's nice to see some romance.  A big problem with the movie was the music.  When they showed the trailer i thought it was bad. I can't get over how good the music is in the movie.  This movie had me excited. I just hope there is a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a great piece of cinematic art and is a worthy addition to a fine filmography.   In the summer of 1979, the producers of the American comedy film, Willy & Harriett, decided that they wanted to bring a new comedic spin on the story of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Their idea was to bring on a young and sexy star to play the role of young Charlie, the beloved pet pig of the eccentric and brilliant but short tempered Willy, played by Gene Wilder. The young, beautiful, and talented actress who would play Charlie, was none other than Jennifer Jason Leigh. Jennifer was an up-and-coming movie star at the time, and had never been in a big movie before. The producers were so impressed with her talents, that they offered her the role in their new comedy film.  The producers, who had heard that Willy and Charlie were both in love with the same woman (whom we will call Judy), decided to make a movie where the two would have to overcome the jealousy, and jealousies of each other.  They wanted the movie to be very funny, so they decided that the two characters would be portrayed by two girls, who would pretend to be Charlie and Judy (both of whom were named after themselves), and would work together to win the affection of each of their respective lovers.  In order to get Jennifer Jason to star in the movie, they first had to get her to agree to an audition.  Although Jennifer did not like the premise of the movie (it was about two girls who were in love, but who hated each other), she agreed to try out for the role. When she arrived at the studio, she found out that she was the only girl in the room.  When she explained why she was there, a producer said to her: "I think you will be just fine".  They had to convince her to go back and audition for the part again. She did.  At the audition, Jennifer was dressed like a young girl in a very revealing bathing suit.  One of the producers (who was also the lead actor in the comedy film) came up to her and said to Jennifer: "Now don't get the wrong idea, honey. This is not an audition for something like A Night at the Roxbury. The movie is going to be a comedy, and I'd like to see how you take this".  This wasn't an audition
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The ending of the movie was good.   This movie was fun.  Â After I got the hang of the way all the characters interacted, I enjoyed it.  I think that was because the movie is really short.  There was a short but cute romantic subplot about some little kid being adopted by a couple.  It was a nice change of pace.  Â  It was good because the acting was good, and the characters had personality.  This was just a fun way to watch a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to see the new Rocky Balboa movie in the movie theater and the theater was pretty full so I was surprised when the movie started and the opening credits were off and it said "no intermission" and I thought "oh great" the movie was boring. I thought to myself "why is this movie not going to show more of the fighting? I'm really not interested in seeing this movie again."  The fights looked terrible and the editing was all over the place. It was a really boring movie and I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was going to try to get a copy of this film on DVD but I decided to pass on it after seeing the trailer, I don't think I'm the right age for it but this is a fun flick. It's a buddy comedy in the 80s and has great characters and a lot of laughs. A great family film for those who like good movies and good laughs.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bfro from Funny, charming and touching I loved the trailer. The movie is one of my favorites, the characters are charming and the dialogue is funny. I think this movie is not available for home video. You could easily find this on DVD. The only thing I wish they would have included on the DVD was the credits at the end of the movie. This is a must have for any fans of this kind of movies.  and  Reviewer: lukas from Germany, Germany on 4/13/2011  I like the comedy in this movie, but I donÂ´t understand how they can say that they will get the cast together to do a new movie in 4 years. So the guy in the film, Michael Palin (The Misfits) and his wife are still living in London and he was only able to come back here for one day in a month? I mean come on, this man was in the movie "The Miser" so heÂ´s really popular. Anyway, I really like this movie and wish you guys would release it on DVD or Blu Ray. If you guys think about it you would have a lot more fun with this movie. IÂ´m sure this film would sell a lot if it was in color and not in black and white.

Reviewer: sf-movie-reviews - favorite favorite favorite - May 27, 2006  Subject: My Review I am not one for reviews, because I find it difficult to come up with anything worthwhile. This is one of those rare occasions where the film makes a real impression on me. I would say this is not one of the top 10 sci-fi movies ever made, but definitely top 5. I have no doubt that there are some of you out there who would agree.   I just found the fact that there is a woman and a man in space, on an unknown planet, together very, very exciting and exciting to watch. I enjoyed watching the aliens very much. It is also really interesting that we are able to tell so much about the aliens, but their faces are hard to read because of the lack of screen clarity.   It is a really good movie, and I loved it. - May in - May 26, 2006My Review  Topic: Star Trek: The Motion Picture  Source: Video   Audience: H  SOUNDS: D  VISUALIZATION: 5  PERFORMANCE: 5 AUDIENCE: H SOUNDS : D VISUALIZATION : 5 PERFORMANCY : 5 2 out of 2 stars, based on 2 ratings

I can only hope that this movie was made when it was made and not when the film was re-written to be something that was "for" the gay community. I love this movie so much.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen The Big Lebowski (1961) many times and am always fascinated by its portrayal of an old man who goes to the local bar to meet a new young lady. One of the many great things about this film is that it has a very simple, subtle message that is always in the mind of the viewer. This movie makes it easy to understand why alcohol makes people lose their minds. "It ain't like it used to be." And what better way to enjoy yourself than at the bar when you're older and still have a bit of fun with your friends? It doesn't take much to set a bad mood; just a drink or two, a couple of shots, and a few shots to finish the night.    Lyrics from the soundtrack: It ain't easy to be a rich man  Nowadays, a lot of people have everything they need  They have all the freedom in the world, but they want to live in a cage  I want it all, but I'll settle for it here  There is something I really want, and I don't want it just for myself  It's my way to be free and it's my kind of fun  Just let me out and I'll be like you  What are you looking for? Something I want that doesn't exist  You don't get it, you want it too much, you can't have it  So you give up and let me in  Like you do every day  With a big smile  The song ends with a line that sums up the essence of the movie: It's not easy to have a life, but it's a lot easier to have one in a bar.

It's a well written, well directed, and very well acted film. It has all the right elements to really hit your heart. The acting is top notch and there's a great amount of emotional development for the characters. The story line is pretty original. There are some neat twists and turns at the end that have never been done before. I'm really glad I finally saw this. I had seen so many good movies on TV and in movies, but now I can see them in a theatre. It was a great time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen so many good movies from the 1970's that I've lost track. This one was one of the better movies in my youth. The soundtrack was amazing.

I've seen a lot of different seventies movies and this is by far the best.

I even bought the cd for this movie because i thought the soundtrack would be awesome.    This movie is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at first a little skeptical of this movie. It is really strange, but if you put in some time and look at it more closely, you realize there's a lot more to it than it appears to be.   A small group of children were on their way home from school when they are attacked by a bear.  There's some sort of bear/human thing going on.  The kids are able to get away but there are still some nasty wounds. The movie does not seem to be making too much of a big deal out of it, though.

If, on the other hand, you want something a little darker, and more psychological, this isn't the movie for you too.   If you have never seen it, you may be surprised at how funny it can get.  I had to see this on DVD, because it is not available in theaters.

There's no need for subtitles since I would be able to understand everything just by listening to the movie.  This movie is worth every penny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A really nice and original movie, with really good performances.   It has a good mix of comedy, action, and drama.  The whole story is written very well, and the whole cast did a very good job.  It was written about ten years ago, and they have updated the movie to make it more contemporary, and to add some more drama, while keeping the classic feel.  There are some scenes, where a man who looks like Robert Duvall goes through a lot of pain, but he still looks very good.  I love how they used the original film to make their movie, and I hope they will continue to update it and make it great.  I recommend this movie to everyone, it has some great acting, and some very entertaining action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You will be amazed. This is a good picture. The acting is good, but the plot is not.   The scene in which the hero falls in love with a peasant girl was very romantic. I have seen many films where the heroine falls in Love with a man. I never saw such a scene, until I saw this film.  The most romantic part of the film is the wedding. I do like the romance of this film a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason it's a good film is because the plot was good, it kept the story from getting old or boring and it ended up being a really fun movie to watch. The actors do a good job in giving this movie the feel of an adventure movie.   "The Man from Another Place" is a story that will have you hooked all the way through to the very end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw this movie a while ago and I have never seen it before. It's very much a different movie from the other one. It has a different pace, a different way of making it, and the cast is good. The actress is great. The director is excellent. I think that this one is good for a different reason. I really thought that this is what John Huston wanted to do with his directing style. He went for a more romantic look, and that's why I think the movie is better than the other film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those who enjoyed this movie, I give it the 5 star rating.   I loved this movie. I feel like this is the last movie that could make me happy with the movies I watch.  It was fun for a kid's movie.  I really liked it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a HUGE Frank Miller fan and was excited to see a new story from him. He had been working on it for a while and I love his stories. I am glad that it was brought back to life and was worth the wait.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of a girl who is a little strange with an interesting outlook on life and the way she is brought up, and how the people around her are oblivious to that, was something that I enjoyed watching, it kept me interested throughout.   There is a lot of emotion in this movie, and the acting was great.  And although it is a pretty silly movie, it was also a very touching movie, if you can get past the weirdness of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is interesting and has a very well done ending. The performances are good and all of the actors do a good job.   I would recommend this movie to all lovers of sci fi and to anyone who enjoys action packed films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie quite a few times, and every time, it is a treat to watch it. There is not much story line to this movie, and the characters are very well written, but it is not a bad movie by any means.   This movie is one of my all time favorite comedies.  The movie stars a woman who is working in the field of cosmetics and makes her way to California with her boyfriend, but upon arrival she is struck with a disease that causes her to see things that are not there.  She is taken care of by a priest who is able to help her regain her senses and her memory.  If you are into comedies, you will enjoy this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After the huge disappointment of the first film, I was surprised at how much fun I had watching the second film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are in for a good time, this movie will blow you away. The performances from the cast are so funny and the movie itself is just so enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've watched this movie a few times now and am still impressed. I always remember the first time I watched it, when I was young. The old man with the beard was the most appealing thing about it. He was full of wisdom, wisdom that he shared from his own life, which is always fascinating to me. And he was really funny. Even now, when he's not around to enjoy it, I still think about that guy. This film was actually directed by William Friedkin, who directed Psycho (1960). But they made their own version. And I thought it was good. The director has obviously spent a lot of time working on the film and they have created something wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is an old favorite, and it's one of my favorites for many reasons. It's one that feels as real as it possibly could be.   The actors do a great job of portraying the many characters, the cinematography, and the music is really a pleasure to watch.  The writing is very simple and simple, but with an old-fashioned flavor that makes it very special.  It's always fun to watch a good old Western, and this one is no exception. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as a way to escape the monotony of life back at home and to make up for missing a day at work by seeing a different kind of movie. I don't like horror movies or any kind of violence at all. This movie wasn't as disturbing as other horror movies I have seen. I liked it for it's lightheartedness.   It's very good. I would recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have seen my reviews of many of Michael Mann's movies, this will come as no surprise. He has one of the most powerful and versatile acting styles in Hollywood, and this is another great example of his talents. Mann uses his amazing physical talents to convey the emotions of the main characters. The two leads, who play opposite each other and have opposite personalities, become very good friends, and when this happens, they have a lot of fun at one another's expense. This movie is more comedic than romantic, but it does a lot to establish a friendship between these two. There is plenty of action, a little bit of drama, and some laughs here and there, but none of the actors do anything particularly memorable. The movie just sort of rolls along.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this movie to be pretty entertaining and the whole cast was great.   It would probably be good to watch this movie with someone, as it has a good amount of dialog and is very funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've loved this movie so much, I'm very glad it came out today.   One thing that I thought was really cool about this film is that the ending was so cool, and it gave you so much closure.  But I love the fact that this film doesn't come at a time when the whole world is getting darker.  I think that's a good thing for it to come out at a point where people are enjoying themselves, and enjoying themselves is always a good sign.  If you enjoyed this film, then you'll probably enjoy some of the other films in the Alien series as well, or you might just watch the sequel "Alien vs. Predator", because that's the best Alien movie of the series.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this in theaters a year and a half ago, I loved the movie and still do. It has a bit of a cult classic feel about it. This is one of those films you watch for the soundtrack. That song is just so nice, a perfect choice.    The acting is great and the story is very well told, especially the relationship between Paul and Susan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I would like to say that I am very happy with my purchase and I really enjoyed it. My favorite part of the movie is when the police officer who is the lead character, makes his way through the ghetto and sees a large crack house. He calls out to his partner and says to stop and not to move or he will shoot. He walks up to the crack house and asks the owner if he is alright and tells him that he is just taking a look at the house and not hurting anybody. He then proceeds to walk inside the crackhouse and see that the person who lived there is on the floor. The owner tells him to go ahead and shoot him but the officer says that he has to have a good reason to shoot someone. The guy then says he has a gun and says that this is not the place to have it in. The police officer then shoots the man twice in the face and the man is dead. The man who was shot is a young boy who was just 12 or 13 years old.   The main character is a very kind and good guy. He is trying to give back to the people in the ghetto who have been oppressed by the white police.  After the film ended I was very sad for what happened to this boy.  I recommend this movie to everyone. It is well worth watching because the main character and his partner are both great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie!  I did not find this movie all that good (i guess it is about the best of the "Moby Dick" movies).  It is a good time with some great laughs.  It gives you the impression of a "real" sailor on an "un-sailed" ship.  But I found this movie to be far superior to "Moynihan's last stand."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was filmed in 1970. The actors were in their early twenties at the time. They looked quite good but had quite a few acting shortcomings. They were all so pretty and their acting had a bit of stiffness to it. I think the reason this film is so beautiful is that its cast is so well-dressed. It was filmed as a film crew and their costumes were all beautifully done. The music was also wonderful. It reminded me of a very late, romantic era of the films and of the acting was very good.   This was the first time I watched "Dirty Dancing" and I must say it was very similar to the original.  This is a very beautiful movie and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really great! It is very original and really good. It is different, but still feels familiar and good.   It is the movie that made me see Star Wars for the first time and I liked it so much I have watched it several times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was great! The plot is extremely complex and fun. It is also very funny and has a lot of great fight scenes.   The music in this film is great and the acting was perfect.  They didn't rush it but they took the time to make it as good as it could be.  A must watch if you like martial arts or kung fu movies.  This movie is based off of a Japanese movie and it is a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know how the producers of this film made it so good. The cast is absolutely outstanding.

I hope more people are made aware of this gem of a film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My boyfriend and I went to see "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" a while back, and we both loved it. We did not want to miss this one.   The movie starts out with the main characters, played by Tom Cruise and Jessica Biel, driving through New Orleans. They visit the luxurious Marigolds Hotel, and they have an amazing stay at this hotel. The scenes in the hotel are very romantic.  The story of the movie is not too good. It does not really have a great plot and all it takes is one night to realize that the love of the people at the hotel is far from genuine. The way the main character, and many others, are portrayed is unbelievable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would highly recommend this film, and I will try to explain why.  In case anyone is wondering the ending is totally unexpected, it's very well done, and it makes you feel so bad for the characters and really makes you sympathise with them.  I think that this film would have worked really well for a short series as it really shows how difficult life can be.  It's a really good film, especially for any film lovers out there.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a good, but not great movie.   The acting is good but the movie isn't very good.  The plot is not a very good one and the characters aren't well-drawn.  When you watch it you will hate the two main characters: "Molly" and "Vern" are both not interesting at all.  There are not many jokes to laugh at or many characters.  It has a strong ending but the plot is very weak and you don't see what happens after that.  "This movie is too long to be interesting.  This is just an excuse to show Molly being a slut.  Why did they take off her clothes?  This movie needs to be shown at 2 1/2 hours.  I don't like the film but it is a bit better than I thought.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was awesome. I had to watch it 3 times in order to fully enjoy it. The whole story is brilliant and was made even better because of the acting and sound effects.   It is really cool how the movie doesn't focus too much on any one particular movie, but focuses on the people involved with it.  Also, it is really interesting to see how movies are made now.  It was made in 1974 and features people like Robert Redford, James Dean, James Mason, Richard Gere and John Wayne.  Even though I don't know what it would have been like to have seen it 40 or 50 years ago, it would still be awesome.

The actors play very well and give very good performances.  I would love to see more movies with like minded actors.  It is a little bit different in some places and some of the scenes are a little hard to see but that is to be expected.  The director uses very interesting and well used lighting in some parts of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie for the first time on tv. I loved it. I did not watch it on tv, so I don't know if that was a problem.   One of the reasons I loved this movie was because of its wonderful cast.  I was not a fan of the movie, but I loved how this cast was able to portray what is going on in that home.  Â    Â  The cast was so great I wanted to watch it all over again, I just knew that this would be a great movie to watch with the wife, just sitting there.  This movie was not made for kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A must see for film lovers, this movie has so many scenes where you get so close to the characters that you want to hug and kiss them. The plot is so interesting, and the characters are so amazing.   My favorite scene in this movie was the scene where the family walks along the beach and all the kids are having fun. The one scene that really makes it worth seeing is when the little boy tells the father "Daddy, I'm scared of the sea, Daddy."   There's so much action and suspense in this film, it's a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's plot is a clever one and the acting is top-notch. There is a slight misstep in the opening when the heroine, who is a doctor in the city, is walking down the street and a cop asks her what she is doing there. She replies, "to help". The man says, "Well what could be better than that?" The cop says, the question is, "What's wrong with you?" The actress says, a bit angrily, "Nothing." The man then asks her, "So you're a doctor then?" Her reply is, not too eloquently, "It's a very good doctor." A nice touch! There is much more character development than I expected in this film. I don't think this movie will appeal to everyone, as it has a very dark tone and some scary moments. I liked it a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what I love?   A solid flick that can take you on a ride to the dark side.   This movie has a very well planned and thought out film that takes the audience on a trip and in the end leaves you wondering about where the plot ends and reality begins.  "The Dark Knight Rises" is one of those movies that is sure to make you question everything you thought you knew about Batman and what that world is like.  From his origins in the sewers of Gotham to his fight against The Joker to his ultimate victory over Ra's al Ghul to his struggle against The Dark Knight.  Batman and this world that he is a part of are presented as very realistic and give us a deeper understanding about how each character is doing in their life.  Even though Bruce Wayne is Batman, we see him struggle to put together his family and life in his quest to defeat The Joker.  The villains in this movie are extremely well portrayed.  I was never a big fan of Heath Ledger, but he is great in this film as the villain The Scarecrow.  Joker's appearance was so perfect that it was almost frightening at times, and his voice was just perfect.  While I would have liked to have seen The Joker take more of a role in this picture, I can't help but notice the fact that the majority of the villainous roles are given to Paul Dano and Michael Caine.  Bruce and his team also have a great supporting cast.  In addition to the main cast, there are a few additional characters that make their appearances in this flick.  These include James Gordon (Morgan Freeman), a police detective, and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the Dent lobby boss.  They give some great performances that give the movie a little bit of mystery and suspense, not unlike what was to come in the next film, "The Batman".  This film also has a great score from Hans Zimmer that gives the film a real ominous and dark feel.  Overall, this is a solid film that has many twists and turns, and I highly recommend it for those who like action films, Batman, and a dark take on the character.

It was my first time at the theatre and I definitely recommend it for any one that enjoys a good comedy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director ofÂ  The Lord of the Rings Â is about to begin work on a new trilogy of films, and he wanted a "big, epic" film to follow. His choice was the film that will go down as the first "Alfie" film: The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring. I remember seeing the first trailer for this film while it was still being made. The movie was huge, and packed with big action set pieces, and it looked great. As you might have gathered from my previous review of this film, I liked it very much. However, it was a little underwhelming for me personally.   I do feel that if the director had taken advantage of the visual effects techniques that are more or less a must-have for these films, it would have been the film.  The film has a good script, and great acting, and has a solid cast. There are also some great sequences that are worth seeing. But, for me, this film was an average film. It didn't have a lot going on in terms of dramatic elements, and just didn't feel like the big film it was supposed to be.  As you can see, it seems that he went a little too far with his CGI in this film. And the CGI wasn't all that great to begin with, either. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to the movie after watching an oldie on TV. The first 10 minutes of this movie are very hard to follow. It is hard to tell when the movie begins and the next 10 minutes start. The rest of the movie is very easy to follow, which is exactly what I wanted. I loved this movie, and I'm glad I finally saw it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am so happy i had this movie. I bought this from the theatre, but when i get it home i saw the original movie, and was shocked. I was so pleased to see it done so well.    The first time i watched this i was in love with the movie, it was like nothing I had ever seen.  It was such a powerful scene when this man started raping her, and then after she was in tears and begging him to stop, the director said 'this is the end, we can't go on like this'. I thought this was going to be a comedy, but it ended up being a true drama.  The director put everything he had into this movie, from his style of directing to his acting to his writing, and it shows. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been following the development of this film since it first started making the news, and I think it's great. I've never seen a film this much like an old black-and-white silent film, but I like it very much. The actors and actresses really do work as well as they could, and the story makes you feel for the characters. It's not just a drama about a single, great director, but about a great period, and about the human beings that were so extraordinary in their day and the fact that they just happened to make a film. I haven't seen a movie quite like this since the great "Citizen Kane", and this is a better one.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed the film. The film follows an American pilot, Steve Gneissel, as he goes through an exotic tour of the world. We learn that he was captured and tortured by the Japanese army for several months. After being freed, he decides to take off and find his wife in Paris. The movie is very fun to watch. There is no dialogue except for a few times to say hello. There are lots of explosions, and Steve is able to avoid the bullets. One of my favorite parts is when Steve and the pilot crash through the bar and the owner is trying to save Steve from the fire. He makes Steve take off his shirt and his pants. It makes me laugh when the owner runs out to his truck to pull him out of the bar. We also learn how Steve's mother has always told him that he's beautiful. He was even called beautiful in jail. My husband and I loved the look of the French women and the way the French men treated them.   My only problem was that the plane was not real. The planes they fly are all CGI. The pilot in this movie was real but the pilots in the film they were not. So, the pilot's name and the plane names weren't that authentic. I also felt that there was not enough action in the movie. I feel that the whole movie should have been a chase, and we would have gotten better action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this film, we see two of the more interesting characters from the 80s: Mr. Travolta and Mr. Cruise.  Â In the 80's, they were both working in different areas at the time and didn't really get together. Â However, this film shows how they both developed into very different characters.  To see them together shows just how far they've come.  They make for an interesting duo, and a really good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have not seen this movie until recently, but it is so much fun to watch. It is about a man and a woman on vacation in the desert with their kids in tow, who are both totally unaware that something is very wrong. What is odd is that both of them are married, and the man, a man of few words and a good cook, is having an affair with a woman he meets on the trip. They make a lot of fun of each other, and as soon as she finds out he is having her baby she starts to realize that something was off about him.   The ending really took me by surprise, as if to say, "we're going to be OK."   Very interesting film, and I was glad that I got to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What made this film so great is that it was about someone struggling with a horrible disease. And he had a family that he loved.   I remember when I was a kid, a sick uncle of mine used to tell me stories of a "magical" cure. He would say that by using certain herbs and plants that if you drank it and the "disease" was cured then you could live forever. I don't know where that came from, but it wasn't true. The sickness and disease he had was from a blood cancer and when it was removed he was cured.  This is the story of his journey and of the doctors, nurses, and family that was there for him. It's really a story of life and I was so glad that it got made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I found that the two parts of the film were so closely connected that they were virtually inseparable." The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1957) is a great example of an adaptation of an older screenplay by Sergio Leone. In this case, it's Sergio's version of the The Good, The Bad and The Ugly by John Huston. Sergio Leone is a legend and should be respected in his films. In this film, Sergio Leone has turned his attention to the "biggest stars" and their conflicts. The story follows four stars, who are pitted against one another as they fight to protect their film. It's a good mix of action and drama, as the four stars clash. Actors such as John Travolta, Marlon Brando, James Coburn and Clint Eastwood bring their A game, with their respective personalities and talent playing off each other well. There is a lot of great dialogue in this film and it's all very clever and clever. If you've seen any of the other adaptations of the movie, you'll know how to spot all of the original references. The film is also an excellent example of what Leone was capable of doing, so this isn't just another adaptation that Leone made. The action is just right and there is a strong sense of urgency and danger that keeps you on the edge of your seat. One of the best examples of a film with a strong plot, superb acting, and beautiful cinematography. If this film were to be remade, the plot would be vastly changed and this film would be no different. This is a must watch for any serious fan of Sergio Leone and any lovers of The Good the Bad & The UGLY. If you haven't already seen it, watch it now, before it becomes a long time ago. I recommend you try and buy it on DVD or a Blu-ray, because it is a rare film and the story is excellent.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a huge fan of The Goonies when I was little, and watching it as an adult made me fall in love again. It's amazing how much better it looks and sounds with its DVD release. I'll keep it on the top of my list for sure.    What a great film! I was thrilled to find a film I had never seen before. It was a great addition to my collection of classic 80's and 90's film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that should be in more hands than it is. It is an excellent, darkly humorous, and surprisingly intense look into the inner workings of one of the most notorious cults. The film starts out like the typical "wannabe cult" movie, with an unknown group of people planning out their next step. The lead, a high school sophomore named Chris (who, in my opinion, deserves to be an Academy Award winner), has just moved to the area and, with the aid of his good friend Kevin (who is just as much a star as the lead, if not more so), he is soon making a name for himself as a leader of an "anti-cult" group. The group, which they named "The World Police," are a bunch of misfits who believe in a God that only exists in their heads, which is why the group is trying to "raise God up" to take on all the world's sins. As Chris grows and learns more about this God, he realizes that there is actually a lot of truth in what they are saying. But Chris, who has always been the leader, is unable to communicate his ideas to the group, who are mostly all kids. So he gets a younger friend (Eric Stoltz) to act as his mouthpiece, and starts teaching the group the truth. The movie really goes into a downward spiral when the group begins taking things too far, and becomes a threat to themselves and the outside world. The final scene, showing the "world police" leaving town and flying away in an unmarked plane with the words "we are gone" written on it, is truly eerie and haunting.   What makes this movie so great is the way that it examines the people and the group at a very real level, even though the actual violence doesn't come into play until the very end. Chris' character is at the center of the story, and the rest of the characters are all more or less like him. He's the leader of the group who sees that they can be successful only by having someone believe in their claims, which he has to convince of their right to exist. Kevin is the high school student that has fallen for Chris, and is the only one who has any sense of understanding about what they're up to. Eric, the new friend Chris has brought into the group (and who also has his own problems with the group), is a "furry-maniac," who wants to

The special effects are amazing and I can't wait to see them all over again. I can only imagine what it would be like to have an entire set made out of them. I loved every minute of it! - January 27, 2009Wonderful!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun and entertaining movie. It is very funny. I like how they make the characters seem real. The people and their names are real people you meet and then you find out they're fictional characters. They have to work around the limitations of the story. The main character gets pulled into a bizarre situation and then he gets to learn the real story. It's all very enjoyable and easy to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this on my honeymoon in London. I've since seen it a second time. It's still an awesome movie.  I was blown away by the story. I love the mystery behind the kidnapper. You just don't see that in a lot of movies.  The acting was good too. The actors were great. I loved how they looked at each other. I also loved the way she made him look like he was crazy with that look of his.  A good movie, great actors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was filmed at several different sites across the US. This allowed for many locations to be used in scenes. It has a wide variety of scenes and sets in which to film. The film is set in several locations across the world including a secret military base, a submarine, an island, a small village, a prison, a hospital and a secret laboratory.   It is a dark and depressing film. While it is not the kind of film that you want to watch alone, it is a nice film to watch in a movie theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the James Bond movies and can't wait to see another one, do yourself a favor and watch this one.   A fun, fun, and a very good watch!   Â  This one's not going to blow your socks off and that's part of the fun of it.  The plot is actually pretty simple: a mysterious package is delivered to the office of a wealthy family who is in the process of selling the house to a young couple.  When a suspicious package arrives, a bunch of people rush to investigate and there's a nice little chase scene.  It really was a lot of fun and very funny.  There was no dialogue in this movie, so there was no way to tell what was going on.  I like this one even more than the one before it, which is probably why it only got a couple more releases. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie had a great plot, great acting, and great music.  This one will make you feel like you're right in that era.  My favorite aspect of the movie is the look of the sets, especially the ones in the '50's.  The movie has an eerie feeling about it, so you won't mind if the actors seem a little out of place.  I liked this movie, but it isn't perfect.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen a lot of good movies and this one had the best script, acting, and direction. It was a very complex story that would appeal to a wide audience but would appeal just as much to a specialist as to a mass audience. I recommend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humor.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie to see is one that you wouldn't normally see. It is a "feel good" movie that has a unique and unusual plotline, and you'll probably laugh quite a bit.  This movie has a lot to it that is great, and is worth seeing.  A movie that you won't see:  The plot is unique and not for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film was the first of the James Bond movies to take place in South Africa. For me this film is a classic of Bond, and definitely one of his best. It tells the true story of Bond's journey from his days as a South African soldier, to his adventures in the jungles of the African Continent. The Bond villains, the Kommandants de Bond, were portrayed in this film as real, real men. They are portrayed with their characteristic mannerisms, and in Bond's world they are all bad men. The movie also is very faithful to the original, and to some degree even surpasses it.

I don't think I will ever get tired of watching this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this one in theaters when it was still in theaters. It looks like it may be one of those films that had to be shown several times because of the popularity it achieved in its time. The film is basically a horror-action film with a little bit of science fiction and fantasy thrown in. The character of the title "Travis" is the main protagonist of the film and he is an alien that can transform into anything he desires at will. He is sent on a mission with his ship (and its crew) to investigate a strange phenomenon on Earth. The science-fiction element of the movie was added to give the alien characters a little more depth, as well as giving them more action. The acting in the movie is great and the effects look pretty great as well. The movie has been made very recently and it still looks great today. This one is definitely worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was absolutely brilliant.  It was so intense that I couldn't watch it without getting goosebumps.   It started out with me feeling bad for all the poor women in India that were being raped, and then the film turned into a horror movie and I thought it was just the most horrifying movie I've ever seen.  You can totally see the difference between this movie and most Hollywood movies, because the main character, who is a soldier, is portrayed as a real person and not as a cartoon.  There's some great scenes in this movie too.  This is probably the best movie I have ever seen that focuses on the effects of war on a human being.  I can't remember exactly where I saw this movie, but I watched it at a college in Virginia, and this was the first movie I saw at this college. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a must see for those who like the horror genre and are interested in taking the next step into the world of science fiction and alternate universes. The main character is an ordinary American whose job is to guard a planet known as "The City," an ideal society that is protected by special weapons. Unfortunately, this world is full of dangers to the inhabitants, and the main character's job is dangerous because his job has given him access to a secret weapon system which is used to help protect the city. When the main characters discovers that one of the people in the city, a teenage girl, is pregnant, he is forced to go through with the job of killing the baby. The film is pretty much about the characters, their feelings, and how they deal with it.   I found this film to be fairly interesting in that there are not really any action sequences and they mainly focus on the characters and their thoughts, emotions and feelings.  It is hard to see what is going on and what the real story is, which makes the film rather mysterious.  Â  The acting of the cast is really well done and the film has a very strong and believable plot and atmosphere.  While I have seen a few science fiction movies, I don't think I have ever seen a movie like this, and I found it quite interesting.  4 out of 5

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you can find this movie, it should be on your list of "must-see movies" for sure.   The film, written by Mark Romanek and directed by Gary Trousdale, is a classic and should be seen by everyone.  This movie is truly an example of a "no-budget" film that still manages to make you laugh out loud as the story unfolds.  It is a love story as the two lead characters meet and fall in love, while fighting a disease and each other, while trying to survive.  The acting, the direction, the production values and the script makes it all worth it.  Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never knew that there was such a thing as black-and-white films that were made before and after World War I.  One of the more underrated films I've seen from the silent era is " The Man Who Sold the World " by the late Buster Keaton.  Keaton made the film in 1928 to play for a Broadway play and after it was over he moved it to television.  This is a silent movie with a very strong black-comedy flavor.  The film was filmed using a Technicolor process that made the action look more vibrant and the black and white made the black look white.  After the film was made and in color it went into a series of re-runs and became a huge hit.   " The man who sold the world " is a great film and a fun look at a very interesting time in American history. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot is rather convoluted. It makes me wonder if they were actually going for a serious thriller and a "true story" about a murder mystery or if the makers just threw in some supernatural and crime elements for good measure. Either way, it's an interesting premise that works well for the story it tells.   There's nothing more interesting than a good mystery.  One of the most interesting and thought provoking parts of the movie is when the characters actually do something right.  The acting was excellent. The actors portrayed the characters with great care and effort. I can't say enough nice things about this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie a lot and would watch it again. It was very unique and interesting. The best parts were the beginning and ending when the people are all running away and then everyone is running back and the film begins in reverse. It did a good job of portraying what happened and it gave you that feeling of not knowing what is going on, but knowing exactly what happened. This is probably my favorite film of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big horror fan and this film did not disappoint.  The plot is simple and the story is very well done.  From the opening scenes to the ending scene, the story never gets old.  You don't need a lot of background information to understand what's going on, but once you do, it's clear what is going on.  I really enjoyed watching this film and I'm glad I picked it up.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been waiting a very long time for this movie to come out in it's original, un-altered form. It's a story with heart that is beautifully shot, shot well, and shot well. There's not much else I can say about this movie.   It was an incredibly emotional experience for me.  The movie really hits home for me, it leaves me feeling good.  I watched this film after watching a short film by James Woods. It made me feel like I was there for the movie. I'll say this, even if you think this is an adult movie, I still recommend you watch this movie before you think about having sex.  This movie is a bit too mature for the PG-13 rating. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â I thought this was an interesting film with a good story.    I liked the fact that the film was about a real life event that took place during the American Civil War.  What makes this film interesting is the fact it was filmed using the same footage that is used to show WWI footage in modern movies.  This footage is very accurate.  My only complaint was it seemed like the film wasn't done to be very historical.  While it was great, it really didn't make a very good impression on me.  I thought it was a great film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really amazing. It's great to see this movie in a theater with the original movie still in the background. The story is very similar to the original, just a few added details.   It's so well made that I'm amazed that such a simple story was made.  The acting is fantastic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is an American black comedy based on the real life story of the infamous John Belushi.Â  The plot is based off of the true story of how Belushi and his group of friends broke into the Laurel Canyon home of an unsuspecting man named Howard Hughes (a film noir classic). Belushi was trying to make a movie out of the Hughes home, as his former friends weren't willing to work on the project.Â  After a lot of attempts, Belushi finally managed to get a group of people together to shoot a horror film, but the movie got cancelled because the people involved had other commitments.   When the film finally got finished and released, it was a disaster.Â  A very low budget horror film and the actors couldn't get the angles right.Â  It was even called "the worst movie ever made".   But, as far as the film goes, it's still enjoyable to watch, because of the high energy, fast paced nature of the film and of course the hilarious John Beluckel. Â  The film has a great cast that includes John Beluca, John Belakie, and James Caan, all of which have very memorable roles. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was very well done. You really see the life of the two characters and the effect that was caused by the circumstances of their lives.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was raised on Star Wars, and I never watched any of the sequels, so when I saw this film in the theater, I was completely confused by how this film was like a prequel to Star Wars. The film was based on a comic book that came out in 1977, and this movie was made by the same people, which was why it had the same feel as the original movie. I really enjoyed the original Star Wars because I was a kid in the 60's, and there wasn't much action on TV in the area. It wasn't until the 70's when Hollywood became a more sophisticated, that's why the original film was so great. This film, on the other hand, has a lot of the original cast in it, and they did a good job.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I love this movie and have been watching it over and over and love how the whole family is so proud of the movie.   If your a girl and enjoy a good romantic comedy or even just a good good romcom then this is the movie for you.  The director had a huge role in keeping the movie from being cheesy or too cheesy and I have to say he did a really nice job on it.  A great love story and very emotional. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a fan of the original series. I've seen all of them, so it's been more than a decade. This film has so much nostalgia to it that I found myself crying from laughter. It was a fun little film to have a look at, it was just fun to watch, although there were a few awkward moments, but the overall fun was just too much to ignore.   This is a good one for the old fan of B-movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those great love stories about a girl and her step-father who are both working hard on making a name for themselves. The plot was a little bit too contrived at times, but it did give us an excellent portrayal of an abusive father/ step-son relationship. The movie has a very nice ending, as the step-daughter was able to take her father's last breath, and he could finally rest in peace. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been wanting to see this movie for a long time now. It's a comedy with an incredible cast (except for Jim Carrey who plays the lead) and it's well written and directed. The movie takes place on an island and it has that same feel of being lost and helpless. The story is about a guy who is trying to find his missing wife who has disappeared. He has no choice but to be the guy who tracks down his lost love and bring her back. It was quite a great movie and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been a fan of films from Brazil for some time now and this film is a welcome addition to that great filmography.   For those who might be unfamiliar with Brazil, the "cocoon" is a small country in South America. It's a fairly new country and the country is growing. While that's good for the people living in the country, it's not good for most of the people who are not as lucky to be able to move to the country.  Most people in Brazil are either slaves in the countryside or slaves in a large city.  The people of Brazil are a pretty harsh lot.  It's interesting to see how some of the slaves in Brazil treat the other slaves.  There is a lot of violence, racism and sexual content in this film.  While it's hard to pick up all of the content, there are some pretty shocking moments of violence and sexual degradation.  I really enjoyed the film. It felt like an authentic portrayal of the times and the people it portrays. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I was a little hesitant about this movie until I watched it. I didn't have a problem with it at all, so I was pleased to see that I was not the only one who enjoyed it. The film had some great performances, and the characters were well written.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really don't understand how you could like this movie.   This movie is a parody of the horror genre and they actually get it.  The actors and actresses are so terrible but the gore and violence is hilarious and makes this movie worth watching.  This is a great parody of a horror film.  There are tons of great movies made but this is the only one that is funny and still makes you cringe.  I would love to see the movie in the theater with this crowd.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie really was a gem. I felt like I was watching one of my favourite films, it is not over the top like The Shining, but it's still a good, thought provoking film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film's first and most important scene is a classic. The first thing you think is "wow, there's something very good about this". This is a movie that makes you think about the nature of life itself, and the kind of people we choose to live among. It's a movie about people at a certain level that take this world for granted, with little concern for the people beneath them. It is a film of two different kinds. It may be the most visually stunning movie ever made. It was filmed entirely on a sound stage in Italy in the late '50s. It shows the impact of film on the world and in human consciousness. It also shows the influence that American filmmaking and other forms of entertainment have had on the way we view and live our lives. It makes you realize that the film is not about the life of a typical American, but about the way that the whole world sees Americans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie does a good job of telling the stories of a few different girls and it's not the most original story line.   The movie is fun to watch and the main character, Eliza, is a great actress.  She does a nice job with her role and you get a little feel for her character.  I'd recommend this movie if you like the movie, I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What more can I say? This movie is so good and so authentic.   As the first movie about the JFK assassination, it was a tough task for a movie to do justice to the real event.  The movie focuses on the conspiracy, the investigations, the conspiracy that they don't want you to know about.  These people, they're still alive, but they're kept on a very tight leash and they donÂ´t want you know who they are.  Their main witness is the real Jack Ruby.  He goes in on a deal to kill Oswald to protect the Mafia.  But Jack, who wanted to kill Castro, and he's on the right side, he gets out.  ItÂ´s interesting, how the movie captures the entire JFK story.  When they put the camera on him, it's like the cameras are following him.  This movie has been reviewed so many times and many people who have seen it, have said that itÂ´s the best movie about JFK.  I can't say anything bad about it, because it is good.  There are a few scenes that are a bit cheesy, but the movie is really good.Â    4/5

It was a surprise to see that it was in fact in HD. I was quite surprised by the picture quality of the film. It is very clean and sharp. The film is also really fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think it's a wonderful film and it's really worth watching.   This film is quite different than the films made by "Citizen Kane".   It takes a very different approach to the same story and the director made the decision to go in this direction.  At times the action sequences are quite intense, and the editing is very fast.  If you like a well made thriller, this is the film for you.  The acting is quite good all around.  It's hard to tell which actors were the best and which actors are not very good.  As the story goes on and we meet more characters and the story progresses, the acting gets better.  I enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie had very good production values with a great costume designer, a great and interesting script, and the acting was top-notch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last three or four episodes have been a bit of a letdown, as I wanted to see more of how this book was coming along. The story had all the elements of a good story and I could have happily continued reading. It really did feel like a real life movie. It was so well done and I was truly surprised that no one had made a movie out of this book. There was also this really cool bit in the first few minutes where the girl played with a toy car, and it was amazing to see her get such a real look at what it was to be a kid. I was really impressed with how this movie was put together and how the actors played their parts.

I wasn't sure if I would like it, but the people were nice enough to make sure I saw the movie. I had never seen the book before, but I felt this movie captured the essence of the story.   In conclusion, this movie captures the essence and tone of the books perfectly.  If you have not read any of the book and are looking for a movie, this is the one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so worried going into this that it wouldn't work for me, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It was soooo good that I wanted to see more of it.   It's about a very special child that was the only one that wasn't taken from her family.  The director, Michael Moore, has a way of making it seem as if she's always a kid, and yet I've never seen her older than she is now.  She's also very good at talking to children, and when her family gets together, she's the only adult that doesn't freak out.  I would definitely recommend this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie, I loved this. I was watching this with my kids on the couch and we were all hooked.   I think it's so much better than your typical chick flick. I am really surprised they kept it so funny. I would recommend this to everyone.

If you're a fan of horror or horror comedies and you don't care what genre it is, this movie is definitely for you.  They did a great job capturing that eerie atmosphere.  I laughed out loud at the movie and there are so many funny and clever things that happen.  It's a good, old fashioned haunted house film.  It's not the most creative, not the smartest, but it works.  If the plot was a little better, this would have been a great movie.  A little bit more mystery and a few more scares and you could have a great horror movie.

For those people who find it a bit confusing the movie does not attempt to give a very complicated explanation of what is going on.  It is simple enough to understand what is happening and is well paced.  The story is good and I would not put it ahead of some of the better made movies from the 70s.  If you have ever wanted to see a great James Bond movie then this is the movie to see.  I enjoyed it very much. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot is not the strongest part of this movie. The film has a couple of decent moments. The cast and the director are wonderful. If you love a horror/thriller, this movie is worth watching.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the best.   It is realistic and you can see the love the characters have for each other.  The movie is really good.  All the actors are great,  the director really tries to tell a good story and it's a good one.  I was glad that I watched this movie and  I really like the idea of a love story between a brother and a sister.  For a movie like this you can really get emotional.  It's a little hard to find a good, realistic movie and this one is one. I like to see real love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a great one, I never realized how much time has gone into building the world the way it is. The setting is a huge mystery, and it is fascinating to look at.   If you want a good time, watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very excited about this movie because I heard a lot of good things about it, but it seems like it doesn't live up to its hype. I think I got spoiled by this movie as I've seen many of the movies in the "Batman vs. Superman" franchise. The script by Zack Snyder was ok at best, but the story was just not that great. It seemed that there was more to this story than what was shown, and I'm a sucker for that. I'm glad I watched it so that I could see the true story behind "the greatest story ever told."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good, honest, no holds barred comedy-drama with tons of laughs, action, and a kickass female lead.  I was glad I came into the theater to see this one, for its humor, its action, its quality, and for the fact that it has a female in it.   I can't see myself going to see any more films about women being shot on a beach or in a bar, since we have so many of these, so this was a refreshing change, a nice surprise.  This is a great comedy film, with a lot of laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is awesome. Very intense and well acted.   It's very interesting to watch how the character evolves throughout the movie. Â There's a lot of emotional depth. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My husband and I saw this at a restaurant during lunch. We were very excited. The film was great and had great acting. I'm a little disappointed that it was only in black and white. I would have loved to see it in color.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A pretty good movie and I can't say it's perfect but it's a solid movie that I'd watch again in a heartbeat.   The only complaint I have about it is the lack of an epic finale but maybe the final battle will be better than the whole movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie really caught me by surprise. It is based on the true story of how a woman was murdered in a subway station in New York in the late 70's. The movie tells the story in a non-judgmental manner. The story was told so well I really wanted to see what happened to the woman. It was not the "murder scene" in a movie, but it was the real-life event. The murder was really hard to watch and really makes you think about what you did that could lead to a tragedy. The police investigation was just about perfect. The guy who pulled off the murder never spoke to the victim's family. There was never a sense of guilt. The murderer was never punished. He was released from prison after 2 months. It really made me want to watch this movie. It also has a really dark and disturbing ending. It made me really want to think about this case again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was a fun movie to watch and if you like the 80s action movies then this is a must watch. It really makes you feel old and I really enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies you will remember forever and if you want to see great films that are truly scary you have to see this one. I remember watching this on a long airplane flight and the screams of the other passengers getting scared out of their wits and then I saw this little guy running down the aisle. The movie has a slow start, it doesn't take long to get the gist and there isn't anything that is really great about the film, but it will scare the crap out of you.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know why people who do not know the movie do not like it. This is a movie that everyone who loves action should see. The best way to watch it is in 3D, which I found to be better than 2D.   The film starts out slow and suspenseful. But the story becomes really compelling. It is the most believable and intense story I have ever read.  It is a real thrill ride.  I never seen such suspenseful and thrilling action.  There are so many twists and turns and many things to do, like a real spy thriller.  The ending is satisfying and shocking.  This is the best movie I have seen in a long time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie. It has lots of humor and action. It features some great acting and the storyline is well written. The characters are very well done and the story is interesting. The director did a good job. This was not something I watched casually, but I am sure I will see it again sometime.   It was good fun, very entertaining.  Great stuff, with lots of action, fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen the original film, but I have watched the remake. It was a very fun movie. It had some nice visual effects. I have seen other versions of the film. I had seen it in the 1970s, but it was more of an American film. The remake had a new sound, it was a little better than the original.   If you like westerns, you should watch this! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most intense and interesting movies I've seen in a long time.   A must-see movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie. The writing, the acting, the music, and the acting/composing, all was great. The only problem with it was it was really long. The story line was good and it just ended after the final scene.   There are some movies that don't make sense but this one definitely did. The ending of this movie was a good ending and I would love to see more of this series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at a local theater where the theatre was sold out. The film was not bad, but this movie was very overrated. The plot is not interesting, and the acting is great. I saw it as a movie on a rainy day, and it was a lot more entertaining that the movie was. It's definitely worth a watch, but don't expect a good flick.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movies that I have seen. It's a film about a guy with an unusual problem that has his life turned upside down. He is on the road traveling across the country and it takes him some time to realize he is being followed by a very creepy guy.   The acting is great and the music is great.  You won't be able to get enough of this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie I would describe as a comedy is one that uses comedy as an avenue to tell a story.   I was glad to see this movie on the big screen.  It was funny and I would not have thought of going to see it for years if not for the excellent cast of actors.  The plot may have been simplistic but it worked and I had fun while watching it.  You may think you would find it difficult to get into a movie with a plot that is so simple but I am sure that most people would love this movie.  I gave it four stars because it did have a very basic plot and characters and I was disappointed that the ending of the film was so much like the plot at the beginning.  If you are looking for a comedy, I recommend it but if you want a movie that will have you laughing then I would suggest a different movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter and I saw the movie in an old theater that we had in the basement of our house.   It had that old movie theater feel with no bells or whistles.  The picture was clear and the sound was great.  My daughters loved it.  It made me laugh out loud.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a good old fashioned comedy with an interesting plot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My son loves this movie. I love the storyline and the acting, too. This movie is for adults as well as kids.   A good mix of action and comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I hadn't known what the movie was about, I would have thought it was a good little thriller, that was all. The only thing that was off was the fact that the lead character, Billy Dix, was a little too happy-go-lucky and it wasn't that funny.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this as a gift for my wife. She thought it was wonderful. She loved it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie did nothing to inspire confidence.   We get introduced to this young couple who have just gotten a job as maids in the house of a wealthy family. The man, a man, is handsome and attractive, and is portrayed by the great actor, James Coburn.  I just thought this was one of those films where you think, "why not?"   A good portion of the time, the camera just sits there, and we get to look at nothing but the man and woman talking.  But I guess the idea was to get us to feel sorry for the couple, and so we see their problems.  The wife is jealous that the couple can sleep in the same bed, and also jealous that she is not allowed to touch the man, except to wipe his feet.  When the couple goes shopping, he keeps trying to give her the ring, and she gets upset at him.  This leads up to one of my favorite scenes in the movie, where the man asks her for a kiss on the cheek.  Of course, she turns him down.  At one point, she shows the ring and says, "that was my ring."   And that is what was wrong with this movie.  It just was not interesting.  There was no plot, and no one was going to change the world.  That is why I think we should be ashamed of the movie that made it to the top of the box office. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a big fan of the movie, especially of one of the actors. He plays a "little boy" named Nick who was sent to the orphanage by his father. He meets an old lady named Judy, who takes in Nick and gives him something to eat. He falls asleep, and when he wakes up, he sees an old man walking along the street with a cane. Nick believes this to be the old man who kidnapped him from the orphanages. However, the man doesn't appear to be Nick's father. This is because Nick was already an adult at the time of his abduction, so it couldn't be him. However this is revealed in a flashback, when Nick was only a child. In the end, Nick comes to believe that he is still missing from the past, but Judy, knowing he's going to grow up, decides to teach him about himself. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who was a fan of The Shawshank Redemption and The Blues Brothers.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film has a lot going for it. I love the story, the acting, the music. The cinematography is amazing. It's really an exciting movie to watch.   If you want an action-packed thrill ride then this is it.  The only thing I found that bothered me about this film was the plot.  It's not as exciting as the first one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had been looking for a new movie to watch, and in the end it wasn't necessary.   This movie is a true, simple, and realistic depiction of the inner workings of a mafia family.  A truly awesome movie that captures the feel of a small mafia family and of a time that was much more "unforgettable" and "unpredictable".   The movie is simple and understandable, and is not at all complicated and convoluted.  The acting is so great, and the writing is so good.  This film has never been out of print, so this is the one movie that you could watch on a bad movie night and not feel like you wasted a good time.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the feeling of a family living on the wrong side of the law, and for those who like the realism of the mafia.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen and heard the original movie and was really into it. I have to admit though I wasn't as big a fan of the sequel as the first movie (I didn't think I'd have any problem with the sequel but the original was way better). I also was a little upset that the director wasn't credited.    The first movie was pretty damn funny but it was hard to keep your eyes off of the plot and characters. The characters and plotline in this film are far more serious and the story itself is way more interesting (I liked the relationship between Rolf and Susan).   This film is really great. It's not a "B movie" or even a good B movie, but it's pretty entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is fantastic. It has a unique style, the actors are really great, and the cinematography is great. This movie shows the true horrors of war. It is one of my favorites.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie that took 10 years to make, it's surprisingly good! I've never seen anything like it and it makes me wish I'd seen it sooner.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never seen the "Lord of the Rings" movies, but heard great things about them. The movie was a big hit when it came out in 2003, and now in 2016 I finally got the chance to see it. It is definitely worth watching. It's a wonderful movie and was even nominated for a Golden Globe, which I had no idea was even an award. It has the same plot and the characters look just as fantastic as ever. I'm glad to know that I was able to see this great movie when it was made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I went on a trip to Seattle in late August. We came early, and had a great time in town. One night we were eating at the local deli when I saw the movie. It made me laugh out loud. I had never seen a movie like it before. It's a perfect blend of comedy and tragedy. The acting was great. I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see a comedy I've always wanted to see and it is actually a good one. The only problem I had was getting the right timing on my shot, but you have to appreciate the time you have before you start the film.   It is a fun time for the whole family.  It's about two old guys who decide to take a trip to a remote cabin on the coast.  A few days into the trip, the guys find a young girl who seems to be a little scared of the dark.  One of the guys has a camera and film and takes some pictures of her and ends up making love to her.  The girl goes back into the woods and then gets lost in the woods.  Another guy comes to look for her and has an accident.  This leads to all sorts of adventures and twists and turns.  They get to the cabin and the guy who took the pictures tries to get away and is almost run over by a truck.  Luckily, the girl is found and the guys are told to leave the cabin.  After they go, they find out that someone else has been in the cabin before them and they also are stuck.  There are a couple of very funny scenes that happened out there.  I recommend this for all old people who like to laugh and love a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favourite movie about a famous band (they were from New York), "Gimme Shelter" is funny, touching, and the story is well acted.  The ending was a bit strange to me, but that's the film being made by the director of "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial".  I'd recommend watching it with a good friend, as they will bring out different parts of it.  I wish they would make a third movie.   A real gem in the "Music" genre.  "Gimmie Shelter" won't give you a headache.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a little hard to find. There is no print in my area, but I have heard great things about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this film was very funny and funny in the right way. The actors were all very good and the movie was well made and produced.   A great idea for a movie. I don't think I would watch this one often, but it does have a very unique style.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this movie has the worst title ever. The movie is called "Tales from the Hood" and it takes place in the 1970s in the city of Birmingham, Alabama. Â The characters are: Â Hutch and his friend, Al.  The two of them, while driving, run into a lot of trouble.  I'm not gonna go into detail about what they do to the people they encounter in their way.   It was the time before Michael Jackson was famous and I think he was very popular.  They have a lot to deal with at the beginning.  After their troubles, they become friends again and they are driving back to the city.  What they have in their car is pretty cool:  A 1968 Dodge Dart.  The movie follows their adventures and they start a group called the "Thuggin", a term for hood rats.  This movie does a great job at keeping you interested.  With good music and acting, it is a great watch.  Although, the characters are very stereotypical, the movies uses them in a good way.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent and funny movie. This movie is a must see for people with funny bone in their body. You will laugh, you will be impressed and you will laugh some more. I really enjoyed it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of movies about animals, especially since I am in the process of starting a new line of pet supplies. This movie was the first one I saw and I have since come to appreciate it as a good animal film. I think this is a great movie for young kids and it's an easy movie to take in. I don't recommend the movie for those who are squeamish, but there are plenty of really fun scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A well written, well acted and very enjoyable movie.   This movie is probably worth seeing if you're a fan of Michael Cimino.  If you're looking for an action packed movie, this is a great choice.  It's not "must see" action movie, but it's definitely worth checking out.   Movie Rating: 5.0/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I just saw this movie in the theater for the first time. It was a fun movie, with good acting and interesting themes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great comedy, starring Robert DeNiro and Jack Nicholson and directed by the wonderful Billy Wilder.   The plot follows a man who becomes the assistant manager of a chain of fast-food restaurants.  This movie was made when the fast food industry was in its infancy and it was the best example of the era it was during.  For that matter, the film also featured a couple of great female characters, such as a waitress with a heart of gold who loves a man named Tony (DeNiro), and a black prostitute who loves the manager's best friend, who is played by Jack Nicholson.  DeN.in't really acting in this movie, but he does look like he's having fun in all the different situations he finds himself in.  One particular scene where Tony is going around taking orders while dressed as a cowboy is hilarious.  The music was great too.  It was a real treat to watch this film when it first came out.  I think this was the last movie that DeNiiro did with Jack Nicholson (who died of an AIDS infection shortly before filming the movie), as they started to become friendly on the set.  Another really fun aspect about the movie was the song about the chain of restaurants. I'm not sure if anyone has ever heard the song, but I think it was an awesome song to hear during the movie.  My only complaint about this movie was that it was a little too cheesy for its own good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Hilarious" - I love the first one as much as the second one and I love all the movies! The characters are funny and you can always laugh at the odd situations that come up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie I will never forget. I was in my teens at the time and my mom took me to the theater. This was one of my first films and it changed my life.   It made me want to become a filmmaker.  I learned so much from this film. It was my first time doing voice over work for a motion picture. Â It was a lot of fun and very realistic.  This was before the time of computer animation.  This is what it was like to be in a silent film.  You can tell that the actors were so realistic that they were in a movie not a stage.  The music is fantastic and a huge influence on me.  Â  It's a great movie and a must see for any film buff.  - James B
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I grew up in San Jose, so I have seen a lot of movies from both cities. One of the first movies that I saw that I remember seeing as a kid, and still thinking it was great was THE LITTLE SOLDIERS (1977). I was about 11 and it took the kids to a nice hotel and then into a movie theater and I was mesmerized by all the military guys and women (including the one who played the piano and sang the song "Bless you all"). It also had a great performance by the movie's lead actress, Jane Fonda. When I got older, my friends and I often saw THE LICK by the same company (Barry Levinson and his sons), and we all loved it, too. I'm glad I remember it now, even though I haven't seen it for many years.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was a bit boring in the beginning. It was more of a mystery-ish movie than a psychological thriller. Then I liked the plot and the performances.   After watching the film and thinking about it, it makes me think it would make a good psychological thriller if it was made by Kubrick (which is what I think it is supposed to be). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I watched this movie in is called the New Frontier . It's a movie about the pioneers of space travel and the challenges that were faced in a world where people were scared of space. The movie stars Jeff Goldblum who has an amazing voice and a very cool role. He plays a young man called Eugene "Erik" Scott who has never had a pilot's license and is forced to go to space on his own with the other crewmembers.   This movie has lots of interesting facts about space travel. It also features very original music by Robert Schumann and it was filmed in 1970. It's well worth the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best horror films ever made. It has a very unique and eerie atmosphere and the camera work is really good. The effects and lighting work on this film are some of the most well done in the genre.    It's not as violent as some of your others, but the tension and dread is always there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched the trailer for this film (which I really enjoyed), then watched the film and it was one of the best movies I have seen this year. It was well paced, well acted and filled with action, humor and a very nice screenplay.   What is also really amazing is the fact that this film was released on Netflix in October of 2015. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this to see a "Dirty Harry" remake and it is a good film. I liked it very much and it wasn't very "funny" either, just real. It doesn't try to be funny, it just is funny.    "You know when they're watching Dirty Harry and there's a big, long shot of him in his uniform and then you hear the sirens, and you think, 'Man that guy doesn't care.' It's all a show. The guy's a performer, you know?" "Why are they in a shower?" "You don't have to have sex to do it, you don't even have to be naked. It's just a show." "It's a show and we've been at it for weeks."   The only thing I really don't like about this film is how they use the camera at one point. They go back and forth so fast, I get really bored.  A couple of things I thought were very funny, like that little boy in the shower, who's in his mother's bra and panties.  I don't really think that this was all that funny though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film I was most looking forward to, was a horror film called, "Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers." It was directed by, James Wan, and it was a pretty good movie. I didn't see the trailer until it was too late, but it was good. The film is supposed to be a remake of the "Halloweens" movie from the 80's, but the remake was made much better. The movie had more gore, and was a good watch.   I saw the first trailer, and I was scared of it. The actor who played the main character, John Goodman, was so good, that I actually enjoyed the film. It made me think, "oh, this film has something going for it."   So, after seeing the film, I went back, and watched it again. The second time, I was actually really scared, and really enjoyed it. I loved the cast, the story, and the production. The plot is pretty simple, and you should be able to follow it.  Â   The best parts of this movie were the scenes where I thought the film was going off the rails, but then it all became okay. I also really enjoyed how the actor playing Michael Myers, John Travolta, would get better and better, and become more and more like the character. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, very entertaining with lots of suspense. I also love that the film was shot in Japan.   For anyone who is interested in Japanese culture, I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure where the original film came from or who the original director was, but the film itself is well made. I was never interested in the original character of the character "Slim", but I liked that he had this one-liners and was the one to have it out with. It's a little weird when he first comes on screen and people look at him like, "what the fuck is he talking about?!" He was a one-dimensional character, but it is just funny to watch him struggle through life as this weird, out of place guy who is always trying to be cool and not fit in. He had no interest in getting his degree, but he's got a heart of gold and tries to make it work. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in a movie, that I actually screamed out loud. His love for his dog, especially "Pete", was something special. I also loved how "Soleil", the girl he cheated on his girlfriend with, always came in to "help" him with things, even if they were bad decisions. That one scene where they are going to go to the movie together, but she's "nervous", is really touching, especially when they go to a secluded spot that has a little waterfall on it. I loved the end where she pulls out a camera, gets out of the car and makes a photo, but I thought the ending was pretty obvious. Overall a great movie, even though the story didn't add up to what I was told about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. There's something wrong with the way it's presented here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you liked 'Star Wars', you will like this movie. If you don't like Star Wars, you will probably enjoy this movie as well.   'Return of the Jedi' is the best movie ever made and 'The Empire Strikes Back' was a good film in its time, but 'Return Of The Jedi' was so much better.  The acting is top-notch and the music is amazing.  'I Love You, Man' was also a great movie.  This movie is just an all-around good movie. Â  I hope that this movie will be brought back for a more extensive DVD release to make it a classic movie that everyone should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was really a great movie!  I loved the fact that they put the same actors in the same movie over and over again.  It was just awesome to watch everyone grow, and grow into their roles.  This movie is so well done and it makes you think about the things you have done in life and the decisions you made and what you have accomplished.   I was surprised at how good the acting was.  Everyone was such good characters.  I think this movie was the best acting I have seen in a long time.  The way they portrayed them was so good.  Posted by John Schuhmacher at 10:51 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was my first movie to see, and I went in with low expectations and it turned out to be an excellent movie.   It has a great plot, and the acting was great.  It took me a bit to get into the story, but once I was there, it really made sense.  The writing is great, and it really kept me wanting to see more.  This film was a bit slow at the beginning, but really picked up in the second half.  And if you have a little patience, you will not be disappointed.  I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not a classic. It is a fine comedy, and it's probably the most original screenplay I have ever seen. It's a very original screenplay by Jim Backus, who is not afraid to make a film that is funny, poignant and touching at the same time.   He uses a very good directorial technique of a very realistic and close up look at the situation of people in the Depression era.  This film is one of the best, I have seen. I highly recommend this movie.

They become friends and play together.  One day they are on the beach when the bad dog starts to attack his buddy.  The story is really good and I liked all the animals in the movie.  There were other dogs in the background and they were real dogs who have lives.  "Coyote" is also a good and funny movie. I thought the movie was well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. This movie is absolutely worth watching.   This movie does an excellent job of capturing the early 50's and the way things were.  A lot of people will complain about the movie but I just think it did a great job of depicting a different era.  I am sure that there are people that have a different opinion on this movie but for me I really enjoyed it.  It was great to watch a classic movie from this era.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When the movie I am talking about came out and I heard that it was being remade in 3D (yes, it is a remake), I thought it would be a great idea. But even with all the CGI, the story is still about a family and the love they have for one another. When it came out I did not see it. I was too busy looking at the pictures on the box. Now that I have seen it, I think it is awesome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie. I was not a huge fan of the first one but I found this one more enjoyable.   It is hard to believe that a movie that is only 15 years old is still making it's way into theaters.  The plot is simple but not so simple.  There is a man who has been locked up in a mental institution since his mother took his own life. He is constantly haunted by visions of his mother's killer. The only person who could help him is a nurse who lives in his home.  It does not take long before we are in this nurse's home and she is very good with Mr. Black. She takes great care of him and he does well in her care. He does become very clingy towards her but I have to give credit to the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very surprised by this movie and I'm glad to see that a director was able to make an action movie that wasn't too ridiculous.   There are plenty of action scenes but the best are when the characters are caught up in a complicated plot.  It's just too bad that it's just one movie and one man. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My dad bought this movie when he was in the middle of a mid-life crisis. He had watched all the old Hollywood movies that he didn't like. After seeing the film (I'm assuming he liked it because he bought it from the movies in the drive-in), he said it had all the right stuff to it, and I felt it was his way of exorcising that mid-70's self from his soul. The story is so well written it is hard to believe the actors are really portraying the characters, especially with the acting by Joe Don Baker, which is excellent.   A great classic movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film was my first viewing of '70s Hollywood and I was blown away by its quality and production value. The movie was amazing in every way. It's hard for me to think of another movie like it. I love the way it's shot, the music, the makeup effects and even the costumes. It was shot in New York City, a place that was very important to the movie and the actors. It really captured the spirit of the time.    The best thing about this movie is it was originally supposed to be a miniseries. The actors weren't so sure, but it was a lot more fun to shoot the first three films and work out the kinks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this on a whim because my friend and I couldn't find anything on Netflix that really resonated with us. We sat down to watch this in the backseat of my parents' car and we got sucked right in.   The story was compelling.  As the viewer, you're pulled into this story of an abusive husband that is still capable of the most gruesome acts, and a woman in a small town that refuses to believe that he's capable of such things.  You watch as her friends and family attempt to stop him and eventually, you watch as she comes to the realization that she must stand up to her husband, even if she has to do it alone.  They give you a good look at their lives and how it has impacted them.  This is the kind of movie that makes you feel like you know people and can relate.  The actors were excellent and I loved the scene where the husband finally gives up and walks away.  A great ending to this well made movie.  My only criticism was the soundtrack.  There was nothing wrong with the music, but it wasn't exactly "Honeymooners" or "Sister Act".  If you've got an iPod Touch, you might as well get this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not perfect, but it's really good and this is what I've been looking for.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a nutshell, this film was a treat for my son. He was about 5 and it was one of the very few movies he'd seen at the theater. It was great to watch him enjoy a story that was based on a true story. He and I both really enjoyed watching the story unfold and loved the dialogue. The special effects, costume designs and acting were great. He loves this kind of story and it helped him to relax.   A great little comedy that is sure to keep a smile on your face and a smile or two on his own.    Watch this movie, if you like good movies

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie for the first time, I was a bit put off by the film's rather low budget. I have no doubt that some people may have found it enjoyable, but for me, it was not worth the price of admission.   I found the acting to be quite bad. Although I never had an issue with the actors, this was probably my most disliked movie to date.  It seems like everyone thought the character of Jim had some sort of mental illness, but it wasn't something that was explored or portrayed at all. This was something that occurred in his subconscious and it is not mentioned in the film.  While this was not my favorite movie of all time, it is certainly a great movie that will stick with you for quite a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This movie is absolutely fantastic!"   This is a great old classic that shows that the "tired old man" stereotype is just that. The movie starts with some dialogue from a woman who was on the plane that crashed. The man says "I just got off the plane, the pilot was flying too high. I was just a kid when he died. I feel awful for the kids who are still living on the island." She asks him how old he was when he was on that plane. He replies "I was just 7". She asks "So what happened?" He says "It was a bad night." She goes on to tell her story about the plane crash. It is in this story that you see that his story is not as old as it seems.   The only problem with this movie is that the quality of the film is quite poor, in fact it is pretty terrible and there are not a lot of scenes that you can enjoy. The action scenes are just boring. The other thing about this movie that is weird is that it shows a real person in the movie who died about 40 years before this story even took place. It seems to be a very strange thing to do. The ending is probably the best part of this movie and was great to watch.  "It was terrible"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has such a big effect on the movie culture.   It is in the same category as the Italian horror films like The Wolfman, The Exorcist or The Amityville Horror.  There were so many great stories, that you just cannot watch this movie without thinking of the actors, and the story.  Also, this movie is a must see.  My daughter and her friends watch this every year on Halloween.  The movie is great for the kids, and a horror classic for the adults.  This is a movie I would highly recommend to see, especially if you like a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fantastic film. I have never been as excited for a big screen production of a film as this one.   Director Martin Scorsese has created a film that is simply stunning. Â Scorsese also directs his actors superbly.  The film begins with an intense sequence in a prison cell where a man is being tortured to death.  An inmate escapes and returns with a gun to shoot the director.  Then a couple of prisoners arrive and we follow them through the prison.  After a chase we see the man with a bloodied head.  As we see him walk back into the cell the blood comes off his head in huge flakes of blood.  We see a man being dragged out of his cell in an orange jumpsuit and then being beaten by the inmates.  It is a scene that will stay with you for years and years.  ScorsESE is a brilliant director and he puts the actors in the perfect position to act.  This is a film with no dialog except for the prisoners yelling, "I don't care what it costs!   This film will haunt you for a lifetime. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this on cable one time in 1985 (for the 10th time), and it was great.  It was just the kind of good, silly fun you remember from a Saturday matinee of a movie.   So, I guess you could say it was a Saturday Night Movie, but with more of a sense of adventure.  I always loved the music and the voices, and it always felt like there was something happening.  The movie did seem to have more humor, and more fun, but it didn't seem to take itself too seriously.  What I really liked about it was how it wasn't just a "Saturday Night Movie" or a "Family Movie," but a movie that could have stood on its own two feet.  Nowadays, it seems like movies are almost all about the same thing: action, adventure, and humor.  If you liked Saturday Night Movies as a kid, or if you really wanted a good Saturday Night movie, you could get it on the cheap on the street.  So it was nice that it had something more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't remember when this movie was first made but this movie has a nice old feel to it and it seems that this film was originally made when the American and British war efforts were still going on.   The movie tells the story of Johnnie Lee Jones and his war buddy Tommy Dorsey, both from the Army and both from New York, that fall in the middle of the war.  There are two other movies that have this story but this is one of the only ones that was made at the time it was made and is still in print and has never been released on video.  It's a well made story of two soldiers that come together and make one last effort to live out the last days of the World War II.  This film is great because of the actors that have it and that are the only two who come close to this story at the end.  I think I just saw it at the old AMC cinema in Manhattan at the very last minute because they don't make this kind of movies anymore.  If you are looking for a film that gives an old World War 2 feel to a modern war film I donÂ´t think this movie can beat it for that.  The picture is clean and it gives a sense of the old style war films without being too pretentious.  Overall I think this is a great movie but it does have a few flaws, mainly the characters, especially Johnnie's relationship with Tommy.  As far as the war goes I think it's one of those movies where if it wasn't for the fact that it was so recent that you wouldn't think that it still had the impact it has today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen it since I was young. It has great scenes in it, but it's only funny for a second and then the movie goes back to something more serious. The director was a very good director in the 60's so I suppose it holds up as well.   A very good movie that never really gets better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Very well acted. I don't think they were asked to, and yet they did it. They did an excellent job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In all my years as a film watcher, I've only seen one movie which managed to combine a brilliant script with some incredible performances - and that movie wasÂ  The Man Who Fell to Earth.   As a fan of many different genres of films, I'm never really put off by a film's lack of originality - and I was certainly never put off from seeing this film either.  The original idea of the film was one that I felt was very compelling, but the actual execution just felt very uninspired.  Although it was a fairly serious and slightly gritty film (which is what made it so great in the first place) it just felt as if it was trying to do too much - and in the process was quite inconsistent.  This film, by and large, just lacked the subtlety and sophistication that I feel the original film had, and that made it far more difficult to enjoy the film - which is to say, far more than I expected.   While some of the performances were very good, including that of the incomparable Jim Carrey as the titular character, the rest of the cast felt a bit out of place, and the rest was only allowed to shine because the film's plot was so fantastic - which it was not.  When you combine a plot which takes a seriously dark tone, which is not a genre I normally pay much attention to, with an incredible cast and a film which just didn't quite come together, it was almost too much to take in at once.  That being said, The Man who Fell to earth is just a masterpiece - and it's hard to imagine it ever getting the critical acclaim it deserves if it wasn't for its brilliant script and performances.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's main strength is its visual style, which, while not quite as cinematic as some of Spielberg's more recent efforts, certainly makes this one look very cool. The film has many memorable set pieces, from the alien spacecraft that is the centerpiece of the film to the space station that the aliens crash on. The effects work and practical sets are amazing. The acting is fine, with the performances by the cast mostly having you laughing out loud.   Some of the best "special effects" work is in the film, from how the aliens move and shoot and the way they change color as they transform back and forth.  The best character work, however, is done by the two humans, played by the great Richard Attenborough and the great Christopher Plummer.  All in all, a fun and very entertaining movie.   favorite favorite favorite favorite ( 2 reviews )

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this version of the tale, the plot is actually quite similar to the original (the characters are all very much the same, but the plot has changed) - and, in many ways, the story is better.  This is a true tale of friendship and loss and redemption, and the performances are very good.  The sound quality in this version is very good, and there are many of the old-time movie songs (like "Swanee River") that you would recognize (and many other familiar ones).  The dialogue is very much as it should be, and you can actually understand a lot of it without an interpreter (though you'll notice some mistakes and omissions).  This version was originally produced for radio in the early 1950's, and it was broadcast on Broadway on August 26th and 27th, 1953.  You can get it on video in its original size.  And, of course, you can always download this version from the internet, if you're interested.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this film in the theatre, I was really scared by the first scene where she is in a room alone. I was so afraid that she was going to do something so awful and so cruel to herself, and that is what was in her mind at the time. It is not an easy task to make such a beautiful film, and it was a good thing that the director, Michael Mann, took his time with this. If he had rushed to the action of the scene or rushed into a shot that did not fit, he could have ended up making a really ugly film. When he let his directorial vision go, it made it a really beautiful film.   The director, for the time, did an outstanding job on this film, which is probably one of the best examples of a period film in that it is a little bit more sophisticated in its ideas and more philosophical in its treatment of the characters and the events.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a fan of Stephen King, but this isn't a Stephen King movie. This is a Stephen Kings movie. It's one that will keep you guessing for a while, if not all of the way through. The movie has Stephen King's signature dark humor and the plot is very well thought out and very well acted. It definitely took me out of what was going on in real life, but I was definitely kept guessing throughout. I found myself really enjoying it, but there was a lot of plot to keep track of.   I'm not sure how to describe this movie. The story isn't very clear, but the movie is very creepy.  It definitely was a scary movie that I'd recommend watching once.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen this film in a long time and I was pleased with the new direction the directors took it in. This movie is very faithful to the book and its a pretty good rendition. This is one of those rare adaptations that doesn't feel like it's trying to mimic the book.   As the title says "Wool" is about a girl in the UK who goes into the woods and gets kidnapped by a man who uses a special device to communicate with animals. She finds herself in a world full of strange beings who have a strange language. The movie is pretty much a slow burn and the plot is so complex that it really takes you into the plot. It is pretty scary and the acting is excellent. It was a pretty rare movie to get on VHS so I was delighted to find this on DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a big fan of the Alien series (well, I've seen the original Alien, Aliens, and Aliens vs. Predator - the series is a real hit-maker). Alien, Predator, Aliens - these are my favorite movies. The special effects are always stunning, and these films have a very dark and brooding tone that is very different from the more light-hearted comedies of the time. This particular film also boasts a very talented cast, featuring John Hurt and Sigourney Weaver in a great lead/supporting role. I've watched a lot of these films over the years, and they are very well-done, but I always enjoy the films with a little more wit, and this film has quite a few that is delivered in a way that is quite different and more funny than what you see on the big screen. The acting is also top-notch, and I always find that Sigourney is simply great in the role of Ripley. I'm not sure why she doesn't get more love, but she definitely deserves it. As an aside, this film also features a few other great actors in Paul Freeman, and the great Roger Moore. The director of this film was Ridley Scott (Thelma & Louise, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Alien).

The scares, and even the gore scenes are truly scary.  This movie is a must watch if you enjoy horror movies.  A really well made movie that is scary without being over-the-top, and the acting is great.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves horror movies

The movie and the actors were all good at making this a "fun time out" and I was glad that I saw it!  A fun movie to sit and watch with your friends.  A great movie for everyone!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not sure if I should be happy or disgusted by the ending of this movie but I am a sucker for action, and this is a lot of fun!   The film has some good sequences, like when the two young guys sneak into a store and get away with thousands of dollars.   And it's a lot better than it has any right to be!  There is some interesting stuff in the story like the underground society, and the way the characters live their lives.  One of the most interesting parts of the movie is the way these two younger guys handle things.  These two get into a lot trouble because they don't want to give up on the lifestyle they have chosen.  The movie ends in a way that makes it seem as if the cops will catch these guys and bring them to jail.  I was really surprised by this way the movie ended.  It's not an over the top ending but it makes it all worthwhile.  Overall, the film is worth seeing for those who love action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie twice because I saw it on opening night and again at the film festival. I loved this movie and was able to appreciate all the great actors in it. It was well made and I can't wait to see this film again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It seems that almost every time someone sees a movie that is about the Vietnam War, they start to feel as if they are watching a movie about themselves or some other personal topic. It just feels wrong, like if a movie was made about something completely different, such as an AIDS-related movie, it would have just been awful. It's as if the entire movie was filmed for the sole purpose of getting the actor's blood pressure up, and then using the footage as a "coping mechanism" to avoid a more critical discussion of the Vietnam war.   The movie starts with this scene, which is also my favorite part of the movie: "The battle of Hue City was the first serious fight between the Viet Cong and the United States. It was an offensive, a major offensive to crush the Vietcong's offensive to the south.... The offensive was to get closer to the enemy-to defeat them and stop their further gains. The American forces had to move slowly and methodically, with the most daring action coming from the tanks."   I really liked this scene because it showed the "tactical genius" of the American troops, and I just love how this movie makes you feel like you are there during this battle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the best movie about a guy who works in the library.  I loved the way it kept up the suspense at the end and it showed how good he is at his job.  Also, there was a lot of sexual tension between the characters.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the most important movies that ever came out of Germany. The movie is absolutely mindblowing. The film is amazing and a must see.   If you like the movies from the 50s and 60s, this is a must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this movie but I heard the soundtrack was great. I haven''t watched it in a while so I didn''t know which film was the soundtrack.   The movie is about a guy, Frank, that loses his job and decides to buy an old trailer. I don''t remember if the trailer was an old car but it was a trailer. Frank decides to sleep in the trailer and finds himself in a small community.  He meets a girl, Janice and they start living together.  Frank has to work and Janice is a stay at home mom.  When Frank gets too old to work his trailer is stolen. He comes up with a plan to get it back, he goes on a road trip and the trailer comes back to him.  I heard this was made for the "Dangerous Road Trip" movie and I must admit I didn't really like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is very well done. Not so much a "movies" as a story about the way a family handles tragedy. The characters are good. It is just about the people, not the story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I also liked that they did not focus on any one girl and that the main character (played by Kevin Spacey) is portrayed as a loner who has no idea who he is. The acting is good, with Spacey being the best of the bunch. Spacey did not do anything that would cause people to say he was acting, but I think his performance does the job. There are times when I thought that he was playing a different character, but it was still fun to watch. I wish there had been more songs in the film. I like the music, but some of the songs were boring. It would have been nice to hear some of them at some point.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very well-made film. I would suggest this film as a good antidote to the recent films. It's not an action film like "Die Hard", but the story is quite good and the cast is top-notch. I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, a true and very well-crafted fantasy, has no real plot or any apparent goals of its own. The characters are as archetypal as they come. I love the way they are portrayed. I think there is an old proverb that says that true characters are those who are "like the old storytellers, and the little ones, and all who have been before them". I can't say that I am that old story-teller, but I certainly do think that I have had my share of experiences in life that I could relate to. This movie is for the young and inexperienced.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been a fan of movies about the Vietnam war and was a little disappointed to see it come out without a good director. However, I still enjoy it and found the cast excellent. The only thing I didn't like was the Vietnam theme but it was a nice little bonus that fit the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born and raised in the 70's and 80's, and as such, I grew up watching many of the classic serials of that time. I am not talking about those who only watched it on tv or as a special feature on a rare VHS, I mean the real classics, those the actors actually lived through, and not the made for tv movies like the ones I see all the time. This film was an inspiration to me as I could not imagine the show was in any way like the films they were based off. I was even more surprised to find the actors themselves had not seen the films when they were doing the role. I have always felt these shows were a little more "real" than the films themselves.   This film is no different. They were not making this for a hit, but rather as a historical piece for sure. It is a great look into the daily life of a large company in a period where the war was still on. It was not uncommon to have as many as four or five sets going at the same time during the day and nights in the factory, and it was very hard to sleep as all of the sounds could be heard from every direction in the city.  I have never seen a film more accurate in it's portrayal of the "real life" of an American company.  This one has some great acting, some of which is not even seen in the films, but that is the beauty of the film, you never know what to expect.  Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this movie is absolutely fantastic, it's not only the best film by this director, but also one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. Even the special effects are top-notch, and even the cast does a great job.   I'm not exactly a Star Trek fan, but I know the characters from this film and I have no problem with it.  This movie is definitely worth the watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason why I liked this film the most was the writing. It was very good and clever. When you see a movie like this, it is just as good as if you had seen the movie the first time.  The movie starts out with the main characters being at a dinner party at a rich couple's house. They are going through an inheritance and everyone has been invited. Then an old woman comes into the house and she introduces herself. She tells them she has an uncle who is going to be a very old man in ten years and asks if they will want to go to the old man's home. Then a big truck comes and a man appears in the middle of the road and says he has a big surprise. It turns out to be the old lady and her uncle who have traveled to their ancestor's house and he is dying. The lady asks them if they would like to be his heirs. The guys say no because he is already dead. The old woman says that her uncle wants to be remembered and he would like some of his wealth to go in the house. So the guys agree. Then they are all on a train heading for the house when they hear something fall out of the sky and it is a small stone. They run out of it and realize it is the stone that her Uncle had given them. It is the one that is said to have powers. So they are invited to stay and see what is going on. The main character's dad was actually the only one who wanted them to come to his home but the old woman wouldn't allow it. So she invited them to live with her. When they see the house, the guys realize that this is not their old home and it looks exactly like it was the old days. It had the same big picture windows. The first thing that they notice are the paintings, there are a lot of paintings on the walls. There are a couple of animals, a horse, a dog, a cat, a mouse, a snake and a monkey. They also notice that there is some very strange music playing, it seems to be very old. The Old Lady comes in the window at night and sings a song which the kids are a bit scared of. It seems to have some sort of evil influence on them. The kids are scared and run out. The one with the painting, the one who is supposed to be their uncle, asks the old folks how long they have been living in this house and
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many films in the "The Naked City" series, the nudity is minimal, which in this case is ideal, as it really emphasizes the contrast of life and death: a life-or-death adventure in the middle of a city where the only sign of life is the people who are out getting themselves killed.   This film is not really one you see every day, even if you have seen all of them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan. His films often have fantastic special effects, are very well acted, and have amazing plot twists. This movie is no exception.   This is an extremely fun movie to watch. There is some great action and some very well-developed characters.  They use a lot of special effects to help bring the scenes to life, and the actors in the film really get into the role. This isn't a bad movie by any means. If you're looking for a good action-packed movie, look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story about a young woman trying to make a living and who ends up being an unwitting witness to the death of her husband and a woman who goes to great lengths to solve the case is a bit of a stretch. The story is fairly standard with some real emotional moments but it does get to you, especially when she looks at the photographs and sees that it's her husband. A nice little drama with a very tragic ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had heard a lot of good things about this movie and my friends were all "what is this?" but I had never heard anything about this film. When I saw the trailer for it and went out and bought the DVD it was an instant "wow, I want to see this movie." The film is just absolutely great. You know what you are getting with this film and that's a quality film. It is funny, dramatic, and full of action and excitement. The script is just perfect. It's just so good. There are some great performances by a lot different actors. This film is absolutely brilliant.    My only complaint is that the movie is quite long at 118 minutes. I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a while and I am sure it would have made a great film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are moments in this movie that are just like the moments you remember from your childhood. The sound, especially in the scene with the kids being held down in the back seat of the car, and the music during a scene where the mother takes a walk.   The best part is when they cut to a kid running for the hills.  This is a great movie with a wonderful soundtrack and an awesome ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie, if you've seen a bunch of action movies, you've probably seen this one.   It's got all the right elements and the special effects are top notch, it was just a little too short.  My favorite part is when one of the henchmen goes to investigate a noise and the entire room is just covered in white powder.  I have to say that this movie is probably my favorite, I'm looking forward to the sequels. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just recently watched this film and it had me wanting to go back and see the original, the new one. This is an excellent film that reminds me of the classic sci fi films of the '50's. I enjoyed this film immensely.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in college when this came out, and I remember thinking it was a great film. I really do remember that I was impressed with the way they used a lot of the old footage and tried to get that feeling of classic Hollywood to it.   The way the story worked out worked very well, but I felt that the film never quite fully came into focus until the last third of the film, and in retrospect I don't really remember a lot about the rest of the films.  I really enjoyed this one and would recommend it to anyone.  - August 24, 2007Another classic
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a strange one and quite strange at that. It was not a great film, but it was the only one I saw with John C. McGinley in it.  This film was a hit in 1954 when it was released, but is rarely found on VHS nowadays.   My first viewing of it. I liked it, I liked the script, the acting was good, and I liked its visual style.  My rating for this film would be 2.5 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this a few times, but it really grew on me each time I saw it. It's not one of those Hollywood films that's out there to make a ton of money, it's not about trying to get an Academy Award, and it's really not an action movie. It doesn't have that much going for it, but when you go to a movie like that, you want it to be different, you don't want it just to be about explosions and cars. This is a real film, and every frame is so beautiful, and the dialogue is just right. I also really liked that the cast was really young, especially in the part of Jack Kelly. It wasn't like a classic hero of the western, and his performance was really spot on.    My only complaint is that the end credits are so small!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie to watch with a good time with friends, it's a great romantic comedy, and I always loved it.   I think the movie's most notable character, Darlene, really was an actress in her own right. I always wondered why she didn't get more recognition for her work.  The acting was wonderful, and Darlen always knew what she was doing.  This movie also has some amazing songs to go along with it, such as the "You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me" and the "Lavender Moon" by the Rolling Stones.  As far as I'm concerned, this movie is the real reason for the Golden Globe award for best film in 1962. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on television a few weeks ago and I was quite surprised at how good it was. It has lots of good action, humor, romance, action, romance and a good dose of humor all at the same time. It is really fun.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is excellent. The story is brilliant, the acting is fantastic and the movie is a very entertaining ride.  The film starts out slow, but builds as it goes along. The first half of the film is about the struggle of a poor family of two to raise their three children and get them to the school on time. The children have been spoiled by their parents who have only worked very hard at work.  At one point the father's wife is seen giving her son a hard time because the boy has failed his test for a government job.  After some badgering by the mother, the father and son come up with a plan to get the test taken. They bribe the clerk at the school, they pretend to be drunk, and they have a fight.  I liked how it turned out as it made the father realize his mistake in not teaching his children more responsibility and teaching them about money.   The children are played by some of my favorite actors of all time and I especially like the daughter.  There is a lot of violence in this film, but it's handled very well.  It is interesting to see a film where the family is all working class.  This is a fun and exciting family movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorites from the new wave of Italian horror. I think it was directed by the great Giuseppe Tornatore. This is a beautiful, creepy movie. I've seen lots of Italian horrors and this one has the unique touch that no other Italian horror has had. I love the setting. I'm sure the director wanted to make a really old, mysterious, atmospheric movie that could scare you to death but that it still had to look modern and spooky.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a bit afraid to watch this one, and I must say, I was very wrong.  I love horror movies, I really do.  But I am also a sucker for good cinematography, and for a good thriller, this movie is the latter.  From beginning to end this movie was suspenseful, and not at all boring.  And as I said before, this is one of those movies that just gets better and better with each viewing.  This movie isn't really horror, it's a thriller, and one of the best of the year.

The "Star Wars" series is very original in terms of both story and themes and I love seeing these new movies being released. The new director of this movie is one of the best in the business. There is a lot to like about this movie. It's funny, smart, full of action and suspense. If you haven't seen a "Jedis" film before then give this one a look.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this movie a few years ago and I've been meaning to watch it ever since.   As mentioned before, it's a story about a young couple that have recently been married.  However, the film is set in the 1920's, so that it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the movies in the film series (which are set in WWI or WWII, which is still the case, but at least that's still an interesting time period).   The film has many funny and interesting scenes, the director (C. Robert Cargill) has a great eye for detail, and the music, while it isn't exactly great, is very atmospheric.  The story takes a while to get going, but once it does, it keeps going and the story comes alive.  There's a great story here, and it's one of the few films of its kind that I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was at the movie when it was originally released. I saw it in the theaters as well. I loved the movie. I didn't know it was a reboot at first. I thought the original was great. This was even better. The original was set in the 20's in Germany. This one is set in a dystopian future. You don't know where you are until the ending. I can see why people would want this film. It's really dark and eerie. I hope the producers will produce another installment. It should be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie twice now, and both times it was brilliant. The first time I saw it I remember thinking "This is great" and thought it was a great story with a great cast. The second time I watched it I couldn't believe how good the movie was, and the same thing happened to me.   There are so many things I enjoyed about this movie: 1. The performances are great. Everyone on the screen has a great sense of humor and always makes you smile. 2. The acting. I don't think there is anyone else who can make you laugh as much as Tim Robbins and Kevin Kline do. 3. The music. Everyone seems to be in a great mood during the film and the songs are always a treat. 4. The special effects. They have a lot of fun with the effects and make them very interesting to watch. 5. The story. The actors are really on a roll here and it's an easy way to watch a great movie. 6. The cinematography. I've only seen this film once, and that was a good thing, because I was very impressed with the way the film was shot.  Another thing that surprised me was the story. It really didn't make much sense, but it's still entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this movie twice now and had a great time both times. The story is very good. The actors in the film are good and the acting is perfect. My favorite scene is when the men (all white) decide to get revenge on the women because they felt so sorry for the two black men who they shot and killed.  It was very satisfying to see an older woman take out two young men who killed her husband.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to hate on all the "white men" in this world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at first a bit skeptical about this movie. But i was very pleasantly surprised. The movie made me think more deeply on death. I felt much more empathy for the dead. I have heard a lot of talk about how bad it is to think about death. And I have to say that i thought that the movie did an excellent job of making people think about it. I think that this is a movie for everyone. It is sad, but it is sad in a way that makes you think about life. I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever wondered what it would be like to have a bad job and the constant fear of losing it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is really good, with a little bit of the romance. There is not really any dialogue for the most part, so it is just a bunch of talking with the kids. I would give it 5 stars, but a little more from the kids I would!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a special place in my heart. This is a beautiful tale of love and loss.   If I had to describe the plot I would say that it's like a fairy tale come true. A man and his wife have been married for a long time, he's very much in love with her and they have a good life. But in his 30s he goes off to join the army. He returns home in a terrible state, after a few days he is found brutally murdered by her best friend. His death has left her in a coma, with her mind slipping into a catatonic state. It's really a beautiful and touching film. I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie because I heard that it was a great, "realistic" portrayal of an alien invasion.   The movie started with some good visual effects and a good score, but it didn't hold my attention very long.  It started out with a very slow, slow-motion explosion.  Then it zoomed up, into the air, into a space ship, and into a flying saucer.  The "alien" spaceship was very large.  I looked into the screen, and the alien's "eye" was moving around, so my guess is, it's a very realistic look at what alien eyes would look like.  We then saw a very large "alien", "alien body" floating through space.  After that it zooms up, again into the sky, and then it was on a ship.  All the movie had was a slow zoom in, zoom out, a flying ship, alien body, and more flying ships.  Very slow paced, and all the "alien movies" are very much like this.  That was it, and that's what I wanted to see.  Not bad, but not the kind of movie I'll be watching again.  Hopefully, some other director will make a good "alien movie." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in a bit of a state when I got this, not really sure what to expect from this one. The director is known for his psychological thrillers, and he seems to be getting better and better at them. The film, as you would expect, focuses on a young woman who comes into a town where people are slowly dying off from a mysterious disease. The movie has a great sense of suspense, and is made better by a great performance by Charlize Theron. This film is so good that I am surprised I haven't seen it before. The only thing that would make this film better is a bit more time and money to get more shots of the town.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a bit skeptical about this movie. I have been a fan of the series and I am very excited to see how this will end.   It is an exciting and violent story about a band of mercenaries who must fight their way back from the Philippines.  The violence is graphic and the characters are very well done.  They were able to bring in very interesting and well acted characters.  Their chemistry made this movie really good.  It would be great if this were to be remade.

I am a huge fan of James Bond and have been waiting to see a movie with a 007-esque actor. It was great. I did enjoy it more than I thought I would, but I could have done with some better editing and some more action in it. A nice twist at the end but I would have liked to see more action. It had its moments, especially when M meets up with a new Bond-like villain. I really loved the use of the music and the movie was just very enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched this movie last night at my parents. We had never seen this film before and were in for the long haul.   My kids were really into this movie, even though they were 3 and 5. We kept trying to get them to shut up and watch it, but they just kept laughing.  And the sound design was great too. I didn't understand why I needed it because I am hearing it on TV.  A couple of things I don't understand: 1) I thought it was a bit long, but the end was nice and short.  2) I donÂ´t remember the movie name, but I canÂ´t find it on the internet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great family drama about the love between two parents and their children.   An excellent example of how not to be creative.  I understand that the director wanted to get her child into a movie and it was not his fault that she had a bad temper and turned the entire movie into a disaster.  She has a temper and a bad attitude towards anyone that gets in the way.  This would have been better if the wife was a bit more creative with her role.  In my opinion, she should have gotten some money from the producer to play a more creative part in the movie.  It was not her fault that the movie was so bad and she did her best in the part.  The movie was well worth watching for the story and for the two acting parts, but if the director was willing to give her a better role she would have probably been better in the role.

I've always thought of this as a buddy comedy.  But, there's something more going on in this movie.  A very serious and dark story with a very real and touching end.  The movie's ending is brilliant.  What's amazing is that I've seen it a few times and just always knew this movie would be remembered in years to come.  It just keeps you there for a long time, waiting for more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As usual, John Hughes did an amazing job with this movie, which is the perfect film to take on the last weekend of June. I think the best part is when the two people are talking about how they were watching it when the ship is crashing into a giant whale (it really is that good). I am a sucker for a good crash/wreck scene, and this was it. It will be great to see this in some sort of digital transfer, because it looks really good. The sound is a bit better, because the ship was in so much water and the sound really was very high pitched. It sounds like it was done in a movie theatre, because of the way the sounds are compressed. I have always thought that John Hughes' films are very good in their own ways.   The only other thing to mention here is that there are some amazing scenes of the beach that you can see from the boat, especially the scenes with the guys playing in the water, as it is really beautiful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the only reason this movie is better than it looks is the quality of the actors (and the effects). There is an awesome sense of the creepy nature of the movie. It has the feel of an old forgotten film, but if you are looking for the old school horror/ suspense movie, this is it.   This movie is very atmospheric, and well shot. You will be surprised at how scary the movie is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie. I love the acting, and it was fun to see how the characters interact.   The action scenes were great and there was a good twist at the end that kept me on the edge of my seat.  I wish they would use CGI in the future because I wish I could have seen this on television, because it was like being in a real movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched the movie before I heard the name Michael Bay. And I was instantly sucked in by the visual effects and by the story. It was definitely worth the price of admission. The cast was great. John Travolta was perfect as the villain, and all the cast worked together very well in creating a film that was full of tension and action. My only complaint is that I feel there is a missing piece in the movie. It has to do with the romance between the main characters. There were so many kisses in this movie, but only a couple of them were real.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked this movie and was glad the director kept his plot on track.   This movie is a fun family movie about a boy who is sent to the hospital by his mother and discovers a secret room under his house.  I think the characters in this movie were very realistic and they fit in the place that they found themselves.  My only problem with this movie is the ending because i thought it was a little silly.  They go back to the past and go back in time and try to find out who murdered this child.  The ending was so silly and rushed.  But if you want to watch a fun movie about the kid who went to the hidden room then this is it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie.   The story is so intense.  I like how you never know who is going to come back, and who is just going to be thrown in and left for dead.  The acting was wonderful.  A lot of action and you can tell the actors are having a lot of fun.  Definitely worth seeing, and if you're a fan of movies like this, definitely check this one out!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film, even though its plot was not that innovative and the acting was not all that good, was a very enjoyable film that had a very dark and depressing message about what happened to the survivors of the nuclear bomb. The film would have benefited a bit more from an introduction of the whole nuclear bombing story before plunging into the story of the survivors. The action scenes were very good as well and there were some great close-ups of people going through the physical, emotional and psychological scars of the blast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good, thought provoking film that will stay with you for many years. It has been said that the most interesting thing about this movie was its focus on the human character. While it had a lot of action and a few twists, it never lost sight of the fact that there were many, many people involved. It was a human tragedy, but it didn't go on to be an epic story about people who were doing what they thought they were doing. It is the human side that the film focuses on that made it so moving.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw the movie on opening weekend in a dark theater.  I didn't know it was a comedy.  The story was not as funny as some of the other jokes in the movie but the acting was very well done. Â The movie was not a comedy I wish it were so.  It is a great film that could be in my personal favorite movies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had been told by some friends that the script for the film "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" was written by James Cagney for the screen and was in fact, "the first American film to be shot in the United States with a black man as the main protagonist".  At first this seemed a bit unbelievable, but in fact it was true, this film was made by the "Cooper Coon" Studio (whose name I don't recognize), and the main actor was James Cagle.  The story is based on the true story of John T. "Jack" Pershing, the hero of the Spanish-American War, who was the President of the United states from 1898 to 1900.  His administration was so close to defeat that he asked his Secretary of War to call for an invasion of the island of Cuba.   The invasion took place in February of 1903, and the Cuban army was completely destroyed, and a Cuban general and the President himself were killed.  In this movie the story has been told in a very realistic manner, and although there are some flaws, the acting is excellent.  I liked the style of the production.  James Caguley (Cagney) was a very charming man, and his wife (J.S. Graham) is an extremely beautiful woman.  Cagley did an excellent job as the man.  For those who don't know, the "The Third Man" is the best film about the Spanish/American War ever made.  A very funny film, and if you're looking for something that is a little bit different from the "typical" Hollywood, this is definitely worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm surprised this didn't win an Academy Award. This is the true story of a woman who is kidnapped and held in a house for 15 years by three men. She escapes and is on the run for 14 years. This woman is a very tough woman. The plot is not a spoiler, it's a true story. The director has a wonderful sense of humor and I liked the way he used this film as a vehicle to tell a story.    A movie that has stuck with me for a long time, it was my first introduction to the James Stewart filmography.  The acting is good throughout, the cinematography is amazing, and the music is just perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â This is the most entertaining movie I have seen since my last visit to the film studios.   I don't know how this film is made but it is so well made that you would think that it has been made for decades.  It shows us an era in which the "wisdom of the crowd" was at its height.  The people at the studio are not too smart but they do a very good job of making good money.  My only problem with this film was that the script was a bit over-the-top.  I like a good old fashioned western that is not too long and not too short.  Here you have a film that has a good time and you would be hard pressed to find a worse script than this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this at a movie theater, and I thought it was a really great film.

I also really liked this movie, but not for the sake of watching a scary movie.    A great movie to watch with the kids!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first experience with Troma was in the late 90s on a late-night bus ride up to Los Angeles with some friends. I remember watching a Troma movie that was very popular when I was a kid (Tales from the Crypt: The Curse of Frankenstein ) that my brother and I watched from the back seat (just so I could watch a scene in the back where I was covered in blood). I remember how much we liked this movie and we loved it so much that I had to see it again and again.  I loved it, but I don't remember the ending, because it was all too real. I'm not sure I would have been able to handle the gore in this film (even though it was well done). I think I would've preferred a "family friendly" ending that ended with just one happy ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is awesome! It is hilarious, and you laugh so hard. I like how you see the old man who lost his wife to her death and her father who is still a bad guy because he's trying to get his revenge on the killer. He is just really creepy and scary. The guy has to be the biggest creepiest character I've ever seen in a movie.    It's awesome. I love horror movies and when they don't go for a "scary" feel, they are usually really funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the few times that I feel that some movies just have to be seen as an adult. This movie is about what happens when two women who have been partners for decades have a disagreement. The movie is so raw and emotional that the audience needs to be very involved. It is so hard for me to watch it now because it sounds so real that I could see it happening.   I really did enjoy this movie and if you are looking for a true story this is an easy one to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this movie it feels like a real movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pretty skeptical when I first heard about this movie as it's not a very well known series (the "Rurouni Kenshin" series) and it seemed kind of "unliked" by a lot of anime fans (mostly because they tend to take the series too seriously and have a really negative attitude towards it). I didn't really care for it but it was still nice to see an actual Japanese movie about one of the stories in this anime series. The acting is great as usual, it's well made. The music is excellent and the acting is quite realistic as well. The movie really captures the spirit of the Rurounis.   The movie is about a group of thieves who become caught up in a war between the Kenshin brothers. They're all heroes in their own right and have all earned the right to become the next shogun (a very powerful leader of the Japanese military). They get caught up, along with other members of the team (and also several other people who have become enemies of the Kenshins) who are all trying to get the treasure (and all of them are just looking for a way to escape from their current situation). All of this happens in a matter of just 2 days.  I don't really have much to say about the movie other than it's pretty good and it has an absolutely great cast.  The story is really well done and it really shows what kind of people these characters are. They have all made some pretty big mistakes in their lives but they all make up for them by being so awesome and heroic. It's a fun movie that will keep you interested through its 2-3 hour runtime. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie while I was staying with my father for a few days. We rented it while he was in Las Vegas. It was one of the better movies he'd ever seen.   The story revolves around a former Navy Seal who returns to his hometown after he's shot down in Vietnam.  When he arrives he sees all the stuff he left behind, such as his dog, and it was such a great, unexpected, "aha!" moment.  The acting in this movie was great and when the story ended it really made me cry.  There were other good movies during the late 80's and early 90's that were based on true stories like WarGames, but this one was the best and also the least expensive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this on VHS from 1983-85. It's a nice retelling of the story.  I like this version better.  The story is just as good as the original, with a more "adult" look. The acting is also great.   It was nice to see a real-life person playing the part of the "mad" girl who had the kid tortured for money.  It's not so funny.  This version is much more of a thriller than the other ones. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has great acting and is a comedy. It also has the typical Hollywood plot holes and ridiculous characters.    Helpful one:  I've seen this movie more than 5 times, so I thought I'd share my opinion that this is one of those movies that just doesn't work. I would have been much better off watching an episode of "SCTV" on a bad-movies night.  I didn't see it when it was released in the 1980s, but it is a classic and I recommend it to a few friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the very best films I've ever seen. I saw it in theaters at a small, independent theater on a small town in upstate New York. It's about a couple that had a very tragic end to their love story and they spend their last few years together trying to move on. There are beautiful moments of tenderness, sad scenes, and intense emotional devastation that make this a powerful film. I've only seen it once but I'm planning to return in a few months. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a big fan of the first film in the Alien series, and was hoping for something in the same vein.   In the original film, we didn't get the same character (and certainly not the original creature, although it certainly looked very much like it).   This sequel gives us the same story as the original, with even better special effects and a terrific score. Â The story was actually quite good and well told, and did a nice job in setting up the next installment.  Unfortunately, the acting is a bit of a let down, although most of it is not especially bad.  However, the story is a very interesting and intriguing one, and the whole film is a fun ride.  It's a good time, and I certainly recommend it to Alien fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was great. If I had seen it in grade school, it would have been one of my favorites. I can't really go into details but basically, the plot involves a young man named Bill, a local barber who wants a chance to live the American Dream. The dream is destroyed by a woman named Molly, who has cancer and wants to take over Bill's barber shop.   As I said before, the movie was well done. The acting was perfect.  After watching this movie for a long time, I really appreciated the music from the great song that came on the movie's TV theme song.  This isn't really a movie that you have to see twice.

But, it was really enjoyable. It has the right amount of twists, the right pace, and the right scares.   The movie is basically about a couple of friends who go to a cabin to look at some old maps and books. When they arrive they find out that the whole place was built to look like a haunted house. It takes on this life of it's own, and everything feels real. I think that this film has been underrated in the past, but this is a great movie to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I are avid film lovers, and this was our first go-round with "Pitch Black". It was a fun romp that left us with some of the most unforgettable memories in the house!   We enjoyed the laughs, the scenery and of course the actors - John Malkovich, Bruce Willis, David Bowie, and Jeff Bridges.   One of my favorite scenes is when Malkovich and Bowie are in the car, as they're about to leave for the set of the film. Bowie has a brief glimpse of his dead father, and he then turns his attention back to his "new" friend, who is now an old friend.  The film was shot in a real desert location, and the weather was as hot and hot and sunny as can be.  This movie is not for everyone, but if you have enjoyed "Mulholland Drive" - and you have an appreciation for the kind of humor that can be found in "Morrow, " then this is a must see.

Like I mentioned before, the actors are great, but I always wondered how they got the roles, but here's an interesting thought...how did they get the roles if nobody watched the movies and the actors hadn't even been in the films.  The movie is about a "travelling circus" and they make a deal to travel to the middle east, they get kidnapped by terrorists, and after a few days in captivity the kidnappers decide to sell the "tourists" as slaves and then kill the tourists.  Well, the trip is quite a success and the circus troupe become very successful in the middle eastern countries, but they are about to have another problem, they have sold themselves out to the terrorists...

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie as part of the "New American Cinema" series with Roger Corman. Roger, who is a veteran of great movies, does not disappoint. He is still in his prime. He made this movie with his longtime writing partner, Robert Evans. The best thing about this movie is the cast. I thought these four were wonderful. They were very good in every role. My favorite was Robert's son, Peter Corman, who was a big kid, but could have been even bigger. He played the younger son and he was adorable. Robert would do anything for his children, even if it meant he would die in the process. It was fun to watch him in his own world of action. This is definitely one of my favorite films.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched this movie at least a half dozen times and enjoyed it every time. The acting was outstanding, and the story was very thought provoking. It was an interesting and entertaining drama about the struggle between good and evil. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good and thought provoking drama.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the beginning I thought that this movie was nothing special. But then after the first hour of it I began to care for this movie. I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.   When I first heard the song for this film, I thought it was a cover of a very old song. I didn't pay too much attention to the song because it seemed that the director was going to use that song for a few more seconds. After the first time they played the song, I realized that it was something else.  The movie really grew on me and it became very interesting.  This film has a lot of heart. I hope that you will see it at a screening, or even in the theater. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason why I loved this movie so much was because it was about two families living in rural South Carolina and they had two little girls.   They lived in a beautiful house in the country where they raised their two little girl. Â I don't know what their names were, but I know that they were always close to one another and had a very close relationship.  After a while, they got into trouble because of their actions.  One day, they decided to drive to see a movie and ended up driving too fast and losing control of their car.  They both died and their little girl had been in a very bad car accident.  Her little brother's mom was driving but she had no idea what happened and she had to stay at the hospital.  The mom was a very beautiful, very kind woman, but the daughter was an ugly, very ugly girl. So, her mom decides to have a funeral to help pay for their daughter's funeral and the whole family comes to see the funeral.  This is the only movie that I have seen where you can see the family sitting together in the room watching the funeral and it looks like a real family.  It also made me think of my father and the time that I told him about the time I went to a movie with my friend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The original version of "The Wizard of Oz" is actually very good, but the 1939 remake is way better. I loved that. There's an awful lot of "A" work in this one too. This one is probably the best of the original "Oz" movies, although it's still an amazing feat that the guy who was so good at making "The Wiz" was also pretty good at "The Scarecrow", "The Tin Woodman" and "The Cowardly Lion". - July 12, 2009The Scarecrows are better
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited to see this movie. I love those old gimmes. A lot of people talk about that film and how bad it is. I've seen it many times and still really liked it. It's not the best film ever but it is a very entertaining and interesting film.   The story is about a man who has been working for the government since he was a kid. He is called to a mission in Alaska and has a bunch of crazy and evil men after him. The man has a good friend who can understand what he is doing. They go to a location where the men have killed a bunch o' people and then buried them in a giant pit. They find a big black box and the man takes it home. There are strange drawings in it and a huge picture of the man and his friend on it. After some time, the man returns home with the box and starts to work on a computer program that will help the government keep tabs on him. I don't know if he had it on him at the time but the box gives him a lot of power and control over others.  The plot is really simple. You'll understand where it is going by the end.  I love to watch these movies on the old VHS and there is something about them that makes you want to see them again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a nice movie to watch when you feel sleepy. I think the story could have been much better. The movie is very good at getting you interested in what is happening.  The soundtrack is well done and really helps create a mood in the movie. It reminds me a little of Star Wars, but with zombies.  I was watching it on a late night, and it was perfect.  There were a couple times when I thought it was a bad movie and that it was just a rehash of another zombie movie, but nothing else really happened.   I really do wish the plot was changed up a little. Â The zombies were more interesting and seemed to come up out of nowhere and kill you.  But I still enjoyed it, and I think a few more people would as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had just watched the new movie, "The Revenant," and wanted to see the old "The Man Who Would Be Bond" on a big screen.  The movie itself is a good one and features some excellent performances.  When I saw the credits roll, I was just about ready to go see it.  This was a big movie back in the 50s when it was being made.  A true action picture, with great stunts and some very scary scenes,  This is a great movie and is worth a watch.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very entertaining, witty, and fun flick.   The best thing about this movie is the way the director manages to make an old 80s film look fresh and new.  As a director, he definitely shows that he is at his very best when he is pushing the boundaries of his own medium. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An epic movie with a lot of characters. Great acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, I must say that I was surprised to see this movie being made. It's a great adaptation of a great story, and a great cast. The story is set in ancient Greece, and follows the adventures of a young man and a young woman trying to survive in the wilderness as they try to find their way home. The movie is really fun and well done and the acting is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you're in the mood to watch a good mystery movie like   The French Connection, this movie is the perfect movie to start with. This movie has great characters that have to work together to unravel the mystery of the murder, and it's easy to follow them with the great performances.   You really have to see the movie to understand what they are up to, but if you are a true detective movie fan, you won't be disappointed with this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a scene in a movie that is very well done that was very upsetting to me. It made me sad. I think it was a great movie. The script is great. The acting is great (Dalton, the movie was set in 1960's so they didn't have the technology to do real acting) but the scene is very disturbing to see. It has not a lot of dialogue but the feeling it gives is so real. It is a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you've ever watched a classic movie like The Godfather, you know that violence is the last thing you want to see. In the case of The God of War, it was the last step in the brutal killing of a powerful emperor and the end of his dynasty. What could possibly go wrong? It did, and this is a movie that never forgets the fact that its violence is shocking, but always carries the weight of its own credibility and consequence. I love violence in cinema, but I really appreciated this movie for not treating its violence like a joke. The acting is great as always, and the cinematography of the series is incredible.    As far as this is concerned, you will not be disappointed. If you love action films, this is one you don't want to miss.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film in the cinema at the end of the 80's and it had just about everyone in tears. This film is about a beautiful young girl who was killed during a street gang fight. She was killed and the gang leader's son ran away but later he was found dead. This was a great story about a troubled boy who was a member of a gang of young people.   They did not use the classic fight scene that is shown in movies every day. I thought it was great that they used a fight scene in a movie.  I think this movie has an old school look to it, which is really cool.  This was the first film I saw that was set in the 80s and it has aged really well.  It is really weird that this was made in 1985 but the 80 is no longer relevant.

I recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite films.   What more can you ask for in a thriller?   This is the kind of movie that I just cannot get enough of.  I just finished watching it and just felt so much anticipation about the next part of the movie that it almost felt like I could wait for it to start.  In my opinion it is the best thriller I have seen.  The acting was amazing and I loved it so much.  This movie is so much fun, just amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's like a Disney movie. It's all about a group of guys getting married. It was a great movie. The cast was perfect.   There was something about the guys that kept me watching it. They were funny, they were good looking and they weren't obnoxious. It had a romantic atmosphere to it, which is perfect for a Disney wedding.  This is not a typical Disney wedding film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first watched this movie with my family about ten years ago. It's a story about a very young girl that meets a man on the beach and after an argument and some arguing, they both decide to go out on a date. She doesn't realize she's getting involved in a relationship that her family disapproves of.  The movie is about the young girl trying to figure out her life. She has this boyfriend that she doesn't want to see anymore and when her mom finds out about it she's furious with her daughter and she sends her and her sister back home.  At the beginning the movie's very slow and it's a real slow burn. The girl's character is a little bit older and when we finally meet her, she is much more independent and smart and she's actually trying to keep her mind off the boyfriend and how she feels about him. She gets all the dates and he doesn't. And then one day at the beach she realizes she loves him and it really puts an end to their relationship.  It doesn't hurt that she's really sweet and smart, and she really gets into him.   This movie is a real sweet story of love and acceptance and understanding between two people that need each other and realize what's important in life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was really nice to see that there were people out there that cared about the future, that still felt a part of this place that many of us never wanted to leave. We are so lucky to still live here after all of these years.   The film is a true story and was shot in 1970. The movie was shot by Sam Cooke and made the director a star, and the movie is actually more than a simple documentary, it is also a documentary of a time, when the future was still an open question, and people could not yet truly believe that things would change, but would they change how they felt?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't seen it already, go see it NOW.  It is really funny, it has some good laughs, and it is an awesome movie.   The actor in it is really good, and is really cool to watch.  The action scenes are real and have some great scenes and stunts.  I really like how they show the scene where they drive to the airport and the airport guy tries to stop them but they are not stopping at the airport...they are speeding towards the ocean.  I highly recommend this movie for all you action fans out there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you don't mind seeing a lot of naked bodies, this movie is worth watching.   It stars David Bowie, whose acting and music make him appear quite cool and likeable in this movie. He also gives a memorable performance, while David Hasselhoff plays a nice guy, with a nice smile.  They are also pretty good at making the bodies look sexy.  A lot of people have complained about how bad the special effects are, but I don't see how they could make the bodies looking more realistic than this movie, that has all the "realistic" special effects possible.  This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first one in many ways. I'd give it 5 stars if I could. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is well made and well acted.  The performances are all well done, and some really are amazing.  I enjoyed the characters as well.  There is an interesting way of showing a couple of the emotions in a relationship.  Overall, the film is a fun action-adventure-romance-fantasy.  It's about a young couple who have a son (who's in trouble) that they have to save from an evil demon.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My friend and I have been friends for many years, so to me, "The Best Man" is the ultimate in my book. It's an honest film that is funny, touching, heartfelt, and heartfelt. You can't really go wrong with a movie about a gay married couple.

It may have been a tad too heavy-handed with some of the symbolism, and the acting was a little stiff for some of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want a good film, you have to go to Germany. This film is very old. That is not a criticism. It was produced by a very experienced director. If you are into period pieces or movies from the thirties and forties, you will not get a better movie than this. You get it on a small budget but the director uses all the old film stock, which brings out the colors. The cast is superb. They are a little older than you would think but they look young. It is the actors' acting ability that puts this movie into the category of masterpieces.   I had been interested in this film for many years because it was made in the late 1930's and the star was a German actress by the name of Lina WertmÃ¼ller. You can get the film on DVD. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in that era. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a little kid, I remember seeing "The Wizard of Oz" and being amazed at the magical world and all the weird characters and things and I always remember this movie very fondly and thinking it was so amazing. I didn't get to see this until much later and I remember thinking "It's not like it's old. It doesn't look old."   I am in my forties, a mother of two, and this movie is still on my mind. I think I'm going to watch this again and it will be a lot of fun!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really looking forward to the new movie by the director of "The Crow". I'm really glad I did. The movie was pretty good. I really thought the movie was over the top and over acted but that is just my opinion and I can't really tell what was happening, so it wasn't that bad, in fact it was pretty funny.    The movie is pretty much an action flick that was not really about what I was expecting and that I think worked. The action is great, but I would've liked to see more.  The movie is over thetop and over acting but that doesn't bother me much, it's what it was trying to be so I think it succeeded.

Unfortunately the neighbor has a big yard with lots of dogs and he decides to keep them all in check and take them out at night.  While he is away one of the dogs breaks out and attacks a boy.

I loved the way they used the story of a girl who is searching for her mother and who is also in a horrible relationship with her boyfriend. The ending was very nice. I was just so surprised to see how much the characters were getting hurt by the person they love and are in love with. It was very realistic.   I would recommend this movie if you like a good happy ending.     Movie:  There was a scene in this movie that i loved and that i hated.  The scene was when the girl is in the house and she's watching her mother come and get her and it was very painful to watch. i love the movie for a few reasons. it's so good and has some of the best moments in my opinion. the sound was great, i loved the music and the ending of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think you could get a worse deal on this one, but that's a minor point. I'm not a big fan of zombie movies and this was not a good one.  The special effects and sound are good, but the movie is badly written and directed.   At one point I thought I was seeing it for the first time, I could almost see the movie being made in a cheap 80s gore movie.  I was never impressed with the acting either, it was all very fake, and I thought there were a lot of stupid lines.  My favorite part is when the guy says, "I've been waiting a very long time for this."   If you see this, don't bother seeing it again, you'll be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a big fan of sci fi movies. I am also not a huge fan of the "hijack/franchise" type movies. But there was a scene in this movie that really got my attention.   It was at a space station. The Enterprise crew were out on a mission. Their ship was damaged and a "freak accident" took place. They were having a tough time communicating with the space station on the other side of the galaxy. After an attempt to communicate is cut short by a storm. In an attempt of the crew to find a way back home, they were trying to use a relay device. It was an old model and as they tried to use it, the space storm hit the ship and rendered it useless. A lone engineer, called Jim Kirk, was trapped in a space suit. The only way he could save himself was to use the "jig" to break free from the suit.  The only problem was, it didn't work.  It would only work when he was in perfect condition. He started to see "ghosts" and felt a "deathly chill" while trying to find his way out of his life-support suit. I knew if the movie wasn't as well acted that the film wouldn't work, but to see the entire crew go through that experience, was really disturbing to me.  If you like this movie and like the concept of a space captain in a suit, you'll find it very gripping. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're an aspiring actor, you probably aren't ready to work on a big budget movie. But if you're a fan of horror movies, and love horror films, this is the movie you should be looking at.   The film is written by Robert Zemeckis ( Forrest Gump, Back to the Future) and directed by Steven Spielberg, with an amazing cast that includes Tom Hanks, Anne Heche, Meryl Streep, and Susan Sarandon.  The story is not original, but it was the best I've ever seen for a long, long time, and I'm a huge fan of his films.  It's a movie with real heart, and a great cast.  This film is worth watching, and should definitely be added to your collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most original films that I've seen in a while. It's about a father who finds out his son has been murdered and decides to become a vigilante to try and stop it. I'd never seen a film that was so intense, so beautiful, and was a great action flick. It was also very interesting to see what sort of society the killer had grown up in, how he thought and acted.   The script is wonderful.  From the way the people speak to the way they react to him as a villain was a lot of fun to watch. It had a lot more story and was much more mature.  It's really a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last film I saw by John Carpenter (he's always good), I was skeptical but intrigued.   From the look of it, the film looks like it was a remake, a spin on the story of the "Darkman" (a.k.a. The Mummy).  I knew the guy who wrote the screenplay and I know he wrote it for Tim Burton, who never worked on a big budget movie and didn't care for the characters.  Carpenter came up with the idea, but I never saw the movie, because it didn't happen.  It wasn't really a good film, but what I saw was what I got.  I thought that the story was very good, with a dark twist at the end.  A good horror film, with some great characters and actors.  This film was made for Halloween, so you get some nice scares, a nice story, but it doesn't have the humor or the charm of a Halloween flick.  From what I hear, it will make a comeback sometime.

I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this film.  It had a real sense of humor to it, and the characters were fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in a movie theater in a different state than where I live, so I was not quite familiar with the name of the film. But I was hooked from the first frame. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the early 1930's. It's a great story about a family of working people and how they have to make a living in the face of what seems like a deathly situation.  Â The film does not make it easy, but it is a great look into the economic problems that the people of America were facing back in the day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I was looking forward to seeing this movie and I'm happy to say I enjoyed it. I've seen a lot of horror films and this one was my favorite.   The story is a bit different than I expected from a horror movie and the acting was good for the most part.  I liked the fact that there were multiple endings that kept me on the edge of my seat.  A nice touch was the use of old vintage cameras and the creepy sound design. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was a pleasant surprise to see what all the hype was about.  It had so much potential, but as a result of bad writing, it never had much life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was raised in a Mormon family in a small Utah town and went to school with them. I was a devout Mormon boy growing up, as I was in many other small towns. I had never been exposed to anything that would challenge me to doubt the gospel or to wonder if it really was true. I found it in watching this movie.   The way the characters talk about their faith was so convincing to me. It was as if the characters were telling their real selves to me in front of a camera.  When the characters went on the attack, and the attacks on other characters, I felt it. I felt that I had been exposed enough to realize that we are all flawed.  It was a great film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of the old school Superman, and I love the new movie as much as the rest of you! The action is a lot of fun, and the plot is just as exciting as the first one. What makes this movie a little better is that it takes a page out of Superman II, and doesn't follow it as closely as it should. I think the best thing about this movie is the fact that it was a lot funnier. There's some really great "whoa, wtf" lines throughout the movie. It also doesn't feel as "dumbed down" as many other superhero movies I've seen. I enjoyed watching it more than I did the previous movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is good. If you're looking for a "realistic" vampire movie, this is not for you, but if you're more into those things that don't really need to be done, then it's great!   It doesn't take too long for it to be apparent that the story, as written by Christopher Plummer and directed by Joe Dante, is actually quite good. The character work, acting and direction are top notch. The acting is excellent. A few things, like a lot of the acting, doesn't really hold up to a close inspection (I'm looking at you, Steve Carell). However, it's still a fun movie and it's always fun to watch someone who you think should be terrible in a movie like this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best I have ever seen, not just in terms of the acting, but the way the story was told. One of those movies that has an effect on you for a lifetime.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched the "American Beauty" movie so many times, I remember that the first time I was watching it it was a little off.   There was no connection between the characters. The dialogue was so over the top and so silly it just wasn't entertaining at all.  However this is one of the few movies that was completely enjoyable and worth seeing.  The plot to this movie is a little strange, but it isn't very complex.  In one scene the main character is on a trip to visit his sister, and it turns out she is actually his best friend's sister and they have never met before.  As the film is called "American beauty" it was made by the same company that made the "Beauty and the Beast" movie.  I guess that is why the movie is so good, because all the characters have so much chemistry.  At the end of the film there is a great payoff for the whole movie. The relationship of the characters goes from being perfect strangers to family. Â I guess you could call the entire movie "American Family."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie and the acting was phenomenal. The writing was also very well done.   There were some excellent scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing that was better was the original "The Thing" (1985). This movie has nothing on that!   "The movie is great and the monsters are amazing. I would go again."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best way to sum up a great movie is by saying it's an "action adventure", and I agree with that statement. The action is done in a believable manner and the characters are done well in order to give them the feel of a real hero.   Unfortunately, "The Good Soldier" is not a movie I will see often.  The story is very complex and takes place over an entire life and it gets in the way of the movie at times. I have to admit that it was a real challenge to watch and not be able to understand everything happening, but I would recommend this movie for someone who likes a "real" hero. "The Great Escape" should be on the top of anyone's "to watch" list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie about a great guy. My favorite movie of all time. I love the way the director got all the characters. He didn't focus on the one, so we got to see the other as much as we could.   Great job!   I don't like watching movies with bad acting. This is one of those movies with great acting and great acting. A must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most unique thing about this movie is not the story but the fact that it was written and directed by the same person. I didn't really notice the director until the second half, and it was amazing! He managed to capture a lot of the personality of the actors and give a very different impression of the characters. There are so many little details in this movie that make it unique and I can't wait to see it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is like a "what if" look at all of the characters. All of them are interesting, and we get a glimpse of all of their lives. My only complaint would be that the "sheriff" character, in a small town, seems out of place.   I will be watching this movie again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The original was a brilliant and moving picture that remains as a masterpiece of social and political cinema today. The remake has some fantastic moments, but the main problem is that it's just not good enough.  The plot is fine, but its execution is so bad.   This is a movie for the new generation, which is fine because they can look past the flaws and appreciate the brilliance of it.  I think the director was inspired by the real life "Manson family" in that he didn't try to make a movie about a rock and roll group who got caught in a weird political situation.  It just happened to happen to be "Marilyn Manson" and the story came out of his life as he tried to cope with the real world.  That's the kind of movie a guy like him could really write. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw The Big Lebowski I thought it was a weird, goofy comedy, but I was right. The dialogue is funny, and the plot is really convoluted. It takes a while for it to happen. In my opinion it's one of those rare "classic" movies that still holds up today.    I love it, and I know it's a hard one to find. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story was really good. The actors played their roles well. They had believable chemistry.   Very good acting and story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first saw this movie as a kid in the 80's I thought it was so ridiculous. I had no idea the guy who played the bad guy would turn out to be such a good actor, I mean the guy was so bad, and the dialogue was so stupid.   I guess I just loved the movie and wanted to see more of it.  It seems like a lot of people have seen it at one time or another, and a few of the scenes are still so funny it's hard to believe they were actually made in the 30's.  This was a real rarity back in the day, and you can't find it on Netflix today!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is good! I think that it's good, a bit "harsh", and probably too "bogus", but for the story, it is good. It's got a good story and I liked it very much, especially the fact that it was the real thing.   I hope the director does some more work on the script, and the rest of the film, as it doesn't really go anywhere. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to see the remake of The Exorcist this year. It is much more entertaining and better than the original. It has a much better story. A group of teens are possessed by the devil in the 1970's. I think this film will be the same one that was made in the 70's. It just had a more original feel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the first movie to give me goosebumps when I watch it, like I know the story and how this all will be resolved.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like my son told me, "You can't take anything seriously."   And the movie is no joke.   The actors are superb.  We get to see the characters at their most vulnerable moments, and the acting is top-notch.  They do a good job of conveying the emotions of the characters, and sometimes, they have to be "unplugged" and let it come out as a character is speaking in a voice.  For example, when the wife tries to get her husband to get out of the picture, she gives us a little chuckle of delight. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had read about this movie on here, but I hadn't seen it.   In fact, I had never even heard of the guy that made this movie until I saw it. My daughter loves horror and I'm so glad that she found out about this film.  The movie looks and feels really good and the actors are all good.  My favorite part of the movie is when the young girl meets the old woman who takes her to a remote cabin.  I don't know if it was the old lady's voice or her eyes that made my daughter giggle, but that was the most hysterical moment of the whole movie.  This movie is fun for everyone and it definitely looks and sounds better than the video tape.  It has a few scenes that are quite disturbing, but those are brief and don't take away from the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have just recently seen this movie in a theatre. I really enjoyed it.  It reminded me of some old serials with an intriguing story, a bit like Dr. Kildare.  I also really liked how they made a movie that is so "out there" with some weird parts in it. I like the way they showed us how strange these characters are and what really happened to the woman who was supposedly shot.  The music also is quite good.   The only thing that bothers me is that when we see the shot of the woman, she is already dead and there is a man that's just standing there.  What am I missing out on here?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is based on a true story and is the true story of the real life kidnapping of John Lennon. It is a true account of what happened to John Lennon as his body was found in the back seat of his white Fiat Uno at about 10:30 in the morning. He was wearing an open shirt and shorts. It was discovered at the scene and was reported that John Lennon was dead. We do not know what happened after the kidnapping but it is thought that the man who kidnapped him was one of the gunmen in the bank attack on John Lennon in Mexico City. It's amazing that he is alive and living in this world. I was a big John Lennon fan as a young man and I am sure that if he was alive he would be smiling from ear to ear as he would have never wanted to live out his life the way he was lived out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this as a kid, and I was so excited to see what the original filmmakers had in store! And they did. It's great! It's a classic! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a classic example of how great it is when an author uses a good story or action to really let his or her imagination loose.   It's a film which, to me at least, has very little to do with the period of the 1930's.  The film is really about a hero, a guy named John T. Moore (the same name as the actor), who in the 1930s, was given the title of the world's greatest spy and sent into the Chinese desert to try and catch a criminal.  He ends up having to fight to the death with some of the toughest warriors he's ever come across and does it without being able to use his weapon.  It was a fun film to watch in the 80's. It is funny and fast paced, with a little bit of action and a bit of politics.  A lot of it is based on fact, some of it not even, but it's not a bad film. It's got a great soundtrack which is a little too old for my taste but that's what a good soundtrack is all about.  This film has a bit more gore than I'd like, but I can't get it out of my mind.  I was watching a very old silent film on DVD and heard something which made me laugh so hard. It wasn't at all obvious, but when I saw the film again I noticed something very funny. It was the film's ending and it was even more obvious then I could have imagined it.  If you like spy movies, a great spy film, or have seen a couple of good movies like this and like watching good action films, then you'll enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little bit worried about the film at first, but I have to give this movie a 10 out of 10. The actors in the movie were great. The film had a real sense of realism in it. I couldn't see anything but the stars when I was watching it.   It was an interesting story with a strong message and it made me think about what it really takes to survive on this planet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to confess, I did not like this movie. It was a little slow, but I was in the mood for some bad old "slapstick" and the cast did not disappoint.   The story was not original. A group of people are trapped in a barn. They are taken away by the police, but not before they shoot each other. I had seen a lot of bad slapstick, but nothing this bad!   It was very bad, and was a real bore. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is well made and features a lot of actors that will get the message across well. This film shows the effects of racism on our society. It also shows the problems of the police and how some people are treated as if they are not worth anything.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The original film from 1966 is so good in every sense.   There was a big fuss about the remake but it wasn't a remake at all.  The actors did a fabulous job.  I remember when the cast and crew first assembled on the set for the second screening of the film they were all amazed at what they had been given.  It was the best film the world had ever seen.  From the opening shots of the main cast, to the beautiful sound, it's a movie you have to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie by the great John Hughes is in my top 10 list of all time. It's one of my favorites, period. I'm not quite sure why I like it so much. The movie is set during the late 60's, but it feels like a mid 80's movie. A great movie to watch at 3 in the morning when the kids are off of school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â "The Rock" is one of the more entertaining action movies I've seen in years.   While it is more of a comedy, it still retains a lot of seriousness.  It's funny, but you can't help but feel for the characters.  There's something about Bruce Willis and his performance that just works.  It was a great film to watch with the kids.  Even though this was filmed more than twenty years ago, the movie still has a lot to it.  The action is still very well executed.  A lot of the set pieces are very entertaining and are definitely worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was very entertaining. It was very well acted and acted well. I laughed, I screamed, I felt, and I was entertained.    I have yet to see another movie that has a story that is as well acted as this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was just at the screening of this, and was so happy that I decided to get myself a ticket for the opening night. It was also wonderful to see how much a small, indie film can touch the imagination of the audiences. I just love all the little things they do, like putting in the extras or the small things like bringing the lights down at the end of the film. It's wonderful.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would recommend this movie for the fans of "The Terminator", "The Sixth Sense" and even "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". In fact, if you have a strong imagination then you would not need this movie to know what happens in the end of this movie. This is just a good suspenseful movie which has got a lot of heart in it.    This is an awesome movie, even the actors are great in this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Das boot" (German for "that boot") is a comedy drama about a man from the East who becomes a refugee after his wife and child are killed in a bombing raid. The story follows him and his young son as they try to adjust to the small town of Weimar, where it was just recently decided that all Jews have to move out. After several days of waiting, the man meets a handsome stranger who agrees to help him return to Berlin, but there's more to the story than just the return trip. It turns out that the man who wants the son to be his lover is part of the same underground organization that gave Hitler the power to commit mass murders. The film shows the character's anger and frustration, along with his own fears, in a very well written script. There's no denying that this film is a classic, and it will likely continue to stand the test of time. I've enjoyed seeing this classic again and again, and I hope it stays in print for years to come.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is an amazing one, I just can't stop talking about it, you need to see it, I'm telling you that, it's worth it.   There are scenes from the movie that I have not seen yet, so I can't really comment on it, but I know it's one of those movies you'll have to see and see it for a while to fully appreciate it. I've seen this movie before and loved it, this one is a very good sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie I've seen in a long time and an enjoyable experience. I would like to see this on Blu-ray and not on DVD as the picture and sound quality could be better. If you enjoy comedies or horror movies in the genre this is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw The Great Gatsby, my first reaction was "Oh my gosh, it is by F. Scott Fitzgerald!" This was a wonderful movie - a modern classic. It had the right cast, including: Â Sean Connery as the rich, wealthy, sadistic Jay Gatsbys, Â Sam Waterston as the feisty but loving and innocent Daisy,   Marlon Brando as the cold, deadpan mobster Nick Carraway,  Elizabeth Taylor as the seductive and sophisticated Gertrude Stein,  and the brilliant Sean Penn as Jay Gatz who is basically the world's greatest salesman.   This movie has it all.  This film is the best film adaptation of a great novel in history - it's just a perfect movie.  As far as the movie was concerned, it just blew me away!   If you love Fitzgerald's novel,  Â  This movie is for you.  - James L. Brooks
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Man From Earth" is the story of two aliens, a female and a male, who fall for each other. This is a fun movie, and I liked the aliens a lot.   The story is fairly simple and it is about two aliens who are very different but fall in love.  The acting was really good and the female lead (who isn't in any of the sequels or remakes) was pretty hot and I enjoyed her character.  This is definitely a movie for aliens who want to show what a good human being can be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very interesting film with very unique visuals and a story that is very unusual. I love the way the colors of the shadows were designed. It's a really cool technique.   The story is well written, and it has a very good flow to it. The acting was very good, the soundtrack was very well done and the cinematography was beautiful. The only thing that I didn't like was when the character who was telling the story would look at something behind the character and not really be paying attention to what he was saying.  Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about a boy who has never gone to school and his mother decides to take him to a summer school. He is in for a surprise when his mother says that she wants to start the year at the school and her son is not allowed to leave the house. This kid was so confused and didn't know how to handle the situation. The kid did the only thing he thought would work and it worked! He went straight to the principal and told him everything. His mother didn't seem to be angry. The principal told the mom that he was really sorry but the kid's father just doesn't want him in school. The movie was pretty funny, and the kids were all in great shape. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this movie, so I have no idea how good it is. However, it is really entertaining and has a great vibe. The acting was really good and the plot had a good progression. The only thing that bugs me is that the girl in the movie gets her hair done, but she wears it in the back. I understand that a lot of these type of movies are just for a laugh, but I can't help but think this movie would be a lot better if the girl was given a more revealing and revealing hairstyle.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie itself is a pretty good one with a lot of action in it. This is the first time in my experience watching a movie that i didn't have to sit there and be entertained but rather get an adrenaline rush from the characters being taken out in the field.   This movie really showed me how real that kind of war can be.  I would highly recommend this movie and i will be watching it again and again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard so many great things about this film, but no one really had the chance to see it, so I had to do it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The action is very real. There is more than a hint of a Hollywood flick and it shows. The movie takes place at the Alfa Romeolare race track near Milan. The car racing is in Italy and the tracks are in the US. The cars and driver were all real and have their own personalities. The film stars the legendary Alfa Romeo drivers Juan Manuel Fangio and Enzo Ferrari and was directed by Federico Fellini. There are great action scenes and scenes of racing with the drivers as well as the cars. A must see for any car guy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the movie there are a lot of people that talk about the movie as though it was a bad movie.   This movie was the last one to be made of the series.  It's an odd and very weird movie that you have to see to get the full story of the movie. It's hard to describe in just one review so I'll try to put it together in one review.  There is the main character, David, his brother, and his friend. David is the real hero in this movie. David was going through a rough time at school. He has trouble getting along with his friends because he does not get along with their way of living. But he has a lot to teach them about life.  They go on an adventure where they meet a group of people from a place called the Red Room.  The story is that there is a big storm coming and it is up to the group to get to the island before it's all gone.  David goes in the storm with the group and he meets a little girl.  She is supposed to be a prisoner but is in fact the last person alive from the place. David must decide what he is going to do and what his next steps are.  This is the movie that gave the movie "Gorillas in the Mist" a bad name. The movie is a lot better than that movie and there are some great characters in this one.  I give this movie a 9. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good old "spaghetti western" that just happens to be in black and white. The characters are really well drawn, from the sheriff, who is so much like Wyatt Earp, to the sheriff's nephew, who also looks like him. I always liked Wyatt Earpy, even though he's kinda annoying, and even though this is not a great film.   A little too "out there" for my taste, but definitely a worthwhile watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My husband and I went to see the film as a family on Friday night. We sat in the dark and were totally entertained. I think that the movie did a good job at capturing the essence of what is about to happen.    This movie is fun, action packed and a real must see for action fans and fans of old school action movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had seen a couple of the old war films, and the old man was such a good actor.  He played the role beautifully.    He was always a perfect gentleman, never a mean one.  The picture was great, even though it was made in the early 40's.  I think if it wasn't for his role, the picture would have been a terrible failure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the idea of a small town, with no crime, in which every one has his own problems and a love-hate relationship with each other. The character of the old man was very good, and I liked his bad-boy attitude. I liked the character of Jack, the older woman, who became a grandmother as he died. I also liked the story about the old woman's husband, who is always looking for some action, which is never to his advantage, because the old people hate him and think he's a jerk. And there is always a lot of tension.   The picture is not too good ( I think it is shot in black and white, but if you see it in color, you will not see it well) but it's better than some of the films about small town life, or a small area of the country. It's like a classic movie, but it doesn't have the same "wow" effect that some of these have. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story and the performances were both top notch, and the acting was spot on.    It had lots of action, a wonderful ending, and a great lead performance by Michael Nouri.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is quite a watch, and has a lot to offer. The movie is a little bit of a love story, though it isn't a romantic drama.   The movie has quite an interesting premise, and it seems like the people in this story were so close, that the relationship didn't really change.  One thing I love about this movie is the relationship between the characters, and I always like seeing a relationship between two guys.  The acting in this movie was good, and all of the actors really hit the right notes with their character.  I did find it kind of strange that it seems that there wasn't much to the story, and the story got very complex.  When this movie first came out, it was seen as a bad movie, and many people considered it to be a bad romance movie.  However, since then it has gained quite a following, and now it's very popular in the USA.  Some people might argue that the romance in the movie was a little too easy, but that's not the case here at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a must see movie. It is so simple, yet it has such a profound message about the impact our daily lives have on our souls, that one doesn't know where to begin. This movie is a great addition to any collection.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a reason why the movie has been in the running for the best picture. It is a film that is set during a war, and tells you exactly how it should be. It tells you what is happening in a very realistic and realistic way. The characters in this film are all real, they all have to face situations that they will never see. I could see how the author wrote it, and I was really excited to see it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie and i loved it. I dont understand why the director put the bad actor in all the scenes, but i liked the bad guy so much, that im gonna ask why it has to be bad actor. I will see this movie a second time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:       I saw this movie before my mother passed away and I wanted to relive that first time I saw it, with my dad. I'm glad we were able to find a way to enjoy this movie again and again. I found it very moving and thought provoking. It's just that when I look back at this movie, I remember the feeling I had while watching it, and how happy I was when I did. I know that I will watch this movie often, and not just as a family movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is not bad.  The first half of the film is just ok.  It gets really good as it moves into the second half and the action scenes.  I will say that the first half is really boring and doesn't move the story along.  But once the action and action scenes get going, it is really good.    Some of the most action sequences I have seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There are no bad films, only bad writers."   Director Brian De Palma makes a great film of the 80's crime movie and it is worth a watch.   It is not a film for everyone, but for me it is a great look at a very memorable crime movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Came across this movie on a Netflix video and I have to say it was a great movie. It's a very dark and disturbing movie and the atmosphere is so well done.   This movie was good because it made you question things and thought about things. I really like the acting, especially the actors who play the two sisters who were in this film.  I liked the movie because it was well made and I also liked that it gave some interesting facts about the people who were involved in the making of this movie.  The fact that this movie was released in the 1960's and that it was written in the 80's makes it even more creepy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great little movie. The cinematography is really fantastic and the performances are amazing.   It has a great feel to it.  The acting is great, there is no one who can't steal your heart in this film.  Even the little girl can steal your hearts with her cute personality.  It's a little bit on the short side but it's only 2 hours long so it's not a problem.  I'd definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My parents went to see it with me when i was in the 4th grade and i have no idea why i never saw it until now. I liked it when i went to watch it in the theaters with my parents and it was one of those "i remember this" movies when they showed it with old movies like the original Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and so many others. The animation is fantastic and really shows the talent that came out of the studios at the time and it made me fall in love with the story and the characters.    I loved this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great film about two very different characters and their relationship. This was a fantastic way to explore a very unusual relationship. I was so moved by the way they talked about each other and the way their relationship came together. I felt the entire film was very well done and beautifully shot. There is nothing worse then watching a film and it not being your cup of tea. You have a great time watching something you love but the end is a disappointment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen "Mulholland Dr." but I saw "The Princess Bride" in a preview screening in Los Angeles when I was about 11. "The Secret World of Arrietty" was at a different age. I don't really remember a lot of detail from "The Royal Tenenbaums" but I remember being so impressed by the film, with all of the characters, that I thought it was going to be an Oscar-winning movie. And it was, but in the opposite direction. So it is a different experience from watching the film in a theater.   The story, with the characters that the director has invented, is really interesting. I think it's really good. The actors are really good, the film looks really nice and the story is interesting and well written. I was pleasantly surprised and very satisfied by "The Girl from the Song," "The Little Match Girl" and "The Golden Years." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts with an extremely fast-paced chase scene. At that point, the movie has already gone from fun, to terrifying, to frightening, and even a little suspenseful. The character I was watching, "Sandra," is a police detective in a small town, but at the same time, I thought this movie was completely realistic and believable. There was a great amount of violence and a lot of action scenes.   I think the reason this movie is so good is because it never feels contrived. All the violence, and especially the fight scenes, are done perfectly. It isn't gratuitous, and there is some blood and some very graphic, but realistic, wounds that happen.  There are several characters in the movie that were really not given much of a chance in the end, and it makes for a very interesting and suspenseful ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie about a real life incident, "Caballo Sin Nombre" is a good comedy with plenty of great parts. If you like a good good comedy, give this movie a try, just don't be afraid of it being "dramatic" or over the top. You will have fun and enjoy the ride. If for whatever reason, you find a "problem" with it, go watch the "Hancock" film instead.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â The movie is good. It is a story with a lot of depth, and the actors do a great job.    I am in love with the main character and the beautiful, yet dark, film.  I wish this film could have been an extended feature length film. I think it would have been a great story, and would have made a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I went to the movie theatre at the end of summer after we moved to a new place. We got to our seats pretty early and the movie went off pretty smooth. We weren't expecting that the movie would be so well done. It was well shot with great CGI. It kept our attention and it stayed with us for a long time. I'm glad that they gave us a choice of what movie we wanted to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful and heartfelt movie from the late 1930s.  The film itself was very moving and poignant, I felt the main character would come back from the brink of despair to find peace and love.  It was a great film and I would recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed the great silent cinema.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie over and over again. It just seems like a movie that should have been done a few decades ago. I'm not much of a fan of Westerns (except for Bonnie and Clyde and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly ) and this movie just didn't have that "It" factor that made the classics that it was inspired by so great.   But, this is still a movie you have to see.  The story of a group of outlaws robbing a bank, as they are ambushed by the police, is a classic.  There is no dialogue except for the occasional grunt and yelp.  But the acting is amazing! The main roles were done by the great Warren Oates and Ray Milland. Their chemistry was great and they made the best out of what was a bad situation.  I never knew that Milland was that good in his early days!  This is definitely a good western for the "It!" factor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first watched this movie at a family vacation it made me feel really good because I thought it would be a very funny movie and I wasn't disappointed. The only thing I think is weird is the way the people act in the movie, but they have to act like that, because it's a movie of people trying to survive and you have to laugh at all the weird behavior. It's so funny and has lots of great scenes in it.    I thought the people were so real and the things they said were so weird, and it's such an amazing survival story and I loved it. I would watch this movie over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've watched this movie in many iterations and have enjoyed it every time. This movie isn't perfect, but it's just a movie and I enjoy the way it was made, not necessarily the plot or performances. The movie has a very "real" feel and even though the actors are not great, there is a real feel to the film, the camerawork and sound are great. The acting is strong and the movie itself is very well done.    The soundtrack is a very nice combination of different sounds, and they compliment each other well. I like the "wanderers" and the "beasts of the mountain" sounds.  This is one of those "must see" movies and I recommend it to anyone that likes a "realistic" western and also enjoys some great acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a big fan of the late 60's and early 70's, and this film is a classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this movie as a surprise gift for my brother. He loves old movies, and I've seen them a bunch of times. My brother is very picky, and has a serious problem not watching these movies, he says they are just boring and stupid.   The movie was okay, I'd say that it is pretty standard Hollywood fare.  But I was excited to see it, and thought it was good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film in a long-term series of films about a group of misfits who decide to make their own world for themselves...this was an absolute joy to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film isn't for everyone but for a few people out there this film will hit some very hard and will make you think. The film is based on a true story about two teenage boys who tried to kill each other and ended up killing the entire family. The boys were arrested and prosecuted by the local police for manslaughter which resulted in a sentence of 25 years in prison. The main character was the best part of the film and a real emotional roller coaster.    A very interesting and entertaining movie, to a degree. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never seen the "Godfather" and only knew of it through news reports. I was so impressed at how well it looks and is set, and how well the actors handled the roles, and the performances are so authentic and believable that I had to laugh at the stupid, stupid things they say.   The movie is filled with so many historical incidents that it is hilarious. I love the characters, the fights, and they even did the time-travel scenes perfectly.  I've seen many other movies, but I've never seen an even more realistic depiction of what the "family business" was really like and how it was run.  This movie has made me a fan of "God" and of film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't see the movie until several months after it was made. I thought I was going to be spoiled by the high production value, but the director, Peter Weir, made me understand why it was worth seeing when I finally watched it.   Weir takes the old genre movies that are on TV and gives them a whole new look.  The acting is good, and the performances have a lot of life.  It was made in the 70s, but it looks more like the 80s.  I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a classic example of how to make an entertaining action film. This movie was in color and on a large screen at the time, but it still looks amazing in color. The first few minutes were so exciting, then the "action" really kicked in, and you are hooked from the first scene, until the last.    It is a must-have on the must-watch list.  I've never heard of this film, but if you like action, and have a huge heart, you have to see this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first saw this film when it was released in the early 70s at the age of 7. When I saw the "Troubled Man" film at the local theater, I didn't know it was a remake of this film. My dad brought me to see this movie with him in 1974. He was watching it with my older brother and I in the backseat of the car and I remember thinking, "This must be the "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" of the seventies!" It reminded me of all those old cartoons from the late fifties and early sixties, including the great Buster Keaton (a close friend and mentor of mine).   This film, about a young man with a drug problem, was made in 1974, a year before the "Easy Rider" film and it is also a remake. This is a great, hilarious, but also a really dark film. This film is an easy watch with a great performance by Richard Burton, but if you do not like Richard Burton you will not like this film at all.   One of the problems with this film is that it was not well liked by the critics or the audience. It was not that bad, but it did not "get" the humor of the original film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â This movie is not for everyone.   It has an unusual plot, as well as some dark and edgy themes. Â The characters are not as likable as the one you would find in a horror movie.  This movie is an example of what could happen if you let your mind and imagination run wild.  The movie is scary, and well worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie! I have seen so many different versions and I'm always glad I saw it when I did! The original story is fantastic, the characters are believable and the acting is so good! It's a bit slow at times but it's a good slow movie, not too fast or too slow. You'll be in the mood for this movie after a few scenes! It has a nice mystery, which is nice, but there are a few loose ends and this movie doesn't solve them so it doesn't feel like a satisfying ending.   The original plot line is good and it makes it extra exciting when one of the characters gets caught, but they don't always come out alive and you have to watch it all the way through and wonder "Why was this guy so careless and stupid?" There are some great performances and some of the actors have gone on to do some amazing movies, but that's a pretty small percentage of all the actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was an interesting, and even better than expected, film.  It tells the story of a man, called David. He was a soldier in World War 2, and he was a man of few words. He worked in a field and used to talk to himself, when he was not fighting. He had a lot of nightmares, but it was always about something positive. David used to wake up, when his wife was asleep, and start to talk about his dreams. This would be the last dream that David would have for the rest of his life. David had been a soldier, and after the war he returned home to his small village. He and his wife had had three children. They moved out and eventually moved into a cottage that was in the middle of nowhere. They started to fall in love. But, when David died of a stroke, he woke up as his wife, again.  In the film, David had a long life, and then his wife died of cancer, and they had a daughter who they never saw. They then moved to a new cottage, and had a son.  David had three more children, all of which he never saw again. David was also a great musician, but, he never had any children. His wife died, and his daughter, died when she was very young. Then, his brother died of an apparent heart attack.  Then, David became a writer. He created a book about his life, that he sold to a small publisher. He then started to write his autobiography.  Finally, he became a famous writer in his hometown, and got many admirers, and friends. The film did a nice job, of showing a man living a normal life.   The actors did a great job. They played a lot on their lives, and also the family and friends lives. The whole film was really well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of "The Great Train Robbery" (1937). I recently re-watched the whole movie with a group of us, and was blown away by how much of a gem it is.    There's a reason the great majority of movies that are in the "Great Train Robberies" class are so bad, they weren't even close to as good as the first one.  The film doesn't actually tell you who did it, but the clues are there. This leads to several hours of wild suspense.  When I saw it as a kid I didn't really care who did the crime, but as an adult I was blown off by how easily the killer could be solved.  The plot is pretty simple, a robber is robbing a train, the man pulls a pistol on the conductor, and after the conductor is shot and left for dead he drags the victim behind a train. The rest of the train is robbed of everyone and the man then sets off in the middle of the night to get away.  After some time in jail, the victim's brother tracks down the killer and finds that he knows all about the train robbery, but never did it. He finds out about it from his brother's wife, who is in jail with him, but she had forgotten that the killer was in prison, and had actually confessed to killing all the men who died in the robbery.  Even though the guy looks a bit similar to the one who committed the original robbery, he is obviously not him, so no one believes him, and the police quickly let the man go.  It's such a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â I love this movie. This movie was filmed on a shoestring budget and it shows in some of the shots, but the acting is great. This is a very low budget movie but the actors really do an amazing job.    This movie is set in Japan during the 1920's and stars Burt Lancaster and Cary Grant.  The movie starts with two brothers, Kamei and Hirata (Hirata was actually a professional actor) and they are traveling to Osaka to see their grandmother who died some years before.  They get off the train in Osaka and they have trouble in finding a room to stay. While walking down a street Kame i and his brother spot a beautiful girl and take her to the home of the couple where they stay. Â The owner of the house is a former professional wrestler and he helps them find a room that is big enough to sleep in.  In their room is a little boy who is about three and a half years old and he is extremely shy. He is so shy that he hides behind a chair and he just sits there quietly. The housekeeper, Minako, is not very friendly to Kame and Hiratta but he is not a bad person as he helps Kame get settled in the house and to start eating his meals. When Kame takes his meal he notices the little boy sitting by himself, he asks him how he got here.  Minako answers that he came by train and asks him to tell her where he will be going.  Kame tells Minako he will not tell her, but he will tell her that there is a room he would like to see for a week. He also tells Minaka that it is in the front of his old house. When Minako goes into the room and looks around she sees a beautiful woman lying on the bed. Minako calls out to her but there is no response. She then notices that the woman is covered in oil from a candle and when she goes to remove the oil she sees that the little man is not breathing and that he is cold to the touch. The woman then asks Minako what has happened to him. She tells Minato that the boy has been dead for some time and that they must get him to the hospital. Minaka says that she will get the doctor and goes into her room and puts on some gloves and a dress. She goes into a hallway and sees a large room with a table set up in the

I wasn't very good at seeing faces before then, but once I saw the face on the little girl's mouth, I was blown away. It was so well done. The whole scene with her father and the neighbor is just amazing.   The story was great too. I don't remember much other than the face of the little boy's mother.  The little girl is very well done too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the original, this one is an "easy" watch that's packed with lots of plot. The story is simple, and it just goes on. I think that there was more plot in this one than in the original, and this one had much more humor.   And I must admit, it is really funny. I love all the characters and their dialogues.  The only downside is that there's some awkward shots in the beginning. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a huge fan of the '70s classic version. The director, Peter Bogdanovich, had brought the idea to the screen through his script with the fantastic Julie Christie. The acting was great, the story was great and the special effects were great. I'd seen the 1970s version in theatres and in video format and it looked like a dream, just beautiful. It was a time when the studios were doing the most with their movies and when the movies were better than ever.    Bogdanoviec's script was an original, and the movie was shot by great actors, some of whom were unknown at the time. A great time was had by all, and many people have forgotten just how great this film was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen "Bitter Fruit" yet, but I read an interesting review where he was complaining about how people were being rude to the cast and crew and how the movie was rushed and rushed to death. I don't believe it was rushed or rushed to die, I think it was just over-budget. I haven' seen "A Touch of Class" yet either, but my impression is that it's very similar to "Bierstadt." Both films are fairly good, but very long.   If you like movies that take a lot of time, but aren't so bad that you can't enjoy them, then you should definitely give "Biterfruit" a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on a movie night in high school and my friends were really excited to see it because it was the first time they were seeing a movie about a girl. I thought it was pretty cool that it was done by women.   The movie has a real vibe to it and the story is definitely interesting. It's like a chick flick on steroids.  The acting was great and it was really refreshing to see a movie that wasn't about a lot of romance and romance was never in the story.  It's a pretty good, unique movie that isn't super cheesy or overly romantic.  If you're looking for a fun movie to watch with some girls at a party and you don't care about the romantic aspects then this might be just what you're after.

I don't care how many other actors were in the movie, they were still just trying to look "act" by looking like they were playing the parts.  To this day, I'm surprised that no one did a sequel.  But I did see the film and it was a great movie.  I just hope that one day it will get a remake or a modern remake. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie   is very well written with a strong focus on the characters.  It was nice to see this film made by a woman. It has a very strong story with an interesting cast. The acting was excellent.   I enjoyed watching this movie because it was one of the few made that has not been a box office bomb.  I recommend it to anyone who likes action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so sorry to say this movie is crap.   It is a terrible movie and you would be better off looking at the video for free online.  The actors should be ashamed.  There is not even one decent scene and the dialogue is absolutely terrible.  A horrible film that doesn't even try to be funny, the actors only know how to act and look at each other.  It really doesn't help that the movie is in Spanish and has terrible acting.  My husband really liked it because he wanted to be in the movie but then the poor acting ruined it for him.  This movie is so bad that I could not even find my memory card to watch it.  I had to look on the internet to see where it came from.  As far as the movie goes it is really stupid, the characters have no life at all.  They are all just characters and they don't even do anything in this movie.  We all remember watching this movie a long time ago and it always makes me feel sick to my stomach, but now it is back and the actors look like they just made it up.  You can be so much more than a dumb ass.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie so much. I think the best way to describe the movie is to say that it's an old western with a new twist. I love how they added so much extra depth and emotion to the actors. I felt like I was going on a journey with these two. I was so happy that these two were given a chance to play such great characters. My favorite characters are the young and old woman.    So glad the director of this movie decided to make it as "spy film". It's a perfect blend of action and espionage. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've loved this movie since it came out in 1989. I have an older VHS copy that I still enjoy watching. It is still entertaining.   This was made in the '90s so its not that great, but it is great fun. Â  There were some great moments.  This is not a great movie, but its still a blast.  It is definitely worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title says it all.   This movie was a bit of a struggle at times, but once the film picked up it's stride, it was great.  The movie is mostly based on the life of Mr. Ed McElvaine who was a top Hollywood show man.  His wife was dying of cancer and she had a few of the world's biggest stars in her life.  Some of the names you remember from this movie are: Richard Burton, Judy Garland, James Dean, Fred Astaire, Clark Gable, Grace Kelly, and many more.  This story was based on real events that happened during the 1940's.  It is well told and the acting is great. Â   The film did not have a very wide release and it is not on the big screen, but it is very well made.  I recommend this movie to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie a lot. It's got a real good mystery to it. There's even a bit of mystery on the part of how it was done. I'd like to hear more about the process of creating the movie.   It has a very dark and mysterious tone to it, it's a bit more serious and not so silly. I like the movie, and it will definitely keep me coming back for more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a guy who wants to meet a woman for a date. He meets the girl and she turns him down. He goes back to her house and does his homework. He looks out his window and sees a girl riding on a bike and stops her, but her boyfriend is in the driveway. She runs away and he calls the cops. They go to the woman's house and find her and the boyfriend. The girl's mother has a shotgun, the boyfriend has a knife and is trying to stab the cops, and the girl is in handcuffs. What do the police do?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this was a solid action movie. The film really does a great job of moving the action and the story forward.   It was really good to see some of the younger actors in their first big movie.  It had a great mix of comedy and drama.  The ending was pretty good and I thought that it should have been longer.  I hope that there are more movies with the same themes of adventure and revenge.  There were some fun things that happened in this film and I can only imagine what it was like to be in the shoes of those who were there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can tell from the title of this movie that it is a historical epic film but the characters are great. It is interesting watching these people change as time goes on.  The film was not as well written as it could have been.  This movie did not have a "great" ending.  If you liked the Civil War you may like this movie.  I really enjoyed watching it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie will have you laughing for the first 20 minutes and will keep you there until the very last. There is nothing else like it.   I thought it was a good idea to have a movie based on a popular TV show from the 70's with an original storyline, but the way they used it was way better.  It was also great to see the two women on the television doing their thing.  I love the 80's era of TV. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that doesn't get enough credit for it's amazing acting.   I was in the right place at the right time with this gem. I've seen the movie a dozen times and still found new things each time I saw it.  From the look of the lead, Bruce Willis, and from his work as the FBI Agent, Steve Murphy, this film has it all.  Bruce Willis is a master of his craft, with no less than five different characters. The acting is the best you can ask for and the supporting cast is fantastic.  I thought the ending was great as well.  There was no way I wasn't going to see this movie again! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have just seen a great movie and I love it.  The characters are the best in the whole film. I loved it and would love to see a remake.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is not all bad. There's good acting and good dialogue, and it gets better when you realize that the lead actors are doing a good job. This is a nice little film about an elderly couple living on the other side of the country and how they feel after their marriage, though the film doesn't have anything to do with marriage. They are still happy and do a pretty good job of showing it, but there's something a bit off with it all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a fantastic piece of art. The script is so perfectly conceived, as if it was written by a great screenwriter. The set-up of the characters are very well developed. The performances by the actors are wonderful, with great chemistry and realism.   I love that there are a few different actors in the movie, which gives it a great variety of emotion.  The acting and story are perfectly cast, especially by Bill Pullman, who plays the most convincing bad guy to date in a movie of this magnitude.  A special mention goes to Sally Hawkins, who is very convincing as the victim of the crime.  And, speaking of which, the real star of the movie is Jack Nicholson, who steals every scene he's in.  What a great performance by a movie star, one I always look forward to seeing.  This movie is sure to be on many top-10 lists. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A must see for anyone who loved the original. Great casting, awesome script, and just a great movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a really good movie. The story about a couple of girls traveling to Europe is a really interesting one, and the characters are great.   A must-see if you like a good romantic comedy with a few good slapstick moments. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best films I have seen. I was a total skeptic on the subject of space but once I watched this film and understood that there were indeed alien races in our universe, my whole perspective changed and I now consider myself an ardent believer. This film is a wonderful piece of art and a must-see.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen this film yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing it. I enjoyed this film a lot. There were a lot of laughs and it was well acted. It had great suspense and I really enjoyed the ending. I thought it was a very well-made movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie looks really good. You won't find many good action movies in this decade that can really impress the viewer and I think this one is a good example of that.   I highly recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch an action movie on a low budget.  The director has made a good action movie and I highly suggest it if you are looking for an action flick for the cheap. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is one of the best I've seen, in all of film. I enjoyed watching the cast playing a wide variety of characters. They gave each of them a very good performance.   This was one of my favorite movies of the year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this case, a comedy. The film is full of funny bits, such as the "drum machine" that Mr. C.D. plays with as he plays in a band. This is an old-fashioned, "realistic" film and it shows. It is very entertaining and one of the very best films that I have ever seen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In case you've never seen this classic classic flick, it's a story about a small town man (William Hurt) who discovers that his mother has been living under an assumed name since she moved there in 1949, and then discovers a few years later that her true identity has been exposed by a new neighbor, a doctor (Robert Blake).  This movie was a big deal when it was released and remains so.  Even to this day, it is one of those movies that doesn't lose its charm, even decades after its release.  This was the film that put the modern slasher film on the map.  One of the best, if not the best.   You might be a little surprised how much a little kid can enjoy this movie, as the gore and violence are almost non-existent in this movie.  It's just a classic and one of the all-time classics. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never seen this movie before, but from what I've read I must say this is one of the most unique, interesting and enjoyable movies I've ever seen. It's a story about the creation of the first television channel, the origins of the movie stars, the birth of Hollywood, and much more. I highly recommend it, especially to fans of the 1950s and 1960s.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you first see this movie the first thing you think about is the music. It's amazing how a movie so short can sound so great. From the beginning there is a strong musical score. This music gives the movie its originality and is what keeps the film moving along. It creates a great atmosphere that is perfect for a short movie.      I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a great example of how to make a good thriller. The story of the main character (who is in a coma) is well done. Even though this is a thriller, it is a well made thriller, very suspenseful, not a typical thriller. You will definitely enjoy the story, even if you have not read it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. It is a good thriller. I liked how it was set in a small town in the midwest and had a good twist in the end.   The movie is good.  I think it is worth seeing, especially if you like old movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie!   It was very well done, very different from the usual horror and suspense films and did it very well!  I did not enjoy watching it.   The camera is usually very good, but on this one, it wasn't. The editing was poor, not only in the acting but in the editing of the scenes.  This was one of the worst acting I have ever seen and I have seen many.  I have had so many films in my life, and this was one that I felt was really poor.  The editing wasn't right, and it was not a very good film.  Overall, I didn't really enjoy it, but I liked it just fine.  It is very different, and I really liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved it. I've been wanting to see this movie for so long, but no one would let me.  It had a very intense look, but it wasn't over the top.  The character of the wife and her two children are so relatable.  When the little girl came out, I knew I had a winner.  I had to watch the whole movie again to make sure it was all good.   You'll love the ending.  If you haven't seen this movie before, don't miss it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â  My husband and I went to see " The Dark Knight Rises" last night with our friend. I thought the film was great and well made. When I got home, I started the movie on a whim and couldn't put it down until I was finished.  The sound was excellent and the special effects on the sets were very detailed.  I have been watching "The Dark Knight" on my X-Box for the last 4 weeks. I've watched the entire series and love each one, but this is my favorite so far.   You just know this is going to be the last time Batman is in the spotlight.  This was so cool, we couldn't stop watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie about 6 times. I don't remember it. The guy in it, George Clooney, is really good. I didn't realize how good until a few days after it was on. He's a good actor. And he does this with this movie. You don't see people this good and this handsome in movies like this. He knows exactly what he's doing. I loved it. It's a great movie. I would recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so well written.   It is an old movie (from the 50s) which is very popular and well loved.  A great romantic movie about a young man in the 50's who falls in love with a woman who lives in the suburbs.  This is one of the greatest movie I have seen in a while.  I highly recommend it for the lovers of classic movie.  The music, the acting and the plot are amazing and the writing is as good as the movie. Â    If you are looking for a good romantic movie that is different then nothing else in this century and is well worth a watch.  If this is a movie you haven't seen, make a note of it as soon as you finish watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My dad would come into the house and sit on the couch and watch these things. When the show had a commercial break we could just sit and watch something and when it came back I could hear him scream and go crazy. It was great to get him in on this stuff.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went into this film thinking it was a good horror movie. I was very disappointed. It was not scary at all. It had a very generic plot line which you already knew. The actors were all horrible, with horrible acting. The writing was just awful. It seems that the writer of this film thought that if a horror movie is about zombies and cannibalism that it will be good. I did not see the movie for at least three hours. The only good thing about this film was the music by Jeff Tweedy. He plays the same song over and over again. It really adds to the movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. I haven't seen any other movie that does a good job of capturing the spirit of WWII. The cinematography was very well done, and the music was very realistic. I love that this movie was made by an actual WWII veteran.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching this movie in theaters, I was left with many impressions:  1. I was amazed by how the cast did such a great job. The production values are good, and they took the time to bring in the best extras.  2. The actors are amazing. They really had a lot of fun in the roles.  3. This movie really made me realize the importance of being a role model for our youth.  I would love to see this movie on DVD.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is about a man who was found guilty of being the mastermind of a large scale drug conspiracy. But his life is never really the same after his arrest. He must now live a life that he never wanted to live - that of a convict, while trying to cope with the fact that he is no longer free. The movie shows the ups and downs of a man whose life has become the stuff of legend.    The story is told through the eyes of a different man, but this man is the main character of the film.  The movie has the effect of a horror movie where we see not the monsters, but the hero.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only reason this is rated at 4 instead of a 5 is because the main characters were not really interesting.Â  The other characters were so generic that they had no personality whatsoever.Â  At least they had nice hair.Â  And there was an interesting twist at the end that was a nice touch.Â  Overall, this movie had all the ingredients to make a great movie:Â  a good premise, excellent acting, and good direction.Â  This movie had everything it needed to be an awesome movie.   It had a nice blend of action, romance, and mystery.Â  It had interesting characters, good directing, and decent acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My parents, my wife, and I all saw it together when I was in the 10th grade. It was about an alien trying to break into the U.S. with his spaceship (it was called the Zodiac) and the film was made in a very low budget and a low key way. The special effects in it were great. I remember seeing it in a movie theater at night. It looks so real you'll want to touch the screens. I also remember that the story line, and it really was an "alien" story line really, was really well thought out and well directed and shot. My wife and I actually sat down and watched it in one sitting, and we loved it, and when it was over we were so tired, but so glad we had seen it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did not know that I would like the story that much. I did have some problem with the characters but that is all they were really good in, the only bad one was the character who seemed so easy to dislike that I think she might have been in the movie to make her friends laugh. I really liked the plot, and thought that it was a very good use of the possibilities that the medium can offer, it really did have a very realistic and interesting character development. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was great.   The cast of characters are all likable.  It is just a little boring in places, but if you do not mind that it is not your cup of tea then it is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In all honesty,  I was looking for something other than  "The Mummy." I was never a big "Mummy" fan but after seeing this I got hooked. I watched it two more times on my own. This is a great, action packed, and very realistic movie. The monsters are well designed and the acting is great. There are many different ways to defeat each monster. This movie is great in the old school way of filming.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really looking forward to this movie, but in the end, it wasn't nearly as bad as the trailers made it out to be. In fact, it was pretty great. It's not as big of a mess as some other sci-fi movies I've seen, and it doesn't try to make you believe in some sort of grand conspiracy. It also didn't try too hard to be too serious either. The effects are good, the actors are all great, and the story is really good.   The story is about two young boys who are both in a wheelchair. One boy wants to go to space, and is getting some help to get there, but there's some strange guys out there who want to stop him. The movie also gives some insight into the real world that most people don't want to go into and tells a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a solid family friendly film and is a decent action adventure film.   It is a good action film that has it's moments and has great sets and special effects.  There are some scenes in the film that I do not like but are not really bad either.  It would make a good Saturday night family film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been watching the movies in this series since the beginning, but have not read the books. This is a fun story with a few funny moments.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think it's amazing how the directors of the movie did their job. Not just with how well the plot is written, but with the way it was shot. The movie is shot so well that you don't notice anything at all when you are watching it. I'm glad it's not like other movies that just go on and on and are shot badly.   The movie has such a great mix of emotion, but also has enough action to keep it from being boring.  As for the plot, it was just like the other movies, but better.  This is a must see if you ever wanted to see an all out action movie.  If you want to see what the future holds, this movie is a great place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was fantastic.   This is one of my favorite films of all time and I hope it's a movie that you will see and laugh about again.  There are a lot of good and bad things in this movie and the good parts are amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have heard nothing but bad things about this movie. When I saw the trailer and saw this was a comedy/drama, I was really excited to see it.   In the trailer it seemed like it would be a serious drama, but it was very funny and kept you entertained. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't believe this movie was made.  This film is a masterpiece and is not like many "spaghetti" movies from the 1960's and 1970's.  A great combination of humor and a good story with a lot of character development.

The movie is set in South Africa and is set during apartheid.   This was my first time seeing a "racial" movie.  I was surprised at just how realistic this movie was. The movie was very well acted and the scenes were really well filmed.  It was so good that I saw it again just to see the actors again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What is there to say about this movie? It's one of the most memorable movies of all time. I just watched it a couple of days ago, and this movie still holds up as one of my all time favorites. The story is quite simple and the characters are pretty relatable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I saw this movie I was blown away by how well done this film was. I was so amazed at how well the actors portrayed these characters that it was difficult for me to even watch the movie. It was also fun to see the different places the characters went to during their time together. The film is a fast paced one and has some great dialogue. The special effects were done great for the time it was made.   This film is one of those rare "classic" comedies from the 50's. It has a really funny script and a good cast that were all great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the early 80s I was a young lad and I watched The Last Unicorn as I was very interested in the story. I also have seen it a couple of times. The quality of the film is superb. It is a fantastic story. The animators really outdid themselves in the way they portrayed the animals. The actors are all terrific and have good performances. The story is excellent and you don't even get to see all the different animals. That's good as it does add to the mystique of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A beautiful, intelligent, and surprisingly funny movie that has a real message behind it, and it's a nice one.   As with all of the others by Jodorowsky, you feel like you're walking with this guy through his mind and soul.  Â  I really appreciated his willingness to explore his life's obsession, and this movie has it all:  - a dark, surreal, spiritual dream that's also a story about love, friendship, and family - a very moving moment in a beautiful movie that's at the same time very dark - the great performances from all of these characters - the beautiful, sad music - and the incredible direction of John Schlesinger, who did some of his best work with Jodorowksy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as I had seen the French version of The Red Shoes (from 1969) in a film fest in Paris, and I must say I loved it even more. I loved this movie for its simple storyline, and for the wonderful performances. I remember being really scared when watching this movie and it really didn't make me feel that good. It was a pretty long movie and I'm glad it wasn't just a bunch of jump scares but it certainly wasn't scary as I really liked the slow paced movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie from start to finish and its a definite keeper.   It was good fun watching some of the best actors of their day take on some of their most iconic characters.  The film has everything from great villains to an excellent action sequence.  I can see why this movie is one of the most successful films of all time and it is also still loved today.  This movie was based on the book by the same name written by John Milius and was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.  It has everything you would want in a movie and more.  What can I say, its a great movie to watch while waiting for the bus.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen most of the movies in this series, but this one is by far the best of the bunch. The movie, for me, is a combination of all of the different ideas that made the series great. The best parts are the little bits of humor that keep the movie fresh.   The best part of the movie for me was the opening scene. The whole cast is in character, and it's just so well done. Â The special effects and design are absolutely amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this movie several times and still enjoyed it. It's a fast paced action thriller that is really entertaining and well done.    Overall:  I'll be watching this film again and again, especially since it was a favorite in my movie club!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only movie I've seen in years that truly captures the feeling I had when I was a kid and watched an old black and white TV show called The Adventures of Superman. The adventure aspect really works for this movie and has the perfect blend of humor and sci-fi. The actors do a great job and I'm not sure how I could pick out one actor over another. The best part of the film is the way it all builds to one big showdown.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was quite enjoyable. It is a great movie about a soldier who survives a plane crash, and has to do a bunch of jobs to keep his family from starvation. The plot of this movie is rather realistic (and a bit unbelievable), and is worth watching. It has the right pace, and the acting is good, and is believable (no one really dies in this movie, but there are times when it is very hard to tell who is who).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Very good movie that has some great action scenes. It is really funny and good action scenes like the guy with the shotgun in the car with the kid.   If you watch it without knowing what the movie is about or why it is making such a ruckus it will make you laugh and cry a few times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie that made me want to be a filmmaker and film maker.   As you can see by the reviews, it wasn't a huge success.  But it also showed me that my idea of what a movie is is so different than most people.  I have never seen anything like it.  My dream for this movie was never to make it into a movie.  It's amazing to have it made into a short, it really took off!   It has a great feel, it's the type of film that I could have made if I had been in college.  If you like the look of something different, and you've never seen a film with a story that is so simple yet so effective.  Don't think that just because you aren't an indie film maker that you can't make this movie. I did all the hard work for this.  This film was made for no one and no one paid me for it. But it's now out there.  Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the best movie that I've seen on the whole planet. That being said, it's pretty hard to get into and the plot is pretty simple. That's what makes it so great.   I'd say that this is better than the first film.  The story is so simple and well-done. I think I can watch this movie without watching the first one and I won't miss it.  This movie is pretty much perfect.  A must watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was pretty awesome to see all of the characters from the original series come together for one more adventure.    The movie starts with an awesome opening with a shot of the beach in the middle of the ocean.  The actors all look so great and the music is fantastic.  There are a couple of really cool things that happen in this movie that will give you goosebumps:  When the group decides to take a break at the local pub, the band members come out and play some beautiful music.  They are singing "Happy Birthday" in the English language.  While walking down the beach, we see a huge shark attack.  It turns out that a giant octopus was hiding in the water and the shark found it and attacked it.  Unfortunately, this causes a lot of damage to the island and it isn't until the next morning that they can all get out.  A lot of times in the original movies, the characters would take a night of drinking and they'd have a really cool sunset that would make them feel like they were getting high on life.  In this movie, the sun comes out pretty much every night, which makes the characters feel like adults again.  Also, the island was pretty great and really seemed to be in a tropical setting.  I thought the characters looked very genuine.  These are the first times I have seen these actors in a long time, so I was really looking forward to seeing how the characters changed and evolved.  You can tell that they had a lot more experience than the original actors, and I love that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Very good film. I had only seen the original in the 50s and wanted a re-run. The plot is excellent and you can see where the film was taking the characters. The special effects were also pretty good for its time.   It was a time when movies were made in 16 mm so the special effects and camerawork was of a higher standard. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was fortunate enough to have seen this movie in it's original form.  It was originally filmed for ABC's popular variety show "Fame," and featured the best comedians in the business in an action/comedy film, and it holds up very well, especially for the era it was made in.   It's a very funny movie, and you have to admit that it would have looked even better in it it's true 4:3 theatrical format.  The action is pretty intense, and all of the performances are pretty solid, with Jackie Cooper's performance being my favorite.  And I just loved the way they shot it.  As far as action/comedies go, this is pretty much the definitive one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the hands of the right director, this would have been a real classic. He really understands the concept of the story, he has an ear for acting, and he knows how to put a whole new spin on things.   The story is very good; there are some laughs, but there is no real emotional depth to the story; the whole thing feels so rushed and unfinished.  It's a good idea for a movie, but it seems to have never been fully realized.  He doesn't seem to care enough for it to be worth making, but the ideas are good and it's a pretty good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fantastic sci-fi movie that would be very easy to overlook.   The movie is full of great special effects and I especially loved how the aliens had an ability to turn people into the same color as their skin.  It is also a great sci-f movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a perfect mixture of action, drama, and romance. The plot involves an aging former U.S. soldier who is sent to Korea after a plane crash in 1972. The country is experiencing a time of turmoil and the country's leader is about to be assassinated. He is given a mission to assassinate the assassin by any means necessary. It's not a traditional western. The film follows him through the jungle and the mountains in the process of eliminating his target. He has to use a variety of weapons such as sniper rifles, machine guns, and even a katana. It has a very gritty feel and a really bad ending. It wasn't the greatest film in the world, but it was still great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad I checked out this movie when it came out, and I enjoyed it.  The character of Dannibal is great and I loved seeing him grow over the course of the movie.   After watching this movie, I wonder what else was shot before it was released?   The music is great too and the actor's voices were fantastic.  I look forward to seeing the new movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing I noticed when I got the dvd was the fact that there is no insert! Not a single piece of paper or anything like that! But it doesn't matter... the movie itself is great.   I am a sucker for "black comedy" films, and this movie is perfect.  This movie is hilarious. It is very fast and funny, but at the same time it is also touching and sad.  I thought that the ending was perfect as well!   This is a must see! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a very dark and twisted plot. However, it doesn't make the film overly disturbing. There is a small amount of nudity, but no one in this movie is "naked." And, if you get offended by that, don't watch it. I don't think that the movie should be watched for any other reason, besides being a good "filler" movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I loved this movie.   And the first thing I do when I watch a movie that I like is check the IMDB and see who played who, which actors have been in more films, etc.  The whole cast was fantastic.  One of my favorite roles was that of Lili Elbe inÂ  Alice in Wonderland.  Her character was the opposite of the heroine in this movie, and as much as she had a strong personality, she also did something very hard to herself to win people over to her side. Â  I like how Lili's character was so very different from the heroine. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. I would watch it again and again.   The acting was great, it's funny and it has a good plot.  The way that the plot was made for young audiences was great.  A young girl has a new boyfriend that turns out to be a crazy man. This girl is like a little puppet on a string.  It was really interesting to me how different her life was when she was in high school. I think that the director has a great way of using this girl to get an insight into the characters life.  This is a great movie to watch when you want something different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie so much that I got to watch it before I saw 'Inception' in the cinema.   It was a great film, the characters are all very well developed and there's not much you can say that won't be said about them.  The cinematography was beautiful and I enjoyed the fact that you couldn't tell whether there was a dolly shot in place or not.  As for the acting, I liked the roles the cast played.  I think a lot of them are better suited to a small screen than a big screen.  This is a movie for fans of Hitchcock, it has that creepy feeling to it, but I think there's so much more that can be said with this film.  It's a movie that I'd definitely recommend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really surprised that this film is actually not a parody of "The Twilight Zone". It is a really original movie which doesn't take itself too seriously. There are plenty of jokes in the film that are perfectly crafted. The story and character development are all great. This movie is definitely worth checking out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this movie was a great and exciting first feature film from Martin Scorsese.Â  I loved it.Â  It's so entertaining and suspenseful.Â    The characters are fun and dynamic.Â Â They are well made and the acting is very good.Â  The script is full of great one liners and you can feel the tension and fear.  Â The director made this movie in about 2 weeks and it really shows.Â  This movie has a lot of heart and it is a really scary and entertaining film.Â  Â  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is great, it's a classic and it's still as good today as it was in the 80s and early 90s. It's a great blend of suspense, romance, and comedy. It makes you feel like a kid again, and it makes for a great family movie.   My only gripe with it is that there's a couple of scenes where you feel as if they're overdoing it. There's a scene where the girl is walking down the street and she sees an old man lying dead by the side of the road and the scene was just ridiculous.  If you've seen the movie, you'll know why it's so funny, but at times, I was thinking how stupid the guy was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was made when I was just a kid. I remember it quite well. It was a very short story but it was a good one. It is a very interesting story.   A good old western, with lots of action and adventure. I loved the guns, the horses, and the girls. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of The Muppet Movie. I have seen it a number of times and I was always impressed by it's humor and amazing choreography. This is a great parody of a comedy and the best part is that it captures the spirit of what the Muppet Show was all about.  This was a real treat and a must see.   My kids loved it too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first trip to France was a blast. As soon as I arrived in Paris I found myself in front of the famous Eiffel Tower. This place is a tourist trap but the view from the top is awesome. I love all the museums and sights but the best part of the trip was a visit to the Eiffemalt and see all the famous sculptures there. I got to see a very interesting statue of a woman and a beautiful statue of the Eifel Tower with a giant bird on top. There were so many different types of sculptures that made this museum amazing. They also have a large art gallery where you can buy a piece of art.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can not recommend this film highly enough.  This film has everything that you can hope for and a number of things that you should not expect.  From the acting and story to the beautiful and unique locations, this is a film that is very much a must see.  A must see movie that will stay with you for a long time.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A truly special film about a boy's family that moved from Boston to California and found some success. The mother's sister is the beautiful actress that played Mary Tyler Moore in The Mary Tyler Parker Show. Her name was, and is, Joan Crawford. The family also includes a grandfather (Walter Matthau). The father is a brilliant but somewhat dim character. The film is the real story of one family and how they found their way to LA, as well as the family dynamics. They lived in a small house on a very remote street (one of the last original streets in LA) and it became their home. The real tragedy is that this was not a typical Hollywood family, but a real one. It's sad to think that a real family found themselves in Hollywood, but I'm sure that it didn't really feel like that at the time.   The family are wonderful and the performances of everyone are spot on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good movie to watch if you don't have much time on your hands.Â  The actors are excellent and the plot is very well made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of the "Achillie Murder" is an example of the style and storytelling of Hollywood:  First of all, there is nothing about the Achillie murders in the movie, but the whole story takes place in the back of a car in the desert. The actors, a man and a woman, are very good at this sort of role (especially the man), and the movie has a realistic atmosphere that can't be made too dramatic.  The film is also well shot, with very well done special effects that are used for maximum effect.  This is a good example of a Hollywood action movie, and I love it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It has some of the best acting I've seen in years.   This was a fantastic movie.  It was well made.  The actors portrayed their characters and didn't play them up too much.  I think it is a good film and I would like to see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to watch action movies like the one they call 'Rambo' and this is one of the best. This movie is so realistic. You can imagine what really happened.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie and a good sequel to the original.   The film has some great performances with some of the best scenes in the movie. The movie starts off a little slow with a little too much backstory on the characters and an old fashioned plot.  The characters really develop and the plot is really entertaining.  I really thought that this was a pretty good movie with some great action scenes and good laughs.  My only complaint with this movie was that the film seemed to have gotten too long.  It did get a little repetitive in the end and I wish that they would have gotten more out of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film has to be my favourite. It is definitely not one of those cheesy sci-fi/action films but it is quite good. I liked the way the film was filmed, it was a very realistic depiction of what it would be like to be in an alien world and it felt authentic. I especially loved how the aliens and humans spoke like human beings and there was lots of dialogue that had to be understood. The aliens were also very expressive and there were some great special effects. This film really is worth checking out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A nice family movie.    For those who say there is nothing good to say about old school sci-fi movies (I'm in that camp), "The Man Who Wasn't There" is an excellent time waster.  From the brilliant direction, the fine acting and a simple, yet intriguing plot, it's one of those rare movies that is good for many reasons.  The film also has a certain charm and beauty to it that I love.  If you like old school movie that is fun and funny, then this movie is for you.  The man who wasn't there is the one that really makes the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie and the way it looks. I've seen this movie multiple times on TV and it always reminds me of the "old days" in movies. If it was a little more dark in the script it would have been perfect. It was great to watch an old movie and not be scared of the ghosts and ghouls.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You've probably never seen this film, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say you've heard about it. It's a brilliant adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. It follows Ebenezer Scrooge and the Scrooges, three miserly old grifters who are given a new lease on life with a Christmas miracle. I've never been much of a Dickens fan, but this film is hilarious and well-executed. Scroogy is played by Charlie Chaplin, who is perfect as he does not need to make much of an impression. He is a bit of a stereotype, but his wry humor and the way his mouth is slightly agape make you laugh throughout. The Scroggs are played by Paul Newman, Charles Boyer and Judy Garland. I'm not going to lie; there's something about a fat man in a long dress that is very appealing to me. Newman looks like a fat, middle-aged guy in a pair of jeans, but it's an amazingly natural performance. Scroggy and his cronies don't even appear to know that they're being filmed. The acting is pretty good as the audience gets to see these characters being silly in the most amusing way possible. It takes an awfully long time to get through all of the scenes, but if you have any stomach for a Christmas movie, it's worth the wait.   I found the Scrooges' first meeting rather anticlimactic.  A bit of Christmas cheer is in order.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film during the early 1960's and was entranced. This is one of the most original, exciting, and suspenseful movies I have seen. There were a few flaws, but they were almost minor. The movie's most serious flaws were: the dialogue was really poor; the movie did not have a great ending; and the acting was a little forced.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't remember the original film's name. It was a black and white film with a large cast. I loved it and still like it. The film was very well done and it took place during the Depression and it showed what poverty was really like. I would suggest this film to anyone that likes black and whites and to anyone who has seen The Great Escape. I also enjoyed the new version, it wasn't as bad as the original.

It was a great way to start a summer, and it was just a really funny movie.  The best part was the ending.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, because it made you feel so sad and happy at the exact same time, and even made me feel like I should die.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A wonderful movie.  A true story about a soldier who survived a suicide bombing in World War II and spent 15 years in a POW camp until a POW doctor smuggled him out, and gave him a prosthetic leg.  The film is absolutely remarkable.  It is absolutely heartbreaking to watch him suffer while others walk around without legs.  There are some parts in the movie that are hard to watch, but this is the perfect way to end the story.  I highly recommend this film to all who want to understand the horrors of war. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed watching this movie. I am not a fan of the first one (The Exorcist) but I thought this was a good follow up and I think it's actually better than the first movie. If you liked The Exorcism then you will enjoy this too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie looks beautiful in a bad way, but the quality of the performances is excellent, and I love how the movie never overshadows the stories that it is telling.  Â It's very important to me that we remember those who have given their lives for our freedoms, and when the American flag is hoisted over the tomb of our fallen heroes, it should be a moment of great joy and celebration, not mourning.  It's a fitting send-off for all the men and women who gave their lives in the war against fascism, and those who are still serving, still protecting this country from threats it cannot ignore.  Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had seen several movies about a person who finds the remains of a secret government project on his or her parents land. While not a "true story", the movie was quite interesting. The plot has the characters trying to figure out who did it and why. The actors had great chemistry.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie.   It is a great way to end the season for The Jetsons, but it also gives the boys an opportunity to get away from their mother.  I also loved the movie's use of music.  Even though it is not the most well made movie, the music and lyrics are amazing.  It was also interesting to see how the movie was a re-imaginative take on an old TV series.  "I just want to say that I am so happy for you. I am very proud of you and I'm so sorry I ever let you down, but now it's all right."   "You can't change anything about your life, except that you never stop trying." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like that this is not about an urban myth or an old wives tale. The people of the 1940's were real people with real problems. I always thought they would make it into a movie but the producers always gave up.   The plot is not too complicated and it is not the most exciting movie out there, but it has a good amount of heart.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves the old westerns and the film is just the right amount of entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is good for the whole family.   It was very well made, the story was very good and it was a great way to pass the time.  I think the best way to watch this movie is to get in the car and go around.  When I was a child, I used to play outside the house and I saw my first monster movie when I was about 8. I have seen many others but this movie was one of the first.  My brother, who is 20 years older than me saw this film when I first saw it. He also watched it with me at the movie theater.  They should make a sequel to this film and do it justice.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is one of the best films of last year, in my opinion. I enjoyed this film as it was a great movie to watch and see some new actors that are great in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought this was a great, entertaining movie. The acting was fantastic, and the story was very good.   It was well written, and it was well made.  I think it should be shown on many TV stations, especially on summer Sundays. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! It's a pretty decent movie, but the acting is just ok. Everyone is too nervous to act. The best actor for the role is Jeff Bridges. Jeff is just amazing! Even though he isn't the right person to play this role, he still gives it a great performance.   The movie is kind of slow and pretty predictable but it's still pretty funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen several of Jim Jarmusch's films and always come away from them with a different perspective. This time, I was totally impressed. I thought the story was engaging, the acting was great, and the soundtrack was incredible. The only thing I didn't like was that they cut out one scene with a woman who is very beautiful. I didn' t like her either and that's a shame, since it really does add some substance to a film that otherwise would've had a much more ordinary feel.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so bad I could never enjoy it, it is completely unrealistic to even think that the characters in this movie would behave in the manner that they do. And as you can tell from the movie, the actor, Steve Buscemi, is completely out of character. But he still manages to give it a good performance. The writing is just bad. Every scene is badly written. If you want a good comedy or drama, tryÂ  "Catch 22"   The actors were great in this flick and the acting was spot on, but I will not be seeing another comedy or an action flick from this guy ever again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a terrific picture. You have never seen a film in which there was such a complete effort on the part of the director and the actors. They are all outstanding. I especially enjoyed the performance of the lead actor, Tom Selleck as the tough detective. He was so sympathetic, likeable and believable. The music was excellent. It brought me back to the movies of my youth. The action scenes were perfect. They were all spectacular. I'd definitely recommend this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off well enough, but the pace slowly starts to pick up. I felt the story was a bit slow for my taste. It wasn't too bad, just felt a bit too long for what it was trying to be. The ending of the movie was not what I was looking for but I wasn't disappointed in the movie, just not what it needed. I liked the characters, and I really enjoyed the story. I found the ending to be a bit confusing, but there were some interesting ideas to follow. This is one of those "when you think it's finished, it's not" type of movies. I loved it, and definitely recommend it if you like horror movies, as well as action films, or movies with interesting ideas.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was very good, but if there was some more detail in the acting then this movie would have been even better.   You may not like the ending or the way the movie ends but it is very good to see what the original characters are like, especially when you compare them to the "new" ones, I found them to be very likable.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, it's just fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good story about a father who is losing his mind, or is trying to. He finds himself alone in the hospital room of a strange woman with an infant girl and she begins to explain to him that she needs him to do some serious healing work. He takes her on as his patient and it soon becomes clear that she is a very disturbed woman with a very dark past. This is done very well. You get the feeling that you are watching someone who has been through some horrible thing and now has a horrible past that he is trying desperately to deal with.   It is a really interesting film and I wish more people knew about it.

There's just so much going on that you get a nice kick out of it. And that's why the actors were great in this movie, because they really nailed it. I think it was the only one of his movies I've seen that he made, and I saw it in the 1980s at a movie house in San Jose.   The performances of the leads, Peter Falk and Bruce Dern, are great.  But, the story is so good.  I mean, it may not be as good as his later work, but it's still great. You just have to see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a well-written and entertaining story. I was happy to be able to watch it, even though it is a little overlong. It is very well-acted and the cast is wonderful.   The book, although it is not as good as the movie, was even better written.

The film takes place in the 1930's and has a good mix of dark and bright scenes. The cast is excellent and the film has a great atmosphere.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film years ago when it was only being shown on cable in Europe. I had never seen anything with such an impact on me. As a boy, I read a great deal, and I've always been interested in horror, but this film completely blew me away. A young man loses his father in a freak accident, and in the year that follows, the man finds himself in a house full of dead bodies, and is taken on a journey with a strange old woman, and an unspeakably evil demon. It's a masterful piece of horror, and it's also a great example of how a great filmmaker can create an atmosphere in the midst of horror that is so effective that it's difficult not to sit still and be fascinated.   The most impressive aspect of the film is that it never feels tacked on, and doesn't feel forced at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so glad I found this movie. It is so true to life, the people really do hate each other. The one great thing about this movie is that there is actually two people in it, one played by Paul Walker, and one played really well by Bruce Willis. They are such great friends, it is not just one-note actors trying to make a career in movies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this film was the perfect blend of the two genres I love the most: the horror and the thriller.    This was scary, intense, and very, very funny.  - Michael Shannon   From the director of The Usual Suspects comes a disturbing and funny story about a group of young adults who discover a gruesome truth when they venture into an old, abandoned mansion where a dead family has been left to decompose and rot. .    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie last year on my birthday, and I remember my friends laughing and commenting on how funny it was. I've not seen it since, so I don't know how it's doing now, but I love that they made this into a "Funny" movie and not a "Drama", which the first one is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. If you like sci-fi and aliens, this is the movie for you.   The story is very good and a nice story that is not too long.  The acting is good and I felt like it was being done by very good actors.  I liked how they kept it realistic.  Â  There were a few times when I was surprised by what they were saying. Â Some of them were hard to follow but that is ok because the acting is so good.  You never really feel out of place or like it is trying to show you something you already know.  There were plenty of action scenes, aliens were a great idea, and the ending was good too.  After watching this movie it gave me some new ideas for some of my own future projects.  If you are a fan of sci-fiction, and love aliens and science fiction, this movie is for you, and if you have never seen it, it is for your next sci- fi movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie before I got into film. At the time I was in grad school in a very small program. The director was trying to find a way to make a film that wasn't terrible but just sort of blah and uninteresting. There was no music in it, just a little static music. I thought it was pretty funny but not that original or creative or fresh. This was pretty much the last movie I saw before I went into grad school and left town. It's nice to look back at a movie when you're nostalgic and realize that there are some really good movies out there.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â This is a terrific film which has a very solid premise that is well-told. I thought the characters were well acted and the film was well directed.   It is a shame this movie was so difficult to find in the theater, but I will definitely see it again soon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In my opinion, this movie is the best of the "Leprechaun" series. It is also an excellent movie about a real life story of two Leprechants who were sent to prison on a trumped up charge.   This movie is a little slow, but it is well worth the time to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie had a lot of heart and energy, and its pretty realistic in the characters interactions, but it was not the best movie of the season.   The first half had some good acting and the movie didn't feel completely unrealistic.  The ending was pretty predictable, and I expected more.  A fun movie to watch, but not something you should be watching too often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's not bad. I'd even call it interesting. It's a real mystery with interesting characters and a great plot. The only problem I have with it is the fact that the director made the movie on a $2,500 budget and was only able to get it shot in a single day. I really think if he had been able to shoot a full film for a little more money, then I'm sure the movie would have been worth more.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie last week and loved it! Great performances and the cast was great.    This movie had a nice mystery, it was not a fast paced movie but there was some really good action and it was an easy watch!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story itself is not too original.  It's just a different kind of crime story and I think it could have been written in a different time period.   You can tell that the director had plenty of time to prepare the movie.  He had some great actors in it, such as Richard Widmark, James Garner, and Steve McQueen.  The film is not very long and has good action.  For its time, the film is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie.   The movie was really fun to watch.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who liked the other movies on this site.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As for the movie, this is a classic. I've loved everything with Roger Moore in the past. From "The Man With The Golden Gun" to "The Spy Who Loved Me." To even "The Last of the Mohicans" and this movie. For me, this movie is no different. To begin, the acting is top notch from all the actors. As the film progresses, it gets a bit silly and not to mention cheesy, but it's great fun to watch. As for Moore, he's an all around good guy and I like the fact that he brings so many different characters in the film.   After seeing "The Exorcist" and "The Omen," I was hoping for more of the same. The movie does not disappoint. The acting is very good and there are some pretty funny scenes. It even has a few laughs in it and even the ending makes sense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was my first time seeing an English language version of a Japanese film. I had always heard of Hayao Miyazaki and admired his works in animation, but never knew he had a voice. The animation style and themes were unique, but not too far off from his work. I really enjoyed the movie and it's music. It has a feeling of old anime and is a very interesting look at a man who was always known for his eccentric sense of style.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had only seen "Shakespeare in Love" and thought it was terrible.  After reading this biography I thought it is great and worth the read.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a very big fan of the movie and its characters. I love the way it plays with its themes of life, love and death.   In the movie I love how the characters are all so different. The one who gets the girl is a rich, successful man, the one who is the most desperate and sad is the guy that got the girl.  The movie is filled with heart and emotion.  I thought it was pretty good and had the right pace.  It takes some time to get into it, but it's worth it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never heard of this movie when I was a kid, but it was really cool.   It was made by Hollywood and I'm glad that someone took the time and effort to make this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie when I was 13. My mom took me to see it. We both enjoyed it a lot.  My mom loved the old style films and the people.   My dad loved old movies and the old people in them.  I loved it.  It made me smile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had no idea who John Carpenter was prior to this movie. I only knew him for The Thing. While I think it's a great movie I do wish he would've made a few more movies.   This is definitely a great time for horror fans to see a classic movie.  While the story is nothing new it's definitely a nice change up from a lot of the "creepy old man and his friends" that were popular in the 80's.  I've never been a big John Carpenter fan but this movie made me interested in watching more of his films.  It's worth watching, especially for fans of the original. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is awesome! I like the story, the art, the characters, and of course the story line. I am in awe of their talent for the movie. I really want to see the next film they make, as well as a new book by the same author.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the 80s, and this movie is really good. The actors are really good, and the production value is really high.   The plot is good.  A boy and a girl have been friends for a long time. Both were killed when they were teenagers, and now they spend all their time together at their parents' house. It is a very touching movie.  I found the ending to be very sad, and it was great seeing them finally be together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "This film was the first time I ever got to see a movie where all the characters seemed to be playing it for laughs, and I was amused at how often the actors screwed up their lines." "This is the first film I have seen where the plot never seemed to change from beginning to end." "There is a lot going on here, and it's hard to follow. But the characters, especially the main cast, really did bring a little life to the movie."   This was the movie that first introduced me to the wonderful world of science fiction and fantasy movies. "The Thing" is an incredible movie from start to finish. "It's the Thing" was made by a talented cast of actors. I've seen many great sci-fi films, but this one stands out as being truly unique. It may seem like an overlong film at times, but it still maintains a good level of intensity. You can't help but feel as though you've been caught up in a giant mystery. It's the best movie I've ever seen." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie, not an amazing one by any means, but a decent one. The movie is not too complex and doesn't have much of a theme to it. The director, Richard Donner did an amazing job with his film, he had it set up so well, that you really don't feel like you are watching a new film. Donner also really had his finger on the pulse of society in the 60s, you see all of these things that are so familiar to us, but it gives them a very modern twist.   This movie is a classic, a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you want a nice movie to watch on a lazy Sunday evening, then The Last Unicorn is the one. This movie is absolutely stunning. I am not even joking when I say that this movie is the second coming of King Arthur. The animators are amazing, and this movie does not disappoint. You feel like you are in a fairy tale. I highly recommend this movie to everyone who has a soft spot for fairy tales. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It seems that the producers were never able to convince Paramount of the value of the original series. The new Star Trek series started at a low point in the series (The Wrath of Khan) and got worse. I liked the new series but never really believed that it was worth watching.   A new story and cast seemed to be the only way to save the series, and they made a good effort, but the movie is really not good.  A really bad movie with an inferior cast that would have been better as a single film (not sure if that is possible, but there were a few scenes that really stood out).   The special effects are amazing in a science fiction film, but this one was not very good. It seemed to me that the special effects department had run out of ideas and was constantly trying to do something new.  The writing of the script was not as good as that of the first Star Trek.  I have seen so many "Treks" and never thought much of them, but "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" just doesn't hold my attention.  This was not the best film, just a bad movie that got bad reviews and would probably not be remembered fondly. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly" is a good action film.  There are some good set pieces.   In particular, the first 20 minutes are fantastic with an excellent stuntman.  For me, it is one of the best scenes in the movie.  Â    There is lots of violence.  It is bloody.  Not in a good way.  But, this movie needs more blood to make it worth watching.  The action scenes are awesome, and the action sequences of the future are well done.  Some of the fight scenes are pretty cool.  One of my favorites. Â  It is a shame that so many scenes are cut.  If you look closely at the final battle, you can see where the fight sequence is cut and when.  This is a movie where there is a lot of blood.  I wish they would have used more footage.  ( I am assuming they were filming it in the rain.)  I like the film and was not disappointed with the film. It is good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen a few horror movies, but none that I loved. I thought it was okay, and I'll probably see it again some day, but it won't be anytime soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The great American story of how a boy grows up to become the first black man to win the heavyweight championship in the world, from a child to a man." I'll never forget the first time I saw the movie. I was in sixth grade and the movie was showing. I thought the title was "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived". I thought I had been born as a hero. I never heard of Muhammad Ali when I was young, but I've never forgotten the film. It was a great story and I remember Ali winning the fight with his style.   Ali's best fight, of course, was the one against Joe Frazier and he knocked him out in 12 rounds. Ali also knocked out Sonny Liston and George Foreman. His best boxing match? That would be against Joe Louis. He knocked out Louis, but he didn't win. He took the title and went on to fight in all the big fights. When Ali retired from boxing, he got his own radio show on ABC called "I've Got The Secret". The story is pretty good, with Ali overcoming racism, being black and going to the Olympics. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is probably the most realistic movie I have seen so far.   It is the most believable portrayal of a man being a woman that I have ever seen.  This was a real life experience for the couple. They made it look easy.  From the beginning to the end of the movie, it was real.  I could see what was going on in their heads.  The story has not been told in many films.  A good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Hollywood has been trying to figure out what to do with the new medium since the silent films of the first half of the last century. As they struggle to determine what kind of films will best capture their audience's interest, they have tended to cast an almost envious eye upon the foreign films that can't be exported, and have thus come up with a range of genres ranging from Westerns to romances to crime dramas. Most of these movies have an American director and usually stars American actors. But in recent years, an increasing number of these films have been coming from Russia, where directors who've been successful at adapting European styles of film and who have little interest in trying to adapt themselves have been able to make their films work here, even in a world where Americans, for their part, don't seem to have much respect for anything Russian. One of these Russian-made films, The Black Angel, has won over a devoted following in America. The film centers on a young American who has just graduated from a secret Soviet training program. He is an agent for the KGB; he and his fellow trainees, who have been told they will only be told the names of their colleagues who have already been eliminated, go on a dangerous mission to retrieve a priceless painting from the hands of a ruthless gangster. But the painting is a fake, and its theft is the work of a corrupt Soviet intelligence officer named Dukhovich (Valeri Baturin) who has also been instructed to take revenge on the American. And while Dukhinovich is on the trail of the missing picture, the man he is tracking is a beautiful young woman, Irina (Yelena Sipaeva) -- a Russian Jew whose parents, like his, have been sent to the Gulag for political reasons -- who is determined to prove that she is the rightful owner. The plot is more than a bit complicated, but the acting and direction are top-notch and the film is full of great action and romantic intrigue that will make you very, very happy indeed!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. The acting was spot on, and the storyline was perfect. I'm a huge fan of the 80s films (e.g. Terminator, Aliens, Predator). This film really captured that old school feel, with some modern day improvements.   It's the first time I've seen a film that actually had a plot. There were a lot of twists and turns, and all of it made sense.  There's a scene in the film where the character has to walk through the city and talk to people in order to catch a taxi to go to an appointment. He runs into a guy who is an alien and asks him a question. The alien answers his question and then asks if the character knows of a taxi in the area. The character says that he doesn't, but the alien responds by saying that he's going to the local cab stand that's right over there.  It also really captured the feeling of a 1980s film, like the characters talk in 1980s style.  My favourite moment was when the character (an alien) tries to tell the human that he loves him but then runs off after the character. It's a very emotional scene.  I'd watch this again, and it was very enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's the best movie   I've seen in a long time.    The acting was amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a classic! It's a movie that the family has seen a hundred times but they get to see it again and again and it never gets old. The story is a bit old and the actors do their jobs well but, I'm glad I saw it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was made in 1950 and stars Clark Gable as a man who is going mad due to an accident involving an elephant, a buffalo, a bear and his wife. The movie has an eerie look to it with great acting and special effects, it also has a good romance to it. It is not too scary, but the main character did scare me and made me think about animals and death.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went into the theater to see the film "Punisher" and saw that the movie was based on a graphic novel and this was a good start. The movie was not in color but the drawings in the novel looked good. The action scenes looked great and the characters were like real life people. I think it's a shame that the producers of the film didn't follow up on the movie but it was good. I liked the character who the protagonist was.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was the first time I came across the film and I have to say it was quite amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been watching this movie for several years and it hasn't changed my opinion of the director and the quality of the movie is excellent. The movie was directed by a very gifted filmmaker, Roger Ebert who was known as a very bad movie maker back in the 50's and 60's but the quality is very good today.   This movie has one of the best stories ever and the acting is excellent all the way around.  I really appreciate the work of the crew that was involved with the production.  It's well worth the time to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As you can see, the film is more about a love story than a political one, but that doesn't matter.   It is a good romantic drama.  The movie takes place in the early 1930s when it was very hard to get a job, and the movie shows that the people who are working have their hearts set on the one they love.  A wonderful movie with a great cast and very good acting by all.  It will make you think a little, but not much.  If you want a great romantic movie, this is the one to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about a former boxer named John L. Sullivan and a former police detective named Joe Sullivan.   They get the job of tracking down a guy who had some ties to gangsters and some other things.  Unfortunately their friend, a woman named Edna, dies during the trip and leaves them with only Joe and the bad guy.  They are followed all the way to the Mexican border and get picked up by another group of bad guys.  The bad guys kill Joe and take the money for a good ransom.  While they are being held at a Mexican prison, Sullivan's wife comes back from a trip and helps him to find Joe, but it's all a ruse and Sullivan is executed.  Sullivan's family comes back to get him and they find the body and the ransom is made up.  Then, after an investigation, the kidnappers are revealed to be the U.S. government, they use a drug called "Chihuahua" and are trying to find someone with connections to gangster Jack Daniels.  That person is a guy named Frank Reynolds and he is going to be sent to the Mexico border where he is to work as a double agent.  In this movie, it does a great job at showing the danger of working for the government and also how dangerous it can be to work for a criminal organization.  There is also a great scene where Sullivan has to have a drug test done on himself because his wife is going crazy and he was thinking of running away with her, so he had to do it.  It also shows some great acting from all the characters and it shows that everyone in this world is in need of a good fight.  This movie is a great action film that has the right amount of humor and the right level of action.  If you have not seen this movie then it is probably too late to watch it and this movie will probably have you hooked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about the first days after the war. The war lasted for over 100 years. Some guys get on a train and start it to Germany. After a while, a train gets shot at by the Russians. They are killed and the train takes them back to the Ukraine. The guy who is driving it gets sick and has to stop. He calls for help but there is nothing he can do. So he kills some guys who are trying to get off the train. The Ukrainian soldiers who have come to help the people who are on the train shoot them dead as well. This film shows the people in the Ukraine before and after the second world war. It is very sad and shows what happened and what happened after.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a fun film, I did enjoy it. This film is about a young man who meets a strange man and is in love with him. The film doesn't have a very long run time, but the movie was well made and it does take a few minutes to get into the action. The action in the film is very well done and I felt it was well done because I did feel that the film really got into the story.   I really enjoyed this film and I definitely will be watching the rest of this film. I recommend this film to anyone who wants a fun and entertaining film to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 10 minutes of the film are really good. It's quite the slow burn, but at the same time, it's very tense and intense. It really captures the tension, and the tension in the characters is absolutely real.   It's got a fantastic lead performance by Tom Sizemore, and it makes for a really good and unique film.  It was filmed in the early 1970s, but it's one of the most unique films I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had not seen this film before, I'd seen it on TV and thought it was excellent.   This movie had it all. A great director, a great script and a great cast. I have seen so many action films that can be considered "action" but really aren't. This film had it going on all the way through, and when it ended you wanted more.  A great film.  I am a huge fan of Bruce Willis and his work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember watching it at a family get-together on my 8th birthday. It was the first movie my sister, mom, and I had all seen. My sister was about 7, and she was already watching me and I was 6 and a bit. I had my hands up and was trying to make a big move in the house, but my parents decided we were getting out of there as quickly as possible. Then it started and I remember laughing hysterically. I think I even tripped a couple of times. We've all known each other for many years, but that was our first time ever seeing the movie together, even though we all have. It still has a bit of a weird, adult quality about it, which made it easy to enjoy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie that will give you a sense of what it was like during World War I. Very well done movie, but more of a documentary than a fiction film, so there is not much in the way of action. But it is good to see people of the time living, working, and enjoying their life as they did during this time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the 90s there were several "Gone with the Wind" films, so it was no surprise when Disney produced one that would look and sound like one of the films. The film was directed by Mel Brooks, who would go on to make many of the biggest hits of the decade, and the cast included Shirley MacLaine, Whoopi Goldberg, James Coburn, Shirley Maclaine, and Robert Vaughn. Â  The script by William Goldman, George Roy Hill, and Jack Warner would make some of the most iconic lines of the entire series, and there was even a cameo by Randolph Scott. It would also be the last of the "Granville" films that was actually filmed during the time of the original trilogy, and it ended in controversy because the ending was so different. The controversy was the death of Lavinia, who was the wife of Lord Granville, who she had an affair with before he was killed.  The film would have been an absolute classic, but a combination of creative differences and creative disagreements between Brooks and Disney, and an unknown actress named Vivien Leigh, who did not play a significant role in the production, led to the film getting pulled from theaters in 1949.    In 1950 a short film by the same name was released, directed by John Huston, and although it would have a similar ending to the original, it was never released and was only made available for download in a very late 1980s DVD release. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an absolute masterpiece.   From the first day of shooting it the actors were on, they seemed to be in a different movie than the rest of us. It is a real pleasure to watch.  The story of the car-bombing and the events that follow is well told.  There is a lot of suspense in this movie.  A special mention has to go to the sound design and music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie a few times. I love the film, and it's one of my favorites. I remember seeing it back when it came out in 1975, and even if I wasn't a film buff, I always liked it.   It's also an unusual movie in the sense that the plot is actually pretty interesting, and the acting is very good. The story is told from the point of view of an Israeli doctor who becomes involved with a Jewish nurse.  It is very interesting to see what happens to both the Israeli and Jewish people during the Holocaust.  In particular, the Israeli woman's relationship with the boy is very touching.  The film, though extremely violent, was a bit slow, and not as intense as I wanted.  There are many scenes of Jews being tortured, but it seems that a lot of it takes place in the hospital (the "hospital of death"), and not in the ghettos.  Overall, it is a decent movie, and a really good one at that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The whole story line with Tom and Jerry is really good. There is really nothing else like it in movies.    I really loved the fact that Jerry got shot, but still went on with his life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fun movie with some awesome special effects.   The only thing i didn't like in this movie was some the dialogue.  If you have seen this movie you know the dialogue is good.  I think the director went in the wrong direction with this movie.  The whole movie starts out okay but it doesn't really come together until the final act.  There is some great action scenes in this.  Overall it a fun movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What was I thinking?? That is one hell of a story.   I was intrigued and I'm glad I waited for the DVD version. It's a little on the scary side, but I enjoyed it and the characters were really nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie because the director is a friend of my Dad and I was in my early teens. It was a big hit, so I went to see it again with my Dad. This is a great movie that I still love watching to this day.  It has great chemistry between the two actors.    As always, Steven Spielberg is a master at making good movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cast and crew are great. They are really talented.   From the first scene of the film with the band playing "In the Arms of a Stranger," I was in the mood for a good thriller.  The director (Tommy Lee Jones) uses his time wisely to give us lots of details and not just jump in for a gory "kills like a hoe" action scene.  I like the use of a few locations that he uses and I think the lighting is really good.  For a movie like this, which is set in 1980, you need to get some nice actors for the roles they are playing.  These are three great actors.  All of them are great, but the performances of John Saxon and Lee Jones are the most unique of the bunch.  John Saxan as the detective (Mr. Saxon is so good you need more) is an original character that works very well in the story.  Lee Jones is great as the hard-bitten detective.  Saxon plays the detective so well.  Jones is amazing as the tough, street smart character.  This movie has some amazing action scenes.  You have to watch this one if you have a great appetite for a great thriller.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the sequel to the classic, "Star Wars: A New Hope". The actors in the movie are top notch and their chemistry is so good that they made the original a must watch.    A great action movie.  I am going to watch this again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â  I am going to be honest here, I have not seen the film since I first saw it on TV back in 1979. I love the film and I love its themes of love and acceptance of yourself and others. It's not a very complex film, but it doesn't have to be. This film is based on a real event and there are a lot of things that people are just not going to let go of. I also love the idea of a man who doesn't fit into society but he does everything to keep his love for his wife. It is easy to look at a person like this and think that he is crazy or that he has a heart of stone, but the more you learn about this guy, the more it just makes sense.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not very common for an art-house film to make a successful debut on DVD. The film was originally released in theaters but after its release a number of people felt it was a missed opportunity, so the film was released on video and a lot of people wanted to see it.   I was actually surprised by how much this film resonated with me.  The plot of the film is very simple: a woman, Elizabeth, is working as a secretary in a fancy hotel when she's given a surprise visit from her former lover, who has come back into the picture.  They hit it off, which leads to a passionate and explosive sex scene.  I really enjoyed the chemistry between Elizabeth and her lover, although I felt that he was too over the top in his behavior for me to really believe he would have been faithful to Elizabeth.  It was quite amusing how he would constantly try to make her laugh or to make it seem like he was the one who really found her.  Despite my misgivings about the plot, I really got a kick out of Elizabeth and the two men having this passionate sex scene with each other.  Overall, this film is a bit of a throwaway with a very good storyline that's hard to take too seriously, although it was definitely interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know about you, but I don't find it a bad movie at all. It had a great storyline and the actors in the movie are all very well done.   This is the movie I always wanted to see, but never got to.  This movie is one of the best sci-fi flicks I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie.   The only reason that I would give this movie a lower rating is because I have seen the same movie several times, and it's never as good as the first time around. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a good old-fashioned horror movie.   The first thing that I loved about it was the sound, and the sound is just superb, with a great use of music.  Also, a lot of the dialog is very well written, and there is plenty of gore too.  I also liked the design of the house and the various things it has.  It has been suggested that it is based on a real-life incident that took place in 1879.  Of course, the author has given all his information in very old-world style, so there's nothing in the story that is new or that any real-world people would know.  The only real problem I had with this movie is that it's overlong.  There are several different storylines that are all told from different points of view, but they're all interwoven and never really connected.  A lot of people have said that they think that the film is boring and uninteresting.  However, if you just want a good film with scary things, this one is probably a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best movie that i have seen for a long time. You have to admit that this is one of the greatest Hollywood movies ever made. It is funny, touching and very emotional. It has the right balance of action and drama. It does not hurt that this movie is also one of James Cameron's best movies and it is also well-written and acted.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on a friend's list, and it didn't disappoint. I'm glad they made it as it was just the right time for a small indie to hit big with a small budget.   It's one of those movies where the details just work. I especially loved the character's reactions as it helped to get a real sense of their emotions and that's where the great work came in.  It is still pretty hard to get into. I can't say enough how much you feel for these people.  The plot really doesn't matter that much. It's the small details that make it feel so real.  If you're a fan of John Carpenter's movies or the great works of David Lynch it will make you smile.  I'm really glad they decided to make the film in a way that I could relate to.  As a film-maker you don't want to mess up your source material.  This film was definitely a fun experiment that ended up being successful and worth seeing.

I really like the story about a man who was a great hunter and he was very lucky to find the great wild game like deer, antelope and antelope antelope.  I love this story.  The acting is good and the actors really look like real wild animals.  Also the movie is very good and you can see how the hunters are really hunters.  This movie really have a great storyline and great characters.  One thing is that some people say that some of the movies are "hard" but I really think the movie to be "easy".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has a lot of good elements about it and I thought it was a good idea to put some of them in there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â What can I say? This movie is great. I just think it is a little too "old-fashioned" to be a "classic" but hey, it is what it is. The acting is wonderful and the story is interesting. A lot of people seem to forget that this was the last movie in the series by Stanley Kubrick, and it feels almost like it could have been the last "classic," but with a modern twist.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I've always liked the films of Stan Brakhage, but never actually seen them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen it twice, and I enjoyed the second viewing quite a bit more. It is not a masterpiece of cinematography, but this is probably the best movie I've seen in a long time. It has so much going on. I like the idea of "trying to get the truth out of these three people." The director and the screenwriter really make it work. I think it is a movie that could be enjoyed by anyone, but also I would love to see it on the big screen. There is so much stuff going on, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is good. I thought this was a good way to showcase how stupid some people are for believing in miracles. I didn't believe the ending.   I wish this movie was made in the 30's.  The ending should have been made in 20's.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. I can see it is a remake of a film called "The French Connection". I never knew that was a remake. The only thing that I wish would have been changed was when they go to the French restaurant where they are working with the French. They are there with a mobster and his wife. The mobster puts a gun to the woman's head and she shoots the French guy with the gun. That's when the mobster opens up the restaurant and the French Guy opens up on the mobsters. A few people are hit, but the French is hit in the head and goes down. The girl then runs back into the restaurant. I loved this movie so much. It was so exciting, it kept my attention for hours. I'm glad to have seen it again and again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't usually do a movie review, but this one is too good not to write about.   This movie is brilliant and worth watching over and over.  You have to see this movie to believe it.  As well as, I believe, this movie will be a movie classic.  I think a lot of people are going to see the movie and say: "Whoa, that's a little different!"   It's hard to describe in words, but I'll try anyway.  Â  The main story is about a poor Jewish boy named Michael, who is born into a poor family.  Michael wants nothing to do with money or privilege.  He has to leave home and become a "tramp".  Michael makes his way to a place called San Francisco, where he becomes a successful entertainer.  The main character is very good and likable.  This film has a lot to say about poverty and the American dream.  It also tells about a lot about the importance of education, and what you do with it. Â    As the title suggests, it's a great film.  If you're like me, and don't often watch movies that deal with poverty, I recommend it.Â

I love that the title character has a dog and is a total weirdo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm just glad I watched this movie in the theater. I've heard so many good things about it, and I couldn't wait to watch it, so I did. It's so sad to hear that so many great movies were lost in the 80s.    This movie is very disturbing to see on screen. It made me cry a few times, and when I turned away I just started sobbing in the front row. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie.   The movie was pretty good! It had some interesting scenes. It was pretty dark and there were a lot of people going to prison.  They also shot this movie in Atlanta.  I would recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at the local theater, and I had a great time. I had never seen a film like this before. The movie is about the exploits of two guys, and their encounter with a man who, according to their story, was supposed to kill them for some reason. In reality he never wanted to kill, just to be a witness to their daring escape. The plot is a little hard to follow at first, but you don't have to worry about it; it is easy to find yourself in the middle of the action. This movie was really great! It was fast, and intense, and it had lots of action. It's a movie that has a lot of things going for it: great cinematography, great performances and special effects. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a really entertaining movie, a little offbeat, a nice surprise.   I was surprised to see a man in a wheelchair, and the acting was excellent.  It has a sort of fun, light-hearted, fun feel to it, without ever becoming too sappy or silly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a great movie. It's one of those films you don't think you will ever see, but it's always in the back of your mind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie about how the real world doesn't have a lot to offer to those in pursuit of happiness.   The main character is a high-school student who discovers that he has been granted special powers that make him better than everyone else around him. He is soon recognized as the "supreme hero" and sent to a world where he finds his true purpose: To save the world from evil.  There are some obvious differences between the movie and the original comics, most notably a lack of dialogue.  However, the movie itself does a good job of maintaining the spirit of the comics.  Also worth noting is that the movie doesn't do any justice to the "Supreme Hero". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie while taking my daughter to a movie at the local theater. It was an awesome time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film stars Bruce Campbell (and is based on the short story by R.L. Stine, which I believe was written by him), but that is just the icing on the cake.   Campbell has a lot of the right stuff.  His character, Dr. Bill Mengele, is a sadistic, manipulative, disgusting, and somewhat egotistical egomaniac.  Campbell was absolutely brilliant as MengeLE.  He played him as not only evil, but as a sadist who has absolutely no qualms about torturing and killing people.  The supporting cast did a wonderful job, and the director and writers did an incredible job of making you sympathize with these people. Menge LEADER is a very well done horror film.  It's not scary or gory, but the plot makes you feel sorry for these characters, and they make you wonder if they could have survived a little longer.  I loved this movie and think everyone should watch it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was not only a blast from the past, but it is a great introduction to the genre, and an excellent way to start a series of excellent films from the 60s.   The story is very simple, a retired pilot finds himself in a strange town with a beautiful young woman.  The actors are excellent, and all bring their unique skills to the screen, even the lead actor, who plays the role with a lot of heart and charisma.  It is great to see an American film released during the golden age of Hollywood. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm glad I went to this theater after seeing the movie a couple times and was not disappointed.  It's well worth it to go to the movies.  The film did not have that "Buffy" feeling at all, but is still good in it's own right.  I love that it's a dark fantasy without being over the top.   This movie was filmed in Germany and as much as I wanted to love it, I wasn't completely sold on it, but I did enjoy it.  My favorite is the girl with the long red hair. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like comedy and screwball comedy you will love this movie. When I saw it for the first time I thought it was kind of boring but when I saw a couple of the other movies they were doing in theaters, this was like a rip off of "What's up Doc?", the movies director was Paul Newman, he was like "hey let's see if we can do this a bit better."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is well told and is a simple story about a man who is a soldier in the war against the Japanese. We follow him and see his training and his life from the time he is old enough to join his army until his death. We see his growth as a man and we see how he handles the war, how he is able to survive it and still hold his family together. He starts off as a normal boy and ends up becoming one of the toughest soldiers in the army.   I love movies that have a happy ending but you never feel like you got out of a movie without being able to enjoy it.  In the end you can't help but want to see what happens to the man after he finishes the war.  If you like war movies and enjoy a good story then you can not go wrong with this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The picture was excellent - as expected, a well-done sci-fi movie.

I loved the concept of the plot - it was interesting and interesting to watch it develop.  And the acting, in my opinion, was top-notch - especially for a movie with such a strong and strong female character (which really showed how strong the character was).   There were, of course, some bad scenes, but that's not to be expected - it's a sci- fi movie.

I was very disappointed that I didn't get a chance to see this before it was released on DVD because I really liked it.

It is fun to watch but not interesting or thought provoking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was skeptical at first seeing this movie because of my previous experience with Michael Mann's films. But I just couldn't put it down. This is a very impressive film. I'm so impressed by the performance of Will Smith. He's so good. I didn't know Will Smith could act. In this film, he has a great turn in the role of Tony Montana and he has great chemistry with his co-stars (Tommy Lee Jones and Val Kilmer). The acting here is excellent and the music is really great and the effects were really great. The editing is just fantastic and the movie was a really fun ride.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an awesome movie with a great cast! What more can you ask for? The story is simple but the emotions, and even the language is very interesting. I especially liked how the people that were involved in the crime were portrayed. I've always felt that this sort of story could be done better, and I feel that this movie shows that it could be. This movie is also just the right amount of cheesy and silly and it really gives you the feeling that someone has been looking over their shoulder.   I was so surprised to see this movie on television. It was something I didn't even notice until years later.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has great characters, and it is set in a very nice setting.  The film is set during the First World War, and the soldiers are captured by the Germans.  They are held in a dungeon, and when they learn what is happening to them, the characters, especially the lead, are strong enough to fight back.  I was never a huge fan of the film, but I can definitely see the appeal of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie about the war is definitely in the right direction. It's been over 30 years since my first visit to the Normandy beaches in Normandy and I am very glad that it is getting a re-release. While I did not realize until the film that the Normandy and the other beaches were taken over by the Germans, the scenes of the battle were very accurate. It was hard to believe that we were there in those parts of France. I think that the director tried to tell the whole story.   I gave it four stars because it is a movie about a man, but it could have been made much more effective with a much more powerful director. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best animated films of the 90's.   The music is catchy and memorable.  The animation is amazing, and the story is interesting.  A family of 3 get trapped in a haunted house, and get in a few scuffles and scares.  One interesting thing is the girl that's stuck in the car, and is talking to her mom about "how she is".   A really creepy movie with some great horror moments.  Enjoy!

I am so sad the day this movie was released, I am so happy it is now available on DVD and on Blu ray.  The movie was so good, that you almost can't believe you are watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw "Saving Private Ryan" at a theater. It was my first movie and I thought it was one of the best war movies. I had seen "Jaws" a few years before and thought it wasn't as good as the first movie. I guess I thought that this movie was just as good but not as scary.   This movie was very realistic about the war. It shows the things that went on in the war and even some of the soldiers who were at war with us. I like when movies make you realize that war isn't really as bad as you thought it would be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorites.   You know, I actually got to see it in the theater, so it's been about 10 years since I saw it.  In fact, it was the first time I'd seen the whole thing, so that was pretty exciting to see.  I'll admit, I was pretty anxious about it. The first time around, I thought it was gonna suck.  But I was surprised by how great it turned out.  When I saw that trailer, I really thought it looked like a ripoff of Dances with Wolves, but it's a completely different movie.  This is one of the only movies I've ever seen that had me crying tears of joy the entire time.  It's a really touching movie. The way it's filmed is just beautiful, and I think that's the best way to tell a story.  The actors are so great, and the music is just really beautiful.  Every time you think it's gonna get too dark, it pulls back the curtain and reveals that there's a light that's shining in the darkness.  All the actors are just so wonderful.  Even the little boy was really touching in a way that I think a lot of kids don't get to do, but he was a little boy.  A little boy who gets to watch his parents dance for the first movie they ever saw together.  There's a lot more in this movie than it seems.  As I said, I don't have anything against it, and it's one of those movies I always try and watch when I get the chance.  For those who love movies like this, and who are tired of seeing the same thing, watch this.  - Jennifer Gage, NY
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â When I saw this film when it was first released in the US, I wasn't sure whether I should love it or hate it.   I was going to say it was "good", but it was nothing that anyone should pay money to see.  I don't know why this film was made, but I don Â know it was made by the same people who made The Big Chill, so that was disappointing.  There were a few interesting concepts in this movie, but it wasn't anything that made me go "WOW", and I Â couldn't tell how much effort went into the editing and the special effects.  It's hard for me to think of anything memorable about this movie - it's just a bunch of scary people running around in a corn field, and I'm sure I've seen better.  A shame,  because it was really fun to see the kids in the costume come through the cornfield, and the actors did a decent job with it. Â    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was good. Good action scenes and good action sequences in general.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like the concept of a guy with an alien tail. It's a pretty interesting idea, and the way the aliens interact with them was very interesting. A little too long to take in.   The main problem with the film is that it starts off slow and the acting is horrible. It takes forever to get to where they are at, and even then, it's not enough time to make it good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I watched it, I was totally lost about what to expect. There were so many weird things in the movie, but I loved it.   It was not the typical, formulaic, "look at the stars, look at the trees and look at this one guy" kind of movie, it was a different kind of feeling, it took me out of the reality of the city I lived in and put me somewhere else.  The movie is not great, but it made me feel so bad for the guy and it made us all feel like we were in a dream. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was a fun time. The cast was pretty good and I can't wait to see their next movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like films where men do things with one another, like the good old days when we all had jobs, and worked with our hands, then watch this film. The film was made to be seen in the theatre and it succeeds as a historical film.  The film follows the story of a very real war and the men who lived through it.  It shows how the war was fought and the war leaders.  In addition the film has an interesting cast and interesting places to visit.   The only gripe I have is that the film could have been longer, the war is only a small part of the story.  What really surprised me though was that this film was actually made by a Hollywood producer and I have never seen such a film in my life.  I am giving this film a perfect score. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't really think that this movie would be any good.   But it is!   This movie is awesome, so good!  In all my years of watching films, I have never seen anything as entertaining as this!  The acting is on point, and the story is a very good one.  The best part of the movie, is the ending.  In the end, the people who helped her go to jail, go and visit her in jail.  This is when she sees her family, and she is very happy to see her family.  A true movie, you will not be disappointed with this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was great. Great acting and a good story. I think the story took a bit longer than the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching this movie I was very pleased. This was a real treat for any fan of horror movies or action flicks and you can tell the actors have a real passion to be in this film. I found it very well done and the horror is very real.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoy action, violence, or horror, then this movie is going to be right up your alley.  The movie was released in the early 1990s so it has a more modern feel to it but still a great amount of violence.  This is not a perfect movie, but it does contain some good surprises that are worth checking out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I have seen most of the movies I have wanted to see in the genre.   It was nice to have a different kind of film than some of the horror movies I usually get.  This is probably the best horror movie I have ever seen.  There is no screaming, no gore, no blood, no scary scenes, no jump scares.  The movie is about a woman who is attacked by a dog.  It shows how it can happen to anyone.  I like the story because of the character of the woman, and the way it takes place.  She is very brave to try to figure out who would do this to her.  My only problem is that I could have done without some of those jump scares and scary scenes.  All the blood, gore, and scary moments were there, but it seemed to me as if some scenes were there just for shock value.  Overall, this was a very interesting and interesting film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a terrific story that does not feel like a typical war movie at all. You might see it as being based on a true story but that is simply not the case. The story is about a soldier who is badly wounded and is taken out of the field by an American nurse who has saved his life. In order to get the doctor to see him, he tells him a story of a woman who has been through a similar ordeal and is desperate to find a doctor who will treat her. The two then team up and set out to find him. This movie is about two friends that are trying to help others, even when it seems that they are going to lose themselves to their wounds. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character is played by Richard Armitage. Richard is an actor who has played a lot of different characters and was not at all afraid to go out on a limb and take on a role that you have not seen before. The cast was great and was able to capture the emotion of the movie perfectly. I felt the movie was a great success and one that will not be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is not a mystery. The clues, while difficult to figure out, are well placed. It's not a very original concept. The plot may not make sense. But the story is solid and compelling.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My fiancee and I have never been to the set of a movie before, and it turned out to be a wonderful experience. We were there at about 6am (which gave us time to get a good hotel, and grab our own food), and were surprised to see the actors in their normal clothes - not suits and all that - walking around the set and having coffee with the director. I'm not much for coffee (I love strong, sweet, black coffee!), but we had a lovely cup of it, and the director was very nice and warm. I have to say that the actors were all really friendly and funny. Even though this is the director's first movie, he seemed quite comfortable directing. The set was a little smaller than we were expecting, and while not as huge as the first film, it felt very intimate. There was also a little bit of a'showdown' between the two leading actors (one was on the right, and one was on left), but it didn't take away from the performance of either of them. I think this movie has potential to become a classic and should be done more in this manner. I loved the music (the first movie was a soundtrack album, but this was actually recorded live), and I'm really happy that they kept it true to the original - the actors should keep coming up with more unique characters and settings. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this film for a college project.   It was interesting, well written and well acted.  I liked it so much that I purchased the soundtrack (and I think that's a good thing because the original soundtrack was quite good).   A good watch!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies of all time. My brother and I watched this together on a double bill. We couldn't believe the movie, and I'm so glad I saw it with him.   The scene with the giant sea monsters is epic.  I just love the soundtrack.  This movie just blows my mind!   I still remember sitting in the theater, amazed at the amazing scenery. The scene where the boat hits one of the giant lizards and it shatters into thousands of little pieces, is just one of my favorite scenes from all time!  I think this movie is one of those films that will never be made into a movie, as the money required to shoot it would be too much. But there is no reason why it can't be made on DVD, and it still should be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a good film and i have seen a lot of good movies and this was one of the better ones.   It was an adventure and a good story.  I loved the setting and the actors were wonderful.  For some reason the director did not take much out of the plot.  i think if you want a good adventure you should watch a little more of this and maybe read the book. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a good one, that's for sure. A good, realistic take on the true story of the war in which the German army, led by Hitler, fought against an army under the leadership of the French general Charles de Gaulle.   I was not a big fan of the movie, but I did enjoy watching it. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that I had to watch the movie in German. If I had not been interested in the subject matter, I would not have seen this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's just a fun, action packed and great fun.  The action is awesome.  I am a big fan of the first one and it was a blast to watch this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember this movie so well. My dad went to see it with my brother when I was little and now I remember the movie the same way. I loved it back in the day and when it was released.   It was very hard for me to watch because I was too young at the time to really appreciate the movie.  It takes some of the best lines in the movie to really understand the characters.  One of my favorite lines in any movie is when he said, "You think I can't have a girlfriend?" The way he said it made me laugh really hard.  I thought it was really cute when he got to kiss his sister.  The movie is very well shot.  A lot of great music was used to set the mood for the movie and I love the way they used the horns and the way he played it for the audience.  This movie was really the first movie to show what a movie could be and it really made the movies we were watching as a family seem like they were movies.  And of course, this movie was about a gay couple. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure that it's the best film that John Carpenter has ever made, but that's not the point. It's the perfect combination of a genre classic and a modern classic. It has all the elements that make a John Carpenter film great, and it's perfectly cast. Carpenter is perfectly cast, and they make it work. His score is really awesome, the script is spot on, and the acting is spot-on. The plot is perfectly executed.   As someone who has seen all of his movies, it's nice to see that Carpenter has an original thought in this one. It doesn't sound like anything else that he has ever done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best feature film in the horror genre, and it is the only movie in the genre that should be seen.   "Para el mundo no es posible... la leyenda es la tierra de la pelÃ­cula que pueda enrguir en el hombre."   This is a haunting story of a woman haunted by the death of her husband.  This was an adaptation of the short story by H. P. Lovecraft called "The Dunwich Horror" which was written about in his novella "The Shadow Over Innsmouth".   It is the perfect example of the genre of horror as well as being one of the best and most original movies ever made.  It's one of those movies that just grabs your attention. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of people seem to be under the impression that the first movie in the series was bad.   In my opinion it's much better than its predecessor, and it really has everything a good "Star Wars" movie should have.  A really good blend of action, special effects, and comedy.  I really enjoyed the film and look forward to seeing it again.    A Star Wars Story 2 is in theaters on August 30, 2016.  Get yours HERE 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a really nice movie that should be seen by anyone who likes a good mystery. I like the way it starts out with a little kid who has lost his favorite toy and is trying to find it. The director of this movie, Brian De Palma, and his wife do a nice job of keeping this film interesting. The ending is quite good as well.   A good movie that everyone should watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is excellent in a fun and entertaining way.   There is also a great performance by Bruce Willis, a very well written and acted movie.  It's not as complex as one would like but it is good fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was about a family of 5. The father was murdered when he was a young boy and the sister was the first to see it, but was unable to help her husband who was stabbed in the throat and left to die. The older sister came into the house and found her husband dead and her children hysterical. The woman had no children so she was a single mother who had lost everything, and no other choice but to put the children on the road and drive them to a place where there was food, shelter and money. In some way the family was saved. In order to get money for a ticket the women stole food from a supermarket, and this is how they survived until the train was stopped by the cops. When the children were reunited the sister is left behind, she had seen her own children shot, and she has to live with this horrible memory. It is such a powerful film, and you see the children grow and change. They were scared, they were sad, and they were alone. The film is a little hard to watch at times, and it was a shock at the end, but it was all so worthwhile.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this movie was fantastic and well worth watching. The story is the best part, and the characters are perfect for this movie. This movie has to be on my must watch list.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't have high expectations going into this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised when I got to see it. The story is interesting, but the acting was so strong. This movie has the makings of a good drama. I can't wait to see the film a second time.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't get all the hype surrounding this movie, but I have to give credit to the director for making a decent movie. It has all the makings of a good flick. The film, a retelling of "The Odyssey", is a great story with an interesting premise. I really like the performances from the actors in this flick. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Michael Caine. He does an excellent job in his portrayal of the Greek warrior and his relationship with his wife (who happens to be a human). The soundtrack by John Barry is well-done as is the cinematography. I have only seen the film once, and the rest of it has been on videotape or on VHS. I don''t know how well the film was able to play when it was seen in its original format.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. I really liked it.   From the great acting (I think all the actresses were really good here, and all of them were very believable) to the realistic feel and story-line of the story to the gorgeous scenic shots of the California landscape.  It's very simple and realistic and you feel it. A very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting something much worse, and even then I was impressed by what the film accomplished in its first five minutes.   It was so unexpected, so unexpected I had to see it again after that to make sure what I saw was a trick of my mind.  I do not think this is the best horror movie ever made.  But it is one of the most enjoyable horror movies ever made and one of my favorites.  What is also incredible is that the whole thing is shot, edited and scripted on location in Canada.  That alone is impressive.  The acting is superb, from one of our generation's greatest actors, to a young man who has come out of the closet.  One of the best acting performances I've ever seen.  It is a masterful piece of filmmaking.  And it is a truly unsettling movie.  So get on it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a true work of art. The performances, the set, the costumes, the special effects, the music, all are done with absolute perfection. It is one of those films that you think "this is amazing!" for no apparent reason at all. The camera angles, the sound, the editing, the direction...all the little details add up to create an experience you will not forget.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first watched this movie when I was about 7 or 8 and loved it. My parents made me watch it every Sunday, sometimes even for weeks on end because it had a fantastic script.   It has an excellent story, a beautiful script, and was the start of me learning what an acting career was all about. The actors in the movie were truly amazing, and this was the perfect start. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie years ago. I really liked the movie and I loved how the kids' dialogue made it seem like a real family.   After all this time, I thought this movie was even better then then.  I just have to see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this for the first time about a week ago. I loved the idea of a movie about a guy who just died and we only saw his last moments on film. This is one of the few movies I saw that had me really emotional. It was well made with great acting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are no spoilers in the beginning of this movie. The characters get introduced and you can feel that this is not going to be an ordinary film. After the first few scenes there is a tense scene between two characters and the tension never let up for the whole movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never heard of this movie before reading the description. The film is based off a novella by the same title by the famed Polish author, Michal Leszek, who had the idea to turn the story into a movie. The story is about a woman who is a little girl, who falls in love with a man who has died and then comes back to life. There is a twist here that you just have to see for yourself.   The cast of the film was amazing. They really nailed it for what the story was about. The character of the mother who had abandoned her daughter when she was young was a very interesting one and really brought a tear to my eyes every time she was on screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this at the theater in the mid '90s when it first came out. I remember the film being a hit. I didn't know who the lead was. I just remember this movie being a pretty good one.   Now I watch it with more understanding of who it is.  For those who haven't seen it I would highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is not as funny as I thought it would be, and the humor comes more out of its characterization than the actual comedy. The comedy is pretty good as well, but it's less memorable than it could be. But I can see why the producers made this film. There is a bit of humor in this film that does work, and if you like a good film with good characters and great acting then this is a must see. It is worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friend took me and my wife to see this movie back in 2008 and we were so surprised that it was actually a good flick. We had such a good time. We loved the characters and the special effects.   It's got a great cast and I would love to see a sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am happy that someone out there has read this novel and will see it, as a fan of the series, I've always had a difficult time following the movies and never understood why it always seemed to drag on.Â  Now that this film has finally arrived I was pleasantly surprised that the story was more coherent, the performances were much more accurate and I was glad to be seeing the actual book in a movie again. I'm not going to give it a high review just yet, it's not as good as the book, but the movie had me very intrigued. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to see this movie after seeing it on TV. I liked this movie a lot. I think it's funny and well done. It's also a good old fashioned romance. It also has a lot of great acting. I thought it was well directed and a lot better than a lot other Hollywood movies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always loved films that take place in the world of mystery, or thriller, and this movie was no exception. It was suspenseful, suspenseful. Very little on-screen dialogue, but I could tell that every character, even the non-speaking actors were very well-thought out and thought out characters. There are also some amazing performances, and some very interesting ideas about the human psyche, and the human spirit.    The only thing I didn't like about the film was the opening, that took some of the pressure off of us when we went to the cinema, as it showed our heroes as they were going to get into a car in a certain part of town, and there was no explanation of where we were going or why it was going to be in that particular place.  The movie has its flaws, but the positives out weigh the negatives, and it's worth a look.  I enjoyed watching this film, it's fun, it has a fantastic cast, and you get to spend some time with them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My brother and I, and my parents, love this movie. I love the story and the characters. I was born and raised in Georgia, and I love this area. This movie is good and a fun movie to watch. It was a small movie, but it gives us the whole experience.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as a child, as did my two brothers. They both loved it and I did as well, although I'm not sure how much of it is true. I think some of it was the influence of the great Stanley Kubrick who shot it, but I doubt it is all his. It is still a great movie, and the fact that it's still in existence, is amazing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this movie as a teen, at the age of 9 or so. The acting is not as good as it was in the late '90s and early 2000s, but it does have some nice moments. There are some great set pieces, and the director did an excellent job of keeping the story moving.    This movie is a great example of why you need to see some old stuff on TV if you want to know what it was like in the '50s. It's hard to explain, but if you just let it wash over you you will be blown away. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very well put together and it shows. The director of photography is good. It is a very dark movie.   It is an amazing movie for those who want to watch a good horror movie. I recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was a real treat. I enjoyed it more than most "horror" films from the 70s and 80s.   My mother, my father, and my children (5 and 3) went on the boat ride on the Mississippi River with me. It was a great boat ride.  There was a small fire at the end and we got out with water, but no one was hurt.  It wasn't that cold, either.  We saw lots of interesting scenes and the boat was rocking back and forth.  The people were all very friendly and helpful. I hope we can all have a trip like that one again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is probably my favorite movie of the year, and I think it is the best James Bond movie ever.   The opening of the movie is perfect. It has a very British feel to it, with the best of them being the scenes in London. The action is very good, and the villains are amazing.  I have seen this in the theaters multiple times and I still can't believe the amount of detail they put into this movie.  It is a masterpiece.  What more could I ask for than the ultimate James Bond, and he gets it all right here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A really well done movie with some great performances. A couple of them don't stand out like others did but it is all pretty well done. I did have a really tough time with the plot. I am not sure what the point was at the beginning or where it was going. It felt a little contrived. If you are not into serial killer stories this isn't for you, but if you like those stories it will do nicely. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't see this one. This was one of my favorites when I was growing up, so I have to thank the people who made it in this way.   The scene in the basement at the end is just beautiful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, at least in the end, is just really good.   A nice, fun film with lots of laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not exactly sure what this film was intended to do. If it was a film about how to get along and cooperate with others and to make a good team, this film could have been a winner. If, however, this was a story about a couple who had to overcome their issues and be successful in spite of each other, it is a little disappointing. A couple who are not that well suited to be married, even with a loving, understanding wife and father in tow. They have a difficult time with their marriage and their problems become more and more complicated and confusing as the film progresses. I was hoping for some insight into what the couple's relationship was like. But it was all just so formulaic and contrived. It's a really boring film, so boring I just want to go to bed. There's nothing that makes this film stand out from the rest of the garbage that is released each year. But if you're a fan of cheesy movies, this is a nice, easy pick-me-up. If you're looking for a movie to add to your collection that'll make you feel good about yourself and your relationship, but you don't like to think about it too hard, then this is probably not your best choice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I love this movie. I loved it and my wife loved it. It has a great plot, a great ending, and a great performance by Robert Blake. I had fun with this movie and I am glad I saw it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie! It is hard to find a good film in the late sixties. If you like the classic "Policeman" style of the 1950's, you will like this one. The only thing that keeps it from being top notch is the lack of background music in a scene where a guy's leg is broken by a car.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love it. Very good.   The characters are fun and realistic.  I can't wait to see the next one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a while now, I've been obsessed with "The Princess Bride". I've read the book too, and watched the movie. This made me want to do a remake/sequel. I had seen the movie before, and knew the book was not as good as it was in the movie, so this was my chance to see it again. And it was wonderful. I loved it. I thought it was the best movie of the 80s. The acting, the production, the writing... all of it. The only thing that I don't care for is that the plot is very similar to the book, so I donï¿½t understand how the movie ended up with such a poor ending. But that didnï¿½t ruin the film for me. It was beautiful and romantic. I especially liked the romance between the princess and the knight. I wish more people would take the time to do remakes/sequels.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A nice action thriller with some great acting. A bit too long for my liking, but I enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is awesome. It is so bad, yet so brilliant.Â    My favorite character in this movie is a little boy named Peter Dinklage.   It was a lot of fun to watch a character I don't like be so great.  The film is good because of the way the actors are portrayed. It was good to see a couple of old actors, and they did it great. I also enjoyed seeing a young actor like Timothy Olyphant and a much older actor like John C. Reilly do their best.  I also like the way they did the computer sequences with all the glitches and glitches in the computer.  I recommend this movie to anyone that likes a good sci-fi flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it   -I'd love to see a sequel -and I think there are some great future films in the works -the character relationships are really interesting and well developed
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie 3 times now and still it gets me. It has a good story line and has a little bit of a different feel to it. The acting was decent and the director did a great job of keeping a close eye on the camera, showing us everything from small things like the girl's legs, to the big events like when the train falls off a bridge and onto the tracks. It really was a very impressive picture.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great story with fantastic acting from Paul Thomas Anderson and Emma Stone. There were many surprises in this film, such as the inclusion of many of the characters from the film, but not just in a good way. This film has so much good acting, even the supporting actors make some of the best performances in the film.   The acting is a lot of fun to watch as well, and I'm glad this movie was made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this before and loved it, but I really like this remake with a few changes.   The original movie has a great plot, great acting, amazing special effects, and I'd watch it over and over again.  This one is better and more realistic.  I had to rewatch it because it didn't make sense how they were shooting things.  Some scenes are too close up.  One scene was actually pretty long, but that's a good thing.  In the original movie, the characters were really good and funny.  Now they are a bit dull and boring, but not the actors fault.  If you like the original, then this remake will give you a better impression. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie for people who want to learn and understand how much it takes for the U.S. military to be able to carry out an invasion of the Philippines. The movie is a true story told from multiple angles which I found quite compelling.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun film that was based off a book by the same name. A fun and well made film with a nice cast. The special effects were good and made the film fun.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a great movie. I wish it was a longer movie (for example, maybe an hour or two longer) but it was perfect for two hours.   The film is well written, well acted, well photographed and it has a good mystery to it.  The ending is really great.  I highly recommend this movie, you will enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film I ever saw in the theatre, it was at the age of 6. I was a big fan of it, I watched the entire series over and over and was totally blown away at the great cinematography and writing. In the film, the lead, John "Lucky" Lucious, is a good detective, not at all bad in the least. He is a master thief, and he uses this skill to get the girl he really loves (who, like the film says, is in the hands of his best friend) away from his boss, a man who is trying to take over the company that Lucky runs. The only reason this film never became a hit, was because the audience didn't get enough of it. It was just too long for us to be able to follow the plot (I mean, what did you want to see? What do you care if this movie takes a while to get there?!). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a huge fan of the tv show Twin Peaks. It had a unique feel, it just didn't sound like that kind of show. Then I came across this movie and I was blown away by the amount of attention they put into it. This was the closest thing I've seen to the show.   The music is so fitting, the lighting, acting and editing are all just so unique.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes to think that they know what a show like Twin Peaks was.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always been a fan of the films that starred Billy Wilder. His films are always enjoyable, but his later films are not so much fun. The story is great. The acting is superb. And the music is great!    This movie is full of energy and it is a great way to start off the summer.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A true gem. When you think of the greats, you probably think of Kubrick or Scorsese. When I first saw this, the thought of a Kubrick/ Scorsesy collaboration didn't seem so far fetched. However, I didn't realize how good of a director Scorsesty was until I saw this. The movie is a tribute to a true Hollywood legend: Stan Lee. Lee's films, for all their faults, are always excellent. The greats don't become the great when their work gets too pretentious or when their movies get too complex. Stan Lee is always a great director, a genius. A masterpiece.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is definitely more entertaining than its content and the film looks wonderful. It has some wonderful music, some brilliant sets and the cinematography is spectacular.   It is a shame that the film is so short (only two hours) as it would have made a great feature film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing the film but my sister had a bad cold and got sick, and that made me a bit hesitant. The rest of my family had a wonderful time and we all loved it.  I really love it and it is a fun film.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film like this that was shot on black and white was truly a work of art. It was so beautiful, I felt as though I was watching a painting come to life. I remember watching it with a group of friends and asking them if they had ever seen anything like it. They had, but not on television.   I also think it's a shame that all of the negative reviews for this film were written by people who were not there. They were just the kind of people who would go see the first Gone with the Wind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very well made and thought provoking film. One of the first documentaries to give a sense of what life is like in the middle of the twentieth century. The use of the word "war" does not obscure the reality of the time. The camera is on both sides of the war, and the war is shown not as a war of words, but as a fight between two people over what their country will become. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only bad thing about this film is that the movie was shot on 16mm film and not digital, but this still is a great movie.   It is the best sci-fi movie I have seen in a while.  The movie takes place in 2031 and depicts a society where man has gained god-like powers.  There are a lot of similarities to the story of Star Wars.  They have made a very good movie that is much more fun to watch than you could ever hope for.  If you like sci-fis and you love sci- fi movies, then this is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you want something a bit different, this is it. A story of love and loss set in the jungle, with the same cast as "A Royal Affair," this is a lovely and moving movie.   My favourite movie of all time.  The actors are so good and it never felt like they were trying to prove anything. I always loved "ARoyal Affair" and "This is the Life" are great movies too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The action scenes were great and the camera work, especially when it comes to the car scenes, is just fantastic. I loved how they were used to create the tension between the characters in the movie and then when it was all over, you can't help but feel like this is how any good car chase should be. It's very entertaining and a must see movie.   I highly recommend the film and if you like action and cars, give it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You get to see what really happens in the inner-workings of the White House and the military-industrial complex.   I think the movie was a really cool way to take a more general view of war.  The people making the movie were trying to bring awareness to what goes on in the military industrial complex. The movie also helped to raise awareness of an actual problem that we are facing: We are fighting a war that is not being fought for the good of all of us, but for the benefit of the military and its contractors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen this movie when I was young and it was one of the movies that really made me think about the human race.   The story follows two astronauts in an unmanned craft, who have been ordered to land on a strange planet after they are detected by the space stations.  A group of strange beings called the "Nordics" have come to earth to help with a "dearth of men" which causes their planet to be attacked by a space ship that tries to wipe them out.  The film is a fantastic piece of science fiction, especially if you love science fiction and fantasy movies.  One of the best parts of the film is that the space station crew is not exactly what you would think.  When the astronauts land on this planet, they find that it is inhabited by people who believe themselves to be gods, and as the aliens get closer and closer to the crew, the crew starts to be threatened with death.  It has been a long time since I saw a sci-fi film that was as imaginative as this one.  So when I see movies like this, I love to see them, and when I saw the movie "The Fifth Element" I said that I will be looking for movies with more imagination and more action.  I loved it when this movie came out and it remains one of my favorite sci-fis movies of all time.  For some reason I never watched it again until I saw it on DVD.  This movie is a classic and I hope to see it again one day.  Thanks for watching my review!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sure I've seen this film at least a dozen times but have only ever seen it on VHS.  The film is set in a large warehouse in downtown Seattle in 1970. The warehouse is under constant surveillance by armed security. It's an interesting concept and even though the plot is very uninteresting it is still very fun to watch and I loved the way the director brought out the paranoia of the situation.   It is a true look into what it would be like if the security systems weren't working but the story isn't about that and the film has some really great character performances. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My second film. This movie is absolutely beautiful. I had never seen the "The Girl Who Played with Fire" until I found it on the big screen on a festival tour in Japan. I was instantly transported back to that movie, and found myself glued to the screen. This is a beautiful story. Great casting, directing, and writing. I'd never seen anything like this before in my life. I loved it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is a bit slow at the start, but this is understandable. The characters are all pretty much on different levels of maturity. They have a lot to learn about each other before they even get a chance to really form an attraction to each other.  The two principal characters are a teacher (Joan Crawford) who was raped and murdered in her car, and a girl she was sleeping with. She is really upset about it, and the way she sees the boy's behavior really shows her that she is being used for revenge.  Their romance is a great contrast to the crime, because he wants to get revenge on her. He doesn't understand why she's so upset over him. He just thinks he's trying to help her, and he's very much like the teacher he thinks he is.  When he says he can teach her a lot about life he means he can be her personal mentor, and that she's very special to him.  A lot of the relationship is based on the tension between the two characters, and there is an undeniable intensity between them.  For the first time the two main characters have a connection that can't be explained in a short scene.  This is an emotionally powerful film.  I wish I had seen this in theaters when it first came out, but I didn't realize it was about this kind of romance.  As a film that is supposed to be about friendship it has a lot of heart to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie more than the first one. I thought the story was better.   The first one was a bit boring and repetitive but it really made you feel for the guys.  The second one was way better but it didn't have any of the same feelings. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In short, this is a very enjoyable film, filled with interesting moments.   The characters are well thought out and the acting is good.  I thought it would take longer than half an hour to get to know the characters and the story line, but it actually came across that way.  It is also interesting to see how a good thriller gets made.  The film opens with a nice action sequence with two men being chased by a large truck and the chase is beautifully shot, though it did seem like a little too much at times.  There are some great close ups in this film which really enhance the suspense and drama.  A very good action film, it is definitely worth seeing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie and so did my two daughters. It was a lot of fun for all ages, especially my 8 yrs old daughter.   The actors were great and the plot was a good way to kick off the movie series.  My only regret is that it didn't go on more and get more sequels.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My husband and I saw this movie in the theater last weekend and were both pleasantly surprised at the quality. It is one of the best made comedies ever. The script is written with a unique take on the subject matter. A good story told with good actors and decent cinematography and editing. If you want a good laugh and have a hard time finding one then this might be the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie, I had never heard of the author, and I didn't even know that he wrote science fiction. My first impression of the movie was that it was a very well-made and suspenseful thriller, set in the distant future.   And for once, I was pleased with what I saw:  This movie is good. It's not exactly science fiction, but it isn't completely nonsensical either. I don't know what it is about the writing, but this movie has a wonderful feeling to it that doesn't belong in just about any other movie.  The screenplay is very well thought out, and very well done.  It's hard to say just what this movie is, but I'm willing to give it a good shot:  And here's the trailer for the movie:
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have enjoyed the films from this director and his teams, all are unique and have a high quality, and are all in the genre of Westerns.  He has a high skill in all the projects he has done, and with this film I would say it is his best work.   The actors are great, and the director knows how to tell a good story.  The only thing that bothers me is that there are two versions of the film, the first being a rough cut, and then a finished film.  It's better if there was a full version of the movie, not just the rough cut.  I would like to see a more finished and finished version of this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was made on a very small budget and had a great script. The cast did a fine job, with John Gielgud as the villain (as good a villain as can be), and he made a very believable and well thought out bad guy. The story was well done, the actors did their jobs very well and all the parts worked well together. The effects work in the movie was outstanding, and the cinematography was so good that it took the viewer out of the story and into the film itself. The music and soundtrack was just the right amount of action and suspense. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good time, and anyone who just wants to see good acting and good acting done very well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am giving it 4 stars because it is not a good film, but it does the job of teaching a good lesson about the dangers of the big city and its inhabitants. This is definitely an excellent example of what one would expect to see in a movie made in Detroit.   This film is more of a warning about the nature of our country, and how society has become so corrupted and evil that it's almost not funny anymore. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this a few years back on a very dark, disturbing night and it was one of the few films I remember that really gripped me and stayed with me.   This is a film that you don't want to miss and I'm glad to have seen it again.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a great movie, but it could be better in some ways. I felt like the movie was missing something at the end, and I had a hard time understanding how this movie ended. I don't mind sci-fi and space movies, but this one was overstuffed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts with an old movie poster, a title, and the date of this film. Â From there, the plot is explained.   There are three families:  One has two kids:  The children of the first family are very sick, so the first child goes to a psychiatrist who treats him.  One of the children in the first parent's family was raped.  The second parent finds out, takes her child and runs away with him, leaving her husband to keep the child.  There is a second kid:  He is the son of the girl who was raped by the first kid.  He has a sister who is pregnant.  She tries to get away with her child, but gets caught by the father.  In order to get a divorce, the first couple tries to have the second couple killed.  What follows is a love story.  A nice twist on a classic love story that has been so overplayed over the years.  It is a story of betrayal and survival. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very enjoyable film. The story is great and it is clear that there is a real love between the two stars. I thought this was just what they needed to pull a sequel off.    I really enjoyed this. I was happy that it didn't end up looking like a crappy rip off of Star Wars, but there were still parts I didn't like. This was really good, even if it is a bit old school. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter had seen the movie "The Great Escape" and wanted to see this one. We drove over to a mall in Long Island. The clerk at the mall said it had been around for a while but she thought it was a new movie. We were a little apprehensive and the movie went on so quickly. It had a wonderful sound to it. The cast was perfect. They were all very nice. We all left laughing a lot. The movie was well acted and it was about the Great Escape. It's always fun to hear about the movie that inspired it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never heard of this movie before and was just watching it with my girlfriend when the screen went off, I checked my wife and she said she did not hear it either. We did not want to stop watching it, we just kept it on. The movie is great and there are some great scenes, you should watch it in the theatre because you won't believe the story that is told. It is a good flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A pretty good movie.   This movie is very good and it will stay with you for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie, and this isn't just my opinion. It's the way that this movie has the characters and the writing make it even better. I feel like the movie is better if you just take the plot and not think about anything else. It takes you on a roller coaster ride and the characters are just wonderful.   The best part of this movie is when the two best actors, Chris Tucker and Linda Hamilton, are talking to each other and it's like a real conversation. I think it's so great because the movie doesn't waste time with dialogue because it knows it's going to be about talking, not talking.  I would definitely recommend this movie if you like an interesting look at life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the best science fiction film I have seen.  It does an excellent job of showing us an alternate reality where the U.S. is now run by a dictatorship and its people live in a hellish nightmare.  This film does not have a happy ending as its ending is quite disturbing, but I did not mind it all that much.   It is a great watch for all people who want an excellent movie about what happens when one man changes the world in the name of technology. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fine example of the kind of film that was made in the late 1960's and early 1970's that was truly a departure from all that had come before it, The Day The Earth Stood Still remains today as an awesome adventure that is both suspenseful and suspenseful enough to leave a viewer feeling utterly enthralled by its plot and its characters.    The film is based on the book of the same name by Ernest Cline, and it tells the story of a scientist on a remote Earth-like planet who is contacted by an alien race of beings that look a lot like us, but also seem to be very different from us, and in the process of communicating, the man finds out that the planet is a living organism which is being manipulated by a much more advanced, and extremely evil, force in the universe.  It was the perfect movie for the time and certainly remains a fine example, in my opinion, of the way that science fiction should look.  For example, it does not use any special effects in any of its scenes and its acting is as good as it gets.  All of its characters, however, are just so interesting to watch and the way the film depicts its sci-fi elements with such real, believable detail makes it a delight to watch, and one that I would recommend to anyone who loves this genre and anyone who enjoys a good adventure story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is great! The acting is outstanding! I love the "gosh darnit" scene. It was just great! And it's a fun scene to watch.   A very "sporty" film. I love how the car is never seen again after this movie.  A lot of the "tough guys" in this film are really just plain tough guys. The one with the pistol is really cool.  I hope this film gets some more attention.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent documentary on the origins and history of the Vietnam War. This movie is very well done and extremely well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story takes place in the early 70's in the town of Fortuna, Indiana.   It is about a young couple who move from California to Fortun, but their love is short lived.  It has the feel of a modern day fairytale.  They move to the town to start a new life, but the young man's father is not pleased, and soon the couple are caught in a series of events that lead them to believe they have been abandoned by God.  The music is really good, and the performances are all great. Â One thing I did not like about the movie is the ending.  I think that it was poorly done, and it seemed that the movie was trying to be more than it was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went with my brother and my dad to see this movie on a school trip and my mom took me to the lobby of the theater and sat in the back row because my brother didn't want to sit next to me. We didn't know a lot about this movie when we saw it but we liked it anyway. It was not a great movie but it did have a pretty good message and at the very end the little girl looks into the camera and says she is sorry that this is how it is going to be. If you go to see it you might want to leave early, we had to wait for the movie to start but when it did start we were in love.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is one of those times where you can't help but think of the classic "Ghostbusters" movies. I'm not the biggest of the "Ghostbuster" fans and never really liked the series but this is a perfect blend of the classics.  Â The main story arc is told in the style of a film noir and it really brings back that feeling.  The movie does not overstay its welcome in that sense.  It has a fast pace, is funny, and can be scary at the same time.  There is a great villain in this film, and he gets his moments, as well.  This is not the kind of movie you need to sit through all in one sitting, but if you want a good laugh and/or want to watch a good film then you owe it to yourself to watch this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am sorry that I didn't like this film as much as the people who say it is a great film.   The story takes place in an unnamed country in Central America, but the characters are all from Los Angeles. The story begins in a bar, and it continues in the streets of that very bar. Â As the film progresses the characters find themselves in the middle of a political and economic crisis and are drawn into a conspiracy.  The movie is interesting, but I didnÂ´t like the characters.  I think it would have been better had they been in the bar with the characters and not outside of it.  It is really good to see a movie that is set in a different country and where the characters don't get involved in something that is so obvious that it might as well not be there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never realized how much I hated this film until I saw it. It took me forever to find a copy of the movie. It was on VHS for a while before I got a VHS copy of it. Now that I have it, I love it. This film is so much better than I ever thought it would be. It has such a good story, with such great performances, and it gives the feeling that you are actually seeing a real war on the screen. The scenes of the actual battle are shot brilliantly. You don't feel like you are watching a movie or something you've seen before, and the only time I remember that feeling before was when I saw this movie. I was a bit worried because it was all in black and white, but it looks great. A few other things I loved about the film are the effects and special effects. I always loved watching people die, and this film gave me that. It also had some great fight scenes, and some of my favorite scenes in a long time. I have seen a lot of action films since then, but I still always go back to this film.   A bit of a warning, this movie has some great scenes, but the action takes a bit away from the story. Some of the shots are incredible, but not every time, and not every scene is very interesting. If you want to see some epic action scenes, this film is definitely the way to go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a time where people are so judgmental and they can't take any criticism they can, this movie is the perfect example of how good films can still be entertaining.

It doesn't get boring, even if you watch it all the time.  I was a little tired of the last film by this guy, but this one is a pretty good follow-up.  It's definitely a good enough movie that it should be seen at least once, and the cast is a little better this time around. Â  I'll be glad to see it in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really glad I bought this. It was not in my price range, but I bought it anyway. I am glad I did. It is very much worth it. It just so happened to be a great holiday movie. I would love to see more from this movie and would love for it to be the next "Harry Potter."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new take on a classic story by the master!  This was a surprise gem!  What a fantastic adaptation!  It wasn't until I saw this movie that I realized why I was such a big fan of the first movie. The film starts with a fantastic scene, and this film is perfect. You don't really see the entire movie until the end. Â    The original movie was done in black and white, but director Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job at getting it done in color! Â   Â   The acting was amazing, even the extras were great!   Â  The film was a little slow, and the plot is pretty simple. The twist at the end was amazing.  The best thing about this film was the music, the music alone kept me on the edge of my seat!  Don't miss this classic film.   It's a very well made film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this when it first came out back in 1993. Back then it was quite an action movie, but over the years it had become quite boring and predictable. It had been remade several times with better performances and better cinematography, but it still wasn't all that much different. The first time I saw it, I didn't mind the overacting. But now, the acting has become very stale and boring. I don't get the need for the action to be all over the place like it was in the first one, because this isn't a big action movie. I guess I just find it boring to see an action hero run around with a machine gun for almost half the movie. The most exciting scenes are the ones that show he's actually going to get killed or beat up. I'm not sure why the writers kept making these action scenes, as they didn't seem to last more than a few minutes.   Also, it seems the writers changed their mind about the whole no blood thing. The guy who plays the bad guy in the third film has his eyes completely blown out by the bad guys. They just used his dead body for the climax.  If you like this kind of thing, you'll like this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie twice now, on video and again on DVD. Both times I've been in the mood for a good "romantic comedy" but this was much more than that. It was a dark, sophisticated, interesting, and thought-provoking film. The characters were well-developed. The screenplay was brilliant and so were the performances. The cinematography was a pleasure to watch and the music was just as exciting as the acting. You should try this film and you won't regret it. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in college and this movie opened at the Cinema Village theater near my dorm. It played at midnight on a Wednesday and the theater manager, who was a friend of my roommate, was on the phone when it opened. So, when the movie opened and a bunch of people walked in, he turned off the lights and turned on the popcorn for everyone. So everyone was drinking popcorn and he didn't realize this until someone told him after the movie had ended. I think he's going to miss a lot of money if he goes to court.   A lot of people have mentioned that the movie is really old, but I found it to be really fun to watch. The cast does a good job of keeping it fresh. The story is interesting and funny, the actors did a good enough job. It doesn't feel like it's trying to be old, because it's definitely not. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been meaning to revisit this movie for some time.   This is a film that I think people haven't seen.  The film has a very different atmosphere from other Italian Coppola films.  It is a very good film with a very distinct style that I haven't found elsewhere.  My favorite scene is where she drives in a cemetery.  I found that a lot of other directors don't do that.  This scene was in a different genre than the rest of the film and I felt it was very well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the film captures the whole idea of friendship in a rather simplistic way. I don't want to say the film is shallow because in my opinion it's quite smart. I just didn't like the way the characters treated each other. They seem to think it's so much fun to be mean to each other and I wish the story was told a little bit differently.   A good friendship starts with a great kiss, and this is that kiss.

If you haven't seen it, make sure you rent this movie from your local video store. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie, as you would expect from a Wes Anderson movie. The cast is great, and the story is really good.   It has a real edge to it that really sets it apart from other movies from the director.  There are some funny lines here and there, and it definitely has a touch of romance, but I also found myself smiling more than a few times.  It's a great fun watch, and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film's story is one of the many aspects that I enjoyed about it.   It's a story of a young orphan who, after leaving his father in a fight, meets a young girl who promises to take care of him while he's away.  The two become fast friends but when they meet up again, the girl's family and friends start to suspect the boy is having an affair.  I found that the film handled the situations well and never made it feel like a soap opera.  There is a great deal of depth to the characters and even though they can be a bit of a pushover at times, the relationship between the two is always worth watching.  Even though the film is set in an orphanage, it's never treated like one, and you'll enjoy the little touches like the parents making sure their child doesn't go to bed without them (just in case the boy was to steal some of the family's money!).   I also loved that the movie's setting never feels like a stereotypical Japanese one.  Although I've seen it before, the film's setting was really unique and made the story even more interesting.  In addition, the ending was pretty awesome and added a nice twist to the story.  While I loved the film, I can see why it's a classic from the early '60s.  A great film, just not my favorite. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After the success of the first two movies I expected this one to be a blockbuster, I was not disappointed. I thought it was a good story and the action was great, the acting was also great, and the movie has a fantastic soundtrack.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story was interesting and had a happy ending.  The cinematography was very good.  All of the extras are here for free so you won't miss a thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what you're getting with this film. It's a movie about a man who kills prostitutes, and it's not very good. The story is so poorly written, and if you were to read it, you'd think it was a thriller, but it isn't. The dialogue is awful, it takes a good ten minutes before anything interesting happens. But then, the sex is the best part of the film, and even though the acting isn't great, the cinematography does it justice. I can't wait to see this movie again!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you first watch it, I was a little worried.   It's very low budget, and doesn't really do much with the plot, which is not even that good.  But it's a really great movie.  The music is really amazing.  It makes you feel like you are in a different place, like you're in the middle of a movie that was meant to be in a certain place, but somehow ended up there.  And there's a nice balance of humor and tension, which are really hard to pull off well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie, the most original I have seen, it has a real feeling of "being there", very realistic, and I like how they did it, I like the way they used the "ghost" part, with the way the music and film effects and everything was done to it.   The story is very good, the only thing I dislike was when the camera would cut back and forth, it didn't make sense for the story, and it made the characters seem out of place.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of this film, even though it's fairly old, is still very good. I've heard many different stories about this movie. I think the story may have been inspired by a movie called, "The Man Who Sold the World", which is a story about a man who was selling things in New York City on the street corners. Well, I've always believed that movie to be true. And, this movie was not a one time event. It was an ongoing, long running story. I believe that the "S" was inspired by the name of one of the partners of that company. It's one of those movies that I will always remember.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Lord of the Rings" is the most successful and beloved fantasy franchise of all time. Even people who don't like fantasy movies like it.   I am a huge fan of Lord of The Rings, the trilogy. I have read most of the books, listened to the audio books and watched the video tapes. I don't own the books.  I really thought that they were going to do a trilogy.  This movie was the third or fourth.  Yes, there was a film of course. I am not sure if it was a 3D movie or a real 2D movie, but there was definitely some special effects. It looked very nice in the theater. The whole movie looked like a Tolkien movie. And it had so much to do with the films that came before it. This was the only one that I haven't seen yet.  The film is the one that was made for the big screen. You have a LOT of extra scenes.  But the acting is amazing. I always wanted to see Elijah Wood in a Lord of Rings movie, and he did it here with some very subtle performances.  My favorite parts were in the scenes with Bilbo and Gandalf.  Bilbo had been through some rough times as a hobbit, but he has found his place in the world. He is still a humble hobbit. And Gandalf has really come into his own as a great wizard and a great leader.  All of the characters were in great shape in the Lord of "The Rings."  They all have had a lot of ups and downs over the years.  "Rings" is my favorite film out of all the Hobbit films. I never thought I would get to see these actors in a Tolkien film.  A lot of people may hate this movie. But to me it was really great!  There are not that many Lord of- Rings films. This movie is one of them.  It had some of the best acting out of any of the films. The costumes were just stunning.  And it is a wonderful film. It takes place in a LOTR world.  What did you think of this movie?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - A really good movie to watch when you feel a bit low and need something to do with your mind. - I like how the characters act in the scenes with no dialogue and how it gives the movie a feeling of drama. -   I do not know why they chose a movie called "The Last Train" for the film about a train crash, but they did it and it is good.

A very enjoyable action movie with a classic story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cast is perfect, it's a love story, no other kind of love stories in this kind of movie, because the love story is so powerful, even if it has one problem, the love of the father, the mother, the brother, the sister, the nephew, the great love of his life, the one that had him come to the city, and was always there, he was there when they were little, he took them to the theatre, he brought them to see great movies, he tried to understand them, he knew what they needed and they didn't see it, he didn't understand them but he gave them the love they needed, this is a great love story that makes you cry, the whole thing is very tragic, they have a lot of pain, the father and his family, their love for each other and their loss and everything is very sad.   The plot is simple, it is very funny, there are two different characters, one is in love with his brother, he is an old man, the other one is a young woman who falls for him, he has many problems and she falls in love at first sight, there is some romance there, there was a lot more romance and some great scenes in this movie, it really is funny, and you laugh a lot, the jokes are really funny.  The director, he knows how to make a film with great story and good acting, he really knows how the story is going to go, and there are moments that make you think, the last scene of this movie where the father finds out that he is the only child and he realizes that he loves his brother as well as his son, that scene was so beautiful, it was beautiful, and that really makes you think and give you hope.  I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know if it's my mind playing tricks on me or my memories playing tricks but when I was in college I would visit the theaters to see old movies I didn't watch anymore. I was pretty young when I saw this film so it was very fresh to my memory.    If I have one problem with this film, it's that the ending was somewhat unsatisfying to me. I felt like a character I didnÃ­t really care for was going to be able to get away with what he did.  The only reason this film was considered good by me was the performances by all of the characters.  Fascinating, but unsatisfying:  This film was made during the 50Ã­s and 60Ã­s. I've seen films that had more sex, but this one was unique. I loved the way the movie was made. It was very well done and the way it was shot was interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â " I've been waiting for someone to make a good action film with no guns and no explosions. It is the best of the best, and I don't believe it should be missed."    In the wake of the Vietnam war and the resulting loss of life, there is a great deal of controversy and controversy about the use of combat vehicles in war. However, the use in the film is very minimal. The vehicle that appears to be the main antagonist, the Humvee is simply a military vehicle used in combat in Vietnam, not a gun carriage. The Humvees seen in this film are armored and equipped with several machine guns and can be outfitted with grenade launchers or machine guns. The battle scenes are excellent, the camerawork is superb, and the special effects are very imaginative. The acting is very good, but the music isn't quite up to the level of the battle scenes. The film is worth watching, but not a must-see.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoy this movie, and I feel I should add that I was really impressed with the special effects as well.    The sound was so realistic I actually had to think of it as a movie.  There were some cool stuff at the beginning.  But, as the story unfolded it all became very silly and unrealistic.  A very nice blend of action, comedy and emotion.  Â The ending was great.  If you like action and adventure, this movie is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best of all 3 and probably the best film of all time.   It is just so perfect.  It has all the classic elements of classic movies... and it has so many surprises.  The plot is extremely well-done.  Each character is unique and has his/her own story to tell.  Even the characters in the background.  And the acting is great.  This is a great piece of classic movie acting that will stay with you long after you watch.  If you are looking for an old time movie... look no further than this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about the history of the Chinese People's War and the struggle against Japan. It's also about the people and their lives after the war. The movie shows the reality of life after the Japanese occupation.   It's a historical movie, but it's not really about the war, it's about the politics behind the war and the war itself.  The director, Zhang Yimou, is an expert in historical and political movies. The story and the cinematography are excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is set during the American Civil War in Kentucky, and the movie makes good use of the period and the locale. It follows two young men, John Wayne and Clark Gable, both veterans who have lost a great deal in war and have been sent back to the North to fight it again. I liked the way Gable and Wayne both talk about how the war is something like a "spiritual battle". The action scenes were very good and very realistic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie in a small cinema, and it didn't disappoint. The story was told in short, punchy bursts, but the scenes were quite entertaining in their own right. A young woman (Jessica Lange) is called away by her abusive husband (John Goodman) who is on the run from the police. She goes out to find him, but she finds that he has a brother (Tim Roth) who has just recently become a millionaire. They are on an exotic island, and the island has a great view over the city - but the couple is unaware that the police have followed them there! The couple are trying to hide their riches, and when they are caught they are in the crosshairs of some very dangerous criminals. This is a very exciting and exciting film. I can't wait to see more of it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went into this movie completely blind. I saw no reviews at all. I went to the video store and was looking around at some other movies and I saw that there was a movie called The Manchurian Candidate. I didn't think anything of it. It seemed really innocent. I had to have it. So I went and got it.   When I first opened it up, I didn''t like it at all, at all in fact. The opening scene where this guy was talking about going into the woods to find out more about these aliens or whatever was really disturbing, and I thought, "I don''t know, this is going to be hard to watch." But it turned out to be really interesting.  It was interesting to find the human side to it. The guy, while he was talking, was very, very disturbed and very suspicious and he was really looking to see if these aliens were real or not. It''s not like the aliens were trying to trick him. It wasn''t just a case of "I'm here, I''m the guy, I know what I''ll do."  But when I saw it again, I realized that it was good, and it is a good thriller. And then in the second act, the guy turns out to have some real insight into this, and that was really interesting to me.  I think that the best way to go into a horror film is to watch the film and then watch the sequel.  So I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The picture is of a movie that is supposed to be a love story between two people but the movie fails at being anything but a love poem. I had watched this movie a couple of years ago and it had much better acting and better acting made me believe this movie would be the one to do it and if it wasn't, this movie is still one of my favorites of the year but it is still very inconsistent. The acting is much better when the couple are alone together and when the camera doesn't keep going around them. I was actually surprised when I watched the movie for the first time as I really did think this would be an action movie but when the action scenes start, it is not a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am amazed at how much the filmmakers got right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I am honest, I was a bit sceptical going in to watch this. After all, I have to admit, I did not think I would have a real issue with such an awful movie. I am so glad I have a hard heart, I thought I would be a complete jerk and I would hate the movie.   I was actually blown away.  In my opinion it is the best movie made by Paul Verhoeven in the 70's, he really went on a journey with this one and it turned out to be a master piece of cinema.  For an example of Verhoeve's genius, take this scene:  Now, this scene is so brilliantly written that it will not even show up on my video camera's video recorder.  Let's just say, that was a very long scene to watch, but it was well worth it.  I watched it over and over and it still leaves me in awe, I can't think of any scene in that movie that I would not enjoy watching again.  Paul Verhoven made an epic movie and I hope he is around for a while.  It was fun, exciting, and I highly recommend it for a good laugh.  A must watch movie for fans of science fiction and horror.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky enough to find this movie at a local theater during a late run. I was already a fan of the film "Hitchcock". I remember it as one of the first big horror films. This film is a pretty accurate reproduction of the making of that film and is well worth the price of admission.   The special effects, especially of a woman getting a bloody head wound were pretty impressive.  I would have given this film a 5 star rating if not for one aspect. The ending of the movie, after the girl has had her head severed from her body, she looks around, and is completely shocked to see the doctor who has just killed her. What happened to the girl? She is looking at him and says something about how "it had to happen". I do not get why the doctor has not been arrested for murder...

The house itself has a lot of history behind it, with many strange deaths in the past, and a dark secret in the basement. Very good and scary movie. The effects were amazing and the actors gave the role all they had.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at the local movie house back in the early 80's. I remember seeing this movie back when it was the big blockbuster, and being a big fan of the John Carpenter and Michael J. Fox.   This movie was made for kids.  If you are a little kid, this movie is totally for you. Â The animation is great.  All the characters are very animated, and they do a great job of giving them personality.  I can still see myself in this movie.  It has that 1980's feeling of the 80's with its scary movie plot, killer clown, and cheesy music.  The actors are all good.  There is a young version of the killer clown.  My parents loved it.  This is one of those movies that you never forget. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The picture is excellent. I love the look of the film. And the voice acting is perfect.  The music is also very nice. And I'm a big fan of the song that plays over the end credits (see my review of that film ).   I'm not sure if I would be interested in seeing this on DVD, since the picture is pretty darn good and the voice-over is pretty good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a really good movie, even for those who don't like the genre.   The movie has a lot of action, and they use that in a smart way, not just putting a lot more bullets in the guns.  The acting is really good in this one too, and it's really hard to not enjoy these guys.  I recommend it to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was great. It was just as much about the movie as it was the war. It gave you a glimpse of the war but then took you off to the next war to fight it.   I'm glad to see that someone else got to tell the true story of how the war was won. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. Its not the best but it was fun to watch. The way the story was told was entertaining and interesting.   The story of these four kids who play ball against adults in a park is interesting to say the least.  The movie was a bit long at 10 hours but it made for a good day out for the family.  It really showed how people are willing to go to great lengths to compete and have a good time.  All of the kids had good personalities.  There were a few bad actors but the ones that worked the most out did so well.  For a teen comedy I give it a 8.5/10   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are few films more emotionally devastating than the film "The Killing." And even though the film deals with the death of a woman, it does not feel like it. I found myself unable to truly relate to the story and the characters. The film also has a beautiful score which makes the viewing of the film even more powerful. The whole movie is just a beautiful reflection of the people involved. I am not saying that I won't watch the film again, but the first time, the first impression was so powerful, and I don't think that it will ever be the same.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the better movies that I've seen in a long time, a very tense and interesting psychological thriller.   The characters are very well written and very well developed.  The story is very interesting and never fails to keep you interested and on the edge of your seat.  There are very few things you would expect from a thriller but you are not disappointed.  It is a good example of how a movie can be made that is very realistic and is not a throwback to the old B-movie.  My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As the title indicates, this is a very well made movie that is definitely worth watching. The plot is very believable and it has a great atmosphere. In fact, I loved the movie more than any other movie that i saw in the last 2 years, and it is also very entertaining to watch. The characters are very well played and they give off an impression of a good time that just happens to be set in a very depressing setting. A well made, very well acted movie. The acting was great and the music was great too. And there was also a very beautiful girl in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - September 11, 2004Great Movie  Reviewer: nfrcf4life - favorite favorite favorite - August 31, 2004  Subject: I like this movie, but.... I know it is bad, but it was a fun movie to watch, not the worst film I have ever seen by any stretch of the imagination, it is just that bad it's almost as bad as a bad dream, with all the horrible images of the dead people, a couple of creepy scenes and a pretty good soundtrack that was a little strange to hear (this was when cassettes were common)   It just seems like the movie was made with a really low budget, but I suppose it was done for a low budget. I guess the director just thought it would be cool if all the deaths in the film happened at the same time, and the victims would all be in the same place, with only an hour or so before the bodies are decomposing. Of course, the result was that the corpses were all different sizes and colors, and it was just too much for the camera crew to handle. They really needed to use a bigger film camera, or have someone take a lot more pictures of the corpse corpses, and then it would have been more believable.   This is one of those rare films that is really, really hard to watch. It will not leave you with many questions, and not that much information, which I suppose makes it a little more interesting for me to watch than most others. The only thing I would have added to it, would be the extra gore shots, and I don't know about you, but those make me a little creeped out. - August 25, 2004I like this film, but.......

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never heard of this movie before and was surprised by it's quality, it was fun and entertaining. The writing was very funny, I didn't expect it to be so good. My only complaint is that I didn' t understand a word of the dialogue at times. It might be because I was so excited about watching the movie that I couldn't concentrate. The sound effects and music were great and the special effects were excellent. The acting was great too. I'm sure it wasn't the greatest movie ever made but it was pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is amazing. It has everything we have seen before, and more!   From the time the two of the boys are watching a show, to the end when the family leaves, the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.   There are times when you'll have to put the movie down to catch your breath, and you will wish there was more.  This movie needs to be watched again, and again, if for nothing else than to understand the true nature of the evil in the world.  It's a long film, but it's worth the price of admission.   Did you miss anything?  1 out of 1 found this review helpful.  I really enjoyed this movie and the cast in it was great. When the ending hit I just sat back and was glad that we were all able to see a good ending. The story line was easy to follow and the acting was great throughout the whole movie. Overall it was a great movie and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm happy I watched this movie. It was a lot of fun.   It's a little slow at the beginning, but once it gets going, it is a very good film.  I've heard that the story was not quite as interesting as the director wanted it to be, but that's only because they didn't have a real story to tell.  The actors are great.  They are great actors that do a good job of portraying their characters.  One actor in particular that I liked was Billy Bob Thornton. He was a great actor who showed that he still had a lot to give.  Overall, it's a great movie that's very funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie about a girl and her sister that lived in a trailer behind a factory. The sister was a pretty hot hottie and the sister's boyfriends had a weird fetish for her.   The film was just so bad I could not believe it. I would never buy a ticket for a movie like this.  The trailer was so bad, the girls face and body were all over the place, especially the face. This film was like it was shot in a different country. The people in the trailer were all rude and mean to the sisters. They even did some odd stuff. There is one scene when the trailer is being towed from the scene and the sisters are walking home. The trailer has no front, back or side views, it was so badly made I was afraid for the girls safety. I'm a little ashamed to even watch this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is definitely one of the most underrated films in Hollywood history. It's not a great movie, and I have no interest in seeing it again, but I would love to see a film on the topic of the JFK assassination.   I really enjoyed this movie, as it does an excellent job of portraying the complexities of the assassination. It is truly an excellent movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not a "super hero movie", it's a story about a man who is constantly being attacked by bad guys. Not only that, but he gets away with everything because he's super, super, and super-strong. The only problem is the director's ego.   A bit of a shame, but it's worth watching because it's pretty awesome. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had not heard of "The Shining" or Stanley Kubrick until after my first viewing of this movie. I had recently purchased the book by the director, which seemed to provide a good overview of the project, and it has since become one of my favorite books. It seemed like it was written in a different time, but still very insightful. Kubrick really knows how to show how a normal man would react when faced with such a psychological horror. The first half of the film is really scary, but the second half makes you think twice before going into that bathroom. If I hadn't read the book before watching this movie, I would not have been prepared for the ending. However, the film has many strong moments that are quite unique. The editing throughout the film and the music, all make the film even scarier.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the 80's I was a kid and I saw this film when it was being released on VHS and I remember being in awe of how beautiful the movie was and how much the music and story was telling me.    Now that I'm an adult I wish I had seen this film back in the day and loved it as much as the kids did.  I wish the director would have directed a little more at the young movie goers and the story being told.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie is a great combination of the two things I love most in movies - action and comedy.   This movie is filled with the best action sequences ever filmed - not to mention that the villains are all hilarious, especially the big bad who wears an old man's clothing and a mustache.  The other half of this movie is equally as fun, and has some of the best acting to be found in a James Bond movie.  It also has a few moments of great comedy, but in the end, it is really a mixture of the great action and funny comedy. "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" is one of my favorite James Bond movies of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is great.  The director of this film, John Woo, has had a great career, his last film was "Double Dragon", the film was excellent.  His last film "Hard Boiled" was also great. He has a way of making us believe in this characters.  It is always great to watch an action film and this film is another film that is on the top of my list.   My only gripe is that the opening of the film is not as awesome as it is in the ending of the second film.  However it is still a great film and if you like John Woo you will love this film.

She is the only person on the film who gets to say anything, and is clearly a very likable character.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You really have to see this movie for yourself to understand how brilliant it is.   It's not really easy to talk about this movie without being a little dramatic, but I'll try.  I went into this film thinking it was some kind of comedy, but when I got into it I realized it was a real psychological thriller.  The movie starts out with our main character, a retired doctor, working as a consultant in an office building. A woman comes to his office asking for a "little time with my doctor."  The woman is very attractive, and he's kind of fascinated by her, but he's also kind of creeped out. He has no idea how much she wants to talk to him, and when he leaves, she follows him.  It takes a while to get the movie moving, but once we do it really goes on an emotional roller coaster.  From the opening shots of a beautiful woman walking through the office, through the awkward conversation she has with our doctor, to the unexpected ending and a beautiful shot of a sunset over the ocean, this movie is really a treat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm watching this movie for the first time today, and I had to watch it in 3D because I'm not used to it. This movie is a great mix of thriller, science fiction and fantasy. The main character, Lenny, is a very nice guy who is trying to make money by running his own transport company, but he has no experience or knowledge of any of this stuff, so he's in trouble. The crew on the ship have to be pulled together and help him find his way. This film does a fantastic job of showing all the various cultures and groups that live on this ship, and all the trouble he has to face when he gets lost or gets involved in a criminal scheme. There's even a nice message about how it's not just a matter of being able to get the stuff to the destination in time, but that it's the people involved that have to work together and keep each other in check. I was impressed by the use of many different sets and locations.   The film also has some excellent special effects, but I think the best thing that stood out to me was the performance of Christopher Lambert as Lenny.

In my opinion, this movie was made because it was seen on TV when it was first made.  A movie of this quality should be seen by everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at a theater near a college and we were pretty much the only people there. We were seated in the 2nd row, and I thought the seats were a bit more comfortable. The movie was pretty good. They went for an older audience, which I guess was a good idea. There were plenty of jokes. I love the "I don't think the kid was in love" joke, and it really stuck out. The guy who was talking was quite funny. The scene with the girl and her dad, in a diner is a bit hard to get through, but when you get to the part where the dad talks to the girl, you're into it, and you start laughing. The rest of the movie was decent. The girl's mom was pretty annoying, and then there were all these commercials. There wasn't too much of a plot going on, but it got me to go out to see a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie three times, and each time the first time I went in I was scared. I had heard horror stories about this film, but to have to see it myself was truly frightening. The first time, I was in my mom's house, and in the house next door was my uncle. My dad and his girlfriend were on the other side of the door. The movie was going on in the next room, and when I got out of my mom and uncle's house I could hear it just outside the door that was a window of a house across the street, and I had to turn my head around and see what was going. I went outside, and the movie was a horror movie! The guy in the mask was in front of me, with a mask on his face, and he was holding a little black girl. I saw her for a second, but I don't know what to make of that, and then it was gone. So my dad grabbed my mom, and told her to shut the door, and to go in her room. My mom told him not to go into my room, but she did, and she didn't know why she did. It didn't make sense, so she had me watch the movie, which I never do because I'm too scared. It scared the hell out of me. I just didn't want to leave the house. The next time I saw it, I wasn't as scared, because I had been watching a different movie with my dad, and my dad didn't have a mask, but it was still the same story. So it was different. My parents were scared that they would come home and find me watching the movie with them. When my dad and I were in the bathroom, my mom was in the mirror looking at her hair. So I grabbed her and went to the door and opened it. She yelled, and said she didn' want to be alone with me, so I told her I was going outside, but that I wouldn't be going far, and would come back if she called me back. So she said okay and we went outside. As soon as I got outside, it was the same movie. I ran down the hill and hid. I tried calling my mom at her phone, but there was no answer. We were in fear, because the movie started playing over and over and she knew it wasn't over. I'm sure it was too much for her.

I would not say it's a great movie but it's good, not amazing. I have a hard time believing in the movie that this is based on. I feel this is a lot of hocus-pocus and makes it seem like they did a whole lot to the story and characters and did not make it believable. I really hope this film is made into a TV series because I really enjoyed this movie and will watch it again.

And it does a great job of taking a story that doesn't involve superheroes, and making it into one that has superheroes and an alien.    I am not a huge fan of the first Aliens movie.

This was a truly great movie about a man who became a hero as a child.  It has a good cast, and I would've never guessed that it was made when it was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film a few months ago, and it is still the best film that I have seen in a while.  It is a very dark comedy that shows you that no matter how much you love something, you will not always like it.  This film is the best example of how a little bit of inspiration can change your life.   It really brings you to the edge of your seat as you watch as a character is slowly getting used to their new life as an underground drug runner. Â The story was very well done, and the actors who played the leads really did a great job of making you care about these two men. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is wonderful, a wonderful love story about a wonderful couple.   I feel this film is not only a great tribute to the Italian art house cinema of the early 1970's, but also one that is full of fun and interesting twists and turns. Â The movie is written and directed by a young man who has yet to get his big break.  There are several things in this film that I found very strange.  I found myself wondering why he chose this particular film for the soundtrack.  He is not known for directing good Italian films.  It seemed like an odd choice for a soundtrack. I feel it was not a great choice.  This is what I mean.  The music is a little generic.  His acting is solid, but doesn't seem like he was having a lot of fun during the shooting of this movie.  Â    My only complaint is that I wish this movie had been longer.  All of the story was just too short for this movie to have been that great.  Some of it may be a little boring for those not familiar with the Italian Cinema. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was the first movie I saw that actually showed me that we were wrong, that the "Star Wars" universe wasn't just fantasy, but a believable and believable place. The script was terrific, the cast did a great job, the special effects were great (for the time), and it all really happened. And then we were able to see the real "Star War," with all the action that happened on the inside.   A good, entertaining, interesting and worthwhile movie.

However, it's a nice film to watch, as the film takes place in the past, but the story is very clear and the acting is very good. The story itself is not a "good" one, and the film also doesn't have a clear ending, but it is still a good film to check out, as it has a "hidden" story that you can actually understand, and not just watch as an action film.

It has the feeling of being so old that it is real and it does not seem to be a movie you could make today.

So this is what I think of the movie. I loved it and hope they do another one.

The rest of the movie has me more or less saying "meh".   A story of the guy who was obsessed with a movie that he thought he'd seen years before, in his youth.   The movie follows him, his parents, and his step-father's involvement with the movie.  The ending really gives me a hard time with this movie. I felt like it really, REALLY sucked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen a better film about two guys getting together and playing a drinking game at a pub. The entire film was filmed with some great camera work that really shows off the characters in a good light. There were a few scenes I really missed, but there's a nice change of pace here in the final act to make this film a very entertaining watch. The characters were all likable and the acting was great. A bit short for my tastes, but I highly recommend this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of "Slingblade" is a classic, and it is well worth seeing. The cast is outstanding and the action scenes are excellent, even when the "bad guy" is clearly a bad guy. My only complaint is that the pacing is a little slow and I would have loved to have seen some of the different stunts that occur in the movie.   I had a great time watching this movie. It is a fantastic mix of martial arts, thrillers, and espionage, and will definitely get a grin out of me. The action scenes were incredible, even the few that are "bad guys" are always very well-done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film was okay. The action scenes were pretty good, but nothing like those in Rob Zombie's Night of the Living Dead. The special effects were great, but not worth the price tag.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie in the theatre with my grandmother. I didn't get much out of it and I just sat there, staring at the screen, thinking about how beautiful the movie looked and how long I had to watch this. A good time, though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Piggy" scene has to be one of the most memorable scenes in a movie.  The music, the lighting, the way that the director shot the actors and the characters, everything just worked.   This movie has so much fun and it doesn't take itself too seriously.  I'm a fan of the James Bond movies, and this movie is one of my favorite Bond movies.  They use some of the best music and the acting is spot on.  It is not easy to make a good James Bond movie, and they succeeded.  "The Spy Who Loved Me" may not be the best James Bond film, but it is the best of the Bond films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was younger, I had always wanted to play the game of rock, paper, scissors. Now that I'm an adult, I know it doesn't have to be that way.   With this movie, I see that not all kids are born into the same situation, and I feel sorry for kids who aren't ready to go through all of this pain.  It's a great movie, well told, and a must-see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was not very good but i saw it at the theatre and wanted to see it so i went home and i watched it on my computer. The film had some good story lines. It had a really good story about the american army fighting the vietnam war and what they think about it. It also had good performances. The best actor in the film was an actor called Richard Todd. Also there were some nice female roles for both the americans and the viets. The only problem was the music. This movie was very bad at the beginning and the music was really bad. The director had a great idea at the end with the music so it made it worth seeing it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most perfect sci fi flick i've seen in ages, and i've been watching a lot of sci fi.   When i saw that it was about a time-traveling astronaut, i was instantly sold.  It's a really good watch.  I've always wanted to see the movie and it's very well-made.  The story is really amazing and it makes me want to see more.  In a world where there's so much wrong with the world and the people there, a space-man is like a ray of sunshine, a light in the dark. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a simple premise: The world is being destroyed by an evil wizard, and only the Chosen Ones can stop him. As a kid, this one had me intrigued. But, in retrospect, it just didn't hold up. This film did not have a "magic" or a "greatness" that I remember from other "superhero" films. It did, however, feature two of the more interesting "magic users" of all time. I loved the idea of two characters, one white and the other black, who are so alike, they could be brothers. And I loved that it was actually a kid's movie.   It's great to see a classic movie back on the big screen.  If you like this kind of movie, this is the kind that you'll like.  It should be in every kid's library.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never thought I'd find a role in a movie so good!  He plays a cop who's trying to get away from a crooked cop who has been given the highest ranking position in the NYPD. The movie follows a story that is really hard to follow, but it is really interesting.  One thing that's worth noting, is that the movie is full of "what ifs" that can't be shown in the movie itself, but the director wanted to make a film about this and so he left those aspects in.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see an interesting film, and to just enjoy it!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this movie about 5 years ago. I never watched a movie that was so intense, as you felt this movie was about two guys who are constantly fighting for their lives.   This movie makes me think of "the man in black", and makes me hope that "the world" makes it as a big budget movie.  The movie was shot with a 35mm camera in one continuous take, and it was very hard to follow as there are so many people in the shots.  It was a very powerful movie. Â  If you want a very dark and intense movie, but you need a movie with a budget, then you need this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a classic, but one that never gets old. From its opening sequence to the last reel, it remains a classic that is very relevant to this day, and the acting is top notch. There is a reason why this movie is always the most requested.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was a very interesting look at life in a prison in the early sixties, with an incredibly likable, believable, and realistic character who you don't just hate, but you care for.   The plot line was simple, but the way it was constructed was well written and acted.  I wish they had kept the same director for the next movie.  This movie is an excellent piece of cinema. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â This is a great movie. I enjoyed it.    The main character is very charismatic and fun. She doesn't have to worry about getting into a car accident. She goes to see a movie, and they start having an argument about the movies. When she gets into the car, the guy's eyes get wide. She's about to hit him but her boyfriend (I believe it was Adam Sandler) stops her.  He tells her to keep going, and she does.  The best part is that he knows her car isn't worth the accident.  A great movie   I really enjoyed the car movie, but I didn't care about the whole argument at the end.  It was like a dream, and I want to have it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie for the first time in the movie theater and loved it.  I would have never seen this movie if I hadn't been at a preview in a local theatre.   It was very hard to believe that they could actually make a movie out of the story of a young girl who went crazy after she accidentally took an overdose of sleeping pills.  It didn't make a lot of sense, but the story, acting and the costumes all combined to make a really exciting movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie when it came out in 1972, and it has aged very well. As I remember it, the main character is a young boy named Will who is in search of his lost grandfather and comes across a strange man who claims to be an angel. As he grows closer to the man, he finds out that the man is a trickster. The film is very entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat, even though Will can't understand the man's riddles.    The music is very reminiscent of the music from the 1930's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think I've seen a better movie.   It has some great action sequences (and a good villain), and the effects and makeup are top notch.  You'll definitely want to see this movie when you're done watching Star Wars. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on VOD on DVD. The movie is about a young man who is sent to jail for murdering his parents. While in jail he develops a relationship with a woman named Elizabeth. Elizabeth is his only friend in the jail. He tries to kill himself by eating a candy bar in the cafeteria. He is visited by his father.   This is a very interesting story. It has a great cast of characters. I think the movie is well done and shows that the prison system is flawed. I am glad to see that this movie is being made into a movie again.  Molly Shannon stars as Lenny. She is the only female inmate at the state prison in Florida. She has a strong independent spirit and is not afraid to stand up to her abusive cell mate, George. Shannon is a great actress. She plays the role with a great sense of humor. She even gets some lines in the movie that I did not expect. Her character is very well written. There is not a lot of nudity and there are no gratuitous sex scenes. The women in this film are very well done. It is a fun movie that has a lot going for it. I loved it and can't wait to watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first part of the movie was quite good. Not the worst of the three, but it was good for the time. Not all that original, but certainly interesting and entertaining.   Â  However, that part of this movie was short lived, because the rest of the film was bad. There was a scene where a few young guys were having sex in the woods with a woman, and the guy who wasn't there to film (who later died of an overdose) did so in the most creepy way.  I can remember laughing at the stupidness of that scene at the time, but now, it just seems incredibly silly.  At least he didn't say "pantyhose" while doing it.  This movie is so bad, I just can't believe it exists. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie a few days after seeing "Klingon" at the BAM movie theater (where I saw two other movies last night... one I have yet to see, the other "Hanna-Barbera".) I had been looking for the movie since I heard of it on a newsgroup back in 1999 and I finally found it and it has a whole different feel to it. It starts out with a great opening sequence. We are introduced to three Klingons. One is an older guy with a bald head, he's playing with a bottle of wine. He's talking about how he needs to find a woman with whom he can "get out of his shell" and that's the only thing he's got. He gets an older woman who is beautiful and who can take care of his needs. Then he takes out a holo-screen with a couple of pictures of himself and then a woman he is dating and that one was from the "fifties". He shows the picture to the other two Klingons and they go "wow". The next one is in the "thirties" and this one is so perfect and seductive and seductively attractive, I was tempted to give it to her. But I was reminded of my own mother at the time, I mean... my mom was always on my case about my relationship with my girlfriend and I could just tell this woman wasn't like my mother. Then we get a guy who is in his forties or fifties, who is an expert at a Klingon language. He is not only skilled in the language but he also is very intelligent and it seems like he's talking to himself (like he can read minds of others and he is even trying to figure out what kind of person he is talking to). He shows us some of his tricks and I was so impressed. He was so charming and I liked how he was so smart and was able to get us to laugh out loud when he was kidding with his fellow Klingons (who are of course, a bunch of assholes). He also takes them on a journey to a secret base where he shows them some pictures of women and they seem to be interested. The movie then goes into the present day and they get a girl (who is definitely older) to try and seduce him. This seems to get on her nerves and she starts yelling at them to leave her alone and not to make her a fool. But he
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After a few minutes of being annoyed by all the stupid stuff going on with the characters and their families in that one scene, this movie had me hooked. The characters and the situations that they were in were interesting and believable. It wasn't a typical movie and it didn't have much in the way of a plot, but it was great entertainment. This movie reminded me of the "Fargo" movie, but with more heart.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and I was not disappointed. The director did a fantastic job of capturing the essence of what it is to be a real man in Vietnam. He really pulled of the authenticity of the story. I was in a real war zone in the streets of Saigon during this movie. It was great watching my brothers who were serving in the army and also watching all of the soldiers from the movie take out their frustrations on each other. I know it's not the same but it was a really cool experience.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is really funny. This is my favorite comedy and also my favorite John Belushi movie. The whole cast does a great job.   I've never seen this movie until now and it had been about 20 years.  I think the cast and the director should give the DVD out for free on youtube for everyone to watch because this movie is so good and funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just wanted to see a sequel to the movie and I am happy that I did. The film does not look the same but the characters are very close and the story was very good.    This was a good buy and would recommend for fans of the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen the "The Godfather Part II" several times over the years and I finally got to see this great remake of the movie and the people I went to see it with loved it. The film was very entertaining and entertaining people went all out to see the movie.    As far as the acting goes, the new director, Joseph Mazzello had the film nailed. The original film had a great cast with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, both great in their own right.  But all of them did a wonderful job in this movie. The actor's names are all well-known. There's Paul Sorvino, Vincent Kartheiser, and Al Pacone, all great actors.  It was a great movie and I wish more directors could be bold enough to make such a good film, let alone get the right people to do so. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just wanted to say that this movie is good! The only bad part is that the girl played by Ellen Burstyn got a lot of credit for being pretty and that was just plain unfair!   The character played by Meryl Streep was really strong! The acting was good.   Â    My favorite part of this movie was when Ellen burstyn (the girl in the car with the girl) looked at a photo and then looked at the guy in the photo and said, "I don't know about you but I'm very flattered."   She looked so cool and sexy when she said that!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie in theaters, in New York. It was late at night, and there was a group of us who were talking about it. I remember laughing about one of the guys saying, "that guy is making a mockery of himself". I am now a big fan of Kevin Smith (Dead Calm, Clerks, and Mallrats) and this is a good example of how he can make a good film and then go and make a bad one. However, if you are looking for a good comedy, this is not it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never heard of this film until a friend gave me a copy. It's one of those films that are so well done and made so well, that it's like a movie I never would have seen on tv.   The story follows a group of friends that all have problems and are trying to get over the others.  The acting is great and the way this movie was shot is great.  As the movie progresses the group of people just don't seem to get any better.  It's a very funny film and I always enjoy seeing these movies made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was amazing, I saw it at a midnight showing in a theatre with a full house and we all knew it was going to be great. When I saw the film it was as if I was in the audience at a film festival, it was very impressive and I loved every minute of it.  This was the only thing in my life I wanted to watch that night, I would recommend this movie to everyone, the sound, the characters, the acting, the story and the music were all great.  It was a movie that made me think about the importance of education and the importance to always stay in touch with the people around you.   You really do need to be a friend with somebody in order to be successful, if you don't know the people you are working with, you don the people will work against you and in your face and you will never be as successful as you could have been. Â  This movie is definitely worth the watch and it has a great message about working for the people who need you and not the people that are paying for your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is a little bit confusing at first but it quickly becomes obvious that we're dealing with the murder of a woman by a group of thugs (a common enough plot element in movies). It's clear that this is an extremely well made film with an amazing cinematography (it looks like a movie of another era) and a fantastic script.   "A Night on the Town" was one of the better films to come out of the 1930s and the one that most accurately captures the era. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had been waiting for this movie for some time and finally got it. This movie was great.   This movie is like a cross between "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" and "The Last Samurai".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember this movie very well. A lot of great action scenes, some of which are still great. I was a very young man in the late 70s. The movie I saw was called "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and it was one of the first I saw that had dinosaurs. That is when I learned to love dinosaurs. "Raider" was a huge box office hit and it is probably the most famous movie ever made. That being said, "Raid" is a very bad movie, with a bad director and bad acting. My first thought was that this movie was so bad that it was just to make a fortune. I still can't understand why the movie is considered a classic, even though it is so bad and no one cares about the movie. I just hope that "Raid 5" gets made and not just "Raid 1" because it was a lot better and more interesting.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great film. The music is great, and the acting is very good. I have seen a lot of movies and this one is a little different.   What really makes this movie unique is the fact that the lead actor is an actual woman who plays the part of a man.  In other words, the movie makes you feel like you are watching a movie where a woman has a crush on a man and wants to go with him.  The main character, Cindy, is a pretty girl who lives in California. She has a boyfriend named Frank, and she's very jealous of him because he loves his job. She gets mad about it, and then he tells her that he needs to be with another woman, Cindy. Cindy falls in love with the other woman and then wants to meet the guy. The only way she can get into Frank's apartment is if he gives her the key, so he does. It's a really nice scene. The movie is full of action, and you really feel like the man is the one being chased.  This movie is really funny, and it's not just because of the male lead.  Another good thing about this movie is that you never really know how the guy is going to get out of the situation. He tries to kill himself, but then he tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but the rope breaks and the guy survives.  I'm sure there are lots of men who would like to see this movie, but it won't be for them.  It's really sad to see a real-life man who has worked really hard to get where he is being ridiculed and humiliated for it.

I can't wait to see how they will portray this movie in the sequel and the movies coming out.

There is a lot of stuff going on in the movie that is not shown in the synopsis, which makes for a very interesting movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very exciting movie that has an excellent cast that gets to shine in this flick. The film is full of action and excitement, with the right amount of comedy as well. The story and characters are well developed and made to the point where it's very easy to connect with each of them. The characters that aren't good but just as funny and memorable are just as good as the rest. This flick could have been even better if the actor's didn't waste most of their time doing a lot of background fluff and not really having much to do. The special effects in this movie are pretty good, but not anything you should take away from the film.

So far in the new season, it's starting to pick up some steam with some great stuff, like the chemistry between Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.   The only reason it's not a 5 star is that the "Breaking Bad" logo is still on the screen at one point.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie. The only problem is that you cannot take it seriously. There is too much talk about the Vietnam War. You would think that the war would have been over years ago but of course it's not. The action is real. You can feel the pressure. You need to be there to feel it. The effects are incredible. The music is great and so is the direction and writing.   I recommend this movie. It's a real movie about a real person and a real place. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a true story of two kids. The story started on a cold January day in the mid 70's. I had been taking care of my father who had had multiple heart attacks. I was the only child who could handle him and I was very scared of him. He was really fragile and could get sick at any time. At the time he had just had an operation on his heart that was going to cause a lot of heart problems. He had a long history of heart disease. He also suffered from an auto immune disorder that made him very sick. It was not a pleasant time. I wanted to protect my brother and myself. I would talk to my parents if I felt the need to. At that time my parents were very protective of our privacy and the children were not allowed to go out in the town. They didn't want anyone to know where they were at that time. It had been raining hard and it was starting to get dark. It must have been around midnight. I believe it was sometime around 11:30pm when I went to my bedroom to do some chores around the house. My brother and I were in the bedroom on our knees trying to get into our dad's closet that was in the hallway. He couldn't open it, it was locked tight. Then I heard a loud knock on the door. I looked up to see my father standing in the doorway. He looked out the window to see who was at the door, I had never seen him with such a big grin. He turned around and his eyes widened as he realized what was happening. He opened the closet door and he walked into the closet and grabbed our sister and ran out the back of the house to my mom's room. I went out and told the other kids what had happened and we ran outside and tried to get our dad. We didn't find him until a little later. He lived alone on a very small farm in the back yard. He made me promise that I would never go back to the house and that I was never going to tell anyone about what had gone on. When my parents saw me running outside they started screaming at me and I started crying and they got into the truck. They drove away pretty fast and never looked back. We never saw my dad again and I never told anyone about it. We are now grown up and have grown up in a different town.

I knew of it, but didn't know much about it. I went into the mall, bought a couple of movies, and then walked out and I was so happy.   I will be going back to see it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was very good in my opinion. I felt that the story line of this movie was so good that it could be something that could be done in a film for young audiences. My biggest concern with this film was the lack of actors who were really able to portray a real life crime. I think it would be great if a few actors who are on the right side of the law were to have some fun in this movie. It did not get boring and I found myself enjoying it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not a big sci-fi fan, but I really loved this movie. The story was unique, and the special effects were great. The actors were great and you really felt the tension in the room. The characters were really well done and really believable, even the antagonists. I will definitely have to see the sequel!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really hoping to see a sequel or prequel to this classic film.  The original is so far ahead of it's time, it makes you question what exactly was the point of the whole thing.  Now a decade later, some film-lovers are still looking for a great sequel, but they should really be looking at the original, which has never been remade.   The acting was spot on, the music is fantastic, and the writing is so witty.  So long, and thanks for all the fish. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I have said before, I feel that the most important quality to a good film is the director. In my case, Martin Scorsese is definitely on my list. His movies never have a boring moment, but never are they overly dramatic or over the top. His films are always entertaining and have a sense of humor.   I really enjoyed this film. I did find it a bit over the edge, but I guess you get what you pay for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie and loved the lead.   The guy I worked for at the time was a huge action movie buff and he loved it and gave it a big thumbs up.  He was also a fan of all things horror and wanted me to read it and give it a thumbs up so he could get a copy.  It has that "classic" feel to it, like something you would see in a 1950s or 60s movie.  I also think the director and cinematographer for this film are fantastic.  When the action started I thought the effects were great and I knew this was going to be a real classic.  The sound and music were also really great as well.  What else could I ask for?    Overall I give this movie a big "Yes!"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an old classic, but very enjoyable as well.  This movie is one of my all time favorites, it is truly a master piece and a treat for the eyes. I have a copy of this movie and love it every time. It was one of those movies that you watch over and over again, it keeps your interest and keeps you thinking about what will happen in the next part.   What I love about this movie is that it really is like a western, with a Western twist.  There are no guns or knives in this movie, the men all carry guns, and some have knives, the fight is all real.

It shows a lot of characters and what they think of each other, how they try to solve their problems and why some of them fall in love. It's a really interesting movie to watch and watch characters that you never really get to know. It goes way beyond being a simple romantic comedy.   A real eye opener movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "This movie is about a kid who lives on a farm and wants to go to a movie. He has never been to a theater before and sees a movie at the local movie theater. I loved the movie. It was very good and had a good story. I think this is a good start for him. There is no story to follow here. The movie ended a bit slow. However, the movie really made me want to see more movies and see it. I recommend this movie to all children."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a wonderful reminder of why I love movies and why I watch them. I loved how each one of the characters is unique, so they really get to show off their personality.   The movie was fun, and I'm glad I saw it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not one to see movies for the story, I just love to laugh.   This movie is a comedy, but I enjoyed it very much.  The whole cast is amazing.  This is a great comedy and I recommend this movie to anyone who likes great comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you first watch this movie, I thought that it would be a pretty straight-forward vampire/thriller/fantasy movie with a lot of action, etc.  I thought it was going to be something really good.  But, after watching the trailer, it didn't look like a very good movie at all.  The movie started off okay.  Unfortunately, the movie lost its way and didn't go anywhere.  Some of the vampires were pretty good, but the acting was way too cheesy.  This movie has the potential to be great, but I can't see how it can ever live up to the hype.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this movie about a year ago from a local video store and was absolutely delighted. A few of the other movies at that time I enjoyed but I didn't even remember the name of this one until a friend of mine said he had seen it and was going to go out and see it. I wasn't in the mood for a horror movie (I didn't know what I was getting myself into at the time) but it was well made and was one of those rare things you get to enjoy for the sheer fun of it. It's a pretty cool movie that you might want to watch with your young children if you happen to be around.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A simple tale of a guy who finds a little girl abandoned, alone in a tree, and decides to get her back, while a woman watches on. The whole movie is just a little creepy, but it's all in a good way. It's a story that doesn't need to have anything else going on. It just makes you look at that abandoned little girl and be a little sad.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â  The movie starts off great with an amazing opening scene. Â Then as the movie progresses the plot twists really start to pile up and make me feel confused and a little scared.   After that it gets really interesting and fast paced.  I really enjoyed this movie and I feel like it could be a classic.  It has really interesting plot points and I love the idea of a young girl trying to find her lost sister.  The acting is great and they really get the chemistry right.  A great flick, I recommend it if you are a fan of the movies that David Lynch directed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very great film. It is not the typical thriller with a bunch of cool gadgets and superpowers, but it is a classic Hollywood action film that is filled with suspense, romance, and action. The plot is well thought out. I loved the action, and the relationship between the two leads is so interesting and well developed. The only flaw in the film is that the music is a bit repetitive and boring. It has been done so many times and I thought the music was really distracting and not necessary for this type of film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen the film twice, first in 1997, when it was playing at a film festival, and then again at an event about 10 years later. Both times I found myself wanting to watch it over again, especially after the first time, as the story is really something special. I have since seen it again, and again I find myself wanting more. I really love that it is based on a true story, and that all of the actors are good friends of the lead, and are always together. And I love that the filmmakers have captured the essence of that place, where the action is intense and action packed.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie stars David Carradine, and is based on a short story by Joseph Conrad, and was directed by Howard Hawks. The movie is funny, well acted, and an excellent movie for people who like good acting. I always like watching Carradines in films that are not action, and this is no exception.   This movie is very good for a good laugh. The film is really about a group of men who are all married, and they want to go back to a time when it was a male dominated world.  The whole film is a comedy. It really has a good story line that involves a guy who's not in love with his wife, but is secretly in love her, and a group that is trying to change the way men think.  This is a movie I always recommend for those who like a good comedy.

It was so cool because they used actual old films.   This is a fun, well made movie.  The ending of the movie was fantastic, I don't think there was one bad thing about the movie. It's the only one on this list that I've seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know if it's true, but one time on a plane I overheard a man on the other side of the plane talking about how he saw a horror movie and how he loved it. I remember thinking to myself, "Oh well, at least the plane has a seatbelt." When we landed, I was in my seat and looking around at the passengers, and suddenly I heard the back of my head hit something hard and felt the whole plane shift. I couldn't see what it was, but I knew something was wrong. A few seconds later, I started to get nervous and looked up and saw that the plane had moved up on the passenger side, and I heard something hitting my head. I thought it was the seat belt, but when I looked down and saw blood, I realized I'd been hit. I knew I was bleeding profusely. I looked around for a blanket or something to cover me, but all I could find were the seat belts and I knew my bleeding was going to get bad real fast. I realized that it was my blood that had caused the shift and it was probably going to stop soon anyway. I got up and tried to cover myself with the blanket, but it was too bloody to do it. Finally, my leg was covered enough and I could hold on to it and look for a way out. I found a window, which gave me a little bit of a view, and there was an exit on the opposite side of where the seatbelt had been. I tried to climb out as quickly as possible. The plane was moving too fast to jump out, but there was no way I was going back into that plane again. I saw a window to the right, which looked to be a little wider than my window, and jumped through it. When I landed on the ground, I felt a great pain in my right thigh, but after a few minutes, I could feel the pain in both legs. I lay there for about half an hour and then walked around a little to see if I could see anything, and sure enough, I saw the door of the airplane had been smashed through. I didn't know how I had managed to do that, but my legs seemed to be holding up. I was limping, but at least that helped keep my weight off my leg. Eventually I was able to stand up and walk around the airplane, but the blood kept coming. It's amazing how much blood comes out from a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In spite of the fact that there were very few characters in the film (one is the girl who's been kidnapped by the cops after she tries to kill the cop that's been after her for years), it was incredibly emotional and suspenseful. I also appreciated the movie's overall look and feel. The lighting was very realistic and detailed and the camera movement, especially when it came to the girl, was really well done.   I don't know if I would have enjoyed the movie if I hadn't heard the movie being mentioned on my old favorite movie, The Fugitive, which I used to listen to every chance I got when I was little.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The great thing about the film is how well it's shot," says Roger Ebert.  "It's a really fun film. There's something about the way it moves in the shadows that makes it so wonderful."  " It's a beautiful film.  This was the film that gave me the idea to make a short film," says filmmaker, David Prowse.   The film opens with a woman being thrown out of her car by a police officer who accuses her of shoplifting.  The police chase her down, and the chase gets wild.  While driving, the woman is hit by a stray bullet and she is left for dead.  As she recovers, she makes a plan to get the bullet out of the bullet hole in her head.  Then she takes off to find her son, who has been shot in the head. It's at this moment that the movie's humor and beauty take over.  Â  It doesn't matter what her plans may be, this woman, her car, her life, are all threatened by her husband's gang.  If you're looking for a good, funny, dramatic drama, look no further.  For the true lovers of dark and moody cinema, you just can't find a better one out there.  A must-see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My boyfriend has always wanted to see this movie for years, and now he finally got the chance to see it and it was awesome! I'm not sure how it happened, but he stumbled upon this when it was on TV and it took him by surprise. He thought it was some kind of kids movie until he actually saw it. He loved it! He even commented that it was the best part of the movie, because he was just looking for a good sci-fi movie. My boyfriend's favorite part of this movie is the "alien" that we see, but I still think it's pretty cool.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a must see for fans of horror.   The film was shot with black and white film and is one of the first movies ever shot in the style that you see in the trailer, the black and red color scheme is a great compliment to the rest of the film.  There are a number of creepy scenes in this movie with the killer and some of them are really quite great and creepy.  The movie has a great atmosphere and atmosphere alone is worth a watch.  I really enjoyed this movie and hope to see more like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of this movie. I think the first time I saw it, I thought it was a bit odd, because it had just a very slight twist in it. I'd never seen the first film, but the sequel really makes the first one feel a bit old. But it also adds some nice twists and turns. The acting is great. The cinematography is very good, and the songs were great. This movie should be on everyone's radar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I love to watch old western movies, especially ones with a more romantic bent, and we have enjoyed several of them. When we heard that "The Great Train Robbery" was going to be made, I was eager to see it, since we both know that I have a very strong feeling for this movie. It is well-written and the actors are excellent, and the setting is terrific.   The main characters are not unlikeable. In particular, I enjoyed the roles of the two brothers.  Â  They don't quite get along but they both seem to get through it. Â I particularly enjoyed their interaction as they discuss the robbery.  My own role was a minor one, but the direction of the film is wonderful, and I liked it so much that I almost forgot that I was supposed to be in it. Â  The two brothers, especially Jack, are believable.  It seems that Jack was not a man of great talent but was driven by an irresistible need for adventure, and it is interesting to see how much of the story he was willing to believe, even when he was lying.  In the end, he becomes the great robber.  While "The Big Gundown" (1938) is a good story, I find the story and direction of "The Train Robbers" much more convincing and more exciting.  About the only drawback in this movie is the very short time they give us to enjoy it. However, I will say that it was well worth it.

The movie is a really good film, but I'd prefer the trailer for some scenes of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story has all the elements you love: the mystery of the mysterious "Cthulhu" who will stop at nothing to take over the world, the good guys vs the bad guys, the old-fashioned monster movie style, and the great performances from all involved.   A fantastic film!   I was never a monster movie fan and never saw one until this one. This movie is a great homage to those old horror films from the 70's and 80's.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris the Tardigrade from The only movie I ever saw in Japan... Well, that's a relief. A friend in Tokyo was telling me about this movie, and I just had to see it. I was thrilled to see all of the movie's famous creature designs in one place. The "Lantern" that eats up the other creatures is a fantastic design that was really creepy, and creepy characters like the "Witch" made me smile.  Reviewed by William P. from A very good movie with a great creature design. The movie itself has a very good story with a nice twist. The film is a lot more than just an homage to old monster movies. It's very original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I heard about the film The Last Samurai, I knew it was going to be something I had to see. The story is simple - a young boy is sent to an isolated village in the woods to be trained to fight a band of Japanese warriors. I really enjoyed the way this was shot and the fact that you get a nice sense of the isolation the young boy was going through. The camera work and acting were really well done. I thought it was very well done that you got a great sense of who the characters were. The sound was also really good. It really gave the feeling that you were there.    This film is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A wonderful, romantic, and quite funny romantic comedy about a married couple who get divorced. One of the best movies I've seen, and I've been watching a lot of movies lately, especially about divorce. The characters were realistic and the dialogue was spot on. I loved that the movie also had music in it and the two actors were just great together.   I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has ever thought about getting divorced.  A must see, especially if you love a good romance and want to see the love story of the week. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie. If you like a good car chase movie then this movie is for you. The movie starts off with the main characters going to an insurance company to try and get the insurance on the car they're trying to buy. In a movie like this one there was no way I could follow what they were doing on their way to the insurance company. I couldn't keep up. But that's where the movie started to get good. As they are walking the car is stopped by someone and they have to pull out a gun and they get out the car and get ready to fight. I thought that was pretty cool. Then as they are getting ready to go there is a guy in the car yelling, "Watch this!" and then there is the car getting pulled over by police. I like when cops start getting in on a car chase and start making people pull out weapons. The car is followed by a police car and then a car that's following the car that they got stopped by. There is a whole lot of cars that get stopped in the end of the movie. I really liked the car chase. The cops are not the most dangerous looking guys but they are tough. They don't really want to kill the car people. They are trying to save people.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always been a bit leery about this film. My mom, who used to see it when she was a kid, told me that it was a 'bad, bad movie.'

But after watching it recently, I couldn't understand why. I couldn  I've always enjoyed Hitchcock's films. And I've seen most of them. They've always held a special place in my heart. I've been a fan for as long as I can remember. They seem to have a timeless quality to them. In this case, it's because of the story. The story is about a group of friends who decide to make a movie about themselves. The actors are pretty much all unknowns. And the acting is nothing to brag about. But it is very good. The plot is easy to follow and the actors do a wonderful job of making us forget that they aren't famous actors. It isn't exactly a 'great' movie by Hitchcock standards, but it is definitely one that deserves your attention.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was ok and well made but it was hard to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this movie, you have to admire the director for making the movie as a true black & white film. It shows the harsh reality of the streets of the ghetto, the people who suffer in the shadow of their success, that all are as equal as they are, that we are all human. That the devil is just as real as he is when he takes the soul of the street-smart street kid. I've seen this movie twice and my opinion has not changed. A wonderful example of how great a director can be, and a great film that will never get forgotten.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The most incredible film that I have seen so far in the summer.  I have watched most of the great European movies and I have never seen a movie that is so good and that can be so funny.  The actor is so beautiful and so convincing.  Also there is a very good movie about a great man that is an inspiration for many men, but we all know that there are some men who don't see it that way.    What makes it even more amazing is that the director is a great guy and so funny too.  He is a genius, just like his acting.  This is definitely one to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky enough to be able to see this on the big screen.   It was really good, and the ending was very well done.  I love horror movies, so I knew I was in for something scary and not all that different from the films I watched as a kid.  There is a great scene at the end, with a great cast.  Also, I like to think the film was made on the cheap, so all the extras could have been made for less.  If you like your films a bit more cheap, I suggest checking out this one!

We both felt like we were part of a great stunt team, as they did a few high dives and lots of flying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's good to have someone else make your movie.   That's what I thought when I heard they were going to make a film of this story.  As an original script writer, I thought it would be great to see an old style film about the true story of the American West and all the adventure and intrigue that went with it.  And they managed to capture everything that makes that time and place great.  The production is great, with many locations and characters from the time.  You can feel it was a real time and the actors who played the roles in that era were genuine.  If you haven't seen it yet, it is well worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "When people think of the first 'Star Trek' movie, they tend to think of Christopher Lloyd as Scotty. Well, there's a lot more to him than that."   The movie is set in a Federation space station. The two most prominent characters are Commander Spock, played by Leonard Nimoy, and Captain James T. Kirk, played again by Nimoy. Kirk is the science officer who is assigned as a temporary replacement for the deceased, and is given a very important mission. He is in orbit around Jupiter, where he is to survey a strange planet called Psi 2000. Spock is the senior officer on the station. While on the planet, Spock's ship is attacked by a Vulcan ship which apparently attacked the ship in the first episode. The attack seems to be a trap for Spock, who is forced to fight for his life. Eventually he is captured by the Vulcan and interrogated about his ship's mission. After being tortured he finally admits his ship attacked the Vulcan ship because the Vulcan would not give it information about the Klingons. He also tells Spock that he is not a Vulcan but an android. However, after escaping his captors, he is forced back into his quarters, where a Klingon is torturing him. This alien says that he knows what the Enterprise is, but it will kill him if he gives up the information. Finally, Spock breaks out of his quarters and is attacked again. The Klingon kills him by lashing his head with a baton and Spock jumps in after him and they both end up in the water. Spock has to swim for almost an hour until he comes across the Enterprise. Spock goes to the bridge to find out where Kirk is, and the Klingon is standing at the main viewscreen. He orders his ship to attack. He tells Spock to take over the ship and he takes control, ordering his crew to stop whatever they are doing. Spock follows orders to a T and uses the ship's weapons to destroy the Klingon ship. He then puts the ship into the red alert mode. Suddenly, a ship flies past them, which they think is a Klingon Bird-of-Prey. Spock realizes it is not, and he tries to communicate with the ship but he can't. After the Klingon leaves, they realize it is a Federation ship. Spock tells Kirk about the new weapons he is working on and they start searching for the new ship. They run into a Klingon ship and are attacked, but Kirk manages to fight off

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In all honesty I don't think I have ever been so much in love with a film as I was with "The Secret of NIMH". This was the first animated film I have seen that made me feel like I was really watching a film. A film that made you believe in the characters and made you feel a strong bond with them.   I was not expecting that from a film about a child with no legs and one missing limb.  "The Noddy Show" is the story of Noddy, his brother Noddy Jr., and their cousin Noddy Bee. A show that is so far down from the reality of the Noddy's home that it can only be described as a parody of life.  I would highly recommend "The Kid's Guide to the Movies" and " The Secret of the Unicorn ".   There is a real feel of sadness and sadness is felt throughout the film.  This film is a great one to watch if you want to watch something different.

You get to see the different characters interacting, the different sides of some of these characters, and they all have their good and bad sides. You never get tired of seeing these characters. The music in this is great, and you always get this feeling of danger and anticipation when the bad guys are about to attack. I feel like it's a really funny movie. The only thing is I wish there were more action. There's one fight in this film, and I felt that there wasn't enough of it. It just didn't make any sense to me.   This was my first time seeing this movie and I was really impressed with it. I got my hopes up when it was first announced and I had high hopes for it, but the movie ended up not being as good as I had hoped for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie because it had a good story, but it could have been better.   It is a very simple story and it could be made a lot better if it had more.  The best parts of the movie were in the first two minutes.  It was amazing that someone was so smart that he made a film about the most bizarre thing in the world.  I just saw it for the first time and I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most realistic portrayal of the experience of being a lesbian in the military, even though it doesn't really do a great job of portraying the whole story. It is also, in the best way, a story of the people who are in the closet.   There was a lot of fun and excitement in this movie. There are a couple of parts that made me laugh out loud, but it does not take long for you to realize how true this story is. It's a beautiful thing.  I wish that a movie like this had been made when I was younger.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of fun. I recommend that you watch this film before the first part of the first movie because there is a lot of story in this movie, and the story never really ends for too long.  Â This movie has some pretty good acting and acting is one of my favorite parts of the film.  It would be great to see this movie on a big screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am glad I saw this. I don't know why this movie got a lot of praise, because it is not only really bad, but it's also completely unrealistic. I'm not sure how much of that is the director, and how much is the actor, because no matter how well the actor can act, the performance just never feels real.   This movie is so fake, that if I had seen the movie with real actors playing real roles, it would have been hard to tell who was in fact talking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film isn't very good, but it's not bad. The acting is top notch, the story is interesting, and the music is nice. It's the last thing you'll want to see, but the ending is very surprising.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the most faithful adaptation of a comic book that I have ever seen and I feel this is what many of the other films of the time tried to do.   The art style is fantastic and the story was pretty much the exact opposite of the original and there was plenty of action to keep you interested.  There are some great performances here and you can watch this film again and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this film because it has an extremely well written script and a very realistic and well performed performance from Bruce Willis. I thought it was well done and very well-acted. I didn't even realize how good he was until the end of the film. My favorite actor in the film, Willis did an amazing job.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a masterpiece. This is one of the very few "gods" films that I have ever seen. If you don't know who the people in this film are, don't worry. They were really quite amazing. It is an amazing movie and one of my favorites from a really long time. It really shows what a good film can be without being overblown or stupid, or making no sense at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been watching these "cubbies" for many years. I was never a fan of them at all but these years, they have changed a bit and I appreciate them now. I am sure I'm not alone in this. I found myself very satisfied with their performance. The movie is a wonderful story of romance, heartbreak and friendship. The performances are superb. The acting in this movie is truly top notch. This movie, to me, is a must see. I recommend this movie to everyone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know the name of the movie when I saw the trailer for it. But after seeing it, I knew it was the one. The trailer made me think of Star Wars or Star Trek.   As soon as I saw it, my heart was racing. The way the director, Christopher Nolan, made me feel like I was there was amazing. I felt like I needed to see it.  The first time I saw this, I didnÂ´t think the movie was going to work. I watched it over and over to make sure I liked it. I didnÂ¿t! It wasn't until the very end when I just couldnÂ´t take it anymore and sat in the theater to watch it over again. It took that one experience and I have seen this movie over a 100 times now.  When I saw my friends it was a blur. I thought they were going crazy because I had seen the movie over and again. And they were right. I love this movie so much! It is one of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just saw this movie and it's my favorite! It's so good. There is a lot of sex and a lot going on. It's just awesome. I love the story and the actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a good one and I'm glad it's being released on VOD now. It has a well made story that is well told, but the film is slow paced and takes time to build. The film is worth watching if you like the kind of film that doesn't need to be "gated" behind a story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It really does look like the early movies. And it is a funny movie, but it was really interesting and fun to watch. It's really hard to understand some of the conversations in this movie.   I loved it. It was like seeing these old Hollywood movies in a really low budget way. And at the same time, it was a fun movie. I didn't think it was boring at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For this to be a full movie, it would have to have more action. They had to give us that...but for the most part, it was good. Good stuff.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a good picture, and I liked it.  I saw it on a television at my grandma's house, and had a real good time watching it with her.  And as I said before, it was on a Saturday night and it was a good time!  It was a nice change of pace from all the crazy crap we were watching the next day.  There were some good characters in it. I really liked how everyone was always having a laugh about the situation.   I don't care if they didn't realize it was me, I think it was cool that everyone would have fun.  The plot didn't really interest me.  It just didn't get any better, and that was the best part.  Even though the ending was lame, I liked how it was done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this to be a great movie and a good time.   If you like bad movies or if you like horror movies, then this is a good watch.  The only problem is that you can't tell when the movie is in a horror movie or if it's just a movie with a story.  This movie is a little too slow.  Also, the ending is kind of a let down.  But overall, I thought it was a good good time and if you have a horror or an old school movie on your brain, then check this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie, and a great time.   I enjoyed it very much, but it was too much for my small budget.  This movie is not very long, and there is no action in the movie. It was really fun.  A good job with the music and sound effects.  The only one who is good is a little girl with a long red ponytail. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been a big fan of the Harry Potter movies and this is another great one. The movie starts out a bit slow as we see Hagrid and Harry looking through some of the old papers from Hogwarts. However, we soon realize this is only going to get worse, and by the end of the movie Harry is even more depressed. However this movie is very well made and well done. Harry is great in this movie, he has all the makings to become a great character and his actions throughout the movie really show how much he has changed over the years.   Another thing I love about this movie are the great songs! Some of the lyrics are fantastic and it's great to see more songs from the Harry potter movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is just beautiful. From the beautiful shots of the ocean and the moonlight to the beautiful background music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is my second movie of the series (the first one was excellent and it is still good in my opinion). It was really a fun movie with the best moments of the first one. This movie was just as good as the first and it does have the same feeling and the same jokes.   My favorite character was the doctor (played by Steve Coogan). He was so nice and funny and he seemed so real. I loved the doctor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been watching this movie over and over again, I must say it is the best movie ever made, and I have never seen anything better in my life.   There is not a moment when you get bored, and there is not even a time when you feel like going home.  As you can imagine, this movie takes you all the way up into the clouds, and the whole time you never get tired of it.  The acting is amazing, it is so good that you can tell it is done by real people.  After watching this, I have started to see the effects of what people do to their bodies and minds, and they are not easy to put down.  I love the music, and it takes you away to the movies.  It has made me a fan of the movies, and now I hope this movie will make someone else as well.  This is the kind of movie you can watch in your dorm room, in the back of your car, or any other place where you are not allowed to have a cell phone.  You can sit in front of it, and listen to the music on it, while you are driving, and in the middle of the day.  If you want to watch a good science fiction movie, this is it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this movie we get to know the characters well and it is a very good role for Michael Pitt. The movie is well-paced and we get a lot of jokes in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so glad I took this class with the instructor and watched all the lectures. This course is great for the beginning of your film-making career. The professor has a very well developed passion and love for filmmaking and takes his craft very seriously. He does a great job of showing you the basics and then goes on to break down the finer details of filmmaking. I am definitely going to take more classes from him in the future. I was able to really make a lot of changes to my scripts with this class.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was never a big fan of horror films and usually only found them for cheap TV specials. I was pleasantly surprised to find this one. I can only remember the first few minutes of the film. It had a very eerie and frightening feel. I could barely watch it. The sound design is great and the special effects and camera work in the beginning really sets the tone for the movie. The acting is good but I don't know why the guy in the movie didn't get his own movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a young film-goer, I really didn't understand the fascination of Alfred Hitchcock's film, or the enduring popularity of its ending. I can't say I've seen it, but from what I've heard, I'm sure that Hitchcock was a master of cinematic storytelling, and his films often have an intriguing and captivating atmosphere. This film is no different, and has enough suspense and excitement to keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie is a true classic, and an amazing ending to the best Hitchcock film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film at a movie theatre in the Southside of Chicago. The theater was packed with people and I was not surprised. I am not a movie buff by any means, but this is one of my top 5 favorite films of all time. The film, directed by Mel Brooks and written by Alan Zweibel, is a fantastic comedy that perfectly balances serious moments with hilarious ones. My wife and I went to see it together because it was the only movie that we had seen the entire night.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a wonderful film. I love that it took a real and true event in history and made it a movie. My favorite part of the movie is when it takes place at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in New York. It was a real event and this film puts it on the big screen. I had no idea what was going on and I was so fascinated. I also loved the fact that it was not just a movie but it was a very important event. I was born in the same hospital and it really brought us all closer. I wish more people saw this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie on a recent trip to Hollywood. The movie is well worth seeing for it's good acting, excellent cinematography and sound effects.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching a movie that I saw for the first time the other day, I thought, "Well, that's all I really want to do" for a while. Then I started reading the Wikipedia page, and it all came back to me.   It was a very good movie.  It's a classic tale of friendship and sacrifice, and there are a lot of things to enjoy in it.  For me, it's one of those movies that has to be seen and heard.  The acting is great.  I enjoyed the music as well.  There were a lot more funny lines in the movie, and a couple of really good scenes as well, but for the most part, it all comes back to the friendship between Tom and Tom, and how they grow and change.  "I don't know what I was thinking! I don't even remember it!"   I'm glad that it was made into a movie. I think it's well worth the time.

"I have not watched the movie since I saw it in college, but I have kept the video on my video tape collection and will always think of it, I had some friends who were in the army that were stationed at Fort Hood when the movie was shown there, and it helped us to relate to these soldiers who had been there when the war ended, and I am certain it would have helped them see it."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You can't stop it," she says. "It's going to kill us all, sooner or later." - from AFI A fantastic film by a truly excellent filmmaker.   This is what you call a story that gets under the skin.  It leaves you with the idea that the way in which we do things in life can really affect our lives, even when the person who is being impacted is not aware of it.  The film really gets its message across.  And what a movie, with great performances and great stories, with a real eye for detail.  A great flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when it was released in 1994, and while it isn't as good as the first one, it is still a good time and should be seen.   This was one of those movies that you had to see again to believe.  It was a good mix of science fiction and horror, and a good cast of characters.  I've seen a few of these films, but never one so good.  While I like the "Buck" character, I really liked the "Frisco" character too.  The makeup and special effects are outstanding, especially the "gore", and the music is great, especially when it's used in the background.  This is one of the funniest and most enjoyable movies I've ever seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love a good adventure. This film has all the qualities of a good film. It has all of the action, the fun, and some of the humor you might expect from a movie with the title "Captain Hook." This movie gives us a unique look into a little known pirate story and offers a unique character.    For someone who loves pirates this movie has a good balance of the good and the bad.  The acting and the effects are very good.  Peter Jackson, Jr. is very good as the Captain Hook.  While the movie is about pirates it does give us an idea of the history of the pirates. The movie does not focus on the pirates but rather how the story of Captain Hook and his pirates relates to today's world. Â   I highly recommend watching this movie if you like pirates or are a little rusty on the history. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so impressed with this movie and the actors. I have to tell you that after reading the synopsis I was a little skeptical, but it was all true.

There are a few mistakes that need to be fixed, but overall, it is a very good film.    I really enjoyed this film. It is definitely worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. It doesn't have the sexiness of "Carnal Knowledge" but it has a more subtle, more adult approach that still has lots of funny moments. It may not appeal to everyone, but it's a good way to get your sexual satisfaction.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so impressed by this movie. It is the best science fiction movie of the 1970's, which isn't saying much considering that there was so many other very good ones. The visual effects in this movie were amazing, and I especially loved the creatures. The script was perfect for this story, and it was also made into a terrific movie. The best aspect about this movie is the special effects. They made the creatures look REAL!   My only complaint is that there wasn't a sequel made.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie three times, and each time I've been totally blown away by the production. You are never allowed to take your eyes off of the camera while it is filming. It really is one of those rare instances where you're not sure how much you should laugh or cry at any given moment. The acting is superb. We are constantly on the edge of our seats as we watch the cast play characters that are so totally over the top, it's almost as if they're trying to break through a barrier between their real lives and the ones we see on the screen. I've never seen such an over-the-top movie.   The plot is not a very complex one, but it does a great job of keeping the audience guessing.  The acting at times is pretty cheesy, but that is not the point.  Some of the other actors like Bill Paxton are so good at playing their characters that you actually start to like them.  It also has a great soundtrack that really sets the mood in this movie. There are a few moments in the movie that just stick in my head, like a random shot of a girl looking at herself in a mirror in the car or the way the audience reacts to the fact that the actors are always changing their lines.  So yes, it is really that good.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh or two and a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite films of all time. The great film is set in a small town on the Mexican border. It's about a father and his two young daughters. Their father has been kidnapped and the daughters are on their own. They go to Mexico to try to find their father but it takes them a while to figure out what happened to him. The film is about finding love and it's very touching. It was also an excellent love story. A great love story in which a father's love for his daughters is the real star.   This film is a very unique film. Not only are there a great group of actors, but there are also a lot of people and it seems like each person is telling their story in their own way.  It's the film that got me interested in Mexico and the people.  A movie to watch with a group of friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "This movie is a great representation of the life and times of a certain gangster boss. His personality is very intense and he always seems to be fighting against some sort of evil force, however it is never revealed.   It is a very realistic portrayal of the American Mafia and the life of mobsters. This movie was so realistic and well done that the audience will never get bored or get angry at the villains. It is very interesting to see how some of the characters got their start and some of them lived into their 70s. This is also a movie I recommend to all those people who have been to the mafia movies.  The soundtrack is great and I believe it is one of the best films ever made." -- "This is one amazing movie."

It's a good old fashioned thriller.   This is a great movie. I love the mystery, the characters, and the humor. The plot is very well thought out. The characters are great, and it takes you into the mystery. It is such an old movie, you could see it the day it was released.  A great movie, definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of the classic noir style. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the movie the other night in a 7pm theater. It was a good start. The dialogue was funny, but not corny. The acting was good, but the director left too many things out. The whole movie is not very exciting, and I don't get the feeling that it was really shot in New York. I guess we didn't need to see a lot of it. The best thing about it is the actors. The young actors were great. They all have a certain charisma. There are only two or three scenes in the movie that were not very good. I never felt that the director could put the film together as well as he could have. He has a lot to live up to.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a very old man who is dying. He is dying of a fatal cancer, but he is still in good health and is very fond of his wife and his cat, but the cat has a very annoying and annoying tendency to eat everything he touches and everything in the house. The doctor comes by to see the old man and says he has a fever and needs to be moved to another house. A little later, the doctor is found dead of a gunshot wound and his body is found with three different bullet holes in the head. The cat has disappeared and he does not know who did it or why. The man wants to know what happened, and that's where the movie gets interesting. The old man goes on with his life as usual, but there is something bothering him. He believes he was poisoned and someone is out to get him. The doctors say they have tested the old person and they have not found anything, and they don't think the old guy is suffering from a terminal illness. The thing that gets the old people angry is when the doctors tell them that the old folks house is a few blocks away and if the old lady was to pass away that night, it could be another body on the way. When the old woman passes away, there is a strange noise, and then a woman gets up and says, "that's not right". The old woman is actually a witch who has used her powers on this poor old man to kill him and send him back to the land of the dead. The woman uses the old dead man as a vessel to release the evil that's been trapped in her body. What really gets the woman's attention is when she sees a figure in the darkness in the corner of the room. The figure is not human, but a beast. The monster will hunt down anyone who goes into the old house, but even if the people leave, the monster will continue to follow them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you ever felt bad for watching your favourite movie and had to watch it again, this movie is the one for you! It is one of the few movies that does not take itself too seriously but it also does not rely too much on the effects and is pretty funny at times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I love to watch old westerns. We love the Western movies as a whole. In the 1960's we were all in love with the Western films, so of course we had to see the old films. I was very excited to see this movie as I never saw it. I thought it was very well made and well acted. I had a great time watching this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Cannibal Holocaust" is a really really good movie. It's pretty much a must watch for anybody who loves horror movies and likes blood. This is a pretty good film, even if the acting is a bit dated. In terms of blood gushing out of the body, this movie is pretty much perfect.   The movie has a great mix of humor and tension. The film is pretty long and not for the weak of heart.  "Beverly Hills Cop" has a lot of blood, but a different mix of blood and gore. This movie does not disappoint.  The story and the acting are good.  I think it's pretty good that the movie is about a couple of guys who go in to a house to "recover" a girl, that they have been seeing.  This movie was not on my radar until I saw the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film has a great cast and excellent direction. What the movie lacked in story was more than made up for in the acting and good acting by some of the best young actors that are now on the rise.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not disappointed in this movie at all. There were so many wonderful scenes in this film, that I just sat back and relaxed while watching it.   This is one of those movies where you are constantly on the edge of your seat for the whole movie.  This movie had so many great lines that I was constantly thinking about. The acting in this is excellent. The movie never felt forced, and it never felt cheesy. Â The acting in every scene in this were spot on.  The whole film is so good.  I enjoyed it so much, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good science fiction film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is pretty good. The script is fun.  The action scenes are great.

The costumes are very well done and the makeup and special effects are very high quality. And most important... The film doesn't waste time, it never wastes a shot. It shows us life on the farm in all its glory. The action scenes are intense and beautiful. And the last third is fantastic. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves good movies. The film has everything you could want from a good Western.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not a big fan of horror movies, but this movie was well made, a lot of thought went into it, and it had a very unique feel.  It's an amazing movie to watch, and really shows off what made Lynch such an interesting filmmaker.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very good.  It takes a few steps away from the usual zombie movie.  The script is good, but the acting is very amateurish.  This is a good zombie movie that shows a few good things and a lot of bad ones.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As it is, a very pleasant experience. I have seen a lot of movies with the same theme - aliens, wars, etc. - but not so many where one can see what is really behind these events. So it was nice to see a simple film with lots of human drama.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this one and it's actually a pretty good movie, but if you want to be serious with this movie I suggest you stay away. It's about a scientist who's trying to discover why the human race is dying off and he's teamed up with a madman, a psychopath. It is not a good horror movie but it does have a good plot to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is not a typical Hollywood thriller. The whole movie is a slow burner. It doesn't get going for 5-10 minutes then you're in to something else.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie and was amazed at how true to the actual story it was. The way it was portrayed in this movie was amazing. It made me realize that there are some movies out there that are not made for adults. I also loved the fact that they gave some thought to the storyline. It really made the movie more believable and I am thankful that they thought of some stuff to make it real.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As an adult, I'm not quite sure how it's possible to enjoy "The Silence of the Lambs," but even I can admit that it is a good film. It's definitely an emotional one, so I don't really have much to say about it, other than that I thought it was pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When the story of the movie "Kramer vs Kramer" was not good, I thought it was the weakest of the series. A poor attempt of a film with a mediocre story. The actors were not good and there was no action or excitement. But "KÃ¼mmler" was a good comedy with good actors who were trying to make a good film. The film is not bad and I think this one deserves a second viewing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the spirit of the classic movie, The Shining is a chilling, beautiful, and terrifying film. It is filled with suspense and suspenseful moments that will stay with you long after watching. I wish to thank the director of the movie for the creative ideas in creating such an excellent film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie that launched me into acting was "The Graduate". I was not going to play it but I did get a chance to be in it in my own small way. I really enjoyed it. My wife actually told me how much she enjoyed it too. We talked about it when we went home to watch it again.    I didn't get my chance to act in a big picture movie in the 80's.  It wasn't until "Fatal Attraction" that I really got a chance and that was a pretty big deal for me.  I played a doctor at a mental hospital who comes out of his coma, is very handsome and successful, but he is a bad person.  He is very self righteous and doesn't care for others but has a beautiful wife who is beautiful and loves him dearly. They spend their time together on the beach, eating food, and having sex.  The acting was amazing. It was one of my first roles and I loved it. I love that they didn't take me for a wimp. They gave me a chance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most satisfying way to enjoy a classic film.Â  I was in the theater when it was originally released and it's still as good as the day I saw it.Â  Not that it hasn't aged a lot, but it still holds up as a classic.Â  The director, Sidney Lumet, was a very underrated filmmaker.Â  He worked in the silent era and this was his first film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a strange way, I think that this movie makes perfect sense for this series. The series really did have its best moments in "A Piece of the Puzzle" (season two, episode twelve) and "The Moth" (the penultimate episode of the last season, the first episode of season three). And even though I love this show, "Battleship" is the last episode of these two, and is a perfect ending to the series. And the way it is told really fits with the tone of this series and the tone it set with this episode.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has great potential as a great science fiction movie. The story is great, and it is great how the cast is involved in the production of the film, which is a must in this film.   While the movie does get a little confusing at times, it is not confusing enough to detract from the overall film, and while it does have a few moments that will leave you scratching your head, it does a great job of balancing the good with the bad, and keeping it in the realm of science fiction.  The acting is very good as well, especially the cast members.  This is the kind of movie that can really grab you by the scruff of your neck and hold you there for the entire movie.  A must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did a bit of homework before I went to see this movie, so when I walked into the theater I was prepared. After a quick preview, I was immediately hooked. It's easy to tell that director Michael Apted is a seasoned director who knows his craft and is not afraid to experiment. He takes the audience on a whirlwind of action and thrills. The action scenes are epic and entertaining. The story is very intriguing and the mystery that the characters, as well as the audience, are given, is captivating. It is a very well-done thriller and well worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people think that this is a very bad movie and this is just one of those.   The plot is lame.  The special effects are pretty lame. The acting is terrible.  None of the characters are likable.  If you are looking for a movie that will have your attention but be boring then go watch a bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie, a lot like "The Birds", in that it takes place in a small town, and is very very much about what we are all experiencing every day. It is not a message movie. I don't know that there are many more than one that would be. But it is an excellent movie, and I have watched it several times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought the movie was good. I thought it was well made. I loved the cast. I didn't find myself confused as to why the characters were in different places.   They do a good job of showing how different people act in different circumstances. It shows you their different personalities and also the reactions they are likely to have in different types of situations.  I found the movie interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie on many occasions and each time the cast is terrific. It is about a man and his beautiful, young wife who come together after they fall in love.   The chemistry is excellent and the direction by Michael Ritchie is top notch.  I would watch this over and over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been waiting for this one, but finally got to see it. I'm glad they got it right. If they had made it a more realistic story, I would have hated it. But it's not like I was expecting some kind of "Saving Private Ryan" movie. I think it's a little more "The Bridge on the River Kwai" than "Spartacus". But I guess that's what happens when you have a great director. And this is a must see movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie as it was just coming out of the cinema, and while it's not my favourite film, I really like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is my favorite one from the 80's and still it is in my top 3 of the 90's.   I really liked this movie and I believe that it was one of the best ones from the movie serie.  The plot is very simple and the movie has the right amount of action and sex.  It was a great movie and if you like this sort of movie then it is worth checking out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a great movie and I loved it!   I was so happy when I realized I found a movie I've never seen on DVD.   The production was great and the actors were great.  The movie was a little hard to watch at first, but then you realize how much fun it is.  I had fun playing with the toys, and I really wanted them to come to life.  They really did.  In my opinion, this was a very realistic and interesting story about the toy man.  When you go to see this movie, make sure to have a friend with you or a camera.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is excellent, a great combination of comedy and adventure. The dialogue is good and the action is great.   There is a strong "anti-war" aspect. It is a satire of the post-WWII era. In a world where all those problems were fixed, we are shown how the Cold War was lost and how it may still happen.  The film doesn't have a lot of suspense, but it is interesting and entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not like it at all. It was slow and very boring. I thought the plot was weak and I did a lot of searching to find out why the guy killed his wife. The wife was only in one scene but she was not that interesting to me. The only good thing is the girl with the bad back!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you love horror, and you don't mind some gore and the gore that goes on in this film, this is a fantastic movie.   I love the film, and I enjoy the gore as well.  I have seen a few of these from the 70s, and they were all good, but this one is right up there.  This is my first ever watch of the movie, and to me it really gets the heart racing.  The action is really cool, and the pacing is perfect.  From the trailer, you will notice a few scenes which may make you cringe.  They really put the viewer to sleep when you have the camera on a young girl, and when she gets a bloody nose.  But for a movie with a similar tone, this one doesn't really seem to have any effect on me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the movie "Taken", you might like this.   This was a movie I was thinking of watching at first, but since I'm not that good at watching stuff, I didn't want to watch it.  The plot was great.  They didn't have to spend too much time on it. So when the credits rolled, I was so excited to see where it was all going.  It's a story that is so well told and so well paced.  All of the characters were believable and the story really went where it needed to go.  This movie had great music and the acting was great in this movie.  What I didn''t like about this movie is that they didn''nt really explain too much of what was going on. I guess that was just the way it was.  Overall, this movie was very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film has a great plot which is set at a ski resort, there is lots of snow, but it's not boring and it has lots of action which I love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only one of the three films that I saw in the 1980s, "Titanic" is a very funny and entertaining little movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The characters are real.Â  From the first scene, you can tell that they really are going places. I found myself wanting to get to know them. They are real people with real problems, who will likely have trouble adjusting to their new life, and the fact that they are not from that area gives me hope that they will be a little more open-minded and accepting in a matter of a few years.   One of the most compelling and entertaining aspects of the film is that, not only do the characters find success, but their wives do too. I have to admit, I felt like I was right there with them in their new city.  I also loved the scenes where the couple visits other people in the city. This gave me a chance to see people from other cultures and backgrounds, and it was so fascinating.  There is an excellent cast. Â Â (The movie is rated PG-13.  If you do not like graphic sex, violence, and nudity, you may not be interested in this movie)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie twice. I have never seen anything with an Asian lead before and to me this is just a very good movie. The movie takes us on a tour of Asian towns in China in the 1950s. It is about a group of soldiers who come to China to help the war with Russia and take advantage of the situation. Their mission is to find a missing girl and to find out what really happened to the boy who was seen on a TV show and never returned. It starts out slow and the movie is very suspenseful. But when it gets going you are on the edge of your seat. I was very impressed with this movie and will be watching it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always loved this movie, even if I was only 10 years old.  It's a funny little movie with a great little twist and it does a great job with that.  I'm not sure how much it really stays on your mind after it's over, but you will remember the scene where the "puppet" (me) shows up on the roof of a building.   It was the best twist I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The picture of a man in an apartment looking at his wife with a cigar in one hand and a book in the other was just perfect for the setting. And the movie gave you the right idea that it was a movie that you shouldn't watch in the house where you lived when you were married.   It was a good film to watch after a long day, when it made you reflect on your life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed the story and the acting. The movie was a lot like a sci-fi thriller. I guess you would think the movie would have a lot of action, but you would be wrong. There is plenty of humor, but not in a bad way. I thought it was great to see this movie with an old couple. I like this movie more than many other old school movies. I think it will have a long life as one of the first sci-fis.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, and in a movie full of great movie performances, I was most impressed by this one.   If you like the story of "The Godfather" with the twist ending, this one is worth watching.  There is no doubt in my mind that this film is a great movie and a worthy contender for best movie of the year.  John Schneider (played by Richard Gere) is so good that it is hard to believe he is in this movie.  His performance has the energy of someone who is really happy to be there and being on a real movie set with some very special actors.  Richard Giamatti is great as Frank Costello, and he gives a very great performance that makes you want to see him again and again.  Paul Newman is great in the role of James Costello and he delivers some terrific lines that were the movie's best.  The scene where George Raft sings the song "Tutti Frutti" in the movie is one of the best scenes in a great film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you are looking for a good science fiction movie with a twist, this is it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a solid action movie that has plenty of thrills.    As someone who enjoys a good chase scene, this is just about the only one worth seeing.  From the opening moments you know you're in for a good one, as the characters are introduced with an amazing fight sequence. The film has a good mix of both action and comedy, with some pretty clever editing throughout.  For a movie where most of the heroes get killed off at the end, it makes sense that they were all so expendable.

The movie shows that people can take part in a lot of different things in life if they know how to look for them and be careful not to get taken advantage of.    The characters are interesting but at the same time you don't know how they'll change later. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've only seen the trailer for this film, but from what I understand it's about a woman named Carol who was raped as a child, and then was kept in the closet, and now it's the 80's and she gets a little money from the government so she decides to run away and move to a small town in the mountains. But the town turns out to be hell on earth because everyone in there has a grudge against her because she was the only one who spoke up about the guy who raped her as a kid, and she was beaten up a few times because she wasn't able to shut up about it, and when she tries to run off again, she's arrested and jailed. Her first night in jail she meets some friends, and decides to stay with them until the police find out who raped Carol as a little kid, which is pretty soon, because the next day the police track her down, and they arrest her again and put her in prison for another week. Finally, the government decides to give her $20,000 to go back to college, so she goes back to school and finishes her degree, then works in the field as a veterinarian. The film was really good and I really liked it. There was also a woman in the film named Kathy who also had a grudges against the man who raped the little girl as a girl, so that part of the movie I liked, too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is my favorite movie and i just love it   Its an interesting story about a kid who got brain cancer and when he found out he has a 10 month long time left in his life he decides to make his last stand against the cancer.  I love it because of how good the actors are at the roles.  They have a chemistry in this movie that is unbelievable.  It is a short movie so i recommend everyone to watch it if you like movies and have a bad day   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really love these films. I've seen them so many times that I can remember the exact words they were saying just by listening to the soundtrack. These films are so funny.   A lot of the films are set in the '50s, and they have an authenticity that reminds me of when I was just a little girl and watched the classic Warner Brothers cartoons. The '50's is such an awesome era, so the comedy is hilarious.  The special effects are so much better in later films, because by that time they were already starting to take over the industry.  Also, the first time I saw this, I was only six. And the film still feels like it's just getting started.  (source: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066891/) 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a good way to finish up my year of college.   I really enjoyed this movie, and it reminded me of the fun college used to be.  This is a great movie for kids who want a good laugh and the story of a little girl who saves a dog from an apartment building is funny.  I got chills and a smile when a bad guy came out of a sewer and took the dog.  The soundtrack is great.  Overall a good time and fun flick.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never seen this movie so I don't really have a good opinion about it, but this is a really good movie, so bad reviews really don't matter. It's a comedy about a guy that gets a job as a movie reviewer, and a day or two after his first review, he gets fired from his job as well.   And then he is working in an empty theatre as a stripper to make ends meet until his brother convinces him to go back to school for one more semester so he can study film making.  The director is one of my favorite directors and has directed a lot of good movies, but his directing style is very different from the other directors and this movie is about as different as you can get.  And it's a really funny movie.  This movie has more laughs than tears, but you will definitely laugh.  There are some really bad parts in this movie, but it's definitely worth watching, especially if you've seen other bad movies like this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie when I was a kid, and I always enjoyed it. I would love to see a remake of this film, as I really think it would be awesome.   The first thing I noticed about this film was how much it had changed since the original, from the fact that it was filmed all in one take to having a very different sound.  It has a very realistic sound and feel, and the characters are very distinct.  I love how the original film was a classic, and a lot of people who love this movie probably grew up watching it because it was in theaters all the time.  For my personal tastes, it is a bit more realistic than the remake, which gives it more realism for me.  One of the biggest differences between the original and the remake is the music. The original movie is very moody, and it has a really good soundtrack that has a nice melody to it.  There was no song that I could remember off the top of my head, but the soundtrack of the remake I felt more subdued, and more like the music in a movie, so I don't really remember it. The movie is a classic that is well worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed watching the movie, and the movie had a very interesting setting. I didn't find it overly funny, but it was very entertaining.   The special effects were very good.  The characters were well played, and I liked the idea of what could happen if they tried to cross paths.  I liked that it was a sequel to an old movie that wasn't really well known.  There is some good action in the film.  This is a film that is worth checking out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is my first time watching a movie in English. I had been to Japan and seen the film by the director (Takashi Miike), and I had the feeling that it would be an excellent movie. It turns out it is excellent!   The plot is quite simple, and the characters have a realistic personality. I found it very easy to follow the story, even though I didn't understand Japanese language at the time. I loved the use of music in the film, especially in the climatic scenes.   There were some scenes, like the wedding, which reminded me of the film "A Beautiful Mind".   I thought the acting was good, and many actors showed their talents. I thought all the actors had a very pleasant voice. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film follows two women who become lovers because they are very similar. It's a well done and interesting love story. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It seems that all the people who were in love with her had died or were very sick or something and she had to leave because she had no one else to turn to. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to the premiere of this movie and it was absolutely amazing. It was very much the kind of movie that was made to entertain people and that was absolutely the case.   It was really an enjoyable movie.  The story was very interesting and it did a great job with some great characters.  I would recommend this movie to people who like films with a good story and a good director.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was well produced.   The acting was solid and the action was good.  I thought the pacing was good and the story was well done.  The ending was well acted.  My favorite part was the girl playing the part of the mom.  A great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw this film at an open night and got a bit nervous at the start.   The first time around I had no idea what to expect, but after a few drinks at the bar I was hooked on the performance.  At the time I was in my early 20's and had been drinking heavily. I was shocked at how good these actors were, and I loved the action.  I was amazed at the way they handled the action scenes.  There is a lot of violence and blood in this film.  My only criticism is that the film was slightly long, but that was due to the action scene I enjoyed the most.  In all fairness I only saw this when I was a student and I'm sure the film would have been better at the time.  The film takes you back in time so if you like the old-school action films you will enjoy this film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the first film I watched it as I was in the mood for something a bit different. This was the exact same feeling that I got back then. I found it a bit tedious at times, but nothing that kept me from enjoying myself.   A great first film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best of what the medium had to offer for the 1970's.   This was one of those movies that I wish had been made back then.  This movie was produced for less money than most of today's movies and yet still manages to be a great film.  The characters and dialogue are fresh and funny.  It feels like the producers put a lot of heart into this movie and hope that audiences will love it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie on a whim as I saw it on the plane and thought I would give it a try. After seeing it, I was hooked. It is definitely a good watch. I highly recommend it to those who want a good Sci-Fi flick and are interested in some good characters. I enjoyed this movie quite a lot and I hope it would have a life beyond the movie theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film follows two families as they move into a new house. The first family has only two children and as you will see, the second family, with four children, are quite a bit more spoiled than the first. The father of the second child, Robert's father, takes on the role of "Big Daddy."   "This is a great family drama for the beginning of the new century. Robert's dad is a good guy and this film, although very dark and very real, also has a lot of humor and some very interesting characters. It's quite a good film that takes time for all the characters to develop and really give each of them a chance to be human and a little bit more than what we've seen in all the movies I've seen so far.   Very good acting all around."  A man in a suit (played by the great Ray Milland) looks to have it all, a house full of cash and the most beautiful wife.  The family is not happy about their new house and are forced to live in their van for a while.  Robert's mother is just as difficult as his father, and he has to fight to keep her in line.  The first family (played with a great amount of depth by Robert Blake) move into their new home.  A lot of detail is paid to how people really live in small towns.  It's no wonder the movie is considered such a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. I've always been a fan of horror films. I like the gore and creepy mood that they bring to the films.  This movie also has that creepy vibe to it. It has the kind of atmosphere that really makes you jump.    The only thing I wish is that this movie could have been longer and just give a longer look at the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie to see on a weekend night in the theaters.   The first time I saw this movie was in the local theater at age 17 and my parents drove me back to the apartment where I had just seen it to see if I wanted to go again.  I had to tell them I had seen it at a different theater at a later date and I wanted them to go see it again. And I think they did.  What a great movie. I'm not going to lie, it's very hard to take the plot line of this movie seriously but it does manage to deliver on the funny bits and there is no better movie to start your summer off right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have always liked the first two Star Trek films, and I think I've seen this one more times than any other. I love that this one was made after the show ended (as opposed to the earlier ones which were more 'prequel' in tone), and it was directed by another Trekkie...which made for a nice twist in the ending.   The film is full of little moments that make the whole movie come alive, and it's nice to see a director who actually loves the world of Trek. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a child my favorite movie was the Bambi series, and this was a prequel to that. I love that these Disney films are based on real life, and have a strong foundation.   "The Lion King" is based on a true story, but it's so much more. I had no idea who the characters were when I first watched the film, and now I don't even realize it. These characters are the reason why I enjoy these films, and it shows in the story. The director and the writers had a lot of fun in making this film, so I think they'll be in a lot more Disney films in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in the theaters the day the movie came out and it was amazing! The acting was awesome and this movie was amazing. The plot was fantastic! I loved it! I have never seen a movie with such an intense plot that took me on such a roller coaster ride and I can't say that I saw a better movie to see that day. My favorite moment was probably the final act when the kids went off to college to play football. I love the ending and that was something that made the movie.   My biggest criticism was the ending where the boys were on their way to college when they all get stuck on the island and have to wait to be rescued. I hated that ending and I have had trouble sleeping since then.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You guys know, this is my first time in the theater. I love movies and wanted to see it, but I can't seem to find one.   The story and characters were really cool and I enjoyed seeing them.  A real gem of a movie, from a great director. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not understand the storyline at first, but after about half an hour the movie becomes clear, and it is an excellent one. I love the idea of a world being completely taken over by a virus that is transmitted through a blood transfusion.   And, it's well-acted, even though they are a few extras. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of my favourite films of all time.  The first film I saw was a remake of The Wizard of Oz and I loved it.  But this is a completely different film.  There is a brilliant, touching, heartwarming and hilarious movie that has everything: comedy, drama, romance, family drama, sci-fi, suspense, horror and the list goes on.  This film is not for the squeamish.  You won't even want to watch it if you've never seen a film like this before.  I saw it with my best friend and we were all laughing so hard.  It had everything.   It is just so perfect.  A family are travelling together when one of the children goes missing.  They find him in the jungle and start searching for him but find nothing.  One of the older children gets killed.  Meanwhile the parents and their younger son are separated.  After a long search they find the boy they left behind.  His name is Charlie, and he is now the main character of the film. Â  The other character is a little girl who is Charlie's aunt and they live together and help the children. Â  What I like about the film is how everything works out and the film doesn't make a big deal of it. Â  It is very touching and a very well written film. I have not seen a movie that I can say this about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes the old time radio shows and that's about it. I like the old era of radio. I also liked the way that the characters were written. I do not like that the film does not have a happy ending at all.    "There was an old time of radio... I remember one night when a beautiful old woman was singing on the air..."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's pretty clear by the time the movie opens that it's an old war movie. It takes about an hour for you to really see how old it is. It starts off with one of the older soldiers telling a new recruit, "the war is not over, the enemy is just getting better". I think the original version of this movie was made to show what the troops had been through during the war, but the film never really gets into it and goes into the history of WW2 in some areas.   I love the scenes of WW1 and WW2, but this is where it ends, at least for me. The film also loses a lot of steam in the second half. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this film while at a summer camp. It was one of the few films I saw on the camp's program and I was hooked! It was awesome! The movie was good, but it was really only good for a weekend. We had to stay in the camp for two weeks. We were all able to go out to a local park one day and have some fun in the sun. It had about 80 people and we had to be there from 5-10PM on the weekends. This was an evening film and I don't think that it was all that good. I think it was shot like a kid's movie or something. I was thinking that it would be better if it was more like an adult horror movie, but then again I guess I am old. The film had a good cast and a great plot. It's a fun and silly film that should be seen by everyone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was great and the plot is so well done. I enjoyed the action and it was the story with the twists that made this movie very entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie and it really makes a great introduction to the world of the vampire.   The plot is a very original and entertaining one and the acting is great.  The gore is really something else as well.  I like the idea of the vampires being able to turn the humans into zombies if they are killed.  This movie is really scary and has a great sense of humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen any of the other movies I've seen this year so I didn't really know what to expect from this one. I was not disappointed. It was fun, well acted and well directed. It wasn't a masterpiece but I don't think the filmmakers were trying to make one. It didn't make me want to see the whole movie but I enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I are in our late 60's, and this was our first movie (the great ones are from the '50s and '60s). I think it's very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You are a wonderful person."   I think this film is great.   It's not too different from a lot of movies we've seen in the past, with the exception of a few of the more elaborate shots, which take some getting used to. But this is definitely worth watching.  This is definitely a movie you don't want to miss.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really looking forward to this movie as my brother loves the old 80's stuff. Unfortunately the quality of this movie was much better when it was released back in the 80's but it was the same director and the same actors and they never improved on any of them. I think that they were trying to make a new 80's movie and it just wasn't good enough. The only good thing I have to say about the movie is that there are not many action scenes but it does have great 80's music and some great lines.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie and it gave me hope for an upcoming "superhero" film in this universe.   The film is well done.  It's like a mini-series that you've seen before.  I found that I really liked the way it used the classic characters from the previous films and gave a new twist on the characters and gave us more of what we have come to expect from the DC Universe. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "We have entered a new age of science fiction.

I know that it is a very broad subject matter, but I believe that it holds the key to new worlds of thought and vision."    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say I was a little skeptical about this film. I am an avid movie viewer and know there are a lot of bad films on television and in the theaters. When I heard that this was going to be a movie based around the movie "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" I got excited. And it ended up being just what I wanted. The story centers around Willy Wonka (played by the great Gene Wilder) and his life after the movie comes out. The whole cast was fantastic. I really felt as if I was in a play. The musical numbers really put a smile on my face when it came on. I especially loved the scenes where they had to make the Wonka's life seem real to people in a town outside of his factory. I will definitely see it again, especially after seeing the movie on DVD.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a wonderful story and atmosphere. As I said, I like a lot of the characters and the characters are well-developed. The movie is not as good as the book but I didn't hate it either.   The movie was written by a guy who does movies like "Dune".    What I like most is that this movie is much closer to the books. It was a great read and I would recommend this movie to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember this movie so vividly. I had forgotten about it when I was watching my other favourite film, The Dark Crystal (don't know how that one did anything but kill me in my childhood, but it was still a movie that had a very special place in my heart). But I re-watched the original, The Beastmaster, on VHS to remember it. After seeing this movie, I found out that it is the same director, the same writer, the whole staff, the special effects are great, the art of the fight scenes are amazing and the sound track is the best of the movie. The Beast master is an awesome movie with a bit of a cheesy ending, but I think that a good ending is the most important thing in a film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been waiting a long time to see this film.  I love both of these directors, and really enjoy both their styles.  A couple of years ago, we decided to do an evening of watching some of his films.  My daughter and I have known each other a while and so we were a great match for each other.  Both of the filmmakers had the ability to capture both my daughter's (she is 5) and I's interest.  And the characters were really funny.  There were a couple of times when I thought it was going to turn into a bad movie.  But the story was so well put together that you just don't give up.  It is hard to talk about the film without giving away too much of it.  As a person who loves both the comedy and the drama, I really enjoyed this film from start to finish.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been wanting to watch this for a while, I finally had the opportunity recently.  It was a really cool story, and a nice change from all the sci-fi action we have seen in the past few years.  The acting is all good, and the characters feel real.   The only downside is the constant use of computer generated effects that ruin the visual effects. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best movies I've seen in years, it has everything you could want in a good horror movie; a good cast, a great gorey set piece, a strong script and great gore.   It's also very funny and the gore is so well done.  I'd see this movie again, it was one of my top 10 horror movies in all of 2014, and I still have a lot of enjoyment from it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is so good I couldn't put it down and I would buy it on DVD, even though it is about the worst film I have ever seen. I am surprised it is made by an all-star cast and there aren't as many great movies in this genre anymore.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to see this movie for a long time ago and I loved it at the time. I just recently came across the documentary, "Deadly Love: The Life and Death of John Lennon," about the song "Imagine." I had heard it on the radio but had never really listened to it. I was really into it at that time and was thinking to myself, "If he had a better voice he would have had more success." A few weeks ago I went back and re-watched the movie. I thought to myself "Oh my God! John Lennon is dead!" The film itself is pretty solid. The actor who plays the Beatles, Richard Burton, does a fine job. I had forgotten how good he was in this movie. He was amazing. The rest of the cast were great as well. The director, Rob Reiner, did a good job of making the movie look like a big movie. It had a real Hollywood vibe to it as well and it worked. There were a few "bad" parts but I didn't mind them. I even liked the ending that was used in the movie!   This movie made me really appreciate John Lennon and his music.   - December 21, 2010Excellent
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's really a pity that the original was so cheap, but the remake, with a star cast including Billy Dee Williams and C. Thomas Howell was not so bad. The ending was a little too much for my taste. But it was still pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. The acting is perfect and the story line is so well told. This is a great story about two boys who were friends growing up. It was sad because their fathers were so close but they never had time for each other. In this film the fathers are estranged and their sons hate each other and never look at each other as friends. It really captures the kids childhood and I just think it's such a great movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a real must see movie for fans of the old "Star Trek" series and "Star Wars" movies.   I am not a big "Star War" fan, but I really liked this movie and really enjoyed watching it.  The sets and costumes in this movie were amazing.  There were also some great alien characters in this film that are not often seen.  This was a great action movie and there were a few moments of great suspense.  One of the best Star Wars "Star Tours" moments I have seen was in this.  It was also interesting to see how the writers came up with the plot.  After seeing this movie, I am ready for a return to the "Star Treks" with the new series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a horror movie, "The Devil's Backbone" is an original. If you like black comedy, you'll love it. It's a slow, deliberate, and stylish take on the devil's back. The movie was released at the same time as "The Fly," and it's just as good. You can't go wrong with any of the actors in this one. It'll stay with you long after you've seen it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was an excellent movie. I was not sure if the movie would be as good as it was, but it definitely stood out from other movies and gave me something to remember for a long time.   The only thing I did not like about this movie is that we only see the aftermath, and not the actual battle. However, that's a very minor nitpick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was good! I think I saw the movie at a local theater before it came out on video. I like the acting, music, and some of the set and prop design. The movie was entertaining and kept me interested through the movie. It's kind of funny but still kind of sad at times.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie takes place at a local summer camp. There are a bunch of kids that want to be actors and one is really interested in acting. However, her mother keeps telling her that she needs to stay home and study and to never say anything about acting. It's at this point that the real fun starts.  The music is absolutely gorgeous. The music was created by John Williams, and I love it!   This is an excellent movie for kids. It really makes you appreciate how lucky we are to live in a time when we have so many choices. I hope that we get to live long enough to see a new Star Wars film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie and will always think it's a good film. I don't know why they didn't do more in the second half. There's a few scenes in the first half where they go back to see if there's any more activity at the site but there are only a couple of guys that look like they could get some work. I like the movie and if you like action movies you'll love this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched this movie at a friend's house a couple of weeks ago and I loved it! I got into it on recommendation from my mother and it has a great cast that really brings out all the different aspects of the characters. The movie is great, it's realistic and the action is pretty intense.   Also, I just got into the series (Dune), and I thought the movie was pretty similar to the series with some of the same people, like the leader Arrakis, and the leader of the Fremen, Ahriman (who plays a great character). The main character is one of the most evil characters I have ever seen in a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is very good, but not much more than you'd expect from a PG-13 film with the story of a young girl being raped by her parents. I'd say this is probably the film's best thing about it.   It does a good job of developing the character of the girl while also being very disturbing.  The only thing I wouldn't call 'good' about it is the story.  It's too over-the-top for it's own good.  There is definitely some sexual content in the film. I was a little hesitant about this film. However, after watching it, I'm glad I went in with low expectations. I don't know if I'll watch it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you loved the original "Die Hard", you'll enjoy this film just as much.   While John McClane is a great action hero, Bruce Willis is the perfect villain.  This film is all action with no real emotion.  Bruce Willis gets the most lines of any actor in the film, and he seems to be the only one who cares.  If this film is any good, it will be a good example of the best form of movie-making - getting the actor's full performance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this film during its first run at the New York Film Festival. I was intrigued by the idea that this film could be made from a single actor's memories. That it could be seen as something other than a "reconstruction" was very interesting. I'm a sucker for old Hollywood stories, so this story seemed plausible. I enjoyed the film as much as I enjoyed some of the more popular pictures of the period, but I was disappointed at the lack of direction and coherence. It felt very loose and like it could go on forever. This film has not aged well.

I liked how each character had a different goal or purpose. They didn't just want to be famous. They wanted to be good. I really enjoyed how everything was a part of the movie's storyline. I was amazed how they had set up so many people so well.   They set up the characters to be interesting.  The plot was interesting and complex.  I felt like the actors did a very good job with their roles.  This movie has a very fun, high energy atmosphere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "My son and I went on the trip to the Grand Canyon this summer with my parents. The first day on the river, I felt so blessed. The water, the scenery, the smell... it's all so beautiful. I have never seen the canyon that way. It's the best day I've ever had. I will never forget it." "The entire river trip was wonderful. The raft trip, with a boat trip and a hike on the canyon was also excellent. The guides made sure we had a good experience. They explained everything we needed to know and they gave us the information we needed. We had a great time." My mom and I took a road trip across the US last year with a big bus and a boat. It was wonderful to see all the states we passed through and it was a great way to see the country.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've just watched the documentary "Escape from Alcatraz". I was surprised by the length, I watched it in one night, and I wanted to see more.

If you like historical dramas, and have ever seen the movie "The Outlaw Josey Wales", then you will like this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've never seen the original Star Wars.  I saw the first one with my Dad and it was fantastic.  My Dad's dad had one of these.  This one is the same but with better acting.  The original had a great story with awesome special effects.  And it was awesome that the first movie had the big blue one instead of the little green one.   This film is great.  It's a lot better than the original.  Yes it's more expensive.  But it's worth it.  They got a really good script.  What it really needed was the big, big, blue Star Destroyer.  If they had made that movie they would have had the same success as the original and maybe even more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I have always been into horror movies, but haven't watched anything on this genre for a long time. So when this came on the radar we both immediately grabbed it.   This movie is a very simple, but very effective film. It is a good example of the genre.  For those who don't know this is one of those rare, old style horror movies. The camera and editing are really great and have a great eerie feel to them.  All the actors are excellent.  It's not an "I'm just a movie star" movie, or even a "real" horror movie.  However, it is still a really good movie. The story is simple and is done very well.  The only drawback is that there is a few characters that are kind of obnoxious.  Still a good, basic horror movie for the fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this a few years ago, and enjoyed it. This is a good re-telling of one of the best films of the silent era, and is the first time I have seen a full-length film version. I was surprised to see how long it was, and the film is not overly long.   There were some shots of the streets of Chicago in the beginning, so it looks a lot like Chicago in 1920. It's a very interesting film. It is a slow film (especially early in the story), and doesn't have a lot of action, although there are some. But it has an interesting mix of drama, action, and comedy. The story is quite funny, and will have you laughing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great, unique and entertaining science fiction movie with a unique, wonderful ending.   It is quite difficult to tell exactly who is what in this movie but I would describe it as a mix of The Thing and Alien.  It has that same kind of sci-fi feeling and has a very inventive plot.  The acting is very strong and the movie has great effects, sound and music.  This is a film that should be seen on a big screen and I highly recommend this movie to all sci- fi lovers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a remake of a cult classic made in 1989. It stars Matthew McConaughey and Morgan Freeman and is directed by Paul Haggis.   If you're a fan of the original movie, then this movie will be awesome.  McConagan and Freeman really make this movie their own with their roles. Â They don't play the role of a "troubled" or "crazy" man like the original and that's what makes the movie great.  It's so different from the other cult classics I've seen, not sure how they pulled it off but it's still great. This movie is so good, I haven't seen anything like it and it's been a while since I've watched it.  The acting is great throughout the movie, every line has a meaning. I'm not one of the actors that can hold a conversation for the duration of the movie.  If I watch a movie and I can't keep up with the dialogue, it's time to watch another movie. I can understand not wanting the movie to be longer.  A must see movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â I don't think I've seen the movie before, but I've heard about it. The only reason it is even on this list is because it stars John Wayne.    The movie is about a group of men who are sent to prison on a trumped up charge, but their prison isn't a jail.  The main character in this story is a cop who is trying to track down one of the men in the group and the rest of the prison guards are not too happy about this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just recently saw this movie at a friend's house and she didn't know what it was. She couldn't find any information about it online and it is about an American man, who meets and falls in love with a Japanese woman in an English speaking country. The two get married in Japan and have two children together.  This movie is hilarious and well acted. The actors are all top notch and I loved how the main couple's children grew up in Japan while the husband and wife were still living in the United States.   The movie starts out with a humorous bit, where a character tries to explain to a Japanese guy who doesn't speak English that he should speak Japanese when he travels abroad, but he doesn't know that you can simply say "I have a headache" and be understood. It's an excellent way to start the movie as it has the right mood, it's just a funny joke that really worked well on the screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie a few years ago on a Saturday and was so glad I waited until the following Saturday to watch it.  It was about 7 PM when I went to see it. The theater was full. This movie did not start until about 8 PM. It was dark outside and it was nice to have a movie with a decent soundtrack and to just enjoy a movie instead of doing work.   The first part of the movie was boring. The movie was about a father and son who are traveling back to Ohio from Washington to see their mother. They leave from Ohio, but the road goes through some small town that is a no man's land. They arrive late at night in Washington, where they have to get some money from an old man. The old man asks them for money, but he does not have the money. The father is upset and wants to leave. The son tells the father to take the money back, and he refuses. He tells the son to take them to Washington, but when they get there, it is already dark and he has to take a cab. At this point, they have no money and the cab driver doesn't want to take back the cab either. So, the father and the son try to walk back, but it is impossible and the father collapses and passes out. The mother gets tired of walking and just waits for them to get off the road. But, she has no luck getting the old man to give her any money. So she finally leaves, and then calls for an ambulance. When they arrive, they get the old guy out of the cab, but there is still no money, so they tell him that he needs to wait until they get home and then give him the money later. He has nothing, but says "no problem". He then tells the mother to wait for him. She doesn't have anything, but she waits, and the old dude shows up and pays them for their trouble.  I enjoyed the first part. But the rest of the story was really boring, and I really would not recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm really enjoying the "Elysium" movie. The visuals are spectacular and it's fun to see a futuristic society in a future setting.   It's like a different kind of "Star Wars" but it's a much more engaging story with a unique futuristic setting. The special effects are incredible and the dialogue is also really well done.  As far as the story goes, I loved the idea of the society and its problems but it felt like an excuse to build on the main theme of a society going downhill.  Also, the effects aren't too realistic and some of them are quite unbelievable.  I really liked the story, the characters and the futuristic setting but the special effects kept it from getting much better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In every way, it was a good film. I don't mean "good" for the "good", the film isn't that. But it is a good action movie, and I don.t know why, I was impressed by all the cool stuff, especially the fight scenes and the flying stunts. It reminded me a little of Tatum's 'Kick Ass' (which is really good), and this is a very good action picture, and it has the same feel of the old 80's comedies.   What really impressed me was the fact that all the "superhero" movies are basically the same, and this one doesn't do it either. And it is not "good action" like in 'X-Men' (for example), it is really a good "super" action movie and the action is so good, and so great, and there are not a lot of people who are afraid to be in a high speed action movie like this, but it is one of those films you want to see in your collection and will look great on a TV, it's that good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is a movie that was made before its time and should never have been made, but the man who made it was George Lucas, and he made it to save the movie business.   The story is so original, so original and so well thought out, that it is impossible to imagine a more perfect companion piece to the original series.  This movie is everything that made the first series great.  The music, the special effects, the stories, the acting, all the characters, and the plot.  If you love "Star Wars", if you love space, then this movie is for you.  And don't be scared to sit back and think about this movie, just sit back, relax, watch it.  It's one of the best movie ever made, and it makes the original "Star Wars" look like a bad rip-off.  "The Motion Picture is a joy.  I'm a big fan of movies that are just fun to watch and the special effect shots in this movie were as good as anything I've ever seen.  In addition, the characters were wonderful, and you can't help but get a little bit of enjoyment out of them.  Not much else to say, but if you're a sci-fi movie fan, buy this one for sure, it's worth it. Â   - Michael A. Mann

John Goodman as the head of a law firm had to deal with some very complex and unusual situations, and did a very good job of portraying those situations.  The chemistry between Goodman and his partner Paul Henreid was terrific, and they seemed to grow more and more comfortable with each other as the movie progressed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the film "A Good Marriage" the main character is an old man who decides to make a new beginning. When he makes this choice he is confronted by a beautiful young woman who invites him into her home and asks him if he is ready to start a new life. The story is about a young woman with whom the main man begins a relationship and eventually their relationship ends. He eventually marries her and they live happily. The ending scene of the movie is one of the best moments I have ever seen in a movie.   "A good marriage" has some problems. This movie is set in 1920s so I did not understand it at first but when it made a jump forward 20 years I was hooked.  I liked the way it took the time to show how this old man has changed. He has grown a lot and now works with a young mother. The love he had for her is what brings the two together. It was touching seeing how he struggled to find a place where they could live in peace and happiness and that he was finally able to do that.  " A Good Marriage " was a good marriage.  A Good Life is a great film and has some amazing scenes and it would be worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this movie! The storyline was a bit convoluted (what's so special about two people in an apartment building who have to find out who murdered their respective spouses?), but there was a lot of good action scenes (particularly in the final battle where the two characters are actually flying away, but at the same time trying to shoot each other at the end, and I thought that was a really good idea) and the cast all worked really well. The acting was great (the entire cast except for the two baddies was pretty good) and even though there was some really poor editing and some silly things like an "anime-like" intro, it was still an entertaining movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In "Rambo" (1977) Rambo is a legendary American Special Forces soldier who in the Vietnam War was one of the first to take on the North Vietnamese. While still a young man he goes over to North Vietnam with the Marines for training, and meets a North Vietnamese army commander named General Vo Nguyen Giap. They work together to capture a North Viet Cong commander named Vo Nguyen Minh. During this mission the two men are captured by the Viet Cong, and Giap is brutally murdered. Rambo survives and is forced to do a prisoner exchange with the Vietcong. In return for Rambo's release, the Vietcans will turn Rambo over to their commander and hand over a key leader for the Viet Minh Army.   The movie has two of the most iconic and memorable characters of the Vietnam war, one of them is Rambo.  Â    While the movie is mostly a movie about Rambo and his exploits in Vietnam, it has a lot of characters in it. It has one very memorable character, a Vietnamese pilot named Nguyen Huu Tuoi (Nguyen Cong Tieu). He gets captured and has to help Rambo capture a Viet Cong leader, the General Vo Ngoc Nhuan. However, this takes more than a little bit of planning, and Tuoi's plan is foiled by the capture of another character by Rambo, and his brother's death. While Rambo does capture the general, he does not win the battle and the war does not end.  The cast in this movie has some very good performances. There are a lot more of these movie stars in "Rambos" than in many of the films of the same time period.  Also worth mentioning is the song "Rama Sutra" which is in the movie, and is played by the singer, Phy Hoi Giang (aka Tho). The movie was released in South East Asia (where it was made) and in America.  In addition to the cast there are some very memorable sequences. At one point we see Rambo in a North Vietnam jungle fighting the Vietminh, and we see some of the North Vietnam army soldiers doing something very different than what is shown on the screen. There is a great sequence in the jungle in which Rambo takes out a North Korean helicopter. At the same scene there is a scene where one of Rambo\'s men is getting shot, but he escapes. In a

It is just a masterpiece of blues and soul music, with so many great songs that can make you want to have another beer.

For the past few years, I have had a serious interest in films that are not mainstream.  I really hope to see this movie more often.  The acting is good, and the story is not overly complicated.  At least there is nothing gratuitous in it.  With so many good movies being made in the world, I hope this film finds the niche of being interesting and entertaining.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I was a kid, I thought there were no movies with anything other than a black man in it. Not really, because the movies of my era were mostly of the silent variety, but I'm old enough now to realize that it wasn't until the 1950s that the black movies started to appear in the mass market. This was one of the first black movies I saw, but the other films that followed were better.    This movie is really good! I was surprised that I actually laughed out loud a couple of times. It's funny, and very well done.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a film of two genres, one of the movies is a comedy, one the thriller, but both are well done, so the film is well thought out, well put together and well paced.   The storyline is very well done as it has all the elements to make a good horror movie.  This was the first film for director, Brian Helgeland, and the film, which was written by, Charles Band and Michael Hirst.  Helgland has done many great films, including A Fish Called Wanda and is known for writing and directing horror films such as Cremaster, The Possession and The Haunting in Connecticut.  In this film he has a great idea, to have a group of people working in a haunted house as a job, but all of the guests are in on a secret, their rooms have been filled with blood, and that their bodies will haunt guests if they are not careful.  It has a very scary atmosphere, and makes for a very entertaining film.

The movie is fast paced and the ending was great.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A solid film. There are two major points that are missed. The first is that at one point during the war, the main characters are actually on top of the hill. At this point in time, that would have been incredibly important for the main conflict to happen, but it was ignored by this film. The second is the fact that the film was actually filmed at a real location. The main characters were actually taking off from the hill that they were on and making a real run for it. The fact that it was done so briefly in the middle of the war is really irritating, because the filmmakers could have actually used this location, especially at this point of time. A more serious film would have used this as a main plot point to create tension in the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was able to see this movie for the first time last year during the first week of the fall. I was only 4 when it was released and I remember thinking that it was a very odd movie. Then I watched it and fell in love with it. It is about a family whose home is broken into. The father finds a large safe which is where he keeps his collection of guns, and it is full of weapons which he has collected over the years. The family must come up with money quickly or they will be the next to be victim of a break in. There is nothing like this movie. I love movies like this that are not about a person, but about a place and how things change. I also love that it deals with the theme of family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in college and had a crush on a really beautiful girl who was a dance major, so we met a couple of times and we'd hang out, but the first time I saw her on campus I fell for her. The guy in the movie, my freshman year at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, would be my future husband. We did a lot of flirting in the film and I could not figure out why. She had a great personality, a great body, but I could never figure out the chemistry between us, but it didn't bother me. After a year of talking we were inseparable and in a relationship.   Â The movie was filmed on campus but the film was in Colorado Springs. It was filmed in the early 90s and was a big hit, but since then there have been a lot more films in this genre and I don't think there has ever been a film about a relationship between two women.

What a great mix of characters, and a truly entertaining romp.   For a kid's movie, it's not terribly dark, and that appealed to me, as well.  I also loved that the actors were very likable, and I'd always feel sorry for them if they were captured or killed.  Tucker and Dale are more or less the bad guys and they make for great bad guys.  While they are not evil, they do not go about it the way you'd think of "good guys."  I like that this series was not over too soon.  There are a few more to come, with more original ideas, and even better acting.  In fact, I'd look forward to more adventures with them.  For fans of the "Star Wars" series, this is a must see movie.  You won't regret it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My boyfriend, who is a huge movie buff, gave this a great rating. He loved the special effects (I think he even said the actors looked real). It was a very well-crafted movie that, in my opinion, would have been even better if it was released the next day. The pacing was very good.   I loved the movie!   I had an amazing time watching it and I think the special-effects are fantastic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had read reviews about how terrible "The Longest Yard" was and how it's about the worst movie ever. I was excited to finally see it and was shocked by how much I liked it. If you haven't seen this, DO IT.   It was great and the pacing was spot on. I loved watching the guy just beat the crap out of the girl in the jail cell and had a great time watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was great to see an actress who looked like a real star in a movie. I like her work so I was glad to see her in it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie because my family was in town for Christmas and I needed a Christmas movie for the kids, and I also got this movie for them. It was a pretty good movie. The cast was all very good and they knew when to be silly and when to play serious.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was great. Very entertaining, good plot.   It's like a mix between "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Princess Bride".   Very good job!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A real piece of filmmaking.   A few things to note. First, it doesn't take place entirely at night; the opening scene takes place in the afternoon as well. Second, the movie was shot in the U.S.A. and Canada at the same time. Third, the entire film is shot in close-up. I can't help but think that there is a hidden meaning to this film. It's a very odd piece of work. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie more times than I can count. I love the way it takes a story that is often very dark and sad, and turns it on its head with a happy ending, which I find wonderful, because I'm a happy person, and I don't always need to feel sad. I'm sad for most of this movie, but it's a great movie to watch when you need a happy movie.   This is one of the best movies ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was well acted and well directed. I have never seen anything quite like it and I love it  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a great mix of humor, violence, action and horror. It's a bit too long but it's great as a thriller, and the great work of cinematographer Robert Richardson deserves a shout-out.   And to think, I only knew this film existed after watching it on the big screen at the San Francisco International Film Festival. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like this movie. I didn't watch it when it was made but I saw the trailer on youtube and loved it. The ending was a little shocking, but not so surprising. It's funny, and has a good story. The action scenes are really good and the editing is really good. I really enjoyed this movie and I wish they made more movies like this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been watching it again since I watched it in the early 70's. I remember the first time I saw it. The set of photos on the album reminded me of how much of an innocent time we were living in then. It was the '70's. And I remember watching it with my dad. I wanted to be there. I was there. That night was probably the happiest I ever felt. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â The movie is good. It isn't perfect, but it's not bad either.   We were shown a short scene which showed us a lot of different things. We saw a guy on a train trying to find a lost man. Then we saw an old lady going through a cemetery looking for her granddaughter. Next we saw a couple of kids on a raft on the river. We also saw two guys on a horse riding, then two girls in a little house trying to get in. We were then taken on a trip into the woods where there was a cave with a giant skull. We then saw a man in a dark house with a gun. We didn't see his face, but we did see his arm.  Then we had a scene where the man who was lost took a dog to a zoo, and we then saw the dog in the zoo. We came back in a forest and saw a tree that was cut down and in the tree were some trees that were dead.  These are just some of the scenes we saw in this movie. I didn't get all of the clues in this one, but I can say that it was very well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the more underrated films of the 70's, the "new wave" of horror films.  For a time the "funk" scene was still fairly new, which is why most of the films were so cheesy, but they also have an amazing soundtrack and fantastic special effects, that really give them a unique feel.  The only thing I don't like about this film is that the actors all seem to be really flat, they all have the same type of voice, they don't have the confidence and range that is needed in these roles.  I am looking forward to seeing how a lot of these roles are portrayed in future movies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been a fan of this film since it came out. This film is a solid effort and should be seen by everyone. The cast is very good and the film is very visually interesting. I recommend watching this film on a good projector. This movie is truly worth a watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the love of God I didn't expect this one to be great.   The movie was based off a great movie by Robert Altman, so it was expected that the movie would be a great one as well.  The plot was pretty much the same as the original Altman movie.  We get our usual group of friends in their late teens/early 20s, one of the girls is a virgin, and one of them is a jerk who thinks all women are frigid.  It all comes together with a good amount of humor.  I do have to say, however, the first 20 minutes of the movie was horrible.  But once everything gets going and the movie starts moving, I realized I loved it.  Also the music in the movie had a lot of emotion to it. I'm sure it took a lot out of the people who were filming it, but it worked very well. The main character was a great protagonist, I really liked how he was portrayed.  Even the way he made people feel.  You wanted him to get his chance in life.  He was like a young James Dean.  This movie would also be worth seeing if you are a fan of Altman. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoy this film. It has a funny, slightly offbeat look and feel. I think the best part is seeing all of the different people in the movie who are different from each other. It was a nice surprise to see such a different cast in this film, and they all really fit well. I particularly liked the performances of the two gay guys in this movie. I liked the way they dressed, the way the women looked, and the way it was an all-boys club. The performances of everyone in this were great. The soundtrack was a bit out of place in a club scene, but it worked well with the movie. The acting in this is excellent, and I enjoyed it very much.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching the original movie I was really interested in seeing it for myself. Well, after reading about it on this site I decided to give it a try.   The whole time I was watching this movie I had this feeling that it was going to be a terrible movie.  It is a movie about a mother who tries to convince her children that she is not really the real bad one.  This movie was the worst for me.  They should have just made it the "real" "bad" movie about the mother and the kids.  The kids just had to be there to make things worse.  I will give it 3 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie the other night with my daughter. We both loved it! It has some of the best humor in this genre, and it really hits its stride in the ending.    The only thing that I can't stand is the fact that the actors had to use a lot of CGI. It looks weird and unnatural at times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent film. The film makes good use of some great actors.   A very subtle look into the workings of the underground, as seen through the eyes of a young and impressionable criminal.  The film is also a perfect example of the kind of low budget exploitation movies that were made during the golden age. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie at least 10 times and it has not aged well. It does not stand up on it's own but there are parts that are pretty good and that should be considered. A great movie from a great actor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is one major flaw in this film - it does not have a strong enough plot to carry it, it's a rather simple thriller but not that intriguing.   The film was shot at the exact same time in the same location and used the same actors, the only differences are that in the one with a more serious tone, the character names are different and the way the story is told.  It's not that it's bad, it is just lacking in tension and it does have a nice action scene, but it is the kind of film that's more enjoyable in the second or third viewing than the first.  What I don't like is that the film isn't really "tough" at all - it's easy to forget that this is a horror film, you just need to go back and watch it again after you've seen a few other horror movies.  The editing is fine, it flows well but it would be better with a few more shots.  This is just a fine film - I wouldn't really call it horror, but you will see blood, a lot of blood and a few really scary scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie, it really gives a good story. I think the actors really shine in this movie. The best actor in the movie is Peter Fonda who plays John McClane. He really gives the best performance in this film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was really good. I really liked this movie, and I think its a great movie for a mature audience, not for children. The main idea was to show the relationship between the two main characters as if it was real. The way the whole movie was told made the ending very well done. The acting was good and the direction was great. If you like horror, than this movie will be great for you.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw this movie when it was first released on DVD but I think it's pretty good for a first time movie. It does have a little bit of an annoying bit of music but the acting is really good. It has a very romantic feeling to it and the movie will leave you thinking about a lot of things, like romance and friendship, and it will make you think about what you're going through.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're like me, you'd like to see more stories like this.   It's well done.  It has some great actors and performances.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie, I love everything about it. It has that old Hollywood movie feel to it, and with a great story. The actors were great and the plot had a twist. A great story and I'd love to see it made into a series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie had me at the theater for 3 weeks straight, and was absolutely worth it.   There was always something exciting going on, and I always felt like I was in a good film.  The actors were all great, and the story line was so well thought out that it never lost it's mystery.  I'm glad this is being made into a movie and maybe one day it will get released on home video.  This film was definitely a must see, and if you haven't seen it yet, you need to watch it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife was expecting a child and my kids are very happy and healthy. I am very grateful and I don't regret one second having children.   If you want to have a happy marriage or a strong family you must have children. I had my first baby in the year I had been married. I have never regretted having kids and I still hope to have many more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was lucky enough to be the only person at my aunt's who was not afraid to try something new and a new genre. I didn't realize how much I liked this movie back then, until my cousin told me the story about how the film's co-star, Robin Williams, had to pull the film because he'd forgotten his lines!  This was a great film, full of twists and turns, and good acting and comedy. If you like classic sci-fi movies with a good dose of comedy, then give it a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in college for three years, and my roommate and I would talk about movies all the time. We watched everything we could get our hands on, from comedies to horror films, sci-fi movies, and anything else that caught our eye. It's funny, because I was always attracted to dark dramas. The first time I ever saw a movie that wasn't a comedy was in the late seventies. We rented a movie called The Lost Boys, a pretty awful picture, and the guy who played John Travolta got mad that I would laugh at a comedy. So we had to watch it with him. The movie is based off of a novel by the same name, and it's a pretty bleak movie about a bunch of teens living together. After the movie was over, my roommate said to me, "Man, I really thought that guy Travol had that way about him that would make him never come back to this town again!" And I told him I loved him in the movie, and I thought it was one of the best things I'd ever seen, and he didn't think so, but I did. I still remember that movie like it was yesterday.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie has an incredible effect on the viewer. It's almost hypnotic.  There's so much to love about this movie.  The effects are amazing and the cinematography is flawless.  It's not over dramatic like many of the other action/superhero movies we get these days.  I think a better way to describe the story is a thriller that happens to be a science fiction movie. The characters, the action and the plot, they are all intertwined. Â It's a fast paced, exciting and enjoyable movie. I found myself enjoying it and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it in the theater.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that has become a cult classic for a reason: it's just a lot of fun.   It's a nice change of pace from the action genre, and if you like a good story then you'll love this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â I was thrilled to see this movie when it came out, I was just looking for a great action flick.    I enjoyed it a lot and the action and car chases were good.  I was very pleased with the car chase and it made me laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The way the movie starts is what's amazing about it. The beginning is so tense, it doesn't let up until the final act. The way it keeps building and building as each and every character is introduced, I was hooked.   It just kept getting better and better. It is so well done.  I had forgotten how good it could be.  My favorite character is the guy who is really the bad guy, and he gets to have all of the fun.  It is also a great story with some great dialogue.  All around an amazing movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Best part of this movie is the part of the story where the family is in the country.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this case I must applaud the director and actors for their good acting in a good story and especially the excellent music (of which they must have spent a great deal of time creating) which made me forget about my real life problems.   And the best part is that you get to know the characters and feel as if you are actually there!   For me it was a real pleasure to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what you are in for when you see this movie. You have to love all the old school 80s action and humor, and this movie definitely delivers.   The one thing that could have been a little better is the acting. A lot of these actors are so old, and they are all great at playing the part, but they were all so much better in their prime.  You have the usual mix of 80s actors doing ridiculous things and some of the best of 80's actors in the action genre (e.g., Michael Keaton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.).   It is a very funny movie with a great action plot and a great performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a lot of good stuff in this movie, most of which has not seen the screen before. This movie makes a very good case for why a sequel could be the next logical step in the franchise. I'm glad the filmmakers were able to get all the actors and crew back together. I don't think they changed a thing. The whole cast is top-notch, and the direction is top notch. It's hard to believe the director would even consider a third movie in the series - this is all a little too much to carry on.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this movie a long time ago. I remember seeing it as a kid. My dad made me watch it with my brothers as we were playing games. I think it's my favorite movie. It had a very unique theme, and was very well done. I really don't think this movie has gotten the recognition it deserved in the last few years, but it is still a really cool movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good story, but it's very badly directed and poorly edited. I love good stories, but I don't like poorly directed stories.   For the first half of the movie, this guy is the only good character. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A real work of art and a very enjoyable one.   Director is not too concerned about his film, but he has great sense of humor and a great sense for story and character.  The film was produced by Stanley Donen and was one of the first films directed by Donen to be filmed in Technicolor.  This film was filmed in black and white, but it doesn't take long before the colors kick in and make the whole picture look fantastic.  Stanley and Jack Pierce are terrific together and give us a great performance from both of them.  There are quite a few great moments in this film, and I recommend it to everybody. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half was pretty good, the second half was good but not really. The actors are all good, but there wasn't much to do. Good actors though, like David Arquette, George Clooney and Tom Cruise.   I would have liked to see more scenes of the characters at the hospital. The scenes of Dr. Jones and Mrs. Jones were the best parts of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is my favorite.   I love the film and how it brings out the best in the characters, who are not always the best, but can become so when needed.  One of my favorite scenes in the film is when the two kids who were playing in the street and the woman who is walking with them are going through a door.  At the end she stops and looks at the boys and they are so scared that their eyes are wet with tears.  I laughed out loud in that scene.  The film gets better in the end.  If you haven't seen this film, go and see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It has some of the best acting and most memorable scenes.    The soundtrack is great and reminds me of an old silent movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It took awhile for me to get into this movie but I came away impressed and glad to have seen it. I am an adult and I can relate to this movie in that my best friends mom died in the 9/11 terrorist attacks and my dad lost his best friend. They were both working and my friend's mom was the breadwinner in the family. She was so happy when they came home from work because it meant she didn't have to work anymore.   This movie was a great reminder of what life is all about. Family, love, friends and a family that is still strong no matter what the challenges are. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A brilliant, inventive, and exciting movie that captures the spirit of the '50s in a way that only a good mystery can. The mystery of the missing money is brilliantly constructed and never loses its sense of urgency.Â  The only weak point is the ending, which, though it's well-written, suffers from an unnecessarily rushed ending and a lame "happy ending" to a very complicated mystery.Â  But the movie will still keep you coming back, even after a while, for a good laugh and good thrills.Â  And the final shot will make you wonder "just what did we all do at that gas station in New Jersey?"    Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film I watched after seeing this movie, and it was the most important film in my life and my film-watching life.   I would recommend this movie to anyone.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would, but it does have one problem.   The characters are all very unlikable, which can be a little annoying.  The plot doesn't make much sense, the characters are boring and the writing is cliche at times.  There are some really bad acting moments.  Also there are too many scenes like when the mother and daughter are talking on the phone, and when the wife and son are in the kitchen, and the husband and son walking down the hall, and then the woman's father tells the mother he's coming home early, and at the end there are several different scenes in a row.  You can see the script changes by the time you get to the part you're interested in.  I didn't understand why the mother would go home early.  So when the husband calls her and she answers it doesn't really make any sense why she would go to the phone and answer it, but I guess it's what was expected of her.  What made the movie enjoyable were the interactions between the characters, and especially the acting.  But if you haven't seen many movies this bad, you should see them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the films of Jean-Luc Godard. I am a student of the French New Wave and had to watch all of the films on my "must-watch list" at the very first time. I was impressed at first with the way he made movies. But, for the most part, Godard made films for people who are not already interested in his work. The films he makes are very abstract in their imagery, very surreal. Godard does not try to use his movies as an "education", but simply make them for the audience he wanted to reach. If you like movies, you will love these. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. It's hilarious and the best.    There's not many other movies like this that are as clever.  The best part is that there's no nudity or sex in this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie!  It is definitely a good time with lots of laughs and a little bit of romance.  It was a good idea to have a man and woman get together, as we know how crazy people can get when they get together.   And the story was really good and you do get to see some scenes that are not in the original film.  The actress, who was great, did a great job.  I have seen a few other "girl" movies, but this one has more of a man.  A lot of scenes are in the bathroom, so you get a little of a peek.  Also, I was really surprised how many times the woman would kiss a man in the movie.  They both were really cute.  My only complaints are that I didn't know which part of the movie I would like best.  Another part I enjoyed was the kissing scene.  But, it is not the best kiss in the world!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie! I think it is the best movie of this era. I haven't seen a better movie! And it is such a different story. It is about a young man who finds love through a television. It's a different world back then, and he just falls in love with her. I think they are right in the middle of their twenties, but he is so young he didn't realize how mature she was. I really love this film! It's one of my all time favorites. I would definitely go back and see it over and over. This movie is about life and it's wonderful! I will definitely be watching this movie again! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is not what I expected, but I was more than satisfied with my choice. The movie had me very involved throughout. The acting was great, the story was very interesting, and the actors were all excellent. The editing was also excellent. I thought this film did not need to be cut to make a more PG-13 rating.   I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good mystery, or if you are a detective or want to try your hand at film making. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun ride.   As a child, I was captivated by the 1950s, and this is a nice addition to the genre.  It has lots of action, lots of laughs, and is well-paced.  I thought it was more than worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you haven't seen a movie like this yet, then I think you will enjoy this one. The storyline is very simple: a man is shot in the head on his wedding day. This causes his wife to go missing. Her husband and friends do everything they can to find her, but they are not successful.    I've always thought that the first act of this movie is pretty lame and it's very hard to care about any of the characters. This movie is like a movie of a woman who is not able to love anyone, so she takes revenge on her enemies by shooting them in the back. The twist is the guy who shoots her is actually her husband, so they end up marrying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The action packed story of 'Majestic Man' was told in the 1940's when the U.S. was developing atomic bombs. The film is set in Manhattan in the late 1940's and shows the early days of nuclear testing. A group of workers have been killed by a flying piece of radiation. They discover that a worker at the Atomic Testing site was killed by another worker who fell into a radioactive pit. The man who fell in the pit was wearing a yellow "majestic" jacket which would help him stay alive for about a year. The workers go to the police and the news media to figure out who did this. The director of the film was Robert Donaty and was able to create an interesting story with great characters. This was the first film to show the effects of the radioactive material that would be used in the bomb. In the movie, Robert Donoghue plays "the Atomic Man." The cast also includes: Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Gene Tierney, Frank Langella, and Charles Bronson. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good old fashioned adventure. The two girls are very pretty, but they are not the only girls in the movie, that would be interesting to see how the other girls would act. The story is very simple, it starts when the girl named Betty is kidnapped by the monster with her father, who is not able to find her, the monster has her father's car and is making it run off. The girl named Rose has just come to the area to visit her grandmother who is sick. She comes across a girl named Linda, who has lost her father.

This is just the beginning, there are some other little twists and turns, but the girls have to get out of the car before the monster destroys it.   Overall a very enjoyable movie with a great story and great acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" was originally planned as a TV series. A pilot was made in 1959 but it never was broadcast. However, a new version of the film was released in 1992. The film has a great plot and is the first of the Psycho series to be made in color.    I always thought of Alfred Hitchcock as the great American director but this movie is actually one of the greats.  The actors did a great job. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good sci-fi movie with an intriguing plot and a decent amount of character development.   I liked the way the film dealt with the problems it presents.  In a way, this movie is like watching a great science fiction novel, in that the characters never really get their own moment to shine and are all constantly being thrust into new situations.  For the most part, the script and the direction are really good, and I am sure the producers will get some nice royalties.  I enjoyed the story, as the movie has some nice ideas, and the main character, Robert, is an interesting anti-hero.  The production was top-notch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that this movie is excellent! It has a lot of things going on: historical, science, comedy, romance and the mystery of who stole the moon. I think this movie has everything I love and I really enjoyed watching this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that this was a fun little movie that, while not really "my type of film", was fun to watch. It has a lot of heart to it.Â    It is, as the title says, "a small comedy set in a small town." It's an amusing film, with great lines, and a good cast. The acting is pretty good.Â  The music is wonderful as well, although I don't think it was very important, since it doesn't really add anything to the film, but it was fun anyway.Â  This is definitely worth watching, just for a laugh, and as a nice "home movie."Â  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie that does what the title says:  I'm sure most of you have seen it, but if you don't, it's worth a watch.  As with so many great movies, the story has its roots in an actual historical event:  It's a short movie, but the story is so good and so well put together, it can't help but stand out.  It really is like the movie was made to be seen as a silent film, and it's still very much a film made with a camera.   The story, written and directed by the great John Huston, is a classic.  The characters are so well drawn, and the actors are terrific (especially Cary Grant).  It has a very believable plot, and is a truly moving movie.  There are also a number of great set pieces that are still pretty fresh in my mind.  I really enjoy seeing the great movie that was so much better than it's box office might indicate, and I love the way the story was developed for that one year after the war ended.  " The Great Train Robbery " is a movie that I'll be watching time and time again.  Highly recommended!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember this film being shown on TV when I was very young. It was a popular show of the day.   It was based on a story by the great H. G. Wells. Wells, a very brilliant man, was a real charmer.  There is something very enchanting about the way he tells the story.  It's one of the few films that have left an impression on me that I can still recall.  I loved it when I saw it in the late 70's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was really good. I don't know why its so popular and not much more like in the 80s. I have never seen a bad version of this movie but i just loved it! The music is a perfect sound track that perfectly suits the mood and the whole film. A movie like this should be seen by everyone. This is a movie that you will not want to miss out on if you ever find a copy of it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had a friend who was going to the theater the other day and she told me to go to it because "it's an old movie". I never really got a chance to see it. It was a film from the 80s, and that was before the great "dancing" style movie stars came on to make big bucks with their dancing style. You had to like dancing to love this movie! It was so fun to watch! My wife loved this movie too. She says it's the best movie she's seen in a while. It got good reviews all the time and it's one of the few movies that I watch with my kids.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember being a teenager and watching a great little gem called The Night Stalker, starring Robert Mitchum. I wasn't really into the movie and had seen many other classics, but I felt this one really captured the fear and suspense of the time. A little girl gets lost and is found by a man. They meet in a deserted car and she's just told to go home. But, he insists that she go back to where he found her. Now, he doesn't tell her why or what's wrong with her. The whole movie was a nightmare and I always feel bad when I watch it for one reason or another.   This is one of those scary movies that really does scare the pants off of you.  It really hits all the right notes of being a horror film.  The acting is phenomenal. The scenes with the little girl are very chilling and the acting is pretty good as well.  Robert Mitchox is great, but there are a few times in the movie when the film slows down and he seems a little off.Â    And the acting just makes you want to see more of this movie.  There's no music in the background so you have to be able to see the picture. It's almost as if a light had been put in the middle of the picture and it was dimmed, just barely enough to be noticed, but so dark that you have no idea where the camera is pointing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. A good, old fashioned old-time Western film.   The acting is top notch.  The music is just awesome.  Very well acted and directed.  I like the opening and closing scenes a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pretty funny and a good tribute to the 1970's. There are some very funny and smart lines in the movie.  I also liked the whole song part where all of the kids sing in the back yard. It was pretty entertaining to hear them all sing together.  The kids were all so well put together, that it was almost as if they were all a team.    Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director made a great movie with the script and the acting.   For me it was not a big enough story to have a trilogy or a mini-series and the end of the film was a little bit unsatisfying. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has made a great impression on me since I was a child. I have a brother who has one too. My mom and I always thought that it was fun. It has a good family feel to it.    My uncle did this movie for money. He didn't realize how good he had it. I was the only one that he hired for the movie. I did some of the stunts too. We had a whole set and an empty stage. The only problem was that the camera man did not know what to do. He kept running over to the other side of the set. So my uncle would have to call over an assistant to help. It took us over a month to do it. There was some great stunts done and the people in it were all really nice.  This is a good old style B movie from the 80s. The story is about the life of a circus freak named Bob Spano. I love all of the old horror movies. This was one of my favorites. It is a must see for all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie does a wonderful job at telling the story of a young boy and his parents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's one of the better films of the 90s. If you have not seen this film I would recommend it as a great movie to check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, it is well made. The story is excellent and the performances are excellent. The only downside is that the director did not finish his film. It is too short and I am too embarrassed to ask why. I think the director should try to finish his own film to prove that it is worth it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never seen the movie so I had no idea what to expect. It looked like a horror film. However, the scares were very well done. I really liked the makeup and wardrobe and the lighting on the camera crew. The action was fast, but not overly so. I liked the fact that the film took place during the week, which I feel is necessary. I would have loved to see more of the film after it was completed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director is good, the actors are fine, the soundtrack is fine, and the animation is very very fine.   There is not a lot of special effects here, but it's not the main thing, and I think it works in this movie.  The only bad thing about this movie is that the plot is very weak and doesn't really get going until much later on, but that's not really the movie's fault, it's more of the director's.  It also really sucks that they didn't go and put some new blood into it and give it some decent actors in there, but again, that's just the director failing.  If they gave it more time and gave more of a focus to some of the characters, I think the movie would have been much better.  I'm a bit upset that this movie didn't make it into more theatres.  But for its time, it was pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent film about a man who is being hunted by a secret government organization. He is not at all sure how to deal with this situation. His first action is to set himself up on the roof of a highrise with a sniper's rifle and a couple of bullets in his back. He does not know where the shots came from, and even if he did he would not be able to identify the shooter. He decides to sleep in his hotel room for a while and will be sure to return to the roof some time. The next day he returns to the highrise to check on the sniper's position, and he sees that the sniper is dead. When the man gets to the hotel, he finds out that his body has been taken to the morgue. He takes one last look at his wife and family and goes off.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never heard of the classic horror movie The Omen before. It was my first movie. I really enjoyed it and have been a fan of the franchise ever since. The acting is wonderful. The movie was shot in black and white with the original sound. If you haven't seen it you should. If not, this is the movie for you. It's a good thriller, and you can get lost in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been waiting years for this movie.  Â I saw it on television a few times and finally saw the film. Â The actors were good but I'm afraid I had the same reaction as the viewer, I was in love. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had just seen this film a couple of days before. I remember hearing of it and thinking that it had the potential to be really good. What I remember most about it was that I thought there were a couple good scenes in it. I am so glad that I gave it a chance.  Â I really enjoyed it and I was glad that a couple friends of mine and I came together to see it. It was a nice change of pace from the typical action movie that we normally see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The cast is fantastic and the film is well-written and enjoyable.   This is a nice romantic drama about an elderly woman who has lost her husband and son to a plague.  Her son is only 7 and his mother is in her 80's.  Despite his youth she seems to be a very good mother who does her best to support him, but he's very young and has many things to learn about the world around him. Â The story is very well done and well acted.  The story about the plague is quite well developed and believable and the death scenes are really well done.  It is a bit sad but never quite dark and depressing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is fantastic. The film has some serious flaws, but those flaws aren't in the film. They are in the acting, script, and music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never been a big action movie fan (well, not until last summer when I saw The Expendables III ) so this was a really nice surprise. The action scenes were really cool. I especially enjoyed the fight scenes in the subway.   What kind of action movie gets me to start laughing after seeing the opening credits?   The movie is really about the relationship between the protagonist, an alcoholic cop with a heart of gold who has a daughter he doesn't love, and the mother who is trying to find the father for her kid. I never thought of this before, but it really does make the movie work.  I know this will sound silly, but I really enjoyed this movie.

As it says in the title, the main characters are an elderly couple from a town in the countryside. While they live in the middle of nowhere, they are surrounded by beauty. There is no better way to describe it.  This film is beautiful, haunting and a wonderful reminder of the beauty of nature.  I loved this movie!   The cast was wonderful.  The beautiful lighting and scenery was so beautiful.  We were always in awe as we looked at the stars or watched a sunset.  I would recommend this film to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very enjoyable movie from a classic director.   Director John Milius was never really a fan of action flicks, but he has done some solid work in this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only negative that I can give about this movie is that I believe it was a little too "fairy-tale" in nature. This movie is not a Disney movie but more of a "giant magic trick." There are certain things that happen in this movie that are very unusual. I believe the actors were given certain things to do, but in a way that no one could predict what was going to happen and the film ends in a very strange way.

Mildly scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great film from a director who has done some fantastic genre films.   The film is a dark satire of a war.  The war itself is not as well researched as it could have been, but this was clearly a serious and serious film. The cast is great.  It's hard to figure out where they came from.  This film is about a group of people who go into the forest in a plane.  In the woods, they are joined by a soldier from the Korean War.  When the group goes through the forest, they find some old bodies, and are confronted by a strange monster.  They find out that the monster is really a Nazi officer in the forest.  There is an explanation for the Nazi officer, but he's not a very interesting one.  I don't really think that the film is as good as the movie looks, but it's still fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The great thing about this movie was the characters were so much better in this one than in the other.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of horror and the old school slasher flicks and this movie fits right in to that category.   This was one of those movies that I couldn't look away from, especially when the film ended on an incredible cliff hanger.  The action was great and the gore was awesome.  For an older movie it was still fun and entertaining, as well as creepy and eerie.  If you want a good old school spooky movie check this out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's about a man who gets in a car accident while on vacation and is taken to a hospital, where he's treated. He's left alone, and while he's there the doctors tell him he can't have a stroke, they can't give him a blood transfusion, and they can only put him on a life-support machine. They tell him that he can only stay on the machine as long as he dies, and that if he doesn't he will die.  It is a beautiful movie, a masterpiece, but there are things I think could have been more developed, but it still is a very moving story, and you have to be a sucker to love that ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen the movie until a friend of mine told me about it and I figured it'd be kind of interesting. I'm not a fan of SciFi films and most of the films I saw were just boring, so this movie was a fun change of pace. The movie had a great cast and the acting was fantastic. I have to admit that there were a few times where I was wondering what the point of the movie was. It was a little difficult to figure out why they weren't shooting at a ship, just because of the background of the ocean. But I enjoyed the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great, original, witty, and witty movie. I thought it was very entertaining and I laughed so much. The actor was awesome and had that kind of charm that a good actor has. My favorite scene was when the dog got his foot caught in a rat trap. He thought it might be fun to play around with the rat trap, so he pulled the whole thing with the dog. He really was a natural actor. The dog was a good addition to the movie and it made it a better movie.    If you are in need of a good comedy movie, then you can't go wrong with this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the same style as the previous ones, this was a fun and colorful watch. It's also kind of a remake of the TV movie "In the City" (not to be confused with the movie "Titanic" or the TV series "Naked City") with one major change: in the original, the cops are so stupid that it's hilarious. While this was funny, it's much funnier to have some of the cops acting stupid. Also, the special effects are better here than in the movie. This was a lot of fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best movie of the year and my favorite film of the decade, from the moment it begins, to the scene where the protagonist goes out for an early lunch at a local Italian place and sees a woman in the parking lot smoking a cigarette and eating a steak, to that night he discovers what a big jerk he is, to watching the whole film again and again, to finally the end, when the character is finally able to have a happy life after he has done what he has been waiting years for.   I would suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys the genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There was a certain charm in this film that I didn't notice until I read up on this movie and I found myself thinking about it frequently throughout the year. I was initially turned off by the very slow pace of the movie and thought it didn't have enough of a story. The film doesn't really provide any direction or even character development. It's pretty much just exposition on the way the heroes get to the location where all of the events occur. It just seems like the film is going to ramble on and on for a while before the climax.   The story is also a bit of a bore as we follow the heroes on their travels to the very same destination. There is nothing interesting about their journey except for what they want to do.  After some time watching the film it does become interesting as the characters are all in different situations and some are more interested in pursuing the film's plot than doing the thing they came to do to.  A lot of the scenes are incredibly boring as the plot doesn't actually seem to be working and the story feels really out of place.  However, the film does have its moments where the characters do develop and the action really does look good, the performances are great, and the cinematography is really good.  This is an easy watch and is certainly worth the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was a lot of fun, the writing was great, and the actors and actresses played their parts perfectly. My only complaint about it was that I got a bad feeling about it from the beginning. My friend and I both loved it, but he got a very strong stomach illness from it. I am going to have to watch it a couple more times before I actually see if it really is all bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "This is a great film. It takes an idea (the idea of the human mind) and uses it brilliantly. I'm glad that I found this movie and I recommend it to anybody who wants a good film to watch. Highly recommend it. It may be difficult to understand the movie at first but once you figure it out, it's a fantastic flick. The cinematography is brilliant." - from movie poster 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the movie I saw last summer. A lot of people are complaining about how dated it looks, but I didn't find any. The story is still good. The acting is great.   I enjoyed this movie. It's fun to see a different side of a movie I usually don't get to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a family of 3 people and how the mother is a schizophrenic and so is the father. We see how they live and how they make a living. The acting is good and the family is so lovable. If you're looking for a good mental illness movie this is it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just came home from the theater, where I had been enjoying a wonderful, well written, but rather simple story. A wonderful cast. I am so sorry, but this is not a movie to be shown at your home. The acting is not good. If you have a small apartment, and a small television, you will be surprised at the acting.   This is not the kind of movie I would show to a group of friends or on public TV. The plot is very simple.  It doesn't get much deeper than that, but it's worth seeing it to see the actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this because it seemed to be a well made movie, with a decent cast. The movie has some nice scenes in it, and it did a good job of showing how life can go sideways so fast. The way it was done though, was so cheesy and lame that I had a hard time believing this movie was actually good. I am glad I watched it when I did, because I think that I would have lost interest if I watched another movie in the same vein.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a masterpiece. It has a unique tone, a beautiful soundtrack and a well-known character.   The film's ending has some disturbing moments, which may be due to a lack of a good ending to be told in the next sequel. But the film is worth seeing for the first half, and the entire plot is intriguing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is definitely worth watching the full version of this movie. The story in this movie is very well written, so if you've never seen an old movie before, this is a great one to learn from.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is not easy to have a good idea for a movie. I have been making movies since high school. But, I've never been a director and I've had a bad idea for movies. I was about to make this one a few months ago but decided not to because it was so wrong and stupid. But my wife and I watched it and we laughed and we were all so shocked when it started to make sense and then it really did make sense.   And that was the funny part. That's where I get off.  I like movies that are different. That you can't believe they are made the way they are.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is an amazing film. It was just the right time for Sergio Leone to do something that didn't require a huge budget or special effects, and this is his best work to date. The best parts are when the bad guys are having a bad time, and the best part of the film is when one man fights them off and is able to take them out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. It was a nice change of pace.   What drew me to this movie was the ending.  The ending was really creepy.  I didn't enjoy it as much as others did, but it was still fun. Â The movie had a very different vibe from the rest of the series.  Â  You have a few different themes running through the movie.  It's sort of like a mix between the original series and the "dark" anime.  If you watch this movie, you will get the point.  You may not like it, but you will at least be interested.  This movie had really good acting, and really creepy stuff. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am in awe of the amazing effects that the filmmakers put on this film. When you see the film for the first time, you have to see it with your own two eyes. This is one of those movies that takes you to another place. The film captures the world perfectly and you feel like you are actually there. There are other films with incredible action but none can compare to this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really glad to find out this movie is out of print. It's one of those rare "good" horror movies and it does a wonderful job of portraying a horror movie with a realistic take on it. The acting is pretty solid and it's a fun watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie, and I liked it well. The story was interesting. It was fun, but the plot is not a great one. It just kind of happens, and you're not really sure why. That's not bad, by any means. However, the ending was a bit of a let down. The characters are very well done, but there wasn't much emotional depth to them, not that I expected any. The plot was interesting, but it didn't do it for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen a lot of movies that made me want to die.Â  Some, I just felt like I was watching a horror film, some were scary but nothing really grabbed me.  But, The Wicker Man was the first movie I really found to be scary in a movie I've ever watched.  I'll say this, I didn't see it at a specific time, but I saw it a while ago and it has stayed with me ever since.   In a movie so perfect for kids and adults, there are no jump scares or blood.  There is a very dark atmosphere that seems to grow as you watch it and the kids, in my opinion, got it the most.  They made the movie seem real and I loved how they kept this movie for children even though it was scary for them.  After the first few scenes you would think the kids had seen a horror movie, but as it goes on the fear and paranoia grow in the adults and as the movie progresses you get more and more of a creeped out feeling.  If you like horror, I can't recommend this movie enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a real great script and it is a great plot with a good storyline. The acting was great and very good all around. The story was easy to follow and made me think.    I really enjoyed this movie, it has a unique plot and a great cast.  My only disappointment about this movie is that it ends so abruptly, but I understand why it did that.  It was so good that I really wanted to see the whole film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very funny and charming movie about a guy with a real problem.   When you see this movie you will think "I wonder how he got that job..."

I saw this movie at the cinema the other day and it made me laugh out loud, and I never even saw the movie the first time around.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film at the first-ever BFI London Film Festival and I was completely blown away. The film is filled with rich colour and strong performances.Â  I really enjoyed it as the film explores the darker side of human relationships and brings a whole new perspective on the subject. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a film that has a touch of darkness to it, but still retains a sense of humour.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm so glad I found this movie - it's a really good horror movie. This is a great example of a good old horror movie that just doesn't get enough love, so it's nice to see one that can stand on its own and scare the pants off of you without it being a knock-off. The ending is creepy and it's great to see this movie being such an influence on later horror films.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would have never thought I would love a movie that much.   This movie has some beautiful scenes.  It has something for everyone.  What I loved about this movie is it has a good mix of drama, action, love and action.  I loved it when the love story was at its best.  The main male was awesome.  At one point we see him sitting in a bar getting drinks for himself.  Then, while walking with his girlfriend, they bump into a guy.  He is the most annoying guy ever.  This guy was so annoying that he was hard to forget.  They do get married at the end and they get their happy endings.  Just a great movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the perfect blend of comedy, suspense, action, and romance.   This film is so well done that it feels like the producers had seen a lot of classic action movies, and put together a well-crafted film.  It is also a terrific action movie.  I wish I would have seen this film at the theater.  The cast is excellent, and it is hard to think of another action movie like this.  For my money, it has to be on the top tier of action movies.  - June 7, 2006A great action film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is like some cheesy Disney version of Lord of the Rings. It has the same charm that the Lord of a Rings trilogy had, but the style and the acting are a lot better. The story is great and the visuals are spectacular, but it doesn't feel like a classic. I did enjoy the movie, but would not recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What can I say about this film? It has its own story, but it is very fun and has a great cast of characters.   "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" was written by the writer of the movie "Up" who wrote many films in the 80's and 90's, such as "The Man Who Wasn't There" and "Knots Untie."   This is definitely one of the better films to come out of that period of time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in science fiction or aliens.   If you're looking for an alien movie, you might not like it. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to take it seriously. However, this movie is not about aliens. It's about the development of technology. As an alien story, it's good.  I would have given this movie 5 stars if the aliens weren't such a joke.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing that comes to mind when I hear "Gone Girl" is "What a great premise." It really is. The book is a perfect example of an obsession, of course, but one that is kept afloat by great performances, excellent writing, and good direction. This movie is not far behind.   "Goner" is a story of a woman who goes missing and her obsessive-compulsive brother. The movie is about the two of them and how they navigate their relationship in the face of the disappearance. It is a great film in its own right, but this is a movie I feel you should watch the book for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a serious problem with this movie. But for the price it's not worth it. When i saw it on the movie channel i wasn't sure about it but my family liked it and loved it. This was a very funny movie, it was so funny and we thought we could hear the laughter coming out of the speakers. But it didn't happen. I'm glad we saw this. It wasn't the same old old story with the same people. It was a funny movie with the right people and it was a little different and a little strange. It's so sad that the movie was a flop. It should have been a hit, but it didn''t get the publicity it deserved. I don't want to see it ever again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a movie that has all kinds of qualities to it: a romance, action, comedy, drama, drama and more drama. It is not a movie to just sit down and watch. In all honesty, this movie has everything that you would want in a movie. I have seen this movie multiple times and it never ceases to entertain me. It always manages to be one of those movies where you want to see more of it. You get so much out of it that you never want it to end. If you want a great movie that you can sit down with and watch over and over, look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason I don't watch movies like these much is because I'm just too old for such childish garbage. This is not even in the "grown-up" category. I don' t think anyone should watch this movie if they're too young to be able to enjoy it.   I've never been into the "darkly humorous" subgenre. I've enjoyed a few of the "hard" comedies, but never a "dark comedy."   This film is filled with so many ridiculous and nonsensical scenes and dialogue. The dialogue is so bad that it just doesn't even register as being funny.  I thought it was the voice actor that was doing the terrible impression. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie a lot. It has the typical action-packed story that everyone knows and enjoys, but it has a twist. A character who is a big bad is actually the good guy! I thought it was a great twist. The movie was really great, and I especially liked the use of music. The soundtrack is really beautiful! The actors were excellent. And the movie even had a great ending! This movie really has everything you want in a movie: action, romance, action, action...etc. It was worth watching and I highly recommend it to all the fans of action movies. - April 5, 2004Awesome
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A must watch movie for all ages. A great movie for kids. A classic.

I love the film and it is the best way to end my childhood.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so different than I was expecting it to be. I really liked it, but it's quite similar to the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.   I was glad to see that this film had a very low budget.  There were a lot of great actors in this film, and the plot was easy to follow.  It was good for a laugh and good for watching with a cup of coffee, but I would have liked to see a bit more action, and maybe a little more sex.  I hope that we get a sequel to this film some day, as it is the only film I have seen with so many great actors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a must see film. It's a real "What if".

He ends up going around killing everyone who has hurt him and the end result is that he ends up on the receiving end of a lot of bullets. The film is very violent and shows the danger of people who are not very careful when dealing with guns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge fan of George Miller and this is a perfect example of what makes him so great. The movie itself is very simple but it tells a very powerful story about a group of people who are fighting a war, but in reality there is a group going through some kind of mental instability. The people of this "battle group" aren't always right and sometimes they lose their minds in their battle against a great evil but in the end the good won out. Miller is an incredible director and his characters have some incredible moments of comedy and drama. I really enjoyed this movie and am glad to see a new series by him.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie a long time ago and it still holds up to the standards that we expect from a Hollywood studio film.   This movie is a good film about a hard working family and how they care about one another and are willing to do anything to make a living.  This is one of the most honest and realistic films you will see in your lifetime.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good story about a family trying to make it out of the small town they live in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this a few times now and it has become one of my favorites. The story follows a young man named John who is given a magic crystal by a girl who is the reincarnation of an ancient sorcerer. After using it for some time, he gets his mind completely messed up. He doesn't know who he is, he doesn't feel the pain of a real injury, or the feelings of being hurt, he can't even remember his own name, but somehow he finds himself in the middle of a fight between two groups of people. The fight ends up in the worst way possible and the man becomes known as John the Man-Eating Man. I can say that it's an amazing film and has always stayed with me even years after it was made.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was amazing!  The story line was very interesting.  I loved the way that the two main characters had a falling out that led them both into the same position of needing to go on the run.  The character that I thought was the most interesting was the old lady that they all tried to out run. She was interesting. I liked the way she handled things and was a perfect character for the story line.   The director and the actors did an excellent job portraying the different characters and how the main characters handled things. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Crazy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know if I can call this a movie because there is a great deal of action, and there is also a great variety of scenes which really shows the range of characters' personalities.   The acting is all right. There are some good ones here and there, but the best performances are those of the actors, the writers, and the cameramen.  For example, Bill Paxton and Richard Chamberlain play the same character, but Paxton is way more likeable.  As for the story, it is not bad, but it's not the best.  The movie starts with an incredible scene where a plane crashes in the middle of a corn field.  There are then lots of other scenes like this, but each time they are a little better and more interesting.  A great deal is given to the use of special effects (the crash, the explosion, etc.), but there are no closeups of the crash or the explosions and there are only a few closeups and long shots of the planes.  When this movie was made, we had only one plane to use, the American F9F Panther.  It is an old plane, and it is only in use today for training.  What makes this movie a little more interesting is that the action is not over the tops of the airplanes, but around the airplanes.  Also, it shows the action from many different perspectives.  I have never seen a movie where so many planes are used in such a variety of action sequences.  So, although it is an older movie, it's a great movie and if you want a good airplane movie, this is it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie.   John McTiernan's direction was perfect.  And the actors were superb.  A great love story that was never predictable.  There's also a fantastic scene where the two lovers kiss and it's just great to watch them kiss.  This is a great film and a great movie, a great romance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, the film is excellent. It really has a great deal of emotion and meaning to it.   The film is set in a small town, and the film deals with a couple of characters that, at first, seem to be very typical of that town.  They are all working at the same store, they are all looking to have a baby, and they are very close friends.  Then the movie takes off from there.  At first, the town seems to be a very nice and peaceful place, but soon you begin to realize that there is a darker and darker side of things, which is made even more obvious when the film progresses further and further into the story.  The cast is great, and it really shows how great a job they did in making sure the film has a very strong sense of place and atmosphere.  There is a really good scene at the end of the film in which the characters spend some time alone, and their conversation is quite touching.  I would recommend this film, but I would be hard pressed to ever watch it again.  If you love films that deal with such a small setting, and people, and relationships, I would say this is one of the best films you could ever watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen all of the movies this one has been adapted from, but I had to see it. I knew it was good, so I decided to see if this was as good. The story was not as good as the original (which was probably the most important part of the movie) and the acting was poor (they were trying so hard to be likable and serious, but never hit the mark), but the acting is really strong in this one, and the action was quite enjoyable. The only thing that was not enjoyable was when the police got into the casino and shot everyone, but that happened too late in the movie to matter.   Overall, a pretty good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When it comes to Hollywood, no movie is a sure thing, and no film is a total failure. So, with that in mind, I would say that there are some positives to be had in this film. The film follows a man (Michael Douglas) who returns to his small California hometown after 30 years of living abroad. Unfortunately, his home has been damaged in a fire, and he is forced to rebuild his house by himself. The fire is a perfect set up for a man who needs help. The plot takes on a twist in a fairly natural way, but the movie really does an excellent job of developing the character. A great cast of actors (especially Robert Duvall and Ben Johnson) bring a ton of depth to the story, and Michael Douglas gives a very believable performance that is believable from start to finish.   The film has some fun scenes and great action scenes, but it is ultimately a very boring movie. There isn't anything new about the story. I found myself bored and frustrated throughout the movie, and I was just hoping for something interesting to happen.  This movie definitely deserves a higher rating than a 4/10, because I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I would definitely recommend that people steer clear of this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was in high school, I saw this movie at the theatre. It was the first time that I saw a movie with an original plot, as well as being a film about people who don't go to the gym. I wasn't in the mood to get in shape, so I didn't go that day. So when the movie ended, I had been interested in the story for a while, but I really hadn't had a chance to give it a good look.   In my opinion, this was the best of the "pump-up" movies. There were some scenes that were quite exciting and I enjoyed them, but other scenes were much more boring.  I think that the movie was pretty successful in getting you interested, especially in the first half.  Â   I can't recommend this movie to anyone.  The scene when a movie's star tells everyone to shut up and take the show seriously.  While there were some great action scenes in this movie, the scenes with the characters talking about themselves were also rather annoying.  They don't do anything in their movies but complain about their lives.  You could tell that the actor was just trying to get the audience to be interested in what was going on, and this movie didn't do it for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "F" was dropped from "Famous". I loved it and I am still laughing about it. There was so much comedy, action and suspense it was unbelievable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what would have made it even better? Adding a bit more humor.   This movie is really quite good.  The acting is really great.  It's a bit slow and sometimes you think "oh, that's just how he does it." But he really has a good sense of how to pull off the whole thing.  There are a lot of things to enjoy here, for example the music. The music that the musicians were hired to record on this movie was really good. This movie does look pretty old, but not by much.  Another plus.  I liked the ending.

The story is really interesting too, how many people are on the road with the same name as their real driver and how that can sometimes be a problem.   I'm going to buy this one again just so that I can see what the original actors look like!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been looking for a good black and white film to watch with my son. This one does the job. Very good production value with interesting and engaging characters. And the music is great! It reminded me of the old silent films. A fun film with a great cast.    A great movie for younger kids. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first two acts are quite the journey for this film, it seems as though the audience was more of an after thought. This is one of those films that needs to be seen and thought about before you make up your mind as to what it is all about.   A brilliant piece of work with a good balance of science fiction, horror, adventure, and even romance.  It really is something you cannot go past, it is definitely worth the time and effort.  A great film and a must see for fans of the genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of times, movie watchers look for the next big blockbuster film. This film, however, is the more intimate, personal story of a man who comes to America to escape the pressures of life in his home country. The main plot is about his relationship with his wife and daughter. However, it is not the emotional drama that the film may lead you to believe. It is a much more emotional and realistic story.   I enjoyed this film immensely. The performances are very good and very real. The ending is very moving. I recommend this film to all who are looking for a film about a man's journey to find peace in a place that can be very overwhelming. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only bad thing about this movie is it's length. If it were shortened by 1 hour to a less than half an hour or 2 an excellent movie would be born.   I am in my early 50's and have seen many a long and beautiful movie with much more substance and plot, but in my opinion this is one of the finest I have seen.  I have only watched this a couple of times and that's why it doesn't get the perfect 5 stars, but I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.  A very enjoyable movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie so much I bought it on video at a local video store. It is so fun and the action scenes are really cool. The only bad thing I found about it was that it was all in Japanese. But the whole movie is worth watching. It may be one of the only Japanese movies you'll ever see!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movie I've seen in a long time, and the second-best movie I have ever seen. It is just the right balance between the seriousness and comedy, and does a nice job at both.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not sure of my impression of this movie. I have been following this franchise for years and have seen the other two movies. I was really impressed by this movie, I would have to say that I was never bored in this movie as it kept me guessing the entire time and left me wanting more. The movie was really scary, and not just at the beginning, but throughout the whole movie. The music was amazing. I love that it is not a theme park ride, so it can still scare you and really give you a good scare. I recommend watching this movie with a flashlight, it makes it even scarier.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "A good old movie that is worth a watch, just to see what it looks like over a century later...I had forgotten how good an actor Richard Widmark looked, in that movie he looked like the man from the Lord of the Rings.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie very much, it was well acted and the story was interesting, especially since the main character is a very down-to-earth young man who has very few friends, yet seems to have lots of friends, the girl that he is interested in is so beautiful and he is completely attracted to her. The story is a simple one, the main characters lives on his grandmother's farm and works hard at fixing and making the farm better for his grandparents, but then their farm has a fire and they lose everything including their horses and the main farmer loses his job. The movie was told with great humor and the acting and camera work were good. I found myself laughing quite a bit when they were talking about the horses in the background.   Overall this is an enjoyable movie, I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially if you like a romantic movie with lots of laughs.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, the film was fantastic. The acting was excellent, as they portrayed each of the major players. The writing was really well done and kept the plot going nicely. There were some funny parts as well, which made it that much more enjoyable. I liked the ending as well. I enjoyed it, because it did a good job of showing just how much this movie was important to both sides. The music was also well done, and the special effects were quite impressive. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves good movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie, I was a fan of 'Papillon', 'The Exorcist', 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'Battlestar Galactica'. I was disappointed that no one had made a film like this before, and this was a welcome surprise. It was a good enough film, but I can't say it was really something I had heard about. It didn't seem so out there, but then I guess we shouldn't expect too much from a horror film.   Â It's a great way to spend a week or two and make sure that you haven't forgotten about that little girl in that car.  It's funny that I was very interested in 'Rosey's' family, but it wasn't until I read the Wikipedia page that I found out it was a fairly recent film, and was made in the '70's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've loved this movie since it came out. It's my go to comedy movie.   It's the funniest one I've seen.  The acting was great.  It was hilarious.  A great way to end the summer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie, a real treat for me. It is not what you think, it is what you see. The actors all have really great performances and some good humor. The story is very realistic, although it doesn't come with a lot of blood or gore, but the people have the right idea. The special effects are great and they have a little fun with it at times.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is what happens when you cast a well known actress as a character that is supposed to be in love with a younger man. It's actually pretty funny because it's pretty realistic. It has a really nice ensemble cast and the film never feels like it is too long.   A good romance with a good acting and a good script.  A little slow but if you can handle that, this is a fun watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching this film for the first time at a friend's house in December 2014. He is an adult with a very mature sense of humor. He told me that he watched the original trilogy as a child and that he loved them. He said it was "wonderful" that it was made by Star Wars director George Lucas. I asked him what he thought of this film. He thought it was a "little disappointing". I guess he knows what a lot of Star Wars fans have been saying about this movie. I thought this was a decent film that didn't try to compete with the original. I would recommend this to Star Wars die-hards who loved it as a kid.

I enjoyed it. The story is great and the performances are great. The actors did the best they could with what they had.  If I'm ever in the mood for some good horror, I'll probably have to go back and see this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great, and I loved it. It's about an American who meets a Spanish woman who is working in London. He learns that her name is "VÃ­ctor".   It's a very romantic movie, and it was my first time seeing that.  Â And the movie is very well done!   The only thing that bugged me is that I wanted to see more of VÃ­ctor. She was in England for two years, but he only saw her once.  It was really sad that she left him to go back to Spain, but it is still sad that he left her so early. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a great movie, a classic. It was the first movie in which I was a teenager, and I will always have a special place in my heart for it.   The movie had a nice retro feel, and that's a great way to tell that it was made for old men.  I loved all the characters, and even though it was in black and white, I still have the feeling of the old films in my mind.  The story was simple and easy to follow, but I still enjoyed it. It didn't have much suspense, and the characters weren't particularly deep.  Although I'm a big fan of the style, the acting was a little amateurish.  It's a good flick and a great tribute to the films that came before it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is about a guy who lives on the edge of the world. He works in an office on a huge building that can only be seen from the outside because of the fire escapes in the windows. He is an artist and he makes a lot of money on his art. He loves it so much that he goes back to the building once a year and takes over one of the small offices to be his own private museum. The man is very clever, he gets the perfect view of the city from his window and he is never bothered. The only problems he gets are from the city council. The movie depicts a city that was built in the 1920's and has grown up a bit but still has it's rough edges.   I liked this movie a lot. It was a fast paced movie and I found it to be a really good watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is really great. I love watching action and movies with good action. My favorite one is the first movie of the series "The Black Hole". The second movie "Black Hole II" is even better.    If you are a huge action fan, it will be great.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The film shows what happens when someone has to defend their son from bullies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought it was a very good movie. The ending, although a bit anticlimactic, gave me some satisfaction.   It's a very serious movie, but you should not expect much from it. It's good for a laugh, and as an extra I found it very interesting to see how the characters feel about each other, and what they really think of the film that made them famous. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this when I was in my early teens, back in the 70s. It was the first time I saw a movie with a woman. It's about a girl, a pretty blonde girl, who meets a guy and thinks she's a guy, but then the movie changes the guy to a woman, and they find out the truth. So they fight to make things right, and after a while they find it out, which made me a very happy kid.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't have much interest in "The Exorcist" when I watched it in high school because I thought it was kind of a silly movie. But, this was my first real exposure to the subject, and, while I was not the biggest fan of the book or the movie, it certainly has its moments. As far as I am concerned, this is the best of the series.   (1941, Dir. Sam Peckinpah)  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I watched is a short, but extremely good one. There is not much to say about it. The plot is simple. A man and a woman try to sell their house but are turned down by the sellers. The man buys a house from a real estate broker who has an excellent background in real estate and is the son of a wealthy person. The story of this movie is about the real estate salesman who is the one that was turned down. When it was time to move, the realtor went to the house and found out the seller was no longer there. He was able to convince his father to sell it to him. The realtor has a lot of money at the beginning and he is very hard on the seller, but later he tries to help him get out of this situation. The reason why I watched this movie was because I really like these two characters. I liked that they did not just go with the typical guy and girl story. They had a really interesting dynamic between them. This kind of movie is perfect for a romantic comedy, but if you are not in for that kind of thing then this will probably not appeal to you.    I really enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "When I was a child, the movie that best explained my feelings toward the world was "Rear Window." I remember I would sit on the front steps of my family's house in Los Angeles and look through the crack into my neighbor's living room. I saw the same faces over and over as I ran to catch a bus to school. The scene always stayed with me: the father on the porch, the children running back and forth, a man standing on the sidewalk, smoking a cigar. The movie had a great ending: the man looked up at the street and said "Good day, Mr. Caruthers," and disappeared. I can still picture that moment. Now I see the same scene in my mind's eye: the smoke clears and I see Mr. C and his daughter, my Aunt Maude." -

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a gem.   It is a true story about a man (Robert Mitchum) who goes to Vietnam and is told that he is the only black guy in the squad.  When he is with his unit and on the move the other white soldiers are constantly taunting him. When they realize that he sees them, the "good" white soldiers (they are not nice) decide that he should be killed so they can be the only one.  Mitchum has to deal with the white man's threats on his life, as well as the men from his unit who are constantly trying to get him killed.  A true movie, full of tension and horror. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great! It has a very mysterious feeling and is very well-made. I can not recommend this movie as it is worth a watch. It is based on a true story about a group of people who were thrown into a mental hospital. They came from an old country, where people with mental health problems were a rarity and they were sometimes even forgotten or hidden away by the government. This is the story of a group that came to California, hoping to start a new life. They soon became an endangered species in a mental institution. The way the story is told, I feel this is true. I like this movie. I know it might be a little scary for some, but it is well worth a look. I would definitely recommend this to people who have ever felt depressed or are dealing with anxiety problems.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It is very much in that "sad movies that everyone should see" vein, and it really does tell a sad story. The acting is good, and a lot of heart.   The scenes where it is raining and the water is flowing over people's faces is a very good idea.  As for the "fun" part of the movie, the swimming is quite boring, and the people are either drunk or on drugs. This movie is definitely not worth the price of admission. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I heard that David Lynch wanted to do a horror movie with me, I was pretty excited. He is a master at doing so and did an amazing job in the movie.  The whole film, from beginning to end, was eerie, scary, and thought provoking.   The actors were great and they had great chemistry.  I had a blast watching the film and was amazed at all the different things that happened to the characters.  It is the best horror movie I have ever seen and that is saying a lot.  Highly recommend this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie that I saw when I was about twelve years old. We had just moved to a new house and it had a basement. I was very young, so it was nice to get out of the house, go and watch a movie and forget our troubles at home. The movie was really good, but the director is kind of old. The movies he made then were great, but today's are not.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was totally amazed at the way this movie was shot and the way they made the entire movie feel like it was one giant battle scene and never lost it's pace. Even though this movie is so violent and gruesome, it never lost the plot line and I never felt bored. The only downside is that you have to look through the entire film because if you miss the fight scenes, you miss a lot of the fun and good acting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was totally caught by surprise at how much I enjoyed this film. The story is pretty simple, but it is really well written. The actors all did a great job and they nailed the emotions of the characters and gave it all a real sense of mystery.    The ending was a little too rushed, but that was only because the director, Chris Cunningham, had to do a scene that was really close to the end of the film.  The special effects were pretty good, but not great, and the color grading was good, and that was a great thing.  A really good film, especially for the times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had to get this on a Thursday night so I wasn't going to take the train from the city. My boyfriend was driving with me and we got off at the next stop and walked for a few minutes and he said, "You've got to see this movie, it's great". I watched the movie again and I was just a little annoyed that the movie didn't show me what the plot was about (which is what really intrigued me about it) and it also didn't explain what was going on in the story at all. It did tell you everything you need to know, but if it had told me more I might have taken more of a interest.    It is not a good film, but for the $25 bucks it is cheap, the movie has some nice scenes. I'm glad I didn't go on another vacation and saw this movie because I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was younger I was addicted to the original Star Wars trilogy. After watching the prequels I lost all interest in the saga and all of the films. However, the new movies from J.J. Abrams had me at the edge of my seat and kept my interest with their unique plots, great acting, fantastic special effects, and beautiful space scenes.   The new movies are a great blend of adventure, space opera, and western. The original trilogy really had a unique look and feel to it and the new films are an amazing take on the same story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie from the late 1960s was made by a man named John Landis that was made in collaboration with the late Roger Corman. While I do think it is a fine movie, it also has some serious issues to it. The movie is set in a place called "The Pit". There were a lot of wild animals that lived in this place and it was full of great actors. They all played a role of some sort. But, I think what made the movie unique were the fights that took place. The fights were just incredible. We could see each and every fight that was going on and then get in the car to drive back to the office. The whole movie was done in one shot. I think that made it unique. It also had some great special effects.   There is a very short scene in the movie that I just love. The woman in this scene is so beautiful. The scene took place in the jungle and the trees in this jungle look just amazing. I love this scene so much because it is just so beautiful and amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is just really awesome. The story takes place in a world that we really don't get to see very much. It's kind of a modern fantasy version of a medieval world, where the good guys are noble knights and the bad guys are bandits. It is a great setting for the movie because it makes you feel like you are a knight in shining armor, fighting off a lot of bad guys.   The acting was really solid, I have to give props to the cast for their performances. The actors were all really well cast and really worked well with the director to create a really authentic fantasy movie.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys an amazing fantasy film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I heard about this, I was going to see it.   I'm a little skeptical about this film.  I mean, I loved the film and liked some of the characters (the mannequin who is a bad influence is hilarious).  But, what bothers me about this movie is that the movie tries to be too dark, too much.  The movie is too much about the mannequins that are in it, and the scenes between them.  It's a little boring watching a film where a person can't move.  However, I did enjoy the movie a lot, because of the way it portrays people.  You can't always tell if a person is joking or if he's truly serious.  And, as a person, you can't help but to feel sad about people in this movie.  After watching this film, I hope to see more of them. I would love to see them as people. I also hope to watch a couple of the TV series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie, but the acting sucks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film starts off slow but does end up as a strong and fun action thriller.    I loved how it blended the fast paced action of modern day cop shows with the more gritty and realistic atmosphere of a 1930's detective thriller. The director is clearly a true fan of both of these genres so there is definitely some genuine love for both of them.  It is a bit weird at first as this is supposed to be a 1940's detective movie so of course there is no nudity or sexual innuendo, but then again, they are not the most important things in this film so it doesn't really matter.  While not the greatest film ever, it has some real heart and it is definitely a must see if you ever find yourself on the hunt for the most extreme action on screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this film many times. I always enjoyed it and now that it is over i am excited to see what they will do next.    This film is excellent.

The story is wonderful, and well done. The characters were all so well done, as if they were real people in their own life situations.

When you think about it, that's probably how it went down.  I liked the movie, but the acting was pretty bad. Â   I loved the movie for its atmosphere and characters, but some of the acting in this movie was pretty terrible.  It really didn't look like anything that's on TV or in the movies.  The special effects were great, but I didn't think they worked too well.  This was pretty much a movie for people who don't care about movies, but want a horror movie. The acting and makeup were really good.

I didn't care if this movie was just a remastered version of that. The script is just as good. The actors, although I thought there was a little bit more in some of the scenes, do an excellent job of bringing the film to life. I really enjoyed the movie. I don't understand why it got mixed up in movies where the actors don't perform at all.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film opens with a couple of shots of a train speeding down a dirt track. The film then cuts to an isolated train being operated by a crew of the same name.   A small town is featured, and several people are seen at the local pub.  A man and woman in the town go up the railroad tracks to look for a good place to get away from their troubles. The man is the son of an alcoholic father who has recently passed away.  The man and his brother-in-law are then kidnapped by a man they met at the pub. They are then taken to a remote cabin.  In this cabin they find a young woman.  While they are looking for her, a man in a long white coat arrives at the cabin. He introduces himself as Henry, and tells them that his father has come back from the dead. He claims to be a vampire, and he intends to drain the blood from them.  Henry then proceeds to drain their blood, which is shown on a vial.  When the blood is drained, they wake up.  After waking up, the woman is horrified to find her husband dead and her brother- in-law missing. She then goes looking for help, and finds the sheriff, who helps her find the location of the cabin from the police report.  It's quite a dark film, and while it's certainly not a classic, it does have some great moments.  There's also a very fun twist at the end which is fun and unexpected. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm an absolute sucker for an older female star, and this movie has the kind of great acting that makes me look forward to seeing her every year or so in a new movie. This time, she's the perfect old lady, and she really has a lot to say and say it with some gravitas. A great, well made film that had great humor and great acting.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like I said above, I like the story, but the acting and the direction, and some of the scenes where they have to hide a body, or just run around looking like crazy people, was ridiculous and made me laugh. It would have made more sense to just run the camera in the middle and have the actors do all the running. I mean, look at the guy running around in the dark in a nightmarish fashion and that's not running at all. I didn't find it funny.   Overall I was disappointed in this movie. The actors had a good time but it was just silly to watch them do the stuff. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only complaint I have with this movie is that it feels like a very amateurish attempt at a cult film, but if you like cult films, you'll really enjoy it. It's well worth watching, and you can't say you didn't know it was a cult classic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at a cheap theater in Texas. It was a good low budget comedy. It had a great cast and a plot that went in a few different directions. I liked the humor and the characters. I didn't like the plot but I would give this movie 5 stars if it was any more interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most amazing and entertaining thing I have ever seen. It's like a big-budget sci-fi movie with a crazy alien that has a crush on a human, who has a really strong mind and is very intelligent. It really makes you think, and you won't be able to look away! It's a real action flick from start to finish, with crazy stunts and cool looking weapons, and the alien is a total badass! You will definitely have a lot of fun watching this one!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first read the script, I thought it sounded a bit cheesy. But then I read some more and I thought I saw that in the director's eyes too. The movie looks like it was made in the 50's or early 60's and it really doesn't have much to do with reality. But as the characters go through their day in this movie you realize it is all based on a true story and even the acting is great. The one complaint I have about the movie is that some of the acting isn't that great. If I was to make a movie based on such a story it would have to be about the people behind the characters and not the people in the stories. But I just don't see how you can make a good film out of a true crime story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the best thing you can watch in the history of cinema.  A classic and a perfect blend of cinema and action.    The story goes as follows:  In the mid 1950s, two French engineers are attacked and held at gunpoint at gun point by a team of American Nazis.  The man who holds them hostage tells the story of what happened, how they were captured and finally what he did to get them out of there.  In his own words, "At a certain point, I took a pistol from my pocket and I shot at the guard at the top of his head, just to get rid of him.  I put a radio receiver in my pocket, and I said to myself, 'I'll never get out of this hellhole. 'So I got out of it, and as I ran through the door, I said 'What the hell did they do to those people?'  And the man who was holding them at gun-point said to me, "It's just as well they're dead."  They had been shot with poison gas, and one of the guys got it in his eyes and the gas ran right through him. His eyes came out and they were still open.  That man who got poisoned got a gas mask and he put it on, and the mask came out over his face. That's how he got the gas out of his eyes." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen many of the horror movies, and I have to say that this is by far my favorite. I've never seen anything like it. I love the movie, and the plot. The actors are all great. It's scary, and there is a little bit of action, but not too much. I really liked it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was funny, as far as comedies go. I didn't find anything particularly wrong with it.   It's a good look at a real life story and the acting was good, with very little of the "ooh" and "ahh" that comes with most movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the style of this movie. I've seen this on a bunch of different channels, including cable tv, but it always made me laugh and had a very upbeat feel. The story is about a high school cheerleader, and it doesn't have much to do with it, but I thought it was very funny. I'd recommend watching this on tv with a group of friends, but you'll be laughing throughout.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There was only one movie in the world that I watched on tv. I remember being very young and my mom taking me to a movie with her, the movie that i remember most was "The Last Time" starring Robert Redford. I love Redford, his acting, and his chemistry with Linda Hamilton. The story, about two guys in a desert, is very interesting, I enjoyed the story very much. The character of Bob, a lonely man is funny, and I loved the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is just fun and awesome.   The people in this movie are all likable.  If you want to see a funny movie that has a lot of action, action in the funny way and a lot less talk and drama in it then this movie is for you.  The director had alot of fun making this movie.  I like the movie because it has a nice cast and a good script.  A lot of people make movies like this and I think they are the best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love it.   Very well done.  I would recommend it to anyone, even if they don't know the background of the story.  The only thing i don't really like is the music.  It was a little bit too quiet for my taste. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. I was a big fan of it when it came out (1991) and it was a really nice way to wrap up the trilogy. I have no idea what came of the film but I really did enjoy it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I saw this at the theater a few years ago and it was good. My wife saw it at the old "Laser Disc" theater in a movie theater and we've seen every movie she's seen at the "Lincoln Square" location. It was a nice, cool, clean, "dear" movie. This is the type of movie where you can actually imagine people walking around with no clothes on and the camera is focused on them. This movie was funny, but not overdone like other films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a hard time watching bad movies. The first time I ever saw this movie I thought it was a documentary. I'm not a real filmmaker, but I've seen it and thought it had an honest and decent story. There's a lot of action but it feels like it's done tastefully.   So I give this one a solid 9/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The director wanted to make a horror film, but he didn't want to go in that direction. So he just said, "Let's make a ghost movie", and he did it perfectly.  A great story and well acted by the cast.   You just need a good script to make this great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was just at the theatre the other night with some friends and I think the only thing we all had to say was "I'm going to give this movie a good go!" It is well produced with a decent cast and I was pleasantly surprised.  It starts out with a beautiful montage of the day before the shooting.  The plot follows a woman called Julia and her father who are out in the country with a horse for her birthday. They are taken by surprise when they get a call from her father saying he has been shot.  They head to a country house where they find her father bleeding. He is rushed to hospital and they find out he has just survived after a bullet went through his heart and out the other side.  Julia and the others decide to continue on the trail of the killers.  Once at the house it becomes clear that the man in the red coat and the man with the gun are the killers and they need help.  What follows is a great chase sequence.   This movie has lots of action and plenty of drama which is what you want from a thriller.  I thought that the main girl was very cute and the film was really well directed and acted.  This film was fun and well made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it was released in 1993, The Exorcist was met with widespread criticism. The film itself was a bit shaky at the beginning, but it became a great horror film as it grew and matured. It has a unique style, where all the camera movements and camera angles are very strange. The actors do a great job portraying the characters in this film, and the performances by the cast of characters were some of the best in the genre.   The Exo-Squad is a movie that has aged well, and it holds a special place in the horror genre. It's one of my favorite movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts out slowly.   One would think that the pace would be fast once the audience has gotten past the boring exposition, but the pace actually slows down, as the movie gradually focuses more and more on the life of the characters.  In order to make the film seem more interesting, a lot of flashbacks were added.  Also, several characters are introduced at different times, which would have been quite tedious if the movie wasn't moving at a steady pace.  The story of the film is simple and the story is told well enough.  It is well paced and the scenes fit with each other quite well.  One of the best parts of the movie is the ending.  When the story ends, the music is almost to the point where the film ceases to be interesting.  But, at the end of the day, the movie can still be appreciated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's action sequence is incredible, it has some really cool stunts, the action is so good, and the fights are so fast paced, and well choreographed. The plot of the movie is great, it really gets into the mind of the lead character, and you feel like you know him and his feelings, he is a good guy, but he is definitely getting into his own head, and this is a very good movie to watch.   Another great thing about this movie is the acting, I love the cast and the scenes are great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie the day it was released in the theaters. My parents saw it at their local mall, they were watching it as a family. I thought it was okay, not a masterpiece.   There was no dialogue, they just used actors.  It was a little slow to start, but when it did, it was well worth it.  The actors did an amazing job and the plot was great.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never watched this movie until after I had heard people on the street talking about it and I finally decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did, because this movie is awesome. Not only is it great to see a movie about the Holocaust and its aftermath, but it has great performances, and the special effects are top notch. You won't be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My second viewing of this film changed my perception of it. I had expected something more of a thriller than this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched the movie a couple of times now, and I think that it is a good film, not one that will cause you to go 'oh God, where have I seen this before?' It is still a great flick, but that's not saying much.   "For a long time, I couldn't understand why he thought that this film could be a hit and not a flop. I mean, this movie is as good as any made in this genre, and to my knowledge, it's the first film of its kind to be directed and written by Stanley Kubrick, who had a great deal of influence on the genre. And so, even though it might not have been as technically accomplished as his later films, he managed to create a world that I find fascinating. "And, of course, Kubrick was ahead of his time." -- Robert Mitchum, who plays the film's antagonist, Lt. K., on the set of 'Full Metal Jacket.'  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is amazing and the best horror film I ever saw.  It's the best, most chilling, realistic and disturbing movie  I have ever seen.    It shows the fear of being alone and scared to death.  The whole movie is great and I really liked the characters.  I just wish it was made into a series, because it's so good.  This is one of my top films and  one of the best movies of the past two decades.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say I wasn't impressed by the movie. The story was well thought out. You really get a sense of what these characters were going through.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is worth watching if you want a great revenge flick with lots of action.   I loved this movie and hope that they do a sequel in the future.  This was such a fast paced action flick.  And it looks fantastic!   The ending was the best part about this movie.  I was really happy that they didn't overdo the effects on this movie (at least for the first half of the movie).  And I really liked the direction the director took (as I said earlier, he wanted this movie to be "a little different".   What I liked the most about this film was the way the two lead characters went about their missions.  Both were nice guys.  They both have a bit of a chip on their shoulder and it shows in their actions.  The only problem is, that they go back and forth on what their next mission should be.  You have to like to see people being tough (in a good way!).   In a way, this film makes me want to be like that (if I could), so I hope that someone tries this franchise out.  If you want some awesome action movies, this is definitely one of the best!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is great but there were some problems with the cast and story that bothered me. If I had watched this on DVD (like I had my previous viewing) I wouldn't have been so critical. The characters are well drawn and really do develop as the story develops. It just takes some time to get into this movie.   - The ending was a bit abrupt. But, it made sense with the main plot that was building throughout the movie. - The casting was really good. They all had good chemistry with each other. - I was surprised how much this movie got me hooked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie you'll remember.  I'm a fan of the old John Carpenter movies, so I wanted to see the man's most famous creation on my own and this was the way to do it.   The story is pretty good, and a great example of how good a Carpenter movie could be.  Carpenter really brought a sense of darkness and the movie never lost its sense of fun.  This movie is a must see for anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The great thing about this movie is that it has a great balance of comedy, drama, action, and romance, which makes it a great movie to watch with your friends or family.   It is pretty entertaining at all times.  This movie has a lot of funny lines to go along with the great action, the romance is quite unique, and it is really hard to find a bad line in this movie, because all of the characters seem to be having a good time in the action scenes.  It should be noted that the script is written by George Pal which makes for a great performance from the actor who played the role of Han Solo.  The best part about this film is that the director, George Lucas, didn't use any cheap tricks.  His editing and camera work is really good, the sound track is amazing, and all of his special effects are great.  There is just something about this one film that is just amazing, that no one can ever duplicate, and that is what makes this one so memorable.  Star Wars is definitely one of the best action films ever made, and even though there are bad lines and bad acting, this movie will always be remembered as one of George Lucas's better movies.

The special effects were very good, and you can really feel the gravity of the story, especially during some action sequences.  The acting in the movie were really good, i liked how the bad guys spoke and acted, as well as the nice voice actress for the baddies.  I really liked the movie, and i recommend it to anyone who like an action movie with cool special effects and good acting.

I don't see this movie often but if you want a good action movie with a great cast you have to watch this movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very disappointed with this movie. The acting was bad, the film was old, and the plot was old.   It was pretty much a parody of a movie called "Parks and Rec".   The film was based on the life of a rich guy in Beverly Hills that lives in a mansion and has a bunch of kids that live there.  It seems like he doesn't have a lot of friends at all and the only friend he does have is his pet turtle.  The movie was set in the early 90's and there was a bunch more to the character but I don't think he was ever really on.  There was a lot about the movie that didn't make any sense. He was in love with an actress and he had her come to his house and go to work for the film company in her free time.  What the hell?  This is just another example of how the movie industry is not really working out.  If you were looking for a movie that wasn't really a parody it would have been better.  Watch this Movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing I don't like about this movie is that the main female lead is not all that interesting. You will see her on the movie screen for about 15 minutes before she is replaced with another actress.   For a movie that comes from a small production company, it is a pretty good film and I have seen a few others that I would like.  If you have some time to kill, and you like this kind of movie, this might be a good choice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I watched this movie as a child I thought it was pretty good. This is a great movie. Very well done. It doesn't get more "American" than this. It is about an old school-man who gets involved in a big drug trafficking scheme. But it is not about the drugs. This movie is about a man who has to put on an act for the government officials who are investigating him. A tough and angry old man and a nice and funny young girl. The acting is great and the music is great. This was one of those movies I have always wanted to see.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the first great films I ever saw, with the great cinematography, great performances, and a memorable story. The story is actually better than the movie, as the lead's family is torn apart, and it seems the only way out is to go back to the U.S. This film is still well worth watching, because of the amazing cast, the great special effects and the great performance by Clark Gable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie in the list.   The story is amazing and I enjoyed it.  I liked it. It reminded me of some of the classic movies I watched when I was a kid and loved them.  It reminded of me of a lot of old sci-fi movies from the 30's and 40's.  The character development is amazing.  This is my favorite movie of the year, and I recommend it to everyone who loves movies.

The bad : I was a little disappointed at how the ending was because I thought it would be more of a "who was the real villain here" type of story but it really just seemed to be "who did what" and I think that's just as good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first 3 minutes of this movie is perfect. We all knew that the story is going to be bad but at least it has a sense of humor and a feel of fun. There is also a good cast of characters and a great sense of tension as well.   What you get in this movie are a bunch of guys in their early 30's.  They are a little too out of place, but that is what the story needed.  The only thing that i have a problem with is that the guys are not portrayed too well. They are all a little bit too thin and have too thin faces. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A true masterpiece of suspense and action, A Beautiful Mind Â is one of the greatest films of the modern era.   The film is a great example of the genre.  From its premise to its characters and performances, A beautiful mind Â does it all.  A Beautiful mind   begins with a young genius, John Nash (James Caan), who is given an opportunity to look back on his past and to find his purpose in life.Â  The movie follows John through a series of events that have shaped his life into what it is today. Â It gives us a wonderful insight into a man's life, his thoughts, his emotions and how his thoughts are shaped and the way he perceives the world around him.  It also shows us a lot about the science and psychology behind the development of intelligence, including the effects of environment, culture and drugs.  This film is so complex that it is really not possible to explain it, but you really get a good feel for what John has seen, experienced and thought about his life.  The way the film deals with some of these themes is quite extraordinary and there is a lot to be appreciated in this film.  John Nash also gets an opportunity as a way to help some of the more unproductive people around him, who may not be able to make it on their own.  There are a number of other interesting character aspects and ideas to be explored here, and this film is worth seeing even if you haven't seen anything of its kind.  When it comes down to it, A gorgeous mind is one of those films that will make you think and it will make your mouth water.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first came across this film in the late 70s and I have always wondered how the heck they got permission from Paramount to put this movie out.  When I saw it again in the 90s and early 2000s it was in a re-release with a much improved audio mix.  This is still a wonderful story about a family of outlaws.  The script is very well written and the production team did a fantastic job.  I believe the last film in this series was The Devil's Horseman  and I would love to see what happens to those outlaws after this film.  It is really fun to see the different types of outlaw that were created in the western and the use of the outlaws in the film were great.  Overall I really enjoyed this film and loved the actors.  A great little story of a little girl who gets in over her head.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that this movie is a true gem. The acting, the music and the story, just add to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is fun! It has great songs and funny scenes that you will want to hear over and over. If you are a fan of the original 'Pulp Fiction' film, this movie is for you! I do have one gripe about the ending... The ending made no sense, and left some of the best lines out. But, then again, it is a Tarantino movie so things are never what they seem, right?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is the only "good" movie I have ever seen. Not only that, but it is the very first one to focus on a character. It shows that if you don't look out for people, you will end up in a lot of trouble. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very entertaining and enjoyable movie. There were times that I was not sure if the character was going to "get over it" or if they were going to realize that it was all a lie or they were just being "brave" and "honest". The "fake death" scene was very clever. It was very well done and made me laugh. As for the characters, they were all very realistic and had very good chemistry. I would recommend this movie to all my friends and would highly recommend this to a younger generation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original screenplay was written by Bruce C. McKenna, the son of famous screenwriter John.   He did a great job of adapting the book into a screenplay.  This movie is a good example of a character driven movie where you can see the different characters' flaws and flaws in each one.  The acting is very good.  A good number of memorable movie characters have appeared in this film.  It is one of the best movies of the year.  I think it is a great film for all ages.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as part of a class in college. I liked it and was looking forward to seeing it again, and I was happy to find it on the Blu Ray.   The film is not good in the sense of being bad (I'm not looking for a classic) it is good, in the way that movies like the original Twilight Zone are good, and it is a good way to get into the mood of the 1960's.

In spite of this, he kept on trying to make it a success, even though the doctors advised him to retire.  This is a wonderful movie, a great story. The film has such great actors in it, such an ensemble cast. This movie isn't all that good, but it's one of those things that I can't wait to see again, and I've never seen this movie before.

The actor that plays Frank "The Greek" McDonough (Mr. Cinco) is excellent in the lead role. He makes Mr. C in such a realistic and believable way that the audience is always at ease. I would not change my opinion for the world.   My rating: 4 of 5 stars  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the old classic movies. The first one i saw was The Maltese Falcon, it was like a cross between a western and a gangster movie and really got me hooked on the genre. I have never seen a bad western ever.   It was the beginning of my love for them.  So now i am getting to see them again and this movie was excellent, the story was the most enjoyable part of the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Wes Craven's first full-length film since his last film, A Nightmare on Elm Street, is the culmination of his career. Craven has crafted a story that is just plain scary, and a lot of the movie is devoted to setting the foundation. When Craven shows a shot of a house engulfed in flames with a woman running screaming out, it's a chilling image that can only be described as demonic." - Robert T. Barrett, Variety "The screenplay by Wes Craven and Sam Raimi was a classic of its genre: it was a perfect blend of horror and comedy. It's no surprise that Wes Craving made his first major film since the success of A Nightmare On Elm Street in 1989." - John Fagan, Movieguide   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be a lot of fun!   A movie that took a risk on a completely new setting.   The plot was a little too intricate for my taste but there were plenty of surprises.  The acting was great.  I'm not a big horror movie fan but I enjoyed this movie.  There's a very cool movie on this list so don't get disappointed if you are! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Very good movie. Love the story line, especially the "wonderful" (to quote the movie) opening scene. And I love the song that plays over the whole movie.   It was a fun film to watch and I enjoyed it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, I'm glad to know that this movie is in the theatres, not in my memory banks.   What really impressed me the most about this movie was the sheer amount of effort and detail put into the look of the town.  From the tiny houses, to the old abandoned cars, the streets and houses were beautifully designed and I have to say I've never seen anything like it.  If I had to pick a favorite look of this town it would have to be the old house where everyone is trapped.  In addition to the look, the atmosphere of this film is incredible.  The characters are drawn very well and you have a sense of dread about what could happen at any moment.  After viewing the movie I don't think I'll ever forget it.Â   I loved this movie and it was very difficult to put down.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a solid remake of the film from the '60's, but doesn't really go far enough in the opposite direction. This movie is much better, but still feels like a rip-off. The actors really don't get a chance to show off their skills here, and don't seem to have any of the same energy from the original. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A wonderful movie that just happened to star the same actors as the one from the other one, and there was a great chemistry between them.  It had a lot of good acting, but one of the most touching moments for me was when a young boy is hit by a truck and runs into a lake, and his mother asks him what happened to his head. He answers it is still wet, and he asks her what happened in the boat. The mother says that a fisherman came and took him out of the boat, and while he was at the shore, he heard a splash and a voice. He called back for help, but it was too late, and before he could say anything, he was drowned.  The acting of the cast is excellent, but the story is a bit slow and the music is not very good, but you just need to see it to be amazed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen the movie countless times, and there are just so many laughs. It was hilarious. It's really funny!   My only gripe is that they tried to re-edit the movie in 3 different versions, the "normal" version, the black & white version and a colorized version. The problem is that none of these versions are even close to what the movie looks like in color, so they are very disjointed. The colorized one looks like someone re-dubbed it with an extra 2 minutes cut from it (and the sound is different from the normal version) and it's really disjoint.    There were a few moments in the movie where I thought it was pretty good, but it was definitely one of those rare occasions where I was disappointed by the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A few of us that I worked with on a movie that was made in my hometown in the early 70's loved this movie, and I think it's a real gem.   The actors are all good, and the scenes are all really well-done and acted.  The story isn't quite as good as the original "The Sting," but it's still good.  One thing that was a little bothersome was the bad-looking production.  It was a low-budget picture made in the mid-70's, and it really wasn't all that great looking.  For a movie made in 1974, it's hard to believe it's 30 years old.  "The Wild Bunch" is a pretty good story.  A real look at the Wild Bum era of gangs.  This is one of those films that is a little outdated now, but it was really fun as a kid. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many of the films in the "Star Wars" series, "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" follows a familiar plot. In a faraway planet, a small, elite, scientific society is trapped by the evil forces of an evil villain, who is also responsible for their ship's destruction. The film stars the late Leonard Nimoy as Captain James T. Kirk, Christopher Plummer as Uhura, DeForest Kelley as the Captain's science officer and Leonard Nimoys as Spock. "Star trek: the motion picture" has several problems, but they are not the main ones.  For one, it is not funny. Nimoy's character is never funny, which is frustrating, as the film has more humor than most science fiction films.  This film is a classic, and it is an excellent way to show off all the work that the movie directors went through to bring a science fiction adventure to the screen.   I highly recommend this film to all Star Trek fans, as it has enough humor to entertain as well as be serious.  The effects work, acting and acting of all the main characters are outstanding, and the plot is interesting.  I recommend "Star wars: the original trilogy" to anyone who wants to see the first three movies in the franchise. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this movie at a family event on a Friday evening in 1982. I didn't have to tell my mother what I was going to be doing, so she was actually a little concerned I would drive all the way to our hometown in a cold, foggy evening in the middle of winter. I did not mention that I was attending a movie event and not the local 7 o'clock dance or the local high school baseball game. It was a great event that evening and my mother and father actually were pleased I was coming because they both knew what I had in mind.   The plot is fairly simple, but the story and characters are rich and the movie holds together well despite its simplicity.  In addition to the story line, I liked the characters. They were all very interesting and even if you can't place them in your neighborhood, they are a good mix of young and old. I liked that a few of them were black and that the movie dealt with such a sensitive subject matter.  My brother and I watched this movie together about a year ago, so I can't speak for the accuracy of the plot, but we all liked it and I still have a lot of fun talking about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really liked this film. It is quite a dark film, with a lot of tension and a lot going on. The actors are great, the special effects are awesome and they really get into the scenes with great enthusiasm. The script is really excellent and it does the script justice.   A good movie, and it has a lot more story than most of the other "superhero" films in the sixties. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen a bunch of bad movies in my life and this one was the best yet! The acting was awesome and the plot was fun to watch.    The only flaw is the storyline (and I think it's because it was too long for me to really follow) but it was a fun watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw this film I had never seen a scene where a police officer shot a suspect. A few scenes like this, where the police officer shoots a suspect who was handcuffed, I remember being surprised at how well they worked the camera angle and the editing. The acting was excellent, the dialogue was crisp and clean. I thought the screenplay was perfect. A lot of time was spent in scenes where the victim/subject was being talked out of killing themselves, and the killer did not kill him/her himself, but simply convinced the victim he was going to. This was done with great effect, and I'm surprised nobody else has done a film like this.   I have seen a couple of good action films in the past, and this is a great example. I enjoyed watching these scenes unfold, and it is very realistic to watch this happen. I also enjoyed how realistic the murders are. They were not carried out with such a brutal method. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen this film and have heard nothing but wonderful things about it. I've always had a soft spot for the film and this movie is the best of the many films based on this novel by the same name.  The story is not as good as the novel (I don't think it's ever really close to being a "best" of the book) but there is still plenty of action, suspense, and great characters.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this was excellent! From the writing, to the acting and all the extras it was all excellent! There were so many interesting characters.

It was well written and all of the extras were great. The movie was very good and I highly recommend it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw the movie "Jumper" when I was only in junior high. At that time I was obsessed with the book "Journey to the Center of the Earth". The first time I saw this movie I was impressed, because it was a very realistic and thrilling film. After that I became an absolute fan and I have been ever since. I'm now over 20 and have seen it many times. The plot is simple but interesting and it doesn't have a lot of scenes that I don't enjoy. The movie is very well-made, the acting is top-notch and the music and voice actors are excellent. This movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I would love to see it in the theaters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie very much.  The story is pretty unique, it isn't like "Hollywood" movies where there is always someone getting caught up in the big crime.  There were different characters and a little twist here and there.   It has lots of violence and nudity so be warned.  It is pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie so many times and yet never understood what makes it so special. The acting is very good and the story is extremely original and fresh.    It is the first film that had me really thinking. It has so many different genres of films going on and the film is very creative and original.  I always loved the movies when they made them in the sixties and seventies.  In this film they were like in a new world and they were really getting away with some crazy stuff. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most visually stunning, dramatic, and engaging movies I have ever seen.   It tells a very interesting story, told in a style that is incredibly realistic and rich.  A lot of directors do not understand how to film the human face, how to use it in a compelling and engaging way.  As a result, a lot of them have struggled to portray the human condition in a believable way, and a lot have failed to convince me of their ability to make a good film.  This film takes the best of the best from other films, the best techniques and techniques of other directors, and gives it a new, unique perspective.  I think it's a wonderful way to tell a story of the human spirit, that focuses on people who are often not seen as such.  There is an amazing balance of realism and suspense, with a lot happening onscreen, but you don't know who is who, where it all begins, who will go where, or how it will end.  It is a very different kind of film, from the other films I have seen, which have a tendency to be too dry, too somber, or have an ending that feels a bit too easy.  The film opens with two young men driving along a country road, on a quiet country road.  They hear a dog barking, and they see a dog with blood in his mouth.  Suddenly, they are in the middle of a horror film, and the film takes a turn.  Two women, one of them a blonde with a long, red hair cut in a certain style, walk into their car, and scream at them.  Then the camera zooms in on the woman, who is screaming for her husband.  She says that she was in a car accident, and that she will not see him again.  He says that he is in San Diego, and he will not be home for several months, but he will come see her.  We then cut to a scene of the wife, and her young daughter.  At first, the film seems like a typical family drama.  But, then it begins to reveal a series of grisly murders.  One woman had been murdered with a large knife, and another had been stabbed in the chest.  And we cut to an image of the young daughter, who seems to be in a coma, her eyes covered in bandages.  Soon after the scene ends, a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An entertaining and well done movie. I always enjoy a good adventure, as we all do, in the same way that we enjoy a great dinner. And this movie does not disappoint in that respect, with some great sets, costumes and effects. The cast is fantastic, including the two great leads, a veteran actor, who was a perfect choice for this part, and an up and coming actor who really brings a lot to the film. The writing is terrific as well, with the characters all having their own little arcs and getting their own small moments in the film, especially when the characters are in the midst of a battle. This movie is entertaining all the way through, especially the film-within-a-film, the flying scenes. There are a lot of surprises as you think you know what's going to happen and then it goes completely unexpected and you are very happy you did not miss any of the action. Highly recommended!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie and I feel this is a perfect example of a film in the 1970s. I liked it very much and it's very well written. It doesn't feel dated at all and it looks great, especially on the big screen.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had just seen this movie a few days before I was born. It was my first movie in my family to watch. I remember watching this movie in a family theater as a baby. It wasn't until later when I was an adult that I discovered the true horror story behind this movie. I still remember being in the theater when my parents sat next to me and they both turned to look at each other at the same time. They had seen the film and knew what was in it. We were the only ones that actually had seen it and still remember it. The film was based off of the real life case of Jodi Arias. Jodi was the first girl to be killed by a psychopath in America and now her killer is serving a life sentence. The movie is based on the real Jodi and the real murders but in this case the killers are innocent victims and are not guilty of anything. I believe this film really captures the life of Jodie and her family and the lives of all of the people she loved. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie so good, that it really takes me to the place I'd like to be, as far as movies are concerned. It's not so much a movie about the war. It takes place during the war and shows how it affects everyone. It really shows how far that nation has fallen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is my favorite one. It's a great, funny movie that doesn't take itself too serious, it's more of a slapstick comedy than a serious drama. The whole cast is great and the humor is great, this is the best comedy out there, it just has such great laughs and great gags. This was a very enjoyable movie to watch and my parents really enjoyed it, the humor in this one is so funny, it will really hit your funny bone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is pretty good and really well made. It's good to see an Asian guy playing a white character that is not a clichÃ©.   I love the movie and I feel that it did not lose any of its charm with the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had just seen an American movie on a British channel called World War II, and thought it was the most gripping and impressive film ever made. This was a film that had a whole generation on the edge of their seats. It was about a group of American servicemen who were captured in Italy, and the story is told through the eyes of some of them. The acting was brilliant and the scenes had a lot of suspense and suspense was really needed in this film. I never knew how these guys could stand there with their bare chests and not try and fight, as they did. I found myself thinking 'this guy is really a toughie, and how did he survive all these years and live to tell the tale?' The whole story is so complex and so absorbing, you could watch it a hundred times over.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a well made movie.   This is the first time I have seen a movie where I could actually see the director.  The characters are the most believable.  He has a very interesting style of filmmaking.  They do have a lot of sex in this movie, but there are a lot more characters.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending.  There were a lot, many sex scenes, and none of them was satisfying.  But at the end, the guy who is having sex with another guy has this huge smile on his face.  So I think that there is some truth to the old wives story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's very good. It is a must see movie. There is a short scene at the start where the two young boys are playing on the beach with their bikes. One boy gets an injury while jumping off a little cliff (to escape a turtle) and the other one is helping him up. They get into a tug of war (as it were) with the other boy getting the upper hand. This will be one of your most favorite movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has something to say. It makes you think. When you first see it, it appears to be just a cheap exploitation film, but as you watch it, you realize it's a very good film that has some thought behind it. It's just hard for me to watch movies where the plot and characters are just about sex. This movie makes me think of all the things I'd rather have in my life than sex: good friends, family, food, clean clothes, etc.   I have only seen this movie once, but I would highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Somewhere between The Last Temptation of Christ and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," this is one of the most beautiful and disturbing movies ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this film.   It's not really a "classic" by today's standards.  It was filmed in the 50's but there is little action except for a few close ups of people who look like they're trying to protect themselves.  But it was made in the 60's and there is a little more action, but it's in a different way than you might have expected.  The film opens up with a great montage of different situations that the characters in the movie have to deal with.  They're all in a hotel in a foreign country but nobody knows the names of the people who are staying there.  There is a few funny scenes and some great music to accompany them.  When the action really starts, it is at the beginning of the film.Â   There are only a few actors, but the one who did the stunts was really in demand.  His stunts are excellent.  One scene in particular involves a couple of guys driving a car up a very steep hill with the woman driving on the passenger side.  He pulls out a car door that has an opening on the other side, and the guy gets thrown out the car and gets hurt.  Even though it was filmed almost 40 years ago, there is really no limit to the type of stunts he could do.  I also liked the way the characters wore clothes.  These are not just some normal guys, they are a couple in love and they're traveling around. Â  They're not just taking a bunch of guys with guns to some foreign country.  You know it is a dangerous job, and you can see how dangerous it is for the couple to be traveling around with guns.  As you see the characters fight their way through all sorts of situations, you can tell how dangerous the job was.  After you see all of these scenes, you realize that the actors all did their own stunts.  With a little luck, they could probably have gotten away with doing a few stunts on film back then.  Not that they could have gotten the right look, but they were just as good.  So, as you see, the story is a good one.  This is not your average romantic comedy.  From the beginning to the end, you see how they try to get away from the violence they are experiencing.  In a way, it shows you that love can change even the roughest people into someone you love.  Because the movie takes
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was lucky to see this movie on the big screen in the 1980s, it's just not the same movie today.   The only thing I miss is the "The Wicker Man" (I think it's called "The Witch")   It was very different back then and this one is also a little different.  It's not a good "Fantasmic" movie, but it's not bad either.  I can't really remember why I liked it so much then, it seems more like a campy classic like the "Wicker Man", and it's certainly not as "gross" as the Wicker man.  My only real gripe about it was that the guy's face is always in shadow.  There's only so much you can do with that, but at least it looks like a human face when the lights are on.  Also, you never know what the next scene will have, and this movie is kind of like that.  The music is fantastic.  This movie is on YouTube if you want to check it out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen all of them and this one is the only one I really liked.   This is a true story about a real life incident, and the details of it make it a very good movie.  It shows the problems with law enforcement and how things have changed for the better since then.  The acting in this movie is very good and they really nailed it in all the scenes with the victims.  They really do seem to be in their right minds in these incidents.  I know these people, and even had a neighbor who was a good friend of the family, but I'm sure these people do the best they can.  As far as the writing is concerned, it's very good.  Every line is written so clearly and it really captures the tension.  Most of the movie isn't shown, but you get a sense that there are people out to get this family.  This movie really got me interested in the whole subject, but it still leaves me asking myself "who would really do that?"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie, which I'm glad it wasn't a huge bomb.   The movie is based on a true story, and has a nice tone to it.  This movie is well-written and has great acting.  I think the only real problem is that there is so much going on.  The story was really neat and the actors really did a good job.  It was fun watching a bunch of people who don't know each other (the guys in the hotel, the bartender, etc.) be friends.  Also, I liked the fact that they showed some of the hotel shenanigans that happened with the money changing hands. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best thing in my book in the new movie "The Revenant" is the way they filmed the scenes with the wolves and the lions.

I really enjoyed this movie, and I really wish more people would see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You never get tired of watching the gang (including one as crazy as he is) get into one ridiculous or silly chase. They're just so fun to watch.   The chase in the movie itself is very well done. There's a lot of fun moments including an amazing scene where the cops try to catch the bad guys but they're never able to, and then it's just a chase through a bunch of random houses. There are a ton of funny moments too such as one of the baddies' brother calling the police, but the cops always have his brother in front of them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was fine, a lot of people have commented that it was overrated, and that it didn't match the book by the same title.  The book is written in an original way, with a good plot, and the characters are very well written, and have depth. The only real problem is that it is a movie, and not a book.    I wouldn't rate this a 9 out of 10, as the movie was overkill, and really only added to the over all feel of the book. It was a good idea, but it really didn't do it justice.  I also liked the character of the old man, I thought he was done very well.

John Lithgow was great as the lead and he was played well.  The production looked good and was in good spirits.  It wasn't the most memorable movie, but I found myself enjoying the story.  I would have liked to see more of the characters that weren't the leads. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The music is really beautiful and the movie looks really great.   This is probably one of the best movies in a while.  The movie is very well written and is definitely worth the watch.  This movie is so funny and not as preachy as most movies.  I had no idea what was going on in this movie and I still don't.  It had me laughing out loud a few times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty good. I watched it with the sound off. There are some cool shots in there. It's got a nice, old school atmosphere, but the story is kind of bland. A young woman gets married to a man she really doesn't like, and when her husband leaves her for another woman, she goes on a killing spree to exact revenge on the other woman. If you're into violent movies, this is a pretty good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A truly wonderful movie.  The movie is a real piece of art, and the special effects are amazing. I found the acting was very believable and I think it was more realistic than a few movies i've seen.  I had no problems with the movie at all.  It made me realize how wonderful people with mental illness can be, and how many lives they can touch.    I highly recommend this movie. It is worth every penny and a true work of art. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is about a man who is trapped in the body of a woman, and after many painful and difficult years, he is finally able to free himself. What follows are some truly horrifying scenes. If you're thinking of watching it, don't wait, you will not regret it.    A must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was about 14 years old, my mother took me to see this movie in theaters for the first time. I was intrigued, as it had a very "old-fashioned" feel to it. I've loved old movies like "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and "The Man Who Fell to Earth" since I was a little kid and I'm glad to say that this one lived up to that old-fashioned feel.   This movie is just about as close to the original story as the producers could get it, and they nailed the look as well.  The special effects are a little over the top (not to mention the music), but the movie is a nice old-timey tale, and the performances are good.  I was particularly impressed with the way the director used the color of the moon to tell the story.  It's not the best movie, but I recommend it to everyone, and it's still entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "It's fun to watch a young actor playing a young man in the midst of his own life-changing experience. At one point he turns around and says, "What's my dad doing here?" That's the kind of movie I can imagine Robert Downey, Jr. having fun making and I loved every minute of it. As for his character, he was an excellent choice for the role." âR.A. Salvatore, The Hollywood Reporter "It might have been a bit of a stretch to cast Robert Downie Jr. as the son of a Confederate general, but the movie does its best to give him the same stature as an action star." âJohn Turturro, The New York Times
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best movie that came out during the 1980s, and a great look at the life and times of rock star and Hollywood star, Jim Morrison.   I don't know how the movie got made, but Morrison is a very cool, smart, funny, and interesting dude.  Â Jim Morrison in "Dark Star"  I remember being at the screening with a friend of mine, and we just had to know who he was in the movie.  Then after the credits ended, my friend and I were walking out of the theater, and I looked up and saw the movie poster hanging on the wall.  That's the poster I remember seeing the movie on, and it still holds up.  I've never seen a Jim Morrison movie before, and this was one of the first ones I saw.  My friend and i just went in a little bit late (around 12:30-1:00) and made it in right next to the theatre where we saw it.  We ended up paying like 15 bucks to go in and try and catch that final scene between Morrison and the audience, but it was just too late.  It's pretty amazing how close the movie came to being a flop.  Unfortunately it wasn't a fluke, as there are many films that come out of Hollywood during the '80s that were terrible.  Morrison, of course, had the ability to change anything into gold.  The movie is based on a novel by John Steinbeck, and there is a ton of great writing in this movie. Steinbeck actually lived with Jim Morrison for a year while he was a heroin addict.  This is another movie I highly recommend watching if you haven't already.  Enjoy, and please leave me a comment with what your first movie was! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. The movie is not only entertaining, but there is also some truth in the plot.   The movie doesn't really tell you the details, but it does tell you enough to understand what's happening.  The acting in the movie is fantastic, and most of the characters were well written.  Some scenes are very interesting.  This movie is definitely worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second one (which has the same cast, but different title, so I cannot discuss that in this review) was pretty good. It is not quite as good as the first one, but it does have more good points, and it was even better in the third act (for that matter, the first two were both good, but they had problems in the first act as well). The first one was about a boy who was very lonely, and in the second it was about an alien who fell in love with a girl from another planet, and his family was very upset. I did not like the alien, but the boy, his mom and the girl were all pretty cute.   There were some other things I liked as well, including a couple of action scenes, and some nice music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Best thing about this movie: Â  The Best thing that I can say about this film is that it is an amazing piece of art, something that must not be missed and something that I would recommend to everyone. It is a film that shows what it would be like if there was a time when movies did not have to be all violence and gore, where the movies that showed us that a man can go through hard times could still be very beautiful and very romantic. It shows us that no matter how bad you feel, no matter what your situation, that you can still find a way to be happy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the late '80's I had a few friends who played video games and when it came to the video game console era they really got into playing the latest and greatest video games. I wanted a game system that was more than just a video game system, a game console that offered something beyond just a simple console or a computer. I remember when I was a kid I would take my mom, brother and sister shopping at a video store and I loved going in to buy games. These were my toys and I wanted them to be something that would actually be fun. I would play my NES, Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, SNES, etc... while they watched me play with my parents. Then my mom took me out one day and bought me a Game Boy, I was like wow! This was my first experience with a video gaming system that actually had fun games. There was a period of time where we would be spending time together playing video games together. These games were very challenging, I remember even when I got to the end I was disappointed that I didn't really accomplish anything. The thing about it though, they were always challenging, you really had to get better and get more and more skillful with the games. They were just challenging enough to keep us all interested and engaged and wanting to come back again and again.   After my parents died, my dad found a way to get me a Nintendo 64. It was my very first system and it was a great experience! I would go over there and just spend hours with my dad and brother. I never really grew up with a home console and this was my main way to play video games with my friends. I have to admit though, my mom was just a little bit worried at first and said my dad was not paying attention. This however is just because my dad wasn't used to video games at first. He had always played games with his friends at school. I know that my mom saw the potential in this system and gave it to me. My father then started getting into the games too. He started playing Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter. He became addicted to the games! The first thing my mom noticed was that my dad's life was totally changed and he began taking care of my mom. He would take care of her and make sure she had food on her table when she was working a night shift or out with friends. He was constantly playing the games with her, he was even able to

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I've never seen a film so beautiful and so alive. Like one of the pictures from a Picasso painting. The visual presentation is one of a kind." â Steven Spielberg   Directed by the master filmmaker, the film is set in a rural community, with a town named Greenwells and a number of small towns scattered around it. It is also set in the early days of film production, with one of its main characters, a local film director, playing the part of an unknown newcomer, while also starring the legendary Audrey Hepburn.   The film is a film about people, and not just those who do something or who are doing it. The story is based on a true story, where a young filmmaker was working on a film on the American farmer, who he filmed, as well as his wife, as they raised his daughter.  The two actors who were actually involved in the film, are great in the role, as do many of the other people who appear in it. This was a film which truly has a feeling of a small community that was coming together in the mid-1960's, when all sorts of changes were happening to the American economy.  In the late 1940's, this area, known as The Plains, had seen many industries fall by the wayside, and this led to many people moving from the area to places like Chicago, New York, and other cities. This caused a problem for the local farmers. While some of them moved to new towns or other places, others just left town. The farm, where they lived, was then left desolate.  Another real-life event that was mentioned in the movie, which was very real for the people who lived in the area, was the 1956 oil spill in Bakersfield, California. The area was extremely contaminated with oil, and it had caused a tremendous amount of pollution in the lake and the area. The only other area on earth where oil could be found was Alaska. The film's director, Errol Morris, lived for many years in the small community where the film took place.  Morris' character, Tom Thumb, worked in a small office in the town, which at the time was a small business, and he was trying to put some money aside to buy a house in the city of Greenwell. The money was only enough to put the house on the market for a little while, however. Morris spent many long months and many nights filming the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is one of the best examples of "realism" in film history. The characters are very believable. The camera work is perfect, especially the close-ups of the people. The music was perfect for the movie as well. This movie should be seen by all. The ending was very emotional and the ending sequence was perfect.   I give this movie a 7.5 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was an excellent thriller that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good thriller. The characters are real and the screenplay is believable. The killer is well written and he does seem a bit like a psychopath. I liked how the killer makes a few subtle moves that make the audience think that he might be more than he seems.   I would give this a 4.5 out of 5 for realism and suspense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie!  I have seen this movie twice, the first time when it first came out in 1980, and the second time last year.   The plot is actually pretty simple.  Our hero is a reporter and he has some pretty serious allegations on his mind. He's convinced that someone is stealing the files of all the people who have seen his new film.  The movie takes you to an apartment where a young man is asleep in bed. The journalist is there with a tape recorder and wants to see what he has to say.  He's heard all kinds of things over the years from other people who claim to have seen things, but there has never been any proof.  When he opens the door, the young man starts screaming and screaming and he grabs the microphone from the journalist and is going to call the police. The camera pulls back and you see the young fellow who is screaming.  At first you think he's crazy.  Then you see that his face is completely covered with scars.  This guy was a very hard case for me.  I had to find out everything that could possibly be the cause of his symptoms. Â  I'm glad that they made a sequel, since I would have never seen it the first go-round.  My favorite part was when the young guy's father comes home and tells him that there has been a murder in his apartment.  But the police don't find anything and the young men's mother seems to be telling the truth.  If you want to watch a good horror movie, make this one your first choice.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great and interesting film about the human race. This film deals with an important and very personal issue.   I have been studying this subject for about 15 years and find this film to be extremely relevant.  I am still learning about it, but I hope to learn more in the future.  This film was written and directed by Steven Soderbergh.  He is an American director and cinematographer.  The main character is named Paul who is a brilliant psychiatrist who is struggling with an abusive father and a schizophrenic wife.  Paul is very intelligent and a brilliant storyteller, but he is a victim of circumstances.  There are two reasons this film is important: First, it shows a great deal about the abuse of power, and second, it deals with a very personal and very sensitive issue. This movie is not for everyone.  For one, this film may take some people to the very edge of their seats. Second, there are several disturbing aspects that may not be appreciated by some people.  Some people may be upset by the portrayal of some of the characters.  In fact, this movie could be considered a horror film, although Soderbugh never really makes this a horror movie.  It is a highly emotional and highly intelligent film, so it is hard to determine what type of person this movie is intended for.  Soderberg is an intelligent man, and this is a very sophisticated film.  Also, this is not a film intended for the children.

It's an interesting look at what life is like for a young man in a city, how his relationship with his father changes, and how it affects him as he grows up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in my local cinema and I had never seen the movie before. It was actually a good little film with a decent story. The acting was also very good, and the music was also decent.   When the film opened up, I found myself really attracted to the lead character, "Buffy."  The movie was shot in the 1970s, and it looked amazing. I am sure that had it been shot today, it would look better.  I found the storyline very interesting, and I really liked the way they told it.  Although the film had a lot of drama and was very tense, it was also quite funny.  There was also some interesting details about the character's lives and feelings.  This is not a very original movie, but it was a good film nonetheless.  Recommended, and if you have not seen the original movie yet, you should!   The Vampire's Mistress (1971) Rating: 8.5

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is about a young man (Dylan) who wants to live a more authentic life, and goes to a "tribal" (sic) Indian village to find a mate.  He is given the job of teaching the locals how to "make" rice.  I loved this film. Â The film tells the story of the young man's life from his childhood in India, until he is sent to America where he is able to finally "come out" (in his own words), and start living an authentic life.  The movie is also hilarious in a fun way, especially when the young Indian girl's "teacher" gets into a fight with the local "chief" for taking away the girl's horse.    It is also very interesting that this film was made in 1962, about the time when the Indian Government decided to officially ban homosexuality (although there still was many gay people living in India at the time).   In fact, it was just that bad, as the "boy's" mother is extremely racist and she is very ungrateful to the Indian men who help her son find a wife. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never knew the old Burt Reynolds/Ginger Rogers movies were bad.   The movies were pretty much exactly like the old one's.  Even though I've seen them many times before, I was impressed.  I think I remember seeing them when I was young and it was funny watching them.  They were in a great little theater in the little suburb of Phoenix.  It was on a Monday night so it wasn't crowded, but I'm sure there were plenty of older people there.  These were my favorite movies from childhood.  The old ones have a real feel to them, like they were shot on film.  This is a true story.  And now you can see this one on the big screen in all of its old school glory.  A wonderful reminder of an era and the kind of movies they made.

You'll have the "classic" action movie feel without the camp and all the action is done without any CGI effects.

The best part of the movie is the story, so if you have a soft spot for any type of story you'll probably enjoy this.

It's funny to see the different styles the different characters were using at the time. The story is about a guy who takes a road trip to see if his ex-girlfriend has any new ideas about him. The scene where the guys get stranded in a country where everyone is naked is hilarious.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of The Princess Bride. I was a big, big fan when I was little. I always got it on VHS. I don't have a lot of movie collection anymore, but I do have an old VHS copy of it. I watched it over and over.   It was a great movie. I remember being scared.  The whole movie is like this:  The villain wants to kill the Bride, so he kidnaps her.  Then they fight and the Bride gets the upper hand. Then the villain gives her a dagger and she fights him off.  When he leaves she looks at him and says "I don't want to die! I want to live!"  When the cops come and arrest the villain, they take the bride away and she goes back to her castle.  But after she leaves the castle she goes into a trance.  What is going on?  I was really intrigued, and I was determined to get ahold of that dagger.  It's in a really old case with the case number #2628.  I called around and finally the guy who sold it told me he had it.  As soon as he got it I had it in my hands.  And it's gorgeous.  You see a lot, I always think of that picture when I look at the dagger. And it has this little, little little handle.  Here's a little look, I just love it. Â   The dagger was in really good condition.  They were using very old daggers at the time.  We are all a little bit afraid to use the actual real thing, but if you have it you never want to take it off again.  This was just a fun little find.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie and was really happy with how it turned out. I do not know why, but I think a lot of people just gave it one star or were disappointed with it because of the sex.   A beautiful romance about an aging girl with a little boy in a small town in the country.  In the beginning, I thought it was just a re-hash of the movie "Tangled" with the same characters. The movie did not do it justice in my opinion. There was no way that the boy would end up in a brothel if the girl didn't care enough.  But what this movie did was make you feel sorry for the girl as she loses touch with the boy. In addition, the movie made you feel like you could relate to the girl.  The ending of the story was so perfect.  I am a fan of the "Titanic" and this movie made me wish that the story would have been as good as the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been trying to figure out why I was never a fan of this movie.  It seems to be one of the few Hollywood films where you can actually laugh at what's going on.  I was in college when it came out.  When I heard it was a comedy, I thought it was going to be some bizarre comedy.   The acting was good.  The scenes were funny.  While it was supposed to be a comedy about a woman trying to make a man's life better, it was more about a guy's life trying to get better.  This was the most hilarious film I ever saw in my life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie back in 1985 when I was young. I was born in 1975, so I was around 8 or 9 when this film was first released. There was a time when all movies were good, and I remember watching this when I first watched the Superman movies. The movie is about a young boy and his parents who move to the big city of Gotham. There is a big firestorm outside of their apartment and the boy's father gets sick. He goes to the doctor to see if he can get better, and is told that he must live in a large hospital with other sick people and have to live in this big, crowded hospital. The doctor is a great man, and wants to help the boy, but there are many others in the hospital who don't want this kid to live. This boy is a genius, and his father has to deal with that fact all the time. The boy is smart enough to know that these other people don't know how to treat sick people. In the end, he is sent away, and a little later he is allowed to go home.

It's the story of a man who is a bit of a recluse, and his friend who is obsessed with the idea that he has a super-power, and are just the two sides of the same coin.  The first half of the movie is basically about the friend trying to get over his friend's obsessive behavior, and the guy who tries to get the friend to talk about what really drives him.  It makes it look easy at times, but the character development and acting is so great it never really feels that easy.  I think one of the reasons this movie was successful was because of the performances and the depth of the story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is quite a pity that I didn't watch this movie during my childhood. I am sure that the film is quite original and interesting. It is a beautiful story, and I liked all the actors.   It was a pity of not having seen this film in its original format during my youth.  It was a lovely film and it does have a nice, subtle, beautiful story.  When I watched this, I was totally taken back to that era.  I don't think there is such a thing as an all-time great film, and this one stands out as an interesting one, particularly with the actors who are quite impressive.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first time I saw this movie.   The film is based on a play by the same name by Arthur Miller, I have read the play and loved it. The story revolves around a man that has come out of a coma and is asked by the wife of his brother to go on a business trip to a new city.  It starts off with him having fun at the bar with his friends and later as a detective on a case.  As he is going from case to case and meeting new people, the man starts to lose his memory.  When a prostitute and a prostitute's mother show up and the woman's mom wants to talk to him about her missing daughter.  The two women start to take advantage of him while his memory is fading, and the film shows the struggles and issues that the man is facing at this time.  A really cool movie about a man losing his memory and falling in love with a woman who is having a hard time remembering her own daughter. Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good thing about this movie, besides the acting and the music, is the acting. It's just that good.   I can't understand what happened to the writer of this movie. How could he make a movie about a guy who looks like a cross between James Dean and Brad Pitt? It's ridiculous.  This movie is so bad, I can barely understand how people ever thought this movie would be a success.  I mean, I thought that it was going to be really funny, but it's not funny, it's just kind of gross. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is so farfetched that even I laughed at the characters, but it's hard to hate on a movie that makes you laugh so hard.   In this movie, you meet a strange character named "Dr. X." He is a psychiatrist, but he lives in a place with no windows that is filled with blood and soot. He runs a psych ward and he likes to see the things he picks up in the streets. He sees people die every day, but this movie is too dark to actually be funny. The only one who laughs is the villain.  "Dr X" is a character who wants to be someone he's not.  He thinks he's the best doctor in the world and he really seems to think he knows better than everyone else. He really isn't.  A lot of his actions are ridiculous, but the humor is still there. It's hard not to enjoy a film that makes the audience laugh when they realize Dr. X has a real problem with his sanity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been watching this since I was 12 and I was a massive fan of the original.  It is an amazing movie to watch.  There is so much great acting, and the story is so compelling.  The scene with Mr. B and Mrs. B was priceless.  And I think that the most awesome thing in the movie is when Mr. C is standing over the body of his baby and when the man looks in his eyes and he sees his daughter and he says, " I love you.  I love my girl.    My baby.  She has left this world and I have a job to do. "   If you are a fan of this movie you will love it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was well shot with a great score to go along with it. I have seen other actors in the film, but not a whole lot. The script was pretty good for a PG-13 movie, but the actors are really good. You would be hard pressed to find any actors in this movie that don't have a great voice.   I would love to see more of these actors in more movies.  I like to see the actors that came from television. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film shows a rather different side of the Japanese film industry from the one most Americans know, with a plot that takes a while to get into, but there's some neatness at its core that makes it a rewarding experience.   I really enjoyed the cast, and there was a couple scenes that made me laugh out loud. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this a couple of weeks ago and was totally blown away by this movie. The soundtrack is amazing and really adds to the mood. It's like a mix between The Shawshank Redemption and Inception, but better.  I'm amazed at how great this movie is.  It's so dark and creepy.   There are no happy endings, no happy things, but that is probably due to the fact that this was an independent film made by a bunch of people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not even have time to watch the trailer to this movie before it was released, but was very excited. I loved how it looked and played and that it told the tale of a young woman that was the daughter of a famous magician, played by the great Shirley Temple. This movie was perfect for the time period and it is not difficult to find on video. The movie was based on the first book by Harry Houdini by Houdan.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good:  The film is very well made and the actors are all great.  The movie's story and script is well done, especially the acting.  This is one of the best films about the JFK assassination I have seen.   This film is a great movie to watch with your family.  In a very short period of time, we see all the characters involved in the assassination of President Kennedy.  While the movie is great, the performances are well done as well.  I think this movie should be on more movie lists, as it has a lot to say and is very interesting.  It is also a great film to watch to get to know a lot of people who were involved in events surrounding the assassination.  Overall, a very good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My brother and I loved this movie. This is the best of the "Fantastic Four" movies. It is also the best movie in the Marvel movie series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was a bit of a treat.  I don't watch much old time TV, but I do watch old time radio, and I always have loved movies about old time Radio.  In this film, they got the whole gang together to play a radio station that was playing a song that was old time.  It was very good, a must watch for fans of the classic old time show.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm really impressed by this movie. It's pretty much like a good old-fashioned adventure film in a very entertaining style. The acting is great and the story is well written. The story about the three men who travel to the island of Far, Far Away is the most exciting part. The other two parts are a bit too similar but they are still good. The whole movie was a lot of fun and I didn't mind it all that much.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never thought that my husband and I would have so much fun watching "The Love Bug" over the years. We've seen it more than 50 times, and we love the movie. The dialogue is always clever and funny. We love to watch the old-timers laugh. I'm sure we'll make it the number one movie this summer. Thanks for sharing this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very enjoyable film, with some great laughs and good acting, and an important message.   The film is based on the true story of a family that lost the family dog in a tragic accident, and the tragedy they experienced afterwards, after a long search and a huge expense.  The movie is a beautiful, sad, and somewhat touching, story about a family who have no time for each other, but still manage to love each other.  A powerful message about what happens when you have to live without a family member, or if you have lost someone you love, even if the person you lost is not yet dead.  It is also a story about the real story behind the tragedy.  In a time where dogs are still regarded as the best pets, the family had to get rid of the dog because it was not fit for work.  After a long and painful search, the dog was finally found dead, but with no clues about the accident or where he came from.  He was put up for adoption, and later the family that had lost him, reunited with the man who found him, and it is they who are the ones in need of help after this tragedy. The man who finds him (who had been a very bad man before) is determined to prove his innocence, and find out the truth behind the accident. Â    It will be interesting to see where this story will go next, with the sequel set to be released.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie follows an average Joe and his sister who go to a nice lake for a relaxing summertime getaway. While there they run into a couple of local boys that have been there a while and are looking to have a little fun. It was nice to see this film on a big screen for once. The movie doesn't have a lot of suspense, but it was a nice change of pace for a good day on the lake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not usually a fan of action movies but this was fantastic.    It was great to see a group of kids going to war.  I would've been just as impressed if it was a couple of kids or just the group.  The stunts were impressive, and the story of these kids learning the basics of being a soldier was great.  This movie also showed how good the original Die Hard movie was.  Also, the soundtrack is great. Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this was really good. A really good thriller that was also suspenseful. It didn't feel like anything like another Hitchcock, it felt like something very different, and it really felt like a suspenseful film. I think this is an important film for Hitchcock's career. I really enjoyed it!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You don't hear the movie's title or description every day, let alone over a period of time, but the film still captures the essence of what it means to live in a society of total conformity. For someone like John Hinckley Jr., there is no room for individuality, and this leads to his decision to kill President Ronald Reagan and attempt to kill then-First Lady Nancy Reagan, even though his father had recently died.   The film was directed by Brian De Palma (who also made the similarly famous Night of the Hunter ), and its plot follows the events of the assassination attempts over the next couple of days. The director also uses the film to illustrate the dangers of our nation's overbearing police state and of our increasingly insane society. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've had this movie for over 20 years, and still go out of my way to see it every once in a while. I'm always surprised by how well it holds up. It has the charm of a great silent film, and some of the most exciting film moments I've ever seen.   A few of the film's most well-known stars appear (Kramer, Mink, Gurney), and the special effects were brilliant. It's a little dated now, but it's still a solid movie for classic movies fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the few films made in Hollywood that I'm proud to have seen, and I've never seen anything quite like it.   The performances of all the main characters are superb and the action scenes are great as well.  I loved the way the camera followed the actors as they went from one scene to the next and the close ups on their faces as they were laughing and doing whatever they did.  For a couple of years I was a huge comic book fan and this movie was like a comic book version of that, and it gave me an idea for a film that would bring some of those characters to life.  Another thing that made the movie so great was the musical score by the late Frank Zappa. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best film in the series (even better than The Fifth Element) is a fantastic sci-fi epic featuring one of the most convincing and terrifying acting performances by one of my favourite actors of all time, Laurence Olivier.   This is one of those rare instances where the director doesn't just have a plot or a plot point that he wants to explore, but the entire production.  The film was shot in a style reminiscent of old-school British television with great attention to detail and even some of the effects (such as the smoke) are so realistic and yet still look absolutely great (even the spaceship flying through the air with a cloud in the background, the film itself is beautiful).   Although the story takes a while to really get going, there's plenty of action and enough ideas and twists to keep you interested.  Laurence is so convincing in this that you don't even mind that he's doing a role that could be played by a lot of different actors.  If you've never seen a sci- fi film in which a robot speaks, then this film is definitely worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie I've ever seen. I watched it with my friends and our kids. We have never seen such an incredible movie. This movie is well worth the time and effort to see. The dialogue is well written, the story line is perfect and it really makes you care about the characters and their adventures. It is not a very good movie at all and its not meant for people who just want to sit back and relax. I really hope they make a sequel.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Bravo!   I have only seen this movie in theaters but the trailer alone, combined with the fact that it is one of the greatest films of all time is enough to get me to buy it! It is a fascinating look into how war turns a man into a killer. The entire film is like a dream.   This movie is not for everyone but it is for the kind of person who loves to have their minds blown. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In spite of the fact that the ending is somewhat unsatisfying I found the movie very enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been meaning to watch this movie for a while.  I never thought it would happen.  The best part about this movie is that you never feel like you are going through some clichÃ©, plot driven, movie.   It's actually very well acted, and you get to understand the characters better.  There's a reason why this movie was considered the movie that changed the way the movie business worked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been a fan of this movie for a while now and was surprised to find out that the movie actually existed.  It was shot in the late '70s and early '80s and stars the best part of the movie, Michael Keaton, and the best supporting actress, Meryl Streep.  While the movie may be in a silly but fun kind of way it has some serious heart behind it.   It's got a great plot, some terrific performances, and an ending that really hits home.  The movie is worth watching if you're a fan, and it's a shame it's not better known. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I just got back from seeing the last two movies in this "Mulholland Drive" trilogy and I really enjoyed them. This movie was a bit better, but still just a little less interesting than those two movies. I still enjoyed the performances of Richard Dreyfuss and Paul Thomas Anderson, although I feel a little sorry for him because the character wasn't that much of a loser.   It is definitely the first time I've seen the movie and it's been a while since I've watched it on TV.

I didn't like the ending, but that could be just because I'm a little lazy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this movie pretty hilarious but in a way that actually made me laugh, instead of just rolling my eyes at every bit of nonsense.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful movie about a man who found a treasure, and a treasure he didn't even find. The best part about this movie is, he goes back to the mine several times, and even finds a new mine, where he keeps the treasure. The first time he finds the treasure, he finds a tiny statue. I wish it was the other way around! It would make a better movie. I love the story line in this movie, the characters are all so unique.   I recommend this movie for all lovers of movie, history, or anything of this kind.

It really is a classic, like an old friend that I never got to see.Â  The music is beautiful, and it sets a wonderful mood. I never liked the musical number in the movie, but this was good. The cast were excellent. We've had amazing performances from the young actor Michael Caine and the Oscar winner Paul Newman. They were so charming. This movie, in all of it's sad, beautiful, sexy glory, is very different from any of the other films that I've ever seen.Â  This is what you make of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was my second time seeing the movie and I was very impressed by the direction.   From the very first shot it was obvious that this movie would be a true American movie.  It's got the spirit of a New Yorker with a New York touch.  The plot is very solid.  From there you can see why this was considered one of the great American movies of the 1920s.  I wish I could remember if I saw it in the late 70s/early 80s. I loved it when I saw the movie.   Recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a film fan, I think you will have a lot of fun with the films. The story and setting is very unique.   It has the feel of a story with a supernatural aspect that can only be described as the supernatural in the modern world.  It really makes you feel like you are watching a true story.  My only complaint is that I wish that there was more of it.  This film may have been overrated.  The ending, if you are not watching the movie as a whole, you may be looking for some sort of resolution.  I feel that they could have taken a bit more time with the character development.  Some of the characters are very cliche.

I can't remember any other movie that has such a perfect balance of humor, action and story, with a real "you can't make this stuff up" quality." --Mitch Hell No.1 "I think this is one of the best action movies ever made. It's amazing what an amount of money can do for a film. The cinematography, the special effects and the acting all work in unison. It just makes you love the movie all the more. If you're in the market for a great action flick, you can't go wrong with this one." --Dan Schoenberg "I know I should have seen this a long time ago. I had no idea there would ever be a movie like this." --Robert Patrick "I was just coming off my favorite movie of all time, Predator, so I was really excited for this new actioner, but was a bit disappointed. There's something to be said about a movie that feels totally new, but isn't really. I think it worked perfectly well, though." --Greg Fenton "The actors really do give these films a sense of energy and danger they don't really have in the movies." --Richard Coyle "I'd have to say that Predator was my favorite film of the last decade, so it was a real shock when I saw this one. The action scenes were incredible, the direction was terrific, the cinematography was perfect, the soundtrack was magnificent and the cast really nailed it. They have no idea how good they have it here." --Michael Biehn "I thought it was great. The acting was phenomenal. It wasn't like a "cameo" movie. I thought that was a great idea because that's how people watch it, they see it as a little cameo, but it was really a movie." --Tory Kittles "The Predator was so cool, it looked like it was going to take the movie to a whole new level. He was awesome! He was the real star of the movie." -Eric Roberts "I loved this movie. The way they built the Predator is pretty incredible, and I enjoyed the action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about a young man who has an affair with a prostitute who later murders him.  The director, Michael Haneke (The Artist, Blue Is the Warmest Color, The Wages of Fear), creates an incredibly realistic portrait of an unhappy love affair which is broken when he returns home to find her sleeping with a man who was paying her.  It's a powerful movie and if you haven't seen it, watch it now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not sure what to expect when I heard that this was a movie about a man who got a motorcycle, but I was more than excited when I saw the trailer. I didn't know if it was going to be an action movie like the one in The Terminator, or something more of a love story. I'm happy to report that it's the latter. The movie is very well made and well acted. In fact, it could be the first true action movie to have an all female cast. The only problem was when the action came. But I guess it's better than nothing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is one of the best of the '80s.   Director Richard Stanley gave this a great run.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  Richard Stanley is a great director, and this film is good.  The acting is great, and the story is good enough.  There is a scene that has the actors in a cemetery.  Then you hear a helicopter flying over.  It goes into the woods and then goes down in the creek.  This scene could have been in a bad movie or some horror movie.  In the end the helicopter disappears in the water.  But you see some kind of flash at the end of the film and then you hear the helicopter.  And the helicopter flies away.  If you don't know who Richard Stanley was, this movie is worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know much about the movie but it looked interesting so I thought I would give it a try.   The movie is a historical drama set in the 1780s about a group of New England Loyalists, a group that wanted to make a stand in what they felt was a "new world". The group of Loyalists were loyal to a very specific cause in particular, freedom of the Irish people.  The main characters are two young boys, who are captured by an English pirate who is using them as pawns in his plots.  They are found, but only in time to rescue them by an Irish patriot, named Patrick.  Patrick is a great character as he is portrayed as the "bad cop" of the group, he tries to get them to confess to whatever crimes they may have committed.  I was quite entertained as the plot progressed and I found myself rooting for the two young characters.  My only real complaint about the plot was that the pirates were very easy to outwit, as they seemed like very young children to me.  This is definitely a fun movie to watch, and I recommend watching it with a group, as it does take some time to get through the whole thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original concept was brilliant, but was ultimately ruined by too many changes, especially by Michael Ironside. But I found the end to be interesting, with some of the characters returning to give us a proper ending to the movie, and even an ending to this entire series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was beautifully made and I really enjoyed it. The story is well-written and intriguing, and I look forward to watching the upcoming sequel!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has so much of the great 80's comedy I love in it!   I love watching the 80's TV shows that they put on the big screen.   What makes this film amazing is that it's not only funny, but it's also realistic.  A woman has cancer and is only allowed to travel by horse and car. A small town that's all poor has a big hotel and a beautiful view from the top.  This movie gives an idea of what it was like when the 80s were happening, the people were all crazy and the show business was still going strong.  The actors are so wonderful in this.  And the music is great.  I will forever love this movie and I wish I was the main star.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm really glad I finally watched this movie. This movie has some great actors, a beautiful story, and a very dark look on life in the American south.   The acting was all great, including an awesome Richard Burton who played a great Sheriff in this movie and in the real life Sheriff who came out to support him, and he gave his best performance.  It was very disturbing and a bit unsettling at times.  This movie was a bit controversial at the time, but is even more so today.  The violence and the story were very realistic and it makes you feel for the characters as they struggle to make ends meet in this tough economy.  One thing that I really liked about this movie was the fact that they gave it a dark and grittier look, and this movie is really not as easy on the eyes today as it used to be.  My only complaint is that I think this movie could have been shorter because it just goes on and on and there were several long scenes in this film that I just didn't get. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie so much. There are only a few things that I don't understand. First of all, why did the cop who is investigating the murder get to the scene so quickly? We were in the car for over an hour, and in the movie he goes and picks up the phone to call the sheriff. Then, when he gets to the phone and sees it is still ringing... that's the end of the film. So, that could be something. Also, why is he using a siren when it would have been a much easier thing to get out of his car and get a gun? Also, who the hell is the guy that runs the jewelry store? Why was he there at all? Why wasn't he in his car? And the reason for him being there is...   The main character (the girl) is very strong, but I don t think she has much to do. She's just following someone else and isn't doing anything at all. There is a lot of running around and stuff, so I am guessing that she just has to get somewhere or something. But I do have to give some credit to the director and the producers for writing something that is entertaining and not a bunch of melodrama.   Overall, I highly recommend this movie. It will make you laugh and cry and make you feel a bit uneasy when you watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love movies that tell us about things that are happening right now. I also love documentaries on specific topics. This is both. My wife was so moved by the film's look at a world in which there is a war against man, a war where women are used as bait. The women are trained in the various ways they can be used and the men are trained to kill them. They use the women as a source of human shields as well as a way of keeping a lookout on them for the enemy.   The first time the soldiers and the women talk was very powerful, as were the conversations in between the men in the war.  Â  The film does a great job of showing us the war through the eyes of these young men, who are not only fighting in a terrible war but are seeing what it means to be used as a human shield.  And that makes you question things when you see them doing things that make you question if they are truly doing it for their families or for the survival of their country.  A great film for someone who wants a deeper look into the horrors of the war against men and women in the US and in other countries. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story itself is pretty simple but well put together, you have a character with a mental disability who is getting married and having kids (which they do) and it is the best film I have ever seen to come out of the LGBT rights movement.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very good movie, and an even better documentary. It tells the whole story, and is not biased. The author doesn't seem to care what the truth is. He just goes with the flow, showing us some facts and telling us what he thinks.    It's been a while since I've seen a film that makes me care about people. A lot of people in Vietnam didn't have a choice in the war. And those that did didn't do a very well job. People died because of poor planning, poor training, and lack of supplies. It was all in the mind of a crazy man. The story shows how the war became a war for profit and ego, and how we became the bad guys in a bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I watched this movie I was quite disappointed, the movie looked very dated to me, and the acting was all over the place, it wasn't even good acting, it was more of a bad acting job than good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent action movie that has enough humor, action and good performances to make it a memorable experience.

The ending is a bit too dramatic but it still is a good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first film in the series, and it's my favorite.   A well acted, well-acted, well written and directed movie that takes you on a journey that really makes you think.  In the course of the movie we get to meet the main character, a man who has had his life taken away from him due to a horrible mistake he made when he was a boy. He was given a chance to redeem himself at a young age and now in his mid 30s, he has a wife and two young kids. While the film does explore his story, it never gets to the point of him redeeming himself or how his life has changed since then. But he stays true to who he is and does his best to live his life and make the best of it.  This movie really puts a character and a story in your mind.  If you are looking for a good, well thought out film, and a good look into the inner workings of the human brain, this is it. I highly recommend it for all who want a good mystery movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not going to say too much, but I thought the film was pretty well-directed and well-acted, and it wasn't exactly anything to write home about, but it was definitely something worth watching and giving a shot (I don't usually do that). The cast was excellent as always (even the extras), and it's not always easy to make a good film, but this film managed to do that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this when I was in the 10th grade. It was the first movie I ever saw on TV that had anything to do with science. I think that my parents saw it to keep me quiet and away from the science stuff at school.   As a kid who loved movies and science (I even wrote a little paper on my very first trip to a science museum), it's amazing to me that my own love of science was so early that I could recognize some of the science in the movie, and I know there were at least a few kids who were just like me.  This is an extremely interesting film and a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very much based on the true story of the same name about a French Jewish family in the 20's who had a very strong anti-Semitic past. It was quite a feat for the director to capture that feeling.   The plot is pretty standard, and the film has a lot of violence, some of it graphic.  It's very good, and is very well-made.  Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After I saw the original, I immediately thought that this one was a better movie because it wasn't about the same story, but was completely different.   This movie is very well made, the actors are all good, and it is definitely worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you ever want to watch a movie where the acting is great, where the music is great and where the plot is great; where the characters are great, the dialogue is great... and where it makes you want to have a beer after it's over then "The French Connection" is for you.  I had never heard of this film but have been following it since it came out and am happy that I did.  The story of The French Connection is an old one and will probably be seen as old around 50 years from now.  We see a couple from the east side of Chicago who travel down to Miami to play the beach scene.  They're out partying and the sun's out when they get a call from a friend back in Chicago telling them about a dead body at the beach.  Things are looking up for these two and they take their two children, Sam and Joe, with them, because it seems like a good idea.  After arriving at the airport, the two of them decide that it's time to make a change, and head out to New Orleans, looking for a drug dealer.  It seems as if this would be a simple story with the right amount of tension and suspense.  This isn't it though.  Instead of going with the easy, predictable route of taking a boat or a plane, they go down to the docks, find a boat and head down.  You never know what to expect.  With their two kids in tow they make the trip, and upon arriving, the whole thing starts to get dangerous.  As the two are getting ready for bed, they discover that their friend has been murdered on the docks.  And it's not over just yet.  By the time the sun rises, Sam has gone missing and Joe is missing as well.  Joe is a little older than his little brother, but there's still a lot of things that don't add up.  So as the two try to piece together what happened and what is happening to them, we get a fun, entertaining, and often hilarious story.  All of the actors are very good.  Sam's brother Bill is amazing in this movie.  Bill is very convincing as Sam's older brother, and is very believable as a person in Sam's shoes.  Michael Caine and Jack Lemmon also give good performances, with Lemmon especially putting in some great comic relief in the film.  There are some great guest stars as
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It took me a while to finally watch this movie. The plot, from the opening scene, was something very strange and very off-putting. A group of three people are in a car accident. They are all unconscious and the man and two of the women are badly injured. Later it is found out that the man who hit the woman and injured the other two men is actually the wife of the dead man. She goes on trial for the crimes and is sentenced to life in prison. There are some weird scenes in the film like the woman having sex in the hospital with her baby before being sent back to jail, but overall this movie has some great acting, a great soundtrack and the plot was interesting. I'd recommend it for a first time viewer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked this movie. It was a nice little tale about a man who gets married to a strange, ugly woman.  He's told that if he wants to protect his family and himself, he must marry the stranger.  It's kind of a fun movie, although a bit silly, and it gets at some interesting issues about sex and romance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best movie I ever watched. It makes you love your country and its people.   You don't just enjoy it for its drama or the great acting. You feel for the characters.  For a movie where nothing happened, you feel like you can tell the lives of these people, the hardships they go through.  The people in this movie were real.  You know when you go to a country and feel like a stranger there. This movie made me feel like I knew all of those people who I saw on tv.  This is a great movie and I will be watching this movie again and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of classic cinema and was looking forward to seeing some new material. My only complaint was with the movie itself. It didn't do anything different from what we've seen before and it was predictable. However, the characters did well and it's nice to see such good actors like Jack Lemmon, Robert Mitchum and James Stewart on the screen. The music is good and the effects on the movie are incredible. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is a fairly simple one and not exactly complex. The story takes place in a small town called St. Peter, a quiet little town that has a great deal of charm. I liked the way the story was told. I also liked the character of the guy in the cafe who is very sensitive, very intelligent and very curious. The movie is about an aging author who had been living off his wife's pension and he's still living in the same house he grew up in. The writer lives a relatively peaceful life but all of that changes when he meets a young woman who is the daughter of his old lover. What really makes this movie special to me is that it's based on a true story. I don't think it's too original but the acting is good and it's a good looking movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just finished watching this movie a few days ago. It is one of the greatest and most beautifully photographed movies ever made. You will see just how good a film can look if you have a good camera and just enough money. If you like action, you will not want to miss this film. If this is your first time seeing an action film, don't let this discourage you, this is a really great movie and I highly recommend it for all action lovers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is one of the better films in the history of silent movies.   A couple of the best actors have done this movie, and the rest of the cast are pretty decent.  This movie is all about the people who were working and traveling around and had no idea what was going on.  I would watch this movie on a plane, while waiting to land, and be very bored.  It is very entertaining.  The acting is very good.  One of the most realistic portrayals of people in a train car in the silent era.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is set in a small town in West Virginia in the 1950's. A family (Hilary Duff and her sister) move to town and take over a failing bakery, which she runs as a hobby while working her real job. They are the kind of dysfunctional family that everyone who comes into the small town envies. Hilary has the housekeeper who is the family's only "loveable" daughter. The other kids in the neighborhood are either mean to Hilary or want her out. In the last scene the little girl walks in to the living room to say hello to Hil, and Hil's reaction is priceless! (My mother used to say, "That's the kind you want, the kind that makes you feel better about yourself"). The movie has it all, a good story line and a great soundtrack by Robert Randolph. In my opinion, the best part of the movie is when Hilary's mother comes in the living area to check on her daughter. She makes sure Hilary is okay, then leaves. Hil can't take her for granted, so she makes sure she's always on the lookout for her. This story is so realistic, you feel as though you know Hilary and her mother.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not a fan of the first version of this movie when I first watched it. After all, it was so close to being a disaster and they would not have been able to film it. But that was a long time ago and the new version has really improved.  And even with the changes it still has some of the best gore effects that I have ever seen. The new gore effects are much more subtle, and yet are enough to make the viewer uncomfortable enough to give a great scare.    It is a shame that it is not released in the USA, because the movie is very scary.  I will be watching this movie again and will definitely give it a 4 or 5, and would recommend it to a horror fan who enjoys a good old 80s movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film will satisfy anyone who wants a quick thrill. In the first few minutes we learn that the movie is based on the true story of a hit man and his last hit. The movie is a great ride. A man and woman fall in love, but then have a falling out. The action is very exciting. It has plenty of action sequences, but in the beginning it really just shows the love between the two characters.   The film was very well done and I was very pleased with the movie. The music is pretty much all there was to it.  I was especially interested in the love scene in the restaurant.  This is a must see film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is very much "Wings of Desire", the title alone tells the whole story. The story is about a group of men traveling to the Amazon to retrieve an unknown object that will allow them to travel to the world of fantasy and dreams. As they travel they are pursued by a group that believe the object is cursed and will kill them unless the men have sex with them.   While there is a story, it is told with such an absurd plot and so many ridiculous details that it makes you think that the filmmakers got a little too far into their fantasy world, and they just couldn't help themselves. I really enjoyed this movie and enjoyed watching the guys go off on this insane journey of love, death, sex, magic, and gods.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It seems to me that the writer of this movie, who apparently did not really know what to make of the character of John (Brett Ratner) at all, decided to make a "buddy film" out of this character, and so, as much as possible, we get to enjoy his love, friendship and adventures with his co-star, who, though very young, is so gorgeous that we have no idea if she was really as beautiful as she appears in the film, or if she is merely playing a pretty character, or even if she really was the daughter of the famous actor, who played her father in the movie. This movie is a "wonderful" romance with a great story, with a lot of tension and good performances.   For those who want to see a true-to-life classic, with great acting, and a good plot, I can't recommend this movie enough. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always loved movies about the wild west and movies with guns. A little over 10 years ago I saw an ad in the local paper for a "shoot-out" at the local "Canyon House" on a Saturday night. Of course, I had to go. It was about midnight and a huge crowd of people were in attendance. The bartender gave me the "Canyons" sign for free. I got in the car and drove the 20 minutes to a deserted canyon. I saw my friend shooting at the other guys. He had a pistol, but I don't think he would shoot any of them, if he didn't have to. This was the start of a few long nights and a lot of drinking. I didn't think it would turn into a movie, but it did. I'm still a big fan of these movies, so when I saw "Old Glory" it was almost a disappointment. I was hoping for something different. "Old glory" did have it's charm. A great cowboy movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been waiting to watch this movie since it was first shown and finally got a chance to watch it with my son. We went to see it at an old time theater with an audience of 3 people. It was not crowded but I noticed that when a couple were going to sit down in a row to watch, the 2 couples in front of them went away without any warning. So the only other couple at the theater when we went to watch the movie were 4 adults and 2 children.   It had a good cast and it wasn't really a scary movie but you could tell that the story was serious.  It was about a man that got in a car accident and woke up and saw that he was not alone.

This film has the quality and production values you would expect from the first season. The special effects and costumes are top notch.   The acting and chemistry between the characters is also top notch in this film. The chemistry between everyone is spot on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen this film yet, so my opinion might be wrong, but this movie is actually really funny. It is a spoof on the film "Airplane! " and features many hilarious scenes that makes you laugh and feel silly when you realize how ridiculous the movie really is. I'm sure that this movie was filmed at the same time that the first one was, but I think that the comedy here is much better. I like how they took the famous scene from the original "Airplanes!" ( I think it's a really good scene), and made a spoof of it.   My friend and I really enjoyed this movie and even though it is a parody, I think this movie really hit the spot, it's actually funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film while in New York a few years ago. It is a must see for those who love science fiction. I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that not a lot of SF/F films from this era are in a museum, since it is the golden age of science fiction and it was only a few decades ago that we had films like Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2, Alien, and The Empire Strikes Back.   A lot of people love this film for its science fiction aspects, like a few of the aliens were not CGI. I also like the fact the film did not try to be a 'comedy' with some of the jokes. It was a real serious film.  If you love sci-fi, this is a great flick to check out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film on a school field trip and was instantly captivated by the story. The concept of a "war" between nations over a young girl has always caught my attention. I'm sure this film may have been inspired by the fact that, just a few decades ago, I'd be traveling around the country talking about the Cold War with fellow students and our families and we'd all be talking about an imaginary war that never actually existed. This is a fascinating film that will give you some interesting and thought provoking discussions to continue on.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite part of this movie are the performances of the main characters.   I never thought I would see a more mature and intelligent Bruce Willis and Robert De Niro in the same movie.  They just worked really well together and gave us both some great scenes.  John Travolta and Rosie Perez gave amazing performances.  Even though this movie was made in the 80's, the acting is much more believable than the movie was set in.  I guess if you are looking for a good action movie, this movie is a good choice.  This movie is also very funny.  It is not a great comedy but if you like watching guys get into hilarious situations, it will not disappoint. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen this movie so I cannot really comment on it, but it is one of those rare good comedies that I remember liking back when I was a kid. There is some good acting, and that is important for a comedy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you like science fiction, you will like this.   The movie is a classic from the early 1960's.  They use a very old camera, so the color is a bit out of focus and grainy, but the movie is great.  I think there are too many scenes from the movie that I want to see on film.  The director, Robert Heinlein, also wrote the book and screen play.  This is one of those movies I wish I had known about when I was younger.  If it was on DVD, I would buy it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was skeptical about this movie, but it lived up to the hype, and I'm glad I watched it. It's an entertaining story, and the acting was great. The story was told well and the scenes in the background were really well animated. My only complaint was the fact that there wasn't enough time between the beginning of the film and the end of the movie. It could have been more time to allow the plot to develop, but that was just my own personal opinion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you love the original, this one will be the exact opposite.   In addition to being a great movie, it also makes a fantastic tribute to the original.  I had never seen the original but my kids wanted to and this movie is great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband was a big Star Wars fan growing up and had a couple of his "old" film reels on VHS. The two he had were a rough copy of the 1977 version and the original 1981 re-make. I bought this in 1981 to watch him on VCR and it was so much fun to watch. I have seen all the movies that are on it and can honestly say that I enjoyed it.   The Star Wars films were a big influence on me growing up so the original trilogy was an eye-opener for me.  Thanks to the VCR, I have a huge collection of old VHS and the Blu-ray was a huge hit for me to show my dad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is worth a watch for anyone. I was not sure at first but once the trailer played the trailer was enough to get me to watch this movie. I think I'm in the minority that doesn't enjoy sci fi and action films. Sci fi and horror movies tend to be the same type of movie over and over again and that is where the fun ends. I always prefer the drama and character development of the movie. This movie definitely has the right balance of both. It is well worth watching and I recommend to anyone with an interest in sci fi. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a classic.   If you've ever watched a movie where the two women have a relationship, this is that movie.  You would see it at a friend's house, maybe with a friend, and the movie would be about 2 guys, and two women, and it would be a comedy, and funny, and you'd laugh so hard you'd start to cry at the end.  This film was a staple of the 80's for sure, and I think it's just the right time to bring it back, for all those who loved it and never got a chance to see it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very well made. I have seen many movies on the small screen with this "look" and they are all bad. However this movie is good. I recommend this movie for the fans of the genre.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great buddy comedy about two good looking friends who decide to go undercover as a drag queen in order to sell cocaine. What makes this movie so great is the characters of Danny and Steve. I never got into the story of the movie until Steve gets into it with a group of bikers and he just goes off and has a great time. They're both so funny in this movie and it makes for one fun watch. This movie was made in 1981, but it's one of the most enjoyable movie's I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this film. It is definitely a character piece, and it is the best of its kind.   The plot is interesting, and very well written.

I enjoyed watching the film, and really wish more films like it would be made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is amazing. It has some wonderful performances and the plot is incredible. It's a great idea and the actors execute it flawlessly.

This is my favorite movie of all time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little hesitant at first to watch this movie but I found that it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. The music and the acting was great. It didn't have the most amazing plot, but it had a lot of great scenes and that was all that mattered to me. It made for an interesting and emotional movie to watch. It is very dark and really got into some of the characters personal and psychological issues and that made it a great movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie. It was fun, well acted and pretty fast paced. The movie was written and directed very well, it was a really entertaining movie that has great fight sequences, and a good pace. I like the movie and will probably see it again when it is released on DVD.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is pretty typical, with the main characters being a couple who is being pursued by the government. The plot was great and had some interesting moments, like the one where the main character runs away from his pursuers to go to a park to find a place to hide and then gets caught and arrested by the police. The story had some really good twists and had a sense of mystery to it. The actors did their best, and the film didn't have a big cast, so most of the roles were played by people you don't see very often in movies. The acting is great and the directing was also good, especially with some really well placed camera shots and great close ups.   I don't watch horror movies as much as other kinds, but I really enjoyed this one!   It's a decent horror movie, but for the sake of being different, the film doesn't really do anything special.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen all the old silent films, but I only saw one in the 1950's. I'd heard of it before, I was too young to see it, but it had an impact on me.   It's the story of an escaped convict who, after escaping, is hunted by the cops. The movie makes no attempt to hide that.  A movie I never saw when I was young but enjoyed as an adult.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I loved this movie.   I think it has something that will always be a classic for me.  For me it was the perfect mix of the original and the sequel.  This movie really showed a whole new side of a character who I still love, Jack Nicholson.  The movie was an amazing mix of action, comedy, romance, and a great mix of characters.  I know this movie was hard for people to watch when it came out and it wasn't a hit at the box office, but I think with time it will be looked back on as one of the best movies ever made.  It really showed how great Nicholson is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked the movie, and I thought it was good. I don't know how to describe the acting but the movie had a lot of people in it that had their own scenes and I think that was a great thing. I was not a big fan of the film, but I did like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw The Great Mouse Detective when I was five or so years old. My parents borrowed a videotape from the local Blockbuster. The movie itself is very well done, with good acting and a wonderful voice. The great part is that the film takes place over a short time period: just a couple of years, but it still holds the attention of the young boy who loves the detective and the detective himself. The picture of a mouse in a detective's costume and the music are perfect for the era and the kid can get a little misty eyed while watching the movie.  The Great Detective is a charming tale, filled with wonderful music and a great voice.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason I love this movie is because it's like a fairy tale.  It's about two sisters who move from their home village to a new village.  The story is simple and you don't need to read all the stuff that was written in the newspapers to understand it.  One thing I will say about the story is that it is not for everyone.  And I don't think it's as good as a good fairy tale movie is.   It does get to you and that's why it gets a 6 out of 10, I would recommend it to a family that enjoys fairy tales but doesn't really like the "romance" in them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I could only have a single DVD of my own, it would be this. There is just a beautiful, haunting sound to this picture that is hauntingly beautiful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What I have to say about this movie is that it is a real treat. This movie has been made in France for a long time. There is no censorship here.   It is a very good movie, very interesting to watch.  There are many different characters and even more places and time of time in this movie.  The best part is that there are no long boring sequences like there are in most other movies.  One of my favorite movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A pretty good film. As mentioned in other reviews, it's a bit dated, but as a teen horror flick, it was pretty good. My biggest qualm with the movie is that, at some parts, it seems like you're supposed to just sit there and enjoy the scares and not react to them.   I guess I'm just old school. I grew up with this movie. I watched it at least a dozen times, and I always just sat there, watching the lights go on and off, the people in the hallways, and not doing anything. I still want to see the movie.

This was a great flick for the kids.Â  It had all the scenes that kids wanted to see.Â  You could tell that the director wanted to put all the action in this film because of the young kids in the audience.Â  They laughed throughout the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A real gem. It is so much better than I expected, and so much more enjoyable to watch than I feared. I could not find another movie like it anywhere, especially a movie that is as emotionally honest as this one is. A great job on all levels. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The most famous of all the film noirs, and the only one I've seen it myself,"   - Roger Ebert,   --Alfred Hitchcock,  A rare example of film noir in action. In a typical film noire story, a detective is sent to New York City to solve the murder of a famous stage magician. Instead, the detective is sucked into a criminal case and eventually gets entangled with a criminal who is himself also in the clutches of a mysterious conspiracy. A great movie, with some great performances. This was a very expensive production at the time, with many locations, and many expensive sets and costumes to be built, but the director and producers pulled off the task and the result is wonderful.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had seen this before on my first viewing of the movie, but only now saw it in its expanded format. I always look forward to seeing this movie and love how it keeps you glued to your seat throughout.   The picture in the extended edition is fantastic.  What is more amazing is that the movie is not just set in present day, but shows what life was like back in the 1800's as the US is still struggling to find a stable path of the nation.  The film has the look of a time that is lost to time, and yet somehow it is quite realistic.  It is as if you are walking through time.  This movie has the feeling of being an ancestor to the present, with every scene as if they took their time getting this correct.  I would highly recommend this to any movie fan that loves to see historical movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After seeing "Fury" at a screening a while back, I was very impressed with the film's technical achievement. This is an extremely intense film, and it looks as though it was shot on a very low budget. The story is also fairly unusual for a Hollywood blockbuster: there are no super hero types, or even heroes at all; instead, there's a lone detective and his partner, who investigate a serial killer who is murdering young women in the streets of New York City. It's a very well-told story, and if you're a fan of thrillers, you should definitely check this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really love this movie.  It had a very dark mood which I was not expecting.  As an actor and as an actor for that matter I was amazed.  This movie is not really about the movie itself but the performance of its star, Peter Falk.  He really plays the role of an alcoholic which you see.  We also see the lives of the people and how they try to get a hold of him and how he eventually turns to drink again.   The movie is really about this man's descent and the impact it has on him and the family.  The whole movie is very intense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very good movie!   The acting is excellent - there's a lot of them in it, and they make it real.   I love the humor, and I love that this is a movie that really explores sex, and doesn't hold back.  For the most part, it gets the point across, and the way the two sex stars talk is hilarious.  This movie is a great example of the kind of movie that can be a bit too serious for younger audiences, but that can't be said about many of these movies.  I recommend this movie for anyone who's not sick of the same old sex-ed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie several times. When I first saw it as a kid, I felt the same thrill as a child has when they watch the classic "Batman" movie. The movie is set in the early 20th century and is about a man who was a criminal for years but then changed his ways and went back to being a man of his word. When he got involved in some bad stuff again and had his life destroyed. He finally had no other choice but to give himself up.   The movie has all the classic elements that make this movie stand out in the crowd. It is fun and fast paced and will have you going back and forth watching this movie again and again.  A must have movie for all ages.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those classic films that you will remember for years to come. My favorite part is the scene when the police arrive and ask to search the house. Everyone is completely freaked out by the officers and have a good laugh at the officers' expense. Everyone except for one person, of course.   I think you get what you pay for.  The dialogue was great, and the acting was excellent, from all involved. It has a feel of being off-screen.

It's not as good as the first one, but it still has a lot of the charm of the original.   A nice change of pace from "The Secret of NIMH" and "Gremlins".   You'll want to watch it, if you have the time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this film, but I was told that it was a very good film. I was very disappointed when I watched it. The acting was very bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts out fairly slow, but it builds to a high-stakes, action-packed climax.   This is a movie about an escaped prisoner who manages to get to the US through the Suez canal, where he is forced to work for an international crime organization, the Syndicate.  The movie does a fine job of conveying the feeling of terror and violence that this would-be criminal must experience.  This movie could use a little bit more blood, but the story still holds the viewers' attention.  A lot of people, including myself, are familiar with the movie "The Untouchables" as the basis for this movie. This movie also gives a nice origin to the character of Tony Montana. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good. It is a great character-driven movie. The director, Peter Weir, has made a great film.   It is definitely an action-oriented movie.  This is the film that would make Steven Seagal want to be in a movie and he did this.  The only problem I had with this movie is that the director had to rely on stunt-work, which is hard on the body.  I would have loved to see more character-based movies like this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best one with a real plot, interesting characters, interesting locations. This film has a great story line, and the acting is top notch.   This film is great because it gives us a real character study of a good detective.  It makes you feel as though he is you, and he is on a very personal journey.  I also like that they don't pull any punches with the way he solves his case.  A must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is told as a story of revenge. It is the only time a Hollywood movie has ever depicted real revenge. There are a lot of famous characters in this movie, but none of them are more memorable than Jimmy Stewart. His performance as a veteran of the Spanish Civil War as a woman who can only speak Spanish is amazing. Stewart is a great actor and he never loses the plot of the movie. This movie is filled with action. The battle scenes are incredible. The only thing missing are the famous explosions that occur in the first half of the film. But they are not as explosive as in the later parts of the picture. The ending is very dramatic. I think it was made just for the movie and it shows.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've never seen a more convincing attempt at creating a classic movie than Hitchcock's Psycho. Not only is it a masterfully crafted movie, it's also a surprisingly funny movie. Â It's hard to tell exactly how much of this is Hitchcock's work and how much is the work of a different guy, but it's definitely not just anyone.   It's hard for me to think of another film that has such a well-observed relationship between characters.  The script is brilliant.  Everyone is written well, and they're all extremely well acted.  I never thought of Hitchcock as a great screenwriter, but the relationship between Norman Bates and his mother is a really great example of how good he was at creating relationships.  There's a scene where the young Norman goes to see his mother after she's been shot, and his dad goes along as well.  In a scene that's almost too perfect to be real, Norman tells his father that his mom didn't really shoot her son, and that's the last thing she ever said to him before she pulled the trigger.  This scene doesn't make any sense, and Hitchcock does a great job of showing why it doesn't.  Hitchcock also does a nice job of creating tension.  It is easy to think that the story about his mom and her relationship with her husband was just a way for the story to introduce a new character and show off Hitchcock's directing skills.  But I think this is all really about the characters. The relationships between them are so believable, and it's clear how much this is going on in the minds of these people.  As with any great story, it takes a little bit of luck to see what happens.  One of my favorites is the scene at the bar in the movie where Bates is talking to his mother.  He's looking for some clues about his past, and then he ends up talking to her.  She's so convincing as a person.  After watching it a few times, it all becomes clear.  Like I said, it may be a little odd to watch the film with people around, but that's what makes it so fascinating to me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The picture is really good and the performance is even better. The movie is really nice. I didn't watch the whole movie but the first scene that starts with the first person coming into the picture and the sound of the first voice and that's it. The second scene with the third person is really sweet but the movie isn't over. It really makes you feel bad for these people and their life. I really enjoyed this movie and it is not to bad either.

I enjoyed the ending, and I'm glad I found it, I thought it was great. I liked the romance between Marla (the main character) and Mr. Jones.  If you like the movie, and like a good adventure movie, this is a great movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is an absolute treat for any aficionado of the genre. It was well made by the director, Michael Curtiz (who also acted as co-writer) and was in fact shot in black and white, allowing for greater contrast and detail in many shots. The score by the Italian composer Giovanni Salvemini is very good, and is an integral part of the film. It is in the style of a spaghetti western, with plenty of galloping horse action and some excellent dialogue.Â    A wonderful film, that manages to be both entertaining and informative. I'm glad that I finally saw this, and would highly recommend it to any fan of the series.

I am a huge fan of Robert Altman's work and I know that his movies will stay with me for a very long time. It is just amazing that he can make a movie like this.  The music is just great as well. I love the "Ode to Joy" soundtrack by the Byrds and this movie would have been even better with that same soundtrack.  This is a must see movie for any movie fan.

It's a film noir, with a cool car chase at the end.  The ending was pretty cool too.  I really enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have just seen this movie and it's great. It's very original and it has many different characters. A few actors were very good. It really shows how strong the writing was.   Also very happy I saw it, as it was a nice change of pace. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is simple: an attractive, blonde woman (Cate Blanchett) is in her mid-40s, the daughter of an affluent European businessman, and is living in a seedy rooming house with her two teenage daughters. After some minor trauma (a break-in), the woman becomes bedridden and in a coma. In a bizarre twist of fate, one of the daughters, Susan, is now 19 and has an interest in the young woman's history of crime, and eventually becomes romantically involved with her.   What I liked best about this film is how it presents the characters and their relationship with each other in such a different way, and without being overly sentimental.  This movie is a beautiful and very funny work of art that is not just for adults. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a nice movie for an old time. The sound quality was excellent. I had never seen the movie in the cinema so I don't remember much about it, but it was a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always loved movies about small-town life, so when I saw this, I was very curious. In fact, I went out of my way to see the movie, as I like to watch it at home.   This film follows the life of a young girl named Linda, who has moved from Pennsylvania to her small hometown in Indiana to work as a waitress. Linda is a sweet young girl, but she has her troubles. Her father has recently died, and she lives with her mother. Her mother has a job as a secretary, so Linda takes care of the house while she looks for a job.  After working for a while, Linda decides to take up the piano, and the people in her small town realize that she's quite talented.  But the people of her small community are not all that happy about this.  The town has a very conservative view on the use of music, and is very concerned about Linda using music to attract men to her. She has also made it clear that she doesn't want to get married.  What makes this even more disturbing to Linda is that her mother is getting older.  Linda begins to wonder about her mother, and in the middle of one of the concerts, she finds her mother's body.  Even though it's not quite what she had expected, the film is still a very interesting watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this in the late 80s, when it was a new film with unknown stars.  The story is about a girl from small town, Georgia who makes a name for herself in the Hollywood movies, then loses everything. She leaves home and is caught and sent to prison by the FBI. The story of how she got in jail and out of jail is just unbelievable.    The film is very funny, and it's been around for years.  There are a lot of old actors in the movie, and I always love watching movies with old actors like the guys in this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always loved horror films, but this one is great. There is something very scary about the idea of a family that doesn't know what has happened to them, and the kids are the perfect puppets to drive that message home. I was in the audience with my husband and kids and it was a great night out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main part is done great and it's interesting to have a whole movie about an army of soldiers who are trying to escape from a big battle in the middle of the desert.   I didn't get the feeling that there was a lot of action, but that's because it was set in a desert. It has a great soundtrack and is definitely worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title was a little misleading as it was more of a historical drama, but the story and performances were outstanding.   A lot of effort was put into putting on a credible, realistic look at the Battle of Gettysburg.  The actors did a great job.  A big part of the story was told in flashbacks, and it was a great device to have flashbacks that didn't really belong in the story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen the movie "Lucky" but I know from the description of it. This movie was based on a book by Jim Thompson. I saw this in a theater in the 70's and was in awe of the performances by everyone. I just thought it was a good time to watch. There is an 80's soundtrack that is really good and I loved that the actors were playing their own characters instead of just being a part of the characters they were playing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is awesome. There is no acting skills needed. I was watching this with my wife. We enjoyed the movie immensely. The movie was about the first man to walk on the moon. He was trying to convince his people that he was going to land on the lunar surface but he didn't. He never got that far. Then he met an astronaut who flew with him on the first mission. The two of them had a conversation. The astronaut said he felt like a dog.  This film gave me great goosebumps.   If you are thinking about making a mission to the moon or any other space mission, make sure to watch this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed watching this movie so much. It's about a man who is being haunted by some spirits after his wife dies. The movie is not scary but it is creepy and I loved it.   This movie is great. I think this movie deserves more than 2 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was not as good as I remembered it to be. I saw it in theaters and was so surprised to see that the story was not like I remembered. The acting was much better than the film. But the acting still had a funny aspect to it. I did not see all the performances but I noticed that there was no one in it who could pull off the high drama like you see on the screen. The most talented character was the reporter who was able to put her own spin on the situation and the ending was much more interesting than the one on the film...but not by much. It was just not good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first read the synopsis for this movie I thought it was another movie that would only be used for the cheap thrills that came with it.Â  The movie itself I thought would be a bit more interesting than that but as a fan of the series I figured it would have some interesting moments to it. I'm glad I thought that because the movie itself was pretty good and even with a few slow moments the movie kept up the pace.Â  A great villain to use is Dr. Henry Jekyll who has some good moments in the movie and also has a scene with a pretty hot and pretty much nude woman.   I would recommend this movie if you're a fan or if you don't want to waste your money on something lame.Â  I would definitely recommend it but just because you like the show and don't think you need a movie to show it off doesn't mean it's a bad movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My brother saw this on the tv before I did, and after seeing it for the second time, I finally did. I loved it! This film is really scary. I'd say it is the scariest film ever, although I think it is more of an urban legend. The atmosphere in the film is very good, and the acting is perfect. I enjoyed the film so much, I still watch it regularly, and if I had to pick one of the films that I love to watch over and over, this is it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The way he plays it is very different from a typical detective, because of his attitude and attitude is a bit more. When he is talking about what he has found in that building, he's not interested about this building, but in it's history and all the lives that were in it. So when he's talking to a man about the history of the building he says he has a name for the building: the "Murderer Building". But the building was not that kind of building. When the detective found out he put the man in the hospital. In the end he's found out that the man is the murderer, the man who murdered his wife, and the man he was married to, and he was also married to a woman that was married once to a very good man. So he was just a murderer, a sadistic murderer. He's not very smart, but he's very dangerous. He killed one or two people and he didn't have a reason. So, you know, he is a very dangerous man. He didn't want to tell the truth, he didnÂ´t want to stop the building, and it was quite easy for him, because he didn' t have a clue. The person that he met when he was walking around the neighborhood, this woman, she was so nice and she told him something about his wife and he went into a room and opened the drawer and there was the key to the drawer, the key for the murder building. He was so happy, and when he left he went to the detective and the detective was so much happy, but the detective had no clue, no clue who that man was, but then he found a note in a drawer that said he was working for a man that killed many people, many people that were innocent, that were not guilty. So you know he got the clue and he caught the killer. And this movie is amazing."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would be hard pressed to not recommend this movie to anyone. I was always curious about it but never really bothered to watch it. I had just gotten out of a movie and decided I wanted to go see a movie so I rented this one at my local multiplex. After seeing the movie I was hooked. The script was so well written and the performances were great. The cinematography was very interesting and the use of sound was done so well I almost felt like the characters were talking to me.   What this movie did for me was to turn me off of everything I had ever seen or heard about. I think I would recommend this to anyone who has never seen a horror film before. I would also strongly recommend it to anyone interested in going into the world of vampires, werewolves, and ghosts. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is great and a really great movie. This is a movie I would have loved to have seen when I was a kid. The story revolves around a group of kids that get caught up in some big world drama. I will admit I was disappointed by the ending and it was not as good as I had hoped it would be. The ending makes me wonder why the ending was not left for the next movie.   I will definitely watch this one again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As with any good action movie, The Hunt (1960) was not without its faults, but it did have a couple that were particularly cool. The Hunt's first cool moment comes when the villain, Colonel Kurtz (Walter Pidgeon), fires his pistol. After it has a good whiz-bang crack and it goes off, an explosion erupts from the tip of the gun. It is very neat and very cool.   I loved the second cool trick.  The Hunt was one of the first major black-and-white action pictures. In order to make the film look good, special effects were used in a way that was both effective and not cheap.  This is one of those movies that I really liked.  In a way, The Hunting was a precursor to James Bond. The action was cool and the story was cool. I liked it.  I wish I had known about it when I was a kid!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie about a man in his 30's who becomes a woman. It's not a good idea. I wish he could change back into a man. I know people have done it. This movie is about that person who goes from a man into a woman, and when he gets a job at the factory as a woman and then wants to be a man, he finds that he can't act like a woman because he's scared of being fired.   I can't recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've only watched this movie a handful of times. I've always loved the original, but this movie was a fun and entertaining change of pace.   My wife and I had the opportunity to see it at the B-day party for my father-in-law.  The film is set during the early 70's in a small town in Michigan, and features a great cast of characters, including a little known and very funny actor called Don Knotts. I really didn't know too much about Don Knots prior to seeing this movie. I love his movies. They are so memorable and well written. This was one of them.  While the plot of this movie is very well developed, it doesn't feel like one.  It feels more like a long, well thought out short story, with the added bonus that it has a great script.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I was hoping would be a classic, with an almost perfect ending. Unfortunately, it turned out not to be the classic it seemed like it should be. The only other thing that could have made this movie a classic is a little more time spent on the relationship between the parents and their kids. A more interesting family dynamic would have made the whole movie far more enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a must see film for fans of The Shining. Stanley Kubrick created one of the most masterfully filmed movies of all time. It was made to be seen, and if you have not seen it yet, do not pass up this opportunity to see it again! The story is quite simple. A married couple are trying to escape their insane leader, who is planning to poison their child in an attempt to take over the world. The ending is incredible and one of my all time favorite films. The actors portraying the two characters are great. The special effects are amazing and some are even considered to be among the best in film history. This movie is well worth watching and is a definite must see!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on the big screen for the first time about ten years ago and was not impressed. It reminded me of the kind of thing you see in a lot of the B-movies that come out of England during the 60s and 70s. It was not very interesting or thought provoking and all I remember was the girl that played the prostitute in one scene and the big black guy that shot the girl in the other.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie.  It's a film about a very sick woman who makes decisions that would get anyone fired from a job.

If you are looking for a film to watch with a friend or have just seen it, give it a try.  I recommend this movie to everyone.

So I'm amazed at the number of times I've watched it, and it never gets old.Â  It's so good, I'll just have to watch it over and over.Â    One thing I don't understand is why it's never been remade.Â  The original was a good film (I just thought it was made in Hollywood when I was little).Â  Â   The special effects were better.Â  Â  What can I say, it's my favorite movie from the 70's.Â  I saw it as a child, and I can still see that film's "color and motion" even with 70 years of age.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a true gem! The film takes place in the 1960's and is all about a group of friends in a small town that get together for a camping trip.

The ending is truly the best part of the film and the music is amazing. If you love movies like this you should definitely check out this movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friend and I went out for a night of fun and ended up in a bad situation. A woman came up to me in an elevator and said that we needed to get some help. I was feeling very confused at the time and didn't think I could help her and she had a bag she was going to take with her. She was very polite and I was grateful for the attention I was getting. At the time I didn't even have a sense of what she was asking for but the more I thought about it I realized that we had the exact same situation and I didn 't have anything else in my possession. I made the decision to help her in an attempt to not get arrested. I am grateful for my friend's kindness and kindness toward me, which led to an enjoyable evening. It also was a great way to end the evening.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in the theater when it came out and, while I enjoyed it, I was not expecting it to hold up this well, and I didn't.  I loved the way that the story was told in this film.  This was more about the lives that people lead than the exploits of some soldiers.  It is very much about these three characters, and they have very good chemistry together.   My favorite character in this movie was the young kid who was just a little boy and was a great foil to the adult characters.  The scene with the boy and his aunt in the kitchen is the most moving scene in the film, I had tears in my eyes watching that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is good.   I think that the film does a good job of representing the real world of a high school kid in his early twenties.  I don't think there is anything "too" good about this film; it's just very well done and it has its "wow" moments.  It's a fast paced action film and has a good sense of humor.  The ending is a little too "hokey" (no offense to the makers of High School Musical or anyone else), but it was done in a way that it seemed appropriate and it made sense.  There's something sad about watching this film because I've heard the music of the film's songs on the radio and I've read a couple of interviews with the film, and I really enjoy the music.  If you want to see a film about an older man who likes teenage boys and is just trying to do his best for his family, check this film out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that for a director to be able to make a movie with so much passion and honesty is really hard.  He managed to capture the essence of what is great about horror films.  The story is well told with strong performances from the two leads, even if they don't always seem to feel like it.  What I really enjoyed about this film was the fact that the director managed to tell a story that could be true or false at any given moment.   In many ways, he made a true horror film.  This is a film that should be watched, even now. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie much more than the two other one I saw, and thought that it was much more fun than the one I watched last year.  The acting was so good that you just don't know who you're going to be seeing.  This movie is a comedy and I had a laugh out of it and would have laughed out of this movie without even seeing it.  It's about a couple of idiots that go up to a couple girls in a bar and ask them to dance, but the girls refuse, so they end up running out of the bar.  As soon as they run, the girls come back and ask the idiots to dance again.  So these idiots go up, this time getting away with it, and the girls dance with them for a while.  One of the guys just wants to go home and get high, so he does a lot of dope shit all night, while all of the girls get freaky and do all kinds of sex stuff.  When they start getting really freaky, the guys finally get up the nerve to leave.  Then we have this weird sequence that takes place in the back of a van.  After we get to the back, the whole thing is shot on video.  I think this movie would be much better with subtitles, but we don't really see any of the text anyway.  There's a guy that is obviously very stoned (the guy that does all of their dope stupids) and the other guy who is just a total jerk.  He seems a little crazy, like he's going through a mid-life crisis or something, and has an attitude and attitude.  Once we get in the van, the guy who smokes all of his dope, gets totally paranoid, and starts telling them to not do anything.  And the girl who refuses to dance gets more paranoid, too.  But then we have some crazy shit happening, like a big explosion on the van. Â  I think the movie would have worked better if they had just told us that the guy had a gun and was trying to rob the girls or something.   It doesn't really feel like the story is going anywhere, but that's fine because it's just a bunch of idiots goofing around.  In the end the girls go back and they go home, but it's all over. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was so good. I never heard a bad review on this movie and i was watching it from the beginning. It was so intense. The character development was perfect. They all had such different stories. They never got caught. The way they were taken down was unbelievable. They really got the hang of the weapons and the way it was set up. I loved this movie.

It was definitely worth the trip. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This movie has a lot of good things in it, especially if you enjoy the action films. But it does also have a lot to be careful about."   This movie is one of my favourites. It is not exactly my favourite action movie. But I love the way they make it look like a classic B movies. If you are into that genre and are looking for something to watch on a rainy day, then you can't go wrong.   It has some decent action scenes. The story is good, but I found it rather short. The characterisation is ok, the action and the action scenes are well done, but the story is a bit rushed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After being disappointed with several of the recent releases in the genre, I was thrilled to see this film. It stars Gary Oldman, who has proven his ability to bring authenticity to any movie he appears in. It's very well made with excellent acting, and very little gore, which is a big plus. I can imagine the film being shown in a theater when it came out. I was surprised that I got more out of it than I did of some of the earlier offerings in this genre. I will definitely be watching this film in the future.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this was a great movie. I saw this at a movie theater in a really good part of town. This was the first time I saw the movie, so the story was a bit tough for me to get into. I think the movie was about a girl, who was raised in a small town. She has been in a relationship with a guy who isn't very well off. When she is invited to an auction of his grandfather's possessions, she decides to go along with it, and ends up falling in love. It is hard to watch her get into these situations. It's hard to believe that she's so young. She is obviously very capable, and is pretty intelligent. She's a very good actress, and really hits the mark every time she plays a certain character. The action in this movie is really good, and it has a nice mix of real and fake. The soundtrack is fantastic. I really liked the acting in this. I've never seen anyone so convincingly likeable. I love the way she plays this girl that doesn't have anyone who loves her. I wish she wasn't married to that guy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first saw the "Shoeless Joe" movies in the 1980's as a little boy watching them on tv. The first one made me laugh out loud.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is one of my favorite action films of all time. It has such a great energy to it. It's like watching a different film. And the music in the film is a little eerie at times. It makes me think of something from the "Scream" series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I don't think I've seen a more entertaining movie thanÂ  Serenity Â (2011).   The film is based on the book Serenata by Joe Haldeman and is about a female pilot (Jessica Alba) who has to stop a rogue mercenary (Alan Rickman) from destroying Earth in a plot to take over the planet.   In the movie, we see the evil plan coming to fruition as the ship is hijacked and destroyed in midair, and the pilot has to fly alone for days to bring the mercenaries back to Earth to finish the job.  The action is excellent.  There are some great shots and effects.  From the exploding asteroids, to the ship falling through the clouds, there is a lot going on.  One of the best moments is when the mercenaries are about to be released from their cells.  When they're freed they are looking forward to meeting up with their old friends and family.  As they walk out of the cells they talk about how "they've been waiting for us for over a year".  The movie ends with the mercenaries on a lifeboat trying to escape Earth. Â The ending is very touching and shows how these people are trying to survive, and when all hope is lost it is the captain who calls them to the lifeboat to finish what they started.  For a movie that came out in 2011, this movie is still as entertaining as it was twenty years ago.  I highly recommend this movie to any fan of Sci-fi and action.

The movie has great acting and a great story line that you just can't put down.

It's really an interesting story about the American Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg, and the fall of Lee's army. I thought it was really well done.   It's a bit hard to follow the main characters story line but the main story lines are still pretty exciting.  It also has a lot of great acting and directing.  This is a great movie for fans of history or for people who don't really like WWII and are looking for something a little more enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my book, I give this movie 4 stars. I think it is a decent movie, I thought it would be a fun, exciting film. This movie was all of that. The plot is good, the action is awesome, and it does have that old '80s 'cathartic' feel to it.   The story is about a group of teenage kids who are living in the backcountry.  They are on a camping trip, but when they come across a big, bad looking wolf (which, by the way, is not at all scary) it makes them all get really freaked out. But it's not long before the wolf shows up again, and this time the teens have to get out of the woods fast.  A really good script, I really enjoyed the characters and their interactions.  And the movie is good.  The acting is really good, and the director was not afraid to take liberties in the plot.  Also, if you want a good, fun movie, then I recommend this one! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a very good movie. The only thing i disliked about this movie was that the whole movie was based on a stage play and i found the actors that played the characters as being too good looking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not a fan of "Batman Begins". I like the Joker better than Bruce Wayne. I did not like the idea of an entire film being focused on a new actor. Bruce Wayne was boring and over used. I wanted something different. "Batman & Robin" was that something different, I loved it and the movie just goes to show you, what Bruce Wayne could do with the proper script, a proper team and great direction.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie   The story was very good, especially the way the two young kids were so very young and still getting used to the world, and the idea of finding a lost kitten and bringing him home, and that they were still trying to come to grips with everything that was going on. The cat was just wonderful   They were so fun to watch, and I think they did it right. I really liked the little girl who was scared of the scary things around her, and her brother (who was a lot funnier than I thought he would be) was just adorable.   It was well done, and if you are looking for a movie that you will enjoy, this one is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film itself was very well done and the movie was pretty cool. A good thriller/drama/musical with lots of funny moments and one of the funniest parts is when they cut to the car and its driver (in a wheelchair) trying to talk.   Another funny aspect of the movie is when we see the character in the wheelchair try to get the attention of the driver, but he just stares at him like he just got out of a coma.  I would like to say that this movie will make me think of the old tv series "My Two Dads" but that wouldn't be a fair description of this movie. The story was pretty well done, but this movie had much more drama and it was pretty funny and some of the moments in the movie were pretty hilarious. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It was a bit of a hit and miss on me but overall a good flick.   The script is great. You'll get some great lines of dialogue that will stick in your mind for a long time. It's a great, well written movie with some very interesting characters.  It has a very fast paced pace, some very funny scenes and a few very touching scenes.  I highly recommend this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen a number of movies that were shot in the Bay Area and are worth seeing, but this movie was a real treat. The actors were great, and the movie had a good plot. The Bay Area scenes were the highlight, because I always like to go there, and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I liked the characters too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the kind of movie where if you haven't seen it, watch it.   The quality of the movie has a little of everything that makes a good action movie.  It's great fun with lots of humor and good action scenes and it doesn't feel rushed.  Â  The movie starts out with some great action scenes with great action.  Then after that, the plot starts to get a little bogged down and then it's just great action and comedy and I think it should be watched to see what this movie is all about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie "Tombstone" is a nice mix of the old and the new, and it's well made.   Very well done.  A real gem.  I'll never forget the scene with John Wayne and Charlie Chaplin.  The "Wagon Train" scene is excellent, and the last scene has some great acting.  Posted by John M. Kincaid at 4:32 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been a huge fan of The Lost Boys for years and years, and I finally got the chance to see it as a kid. It's a film I wish I could watch over and over and never grow tired of.   The Lost boys is the most entertaining movie that I've seen. It was very well acted and I think the actors really nailed what the characters were thinking. The only problem I had with the movie was when the boys would take off and no one would follow them.  I am still looking for a place to watch this movie over and again and I hope to see more from this great cast in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had heard this movie was great and that I should look it up but never saw it.  When I saw it I was surprised it was so good. The movie has some nice acting, and there is a good story.   The only thing that I wasn't expecting was the good acting and the great actors in the movie.  It wasn't a movie that will blow your mind but will have you going back to it. I'm going to have to see this movie more to see the other actors and actresses that were in it.Â  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie very intriguing. It's the sort of thing that should have been made before the new millennium. I liked it much more than I should have. It was very good and I feel it was ahead of its time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. The cast is amazing, and the film was made by the wonderful director, Joe Dante.   Â    It is a fun and exciting look into the life of a New York City gangster. Â The story is great too, and I am always entertained when the gangsters do something that makes no sense, or is completely against what they believe in.  If you enjoy gangster movies, this is a must see!   "Cops on the Run" was filmed in 1969 by the same director, and was never released commercially because of its violent content.  Watch on Amazon Video  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the first scene you see a car pulling up to a small town where all the cars are in the same style. You see all the same cars, the same license plates, the lights all on and the same police cars, and as the camera moves on the cars start to move. A man in the back seat gets out of the car and asks the townspeople if they know who he is. They say no and the man walks to the street and starts walking into traffic. He walks through the streets, past every traffic light, and then finally gets in a car that is moving and it makes a very fast stop and he drives off and disappears. I was completely mesmerized by the entire sequence and the way the driver of the speeding car gets out and walks towards the town, not even bothering to turn on his headlights as he passes through a busy intersection. A short time later a woman is on the phone. She is talking about her daughter that was just kidnapped, and it is obvious that the kidnapper knows her. In another shot you see the man sitting in the front seat of a car. It is obvious the kidnappers are watching him. The whole movie is very much a thriller. The best part of the movie is the final scene. In the car that the man is driving, he gets out as the kidnappings get closer. They walk towards the car, the man grabs his gun, and a couple of shots are fired. The man runs through the traffic and the kidnapers leave him in the middle of the road.   If you are a fan of the classic horror genre, check this movie out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I watched this for a class project and it was great. The actors and script were both great and it is very funny. I enjoyed the film and it does not overstay its welcome at all.   The best part is when the film takes a look at the current climate in the country. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was going to give this film a 7, because I loved it a lot and I am going to have to give it that once a year thing... but I felt it was much less than a 7.   First, let me start by saying that I really enjoyed watching the movie.  I loved the idea of a zombie apocalypse.  It was a bit long and I found myself wishing that it would have had a lot more footage of the main characters.  The movie is well made and well written. Â I really liked the idea that the people of the world would band together to stop a threat that could destroy the world.  We learn that the world is overrun with zombies, but they are slowly dying off.  Even the zombies are not able to kill the human race.  This is a good thing because then, we see the world without a leader and without a cause.  When a great leader (like the King of France) decides to start an alliance and create an army to fight the zombie threat, we all wonder what happens to the world?  This movie will make you feel like this, it makes you feel as if the world will come together to face the zombie plague.  Unfortunately, I felt that it could have done a lot better.  There were some very interesting ideas that could have been explored, like how the zombies work, or why they are the way they are.  These are things that should have been addressed, and I wish that more of this movie would have been directed by Paul Schrader, because his movies are always worth seeing.  A zombie movie that is good but doesn't really have a "hero" or a "villain", makes you think of all the possibilities that the film could have explored. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to see a feature length version of this classic movie. The film is wonderful and well done.   Â  The acting is spot on and it's obvious that these people were enjoying this movie.  Â  They all had fun and are really relatable.  I know that some of you think that all the action movies are the same and this one in particular, but I can say that this one was different than any of the others.  One reason for that was that it was about a married man trying to stay away from his wife and the kids.  There was also a strong theme about the importance of family and how it is never taken for granted. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It has lots of action and suspense in it. There are a lot of scenes that make you want to keep watching. This movie is a good example of how one can make a good action film without any special effects. There is a lot to see and do, with a great villain, and the characters are all very well drawn. This film has a lot going for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this at the local theater, and although I saw it over a week ago, it's still stuck in my head.   For a short film, it has a really strong, and original, story line.  This is a story about a girl who finds a baby who seems to have lost it's mind, but can't quite figure out why.  I liked how it told the story through the eyes of the baby, so when she starts screaming, the audience is seeing it in the baby's point of view.  It's a really funny, well-acted, and well-directed film, and I especially like the song they use to play during the ending.  Another really good movie that I'm glad I saw.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful, heartfelt story about the bond between two fathers in a world which is becoming ever more isolated from the world of their children. The children of the parents, the brothers of the father, are the key to the film. The relationship between the two brothers is wonderful, and they have a great understanding and respect for each other.   One of my favorite films of the last decade. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The End of Time"   The best movie of the year so far and if you like science fiction, and are not afraid of a good "big bang" then it is worth watching.   A little over long, but still a fun movie, and with some really great special effects.  A couple of the special effects could have been better but not as bad as some of the later ones in the series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was a lot of fun and a lot better than i remember. The acting, the music and the direction were all great, it was all very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really impressed with the direction of this movie. The acting was top notch.

I would suggest this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this film, the only character with any personality is a man named Robert Redford. He is so full of charm and sincerity that he makes you think you are in an authentic movie. He also plays a great doctor who has been suffering with mental problems. His best friend, a man in a suit, becomes his love interest. You also get to see an alternate version of the doctor with his right eye as he has gone blind. I like the alternate movie a lot better than the first because it is much more interesting, less made up, and has better acting and effects.   A great movie that I will recommend to everyone I know.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so glad I came across this film years ago. It was made in 1976 but it is as relevant and important today as when it was made. The world was in trouble. The economy was shaky. The nation was divided. The Vietnam war was in full swing. And yet a few brave, determined people in Hollywood decided that it was time to make a film about two young men fighting for a free world and a society that values truth. The film was about the struggles of their personal lives and their personal battles as they went against the establishment and went up against the war machine. I really enjoyed the film and it has not aged a bit. One of the best things about this film is how well it has aged. I haven't been able to find a copy anywhere but I have seen it on TV several times and it still looks great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been looking forward to this film since it came out. It was written by a famous movie director, John Huston, and the plot was great.

I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good old-fashioned good time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It's set during the Revolutionary war and tells the story of a young man who goes to battle with the British in order to take their supplies and to fight against the British forces. The acting is great and it's all well done and not over the top. It has some of the most realistic and emotional acting I have ever seen. The film has so much action and even a few fight scenes that are really well done.   It has a great soundtrack, great music, and a great plot and it really shows the true meaning of a war.  In fact it is about a real war and some of my favorite actors are playing real people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought the movie was very well done, and had a great story. It has been years since I saw it, so I wasn't that familiar with it, but I do remember that my brother and I had a very enjoyable time. The acting was great, and the character of the character actor was great. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good, classic, noir detective story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many, I love The Shawshank Redemption. This movie was an easy choice.   It has a hauntingly beautiful sound that made me think of all the good old silent films from the 40's and 50's.  Â  It also had a very unique script that made it feel very "off the wall" and I loved it.  The soundtrack was great, I especially liked the soundtrack to the opening credits and also for the closing credits.  As a kid I was never much of a fan of the great silent films but this movie has really captured the feel of those old movies.  I also loved the fact that the movie was set in prison so you never knew what was going on outside. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very excited for this film, as I have loved the James Bond movies of the past 30 years.  When I first heard that a movie with this story was being made it was a nice surprise, as it is not something that I have seen before, but I think it's a great one.  The story is very well told, as the story is a mix of spy/thriller and the two are well done together.  For the most part the action is fantastic, as Bond is a spy, and in a lot of action films they tend to have bad action, but this one is great.  This film is well acted, and it was definitely the best part of the movie for me.  I love the way that the James is dressed in this film.   The villains are all played very well, and the action scenes are really well done.  There were a couple of instances where the action wasn't very good, but they are very few and far between.  Â  I really liked the music that was used, and I would give the film a 9 out of 10.  After seeing this movie I have high hopes for the next one, and so far so good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm an old time horror fan who has been waiting years for a modern day "The Thing" remake, and when it came out, it really got under my skin. The special effects are outstanding, but the creature effects, even with a great cast, are pretty darn underwhelming. I'm glad they tried to make it a bit scarier, but I didn't care for the direction, especially with John Carpenter on the set. If you like this kind of film, go see it, but as is it's just not enough to bring you back to the cinema.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a classic. The story is simple but the acting is outstanding. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and have fun with it.  The only problem is that it never feels the same. It has great acting and is a good time but is often hard to get into the story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a good one, especially if you're a fan of the TV series. It is fun and pretty funny, though it can sometimes seem like they're skipping over some of the plot points that would make the movie more interesting, and are just trying to make it for a TV series, which is unfortunate.   It is also pretty silly. There are many, many plot holes and inconsistencies that could have been avoided if the writers had just stuck with the TV show and not made it into the movie.  I think the writers made a couple of good decisions here, especially in the movie's third act, and the movie is probably a lot better than it actually is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a big fan of Stephen King and have seen a few of his movies. I have never read any of his books and never plan to. This is a solid Stephen King movie and it takes place right after his "Pet Semetary" story. I loved the ending. I am glad that it was a short film. It made a nice change from the movies he's made in the past. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " The first time I saw "The Shining" in the theater, I didn't like it because I saw it in the middle of an episode of "The Twilight Zone".  The next time I went back to the theater I saw that the story and characters had completely changed, and that the movie had grown up.  I saw the movie again in 1971 and, for the first time in my life, I thought that the picture was actually very good.   I think that Stanley Kubrick did a great job with this picture.  The production values are not the best, but that's hardly the fault of the movie.  Some of the shots are very good, and the special effects and the scenes of the nightmarish descent into the Overlook are really eerie and scary.  "The Overlook" was one of the most successful films of all time.  It grossed almost a billion dollars and won several Academy Awards.  Kubrick had the courage to use the techniques of the horror genre.  He wanted to frighten us, but he also wanted to make us care about the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched the film in the theater with my friends. It is a very good film that is funny, thought-provoking, and a great ensemble.   The film explores issues that are important to us as a people; we have been misled about the truth about our government and we need to be aware of who is pulling the strings.  The government has been using deception, lies, and even lies of omission (as the film explains) to keep us ignorant of the truth. I believe that this film does the important work of educating the general public about the lies that are being told by the government, the corporate media, and other groups that want our money and control our lives.  I highly recommend this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not going to lie. This movie is a great movie. It has great acting, it has great special effects, it's well written and it is not so cheesy as you might think from the trailers. There's a lot of jokes to it that will get you in the mood for the movie, but the humor is kept to a minimal for the most part.   For the most you won't find much in the way of romance in this movie. The chemistry between the cast is strong but it's not something I can find a way to get to, especially with the actress playing the main character. The movie is also not overly romantic, it never becomes too in your face and has a very light tone. It's all very sweet and the actors are wonderful.  My only problem is that the story is not that great. The script is fine, but there are things that just don't add up. For example, when she comes across a beautiful young woman, she's so taken with her and seems to want to marry her, but it turns out that she's not actually the girl that he's looking for and he never had any intention of marrying her. What happened to her? Is she just one of the many that he had already had? There were also moments where the movie is way too caught up in having fun and throwing some great comedy out there, but I found them to be pretty forgettable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is hilarious and very funny. It does a great job of telling the story of the "American Idol" competition (yes, there were real people playing the contestants at the time) in the late sixties and early seventies.   A great way to make a movie that has no "special" qualities, and is a great example of how comedy should be done in a straight, serious and well-paced way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! It's definitely not your typical action film.   The action scenes are intense and well choreographed, and the way they were executed on the big screen was amazing.  It was really hard to choose which action scenes to add because most of them were amazing. I can't recommend this film enough to anyone.  I recommend it to anyone who loves action, and especially those who love kung fu movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I are in our 40's and are in the beginning stages of our relationship. We have just moved in together and were visiting a friend's place. It's a beautiful place, not too big, with good wood siding and windows. We had just finished dinner, had a good time and when we got back to the house the room was quiet. I heard my wife and my friend talking quietly in the kitchen. I went into the room to find them both nude and having sex. I saw a few strands of my wife's hair in my friend's penis and it was very arousing. I was very aroused and I heard myself breathing. When the phone rang it was my friend saying, "you can talk to her if you want to and I can keep the pictures." I looked at the pictures and it looked like they had been taken in the shower. I tried to tell my wife but she wouldn't believe me. I knew she had to know but couldn't tell her because she couldn't believe what I had seen. She was furious with me. She has always said, "if I didn't know better I would think you were the one doing it." I told her that she wasn't the one and that I saw things. She told me, "no, I don't think you are. You must be kidding or dreaming. I think you must be sick." My wife doesn't believe in "super powers."   I was not very bright, but at least I was able to read. My wife has never been the brightest of people. I told my wife what I saw and she just stared at me for a moment. I didn t know what to do so I just sat and listened to my friend and talked to my wife. Eventually my wife relented and told me that she believed that I was the one who had done it. I just told her, "don't believe anything you read. Your husband has a strong opinion about everything and would never have done something like that. I know he was having an affair." My friend said he would call my wife to tell her what had happened. I called my wife while he was calling. She hung up on me and said, I'm sure he is lying. I said I didn taan to tell him, but she hung up again and told my friend, "I don't care. He is lying about what he saw." She is very upset.     I

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I read some of the reviews of this movie I wondered what this was. I had not seen any of the films that were included, nor any of those that were mentioned in the movie. The synopsis and credits on the DVD that I watched with the rest of the family was very vague, it seemed like this was a story about some people that had been sent by their government to help the people on the Moon. So how did that work out?   The movie is pretty basic and basic is not a word to describe it. The movie was pretty old looking but still had a great atmosphere to it.   I like this movie and it is a great story about the future. I like the way that it is told and the way they tell it. This movie is fun and just shows the future and people that are out there.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first thing that comes to mind about this movie is that the whole production is like a huge dream. Everyone involved was just so dedicated to make sure the movie was awesome.   In a good way. The whole film is made up of interviews of people who have worked on the film and a few still pictures.  The actors and crew all talk about the movie and share a lot of stories about working with different actors and how it is the most difficult job they've ever had.  There are great moments of banter in the interviews with the actors and there are also a couple of flashbacks.  It's really just a great movie about the ups and downs of Hollywood.  I found the movie to be very informative and interesting, and it was just an absolute blast watching.  The only complaint about this Movie is that it felt like there could have been a better ending and a better script. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this a few weeks ago. After watching The Usual Suspects, I thought, 'oh, okay, it's not the same'. This movie is a fun thriller. I think there are more laughs to be had in this movie than the UsualSuspects.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is great and the action is very entertaining. There is some good dialog and some cool looking vehicles.   There are only one or two characters I don't really care for, but I was more than satisfied to have seen it and the only real flaw was the music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie does not have a lot of suspense.   There is a lot going on and the action scenes are not super special.  The film does have a solid script.  This film is not great in the "gory" department.  Most of the blood is gory and most of the action happens when the main character is in the middle of the fight.  It is just not a great film.  I will have to look at other films when I am done with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw the original 'The Great Gatsby' it was a great adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel.  The new film by Baz Luhrmann had some problems, however,Â  I thought it was fantastic, but it had a bit of a clunky beginning that threw me off.  But Baz is a brilliant director and I can not wait to see him work his magic on the adaptation of this great story of American Gatsbys.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really, really good movie. I mean, it is not perfect, but I really enjoyed the movie, so that is saying something. I would probably be a big fan of the movie if the script had been a bit better, but for the time, the story worked, the acting was good, and the directing was pretty good.   My only complaint about the movie was that it was all in Japanese, so I didn't understand all of the dialog. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a really good movie.   It has a lot of action and was well acted.  It was very enjoyable.  In some ways it was a little long but it got you to the main story and the whole thing had a good balance of drama and comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an awesome movie about an orphan boy that gets a "gift" in a man's pocket.Â  It is amazing how a man could care for a boy that looked like a stray.  Â I'm really glad that there are more and better stories about orphaned children than those that show them being abused and abandoned.  This was great!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The cast is great and the chemistry between them is wonderful.  The movie is well produced.   There are no bad moments in this movie.  I had a great time watching the entire movie. It was funny and had great acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great action movie. The movie looks and feels just like the real thing and there is a lot of excitement that you don't find in the movie and there are just some real good action scenes.   The movie shows how real a gunfight is, where the gunfights are all over the place and they take place in many different parts of the city.  The whole movie is very exciting and you never know what is coming up next.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action and likes shooting guns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched a few movies on Netflix, but I have never seen a movie so awesome on the small screen.   One of the best movies ever made. I was a bit disappointed with some of the choices (not a bad movie), but this is by far the best.  I love that it was made in a very unique way, it just adds to the mystique. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about the greatest of all time, this is the best James Bond movie to date.  A great and memorable film.   The story was great and the Bond boys handled themselves very well.  The stunts were great and all of the scenes with the girls were great.  James Bond should be in every James Bond film. But not every Bond movie needs to be as great as this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I was a kid, I saw this movie more than any other. When the original series came back, I wanted to see it again, so I bought the Complete Collection and watched it again.   I must admit, I was disappointed when I saw it for the last time on the big screen.  Sure, the animation was good, and it looked more or less like the TV series. The plot and characters were also good. But the movie was way too slow paced and had a bit of a "lost in translation" feel to it.  I am glad they didn't use that style of animation in the new film.  The movie was also very different from what I expected from the movie, and was also not well thought out.  A new movie with a new director and a new story should do better.  What I really liked about this movie was the music, and I don't really get the joke that people think that "Star Wars" and "The Last Jedi" are the same. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw the trailer and realized it was a comedy, I was ready to give it a go. I was not disappointed. I have never seen an action/comedy that so perfectly blended the action with humor and the banter as well as the humor with the action. The story is pretty simple, but I never felt like the plot was contrived or over-thought. It really felt like a real, hard hitting comedy that just happened to involve an extra-ordinary group of guys. I thought it was funny, well-written and well-acted.   The movie is funny as hell and you'll never look at your car the same way after watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not sure if I'm a fan or not. I'm definitely a fan of movies that have an interesting premise (even if it is ridiculous), and the concept of an "alien" that can change genders is a pretty cool one. The movie itself is pretty well done with some really good action scenes, although I think the acting in the movie was a bit cheesy. I just wish that there was a couple more aliens in the picture that would have made the movie even more interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you can appreciate a good comedy (with a little heart in the plot) then watch this movie.   The director of this movie is an experienced comedian and he really knows how to make the movie funny.  It is a story of the life of a little boy who went to the circus and ended up becoming the king of the whole thing.  There is nothing else like it.  After the boy and his brother get hurt in the circus they go to the hospital and the doctors tell them they are a disgrace to the profession and that the injury will make them infertile for the rest of their lives.  As they're saying that, a little old lady comes and shows them a cure for their infertility.  The doctor then turns them into a "family" of circus animals.  When the doctor is told that the boy is King of the circus, he thinks he is crazy and goes to the palace where the boy lives. There the doctor tells the boy he will be allowed to take the boy away.  So the boy, with his sister, leave the circus.  One day they end up in a village and the girl gets sick. When the nurse takes her out of the house, the man who runs the village says "the girl is dying."  When they get to the village they find the girl in the house with a disease called "Pneumonia"  When there is only a day left until the girl dies, the boy tells the doctor that she must have an abortion.  He tells the little girl to take a poison from a bottle.  On the very first day the girl goes to drink some of the poison but the bottle explodes in her mouth and the poison is all over her clothes.  Meanwhile the little boy, who was the only one who could hear what was going on, ran away and found a woman.  While the boy was looking for a new place to hide, the girl ran away again.  But the boy's girlfriend is coming up the hill with her mother.  She sees the boy run off into the woods and she finds him.  Then the girl turns around to see who it was and she sees that it is the little king and that he is wearing his crown.  At that moment, a man comes and tells the girl to run back.  By then the little man has told the little guy who ran off that he was now King of all the circus animals and he would do anything
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film in the theatre and it was so awesome. It's a great thriller about a guy on the run, trying to escape and take a girlfriend to a place she doesn't recognize. The acting was amazing, and I really did enjoy the scenes they put in.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The one thing to say about this movie is that if you are a fan of David Lynch's work, and have a love for weird stories, then this movie will be right up your alley.   If you are looking for a creepy, supernatural thriller, then I highly suggest giving it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the late 80's and early 90's, this film made a big impression on me. The story of a man and his family fleeing a hostile foreign country in a small plane is one of the most beautiful and powerful films I have ever seen.Â  This is a film that you should not pass up.   A good thriller with great actors who deliver the best performances I have seen in my life. I hope you all take a look at this film. It will make you appreciate the film that much more.Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very fun watch and a good little romp. It doesn't quite match the movie but I still thought it was a really fun movie and I thought the two different characters were pretty interesting.   I loved the way it was shot.  It's a nice little movie that just doesn't seem like a big movie from what I've seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best of the best in a genre filled with terrible movies.  The characters are the best.  Great acting and acting in a good flick.  I liked the pacing.  This is one of the very good old gang movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is well made, well acted and the music is great. It's a good film for a summer movie and it is very good for an old film.   I don't like horror movies and I don''t like them as much as I once did, but this one was very good.  If you like old films, this is a very good film to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I'll take all my guns, I'll take it down to the bayonet and I'll break your head in two"   This is a great movie. It is not a historical drama (the historical part is more about the Battle of Waterloo) or an action film (it is more a historical fiction). This is instead a love story and a tale of two men who have become "brothers."   The actors in this film do a great job portraying the characters. Both the lead and the secondary character do a good job of portraying their characters.   Both are good characters in their own right and as good as you can expect from a two men of their respective generations.  One of the best parts of this film is the use of music. Â  The film is beautifully composed and it is nice to hear the song "I Love You, Baby" that plays at the beginning of the film. The film also has a very beautiful score that you will not soon forget. Â   Overall a very enjoyable film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My girlfriend and I went out with friends last night and saw this movie. We watched it in a group of 4. She has seen the movie and wanted to see it again. We were all very impressed.    The story line was good, the characters were all real and they really did have believable stories behind them.  I liked the fact that it was set in the early 1900's. The people were very colorful and not just typical Irish or Italian. The music is also good.  It is a great movie to get a date to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It was an enjoyable watch with great acting and an excellent soundtrack.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw this film when I was a child, and it was just so scary that I had to see it again. There were lots of scary scenes in this film, and they really made this film stand out.   The film had a very unique and eerie feel, and made me remember the days of The Exorcist with it's creepy music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this film was very clever and funny. The movie makes a great example of the way "conspiracy theories" are made and they are very popular on the Internet. The story is about an "inside" job in a famous historical building. The "inside job" is a "conspirator" who actually is the building owner who has his security guards make a scene. The conspirator has his "security" make sure nobody enters the building. So, the owner's security guards let in a very small group of people. The small group then goes into the building and makes a lot of noise. Eventually the "insider" calls the owner and tells him that the building was being infiltrated by "outside" forces. The owner is a little worried and tells the "security guard" to keep the small group out of the building, but the "man" still tells him what to do. The only problem is that the "guest" (a famous actor) and his crew go right back in. The film then is a good example of how many people just believe "conspire theories" without doing research. I think it's a good comedy that has a lot to say about "conspiring" and the world we live in.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is pretty good. There's not much action in it so it's a little slow, but it doesn't drag on for too long and most of the action scenes are good.   It's a really good story, which is good for a horror movie.  It really puts you in the mindset of the killer.  I would have enjoyed this much more if the actors had done more.  The acting was all decent and did a good job of making the movie. Â   The music in this movie was also very good. I thought the voice actor for the killer was great.  Overall a good, but not very scary movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a good one for sure. I love this movie and it is very funny. I do like some of the movies in this collection from the 80s like The Fly (the first) and Top Gun but this one is a lot more different and funnier than most of the other ones. I think it is a great movie and is not so funny that it is annoying but it is not very good either. The movie does get better later in the movie and you see more of the characters and the different styles.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was not the biggest fan of "Lethal Weapon", but after seeing this, I got a new respect for it. It is a really good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best kind of movies are the ones that will surprise you. If you're looking for a great action movie, I wouldn't go out of your way to find one. In fact, I think they were all shot in about one week. They were all fun to watch and make you think. The acting is all terrific and all the characters are well-drawn.   I saw the first one when it came out and it was worth it.  I love action movies and I love science fiction and fantasy. If the writing is good, and the action is good I'll watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this is a terrific film and a wonderful story. It is not the most original of stories but it is very well told and told in a way that makes it memorable. It really is like a "lost film" of an old western in which the actors who played the characters seem to have been watching a real western movie and they all seem to be enjoying themselves. It's really a wonderful movie with a great message and it makes for a great movie in my opinion.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best sci-fi film ever made. The science is real, the story is interesting, and the characters are likeable and likable.    I loved the movie and even the "back to the future" part was good!   The movie is an "E.T." for people who liked E.T. but thought it was a little cheesy.  It's the end of the world and people have no idea what is going on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie in high school. It was amazing. I have a bad back and I had to lie on the couch for a good 2 hours to make it through. I've never been more impressed with a movie.   The opening credits are perfect.  The entire film is incredible. You feel like the cast and crew were making a movie for the ages.  I highly recommend this movie for any aspiring filmmakers.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched this movie and i gotta say, i was really amazed of how this movie managed to create such a great and likable cast! The movie is not for the faint of heart, but if you are a fan of 80s and 90s movies, then this movie is something to check out, but this movie can be a little hard to sit through because of the violence and the bad acting! BUT the ending i felt was very well done and the whole movie was great!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was good. You have to be in your 40's or over to appreciate it, but you have to admit that it's a little silly. I liked that it did try to explain the movie's plot in some sort of way, and there was a lot of action in it.   What really sold this movie for me was the little bit of sex that was shown in it, although most of the characters are married with kids, and even if you've seen a bunch of these, you'd never see this movie with an uncensored version. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm very pleased with this movie. I don't remember when I first saw it, but I remember watching it about ten years ago. It was my first time ever seeing a black and white silent film, and that's probably why I loved it so much. When I saw this movie, I remember thinking, "Man, I wish I could see more of that." It has a real sense of style and artistry to it, and it's got a real story and real characters. It's got real emotional stuff and a lot of humor to it. I would never have thought I'd be so glad to see a black-and-white silent film again, but this one is great, and I'm glad I watched it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on a Friday night in a theater I saw it in, so it was a bit of a walk to my home. I was going to go to the theater by myself, so I decided to see this. I wasn't expecting anything outstanding, but this is just a good little comedy about a couple that gets caught in a strange situation. The acting was spot on, and the premise was funny, and enjoyable.   It was quite a fun movie to watch.  I highly recommend it for everyone, even if you are an old fart! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen a western movie with this amount of blood in it. I'm a little surprised that this is the first film to have been made in the genre that's been done by the Japanese.  The westerners are portrayed as bad guys, and the samurai are portrayed quite well.   In a way this has been done better than the samurai films that have been produced by American studios and directors.  This is a good Western and I recommend it to anyone who likes westerns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the best movie I've seen in ages.   My first viewing was a very pleasant surprise.  The acting was strong and the direction by John Boorman was outstanding.  A movie that has all the things that I love. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen this movie a bunch of times, and I love it every time. I don't know where they were from, or what they looked like, but I loved the character of Steve. It's the only one I'd consider a "main" character, the rest are just supporting ones.   A great little flick about a guy who gets pulled into a crime he didn't commit and it takes a long time to figure out who he is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first thing I noticed when watching this movie is that the cinematography was pretty good. The scenery was very well done and there were quite a few scenic shots of the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area. The acting was excellent and even though there weren't many people in the film it seemed that everyone was really involved. The other interesting thing about this movie was that the main character, John Wayne, seemed to have a lot more depth than anyone else. There was a sense that he was someone who was quite close to you and you really felt sorry for him.  The most memorable scene in the movie was when John Wayne went into the shower and we saw that he hadn't changed a single bit. It was a great scene and I really enjoyed watching it.    This movie was very close to a perfect movie. I really enjoy movies like this and can't wait to see what other movies they will be making in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A must see for the fan of the "X-Men" franchise. The plot is the best part of the movie. The casting of Shredder as one of the three leaders of the X-Men is awesome. The first half of the film is really awesome as we get to meet all the X Men as well as the Brotherhood. The ending was really cool and I really loved the use of a hologram to show off the different X-men. It was the perfect ending to an awesome movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was the most fun I have had with a movie since the original "Star Wars." I don't know how the producers can put out a movie this bad. This movie was so bad it's amazing!   They have taken out the original dialogue from the movie, yet the film still has a good cast that works. George Lucas does have a good sense of humor and all the actors are really great. I am so sad they didn't try to do it in the future.

But this movie is actually pretty good. The acting is pretty good, the story is good and the plot is good. I'm kind of sad to see this movie end, though. It is one of those movies that will haunt you a few days after it's over. It was like an early '80s version of 'Terminator 2'. It looks cool, the effects are really good, and the music is pretty cool too.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is one of the best movies i saw this year.   This movie was the best thing to happen to my life this year as i have been through so much in my life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you're going to watch a movie that is so close to perfection, then why waste your time on anything but this.  The story of this film is amazing, the acting is top notch, the stunts are impressive, the performances are amazing, and the story is just pure gold.  I've seen many a great film that you'll hear people talking about but never see, but never forget the name, this film definitely stands out in my mind.    I don't understand how anyone could make a movie like this after the fact because it just doesn't make sense that it was so good so soon after it was released.  This film will have you crying by the end of it, and you'll go see it again and again.  It'll stay in your mind.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was looking for something that was a bit more mature for my 9 year old daughter.  She had no interest in watching a PG rated movie, and the older, more adult themed films she wanted to watch were filled with sexual innuendos and dirty language.  This movie had none of this, and was extremely entertaining and hilarious.  I felt a bit guilty in rating it higher, but it just didn't seem that funny to me.   There was a whole line of people in the movie that were totally naked.  They were completely non-sexual, but the idea of them having their "fun" was hilarious.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is not original. I've seen it before. But the actors make it feel fresh and real. They are actors who deserve our attention, because they bring their characters to life.   "One day he is a teenager, the next he is in his sixties. His mind is clouded by the events of the past few years. The only person who can help him is a young woman who has lost her memory.  "When her son asks her, "Who is Mary?" her memory begins to return, but it's not the Mary that she remembers from her youth. Mary is a new person with a new name and a new story to tell."   This movie is good for anyone who has ever been through a tough time.  I wish that this movie was made after 9/11, and we could see how people reacted to that horrible time. What a great way to show how tough it is to find true love and friendship. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a must see!  I saw it on Netflix the other day and i am in love with this movie! The movie is so good and funny. It's so sad to me that this movie will never get a remake.  A very good comedy! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a lot of things wrong with this film, and some of them can be found in its source material, which is not particularly well read. For instance, in a scene where two children are playing in the woods, one of them says, "I just saw a snake!" And while it could be a reference to the movie's snakes, it's also an obvious and stupid joke. One has to assume that if a person heard something like that, they would have run away. However, in the movie the children play like that all the time.   This movie does try to be funny and light, but its plot just gets lost in the process, and it doesn't do much with its two actors, although both of them do a decent job with what they're given. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't see how you can take this movie seriously. The actors seem to be trying to be funny in this, and I can tell they don't give a rat's ass about the story. I can't tell you how many times I've seen movies with the same premise and the same cast, and it has nothing to do with how good the actors are at the time, or the story's quality. The only good thing I can say about the film is that it is long, which is good for my schedule.     Overall:  Â    The only positive I can give this movie is that when it came out it was an important statement against exploitation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen this movie for years and I had forgotten it. I was in an interesting film club where we went to see a number of old Hollywood films, most of which I had never heard of. The film was directed by the great Elia Kazan and starred the great James Dean. I never saw Dean in anything but small roles, but it looks as if he really got into it for this one.   This film is one of the best. A lot of people have seen it but I haven''t seen it for years.  It is a masterpiece of filmmaking.  Very well made.  There is a scene in the beginning of the film where the camera sweeps from one side of the set to the other.  This is the start of Dean''s career, and it is very exciting.  You don''t have time to wonder what is going on with the other actors in the film, you are just going with it and going to see what will happen next. This is exactly what is happening.  The scene was shot with the intention of creating a sense of movement and suspense. I love that they kept things moving at all times.  I love the shots of the cars in the rain, the cars driving along the boulevard, the streetcars in the fog.Â I also love the way that they keep the action moving with no sign of the story taking a turn, you just follow the characters.  As a movie you will never forget this one, it is a great classic and it should be on every film club member''s list. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the first film of any kind I have watched and it's so far been one of the most entertaining. I thought I was going to die laughing watching this movie. Not only because of the fact that I had to be in my right mind to keep watching this, but because of my amazement at the sheer awesomeness of the acting and writing.   And my favorite scenes? They all are good in their own right, but the scene in the hotel when the woman has to deal with the male driver being very aggressive and threatening and the female who has to make sure he doesn't get away is really great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really impressed by this movie. It really shows how a movie like this can be used for good. The story about a couple who have a kid is super simple and yet very effective at conveying the characters feelings. It also gives some background to the family, the way the film was filmed, and how the mother and father are like a good husband and wife. The movie is really good at capturing the emotions of the characters, and the camera work is very very good. This movie is not an all out comedy, but it does have some very funny moments.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a masterpiece.   It's so well done.  You will feel a rush from watching this movie.  It has the sound, pictures, and animation of a movie you might see on a TV show.  The special effects are great, but it's the acting and the acting alone that are the best part of this movie  It doesn't take long before you are enjoying this movie, and the ending is a nice surprise that gives you a nice sense of closure.  I hope the director will make more like this movie to show us what happens to people after they die.

It's great that a woman like Charlize Theron is getting recognized, and that there are so many strong women in a film like this. It does have a lot going for it, including great performances by the women. It would have been great to see her play another role, but I'm not complaining.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fun romp through the backwoods, with the kind of characters that you can identify easily from a mile away.  This film is set in the 1950's, in an area of Alabama called the White Mountain Apache country.   The film has a great score by the great composer Charles Mingus, and has a number of real locations, all captured in the best way.  The actors are great too.  It is a love story, and a tragic love story.  In a wonderful twist, they are both in love with the wrong person.  They both were so beautiful, they were both taken from us.  A great little movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie when I was about 12 years old and loved it, it was just like a good sci-fi movie where all the things that are happening in the world you just sit back and enjoy the ride. The special effects were great, the action scenes were awesome and there is an evil alien creature that was awesome, all of the aliens looked really evil and looked really creepy too.   This movie will stay with me always, i hope they make a movie about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â  The "Ace Ventura" movie is a classic with a few changes and some very funny moments. I think if you have a kid that loves action movies this is a great movie to take them to.   The "Citizen Kane" movie was great as well.  The ending of the film was a bit out of control, but I think we all know this was only a part of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "This is a pretty good movie that does what it set out to do, that is give a realistic portrayal of Vietnam, without becoming too political. The movie is well worth the watch. There is no plot to speak of, but there are characters that you really do care about, and you get an awesome glimpse at war in Vietnam. The dialogue is well written, and there are a lot of great actors in it. It is an awesome movie." - Tom Cruise
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at a theater with a great band. Everyone was really into it! It's a great combination of music, comedy, and drama.   The story is about a guy who goes to an insane asylum and tries to be a comedian there, but ends up in a world of horror.  It is very surreal and the characters were very real.  Everyone in this movie was just really good in their roles.  The acting was done so well.  They all really captured the characters and made them feel real. A good cast of characters.  There are many great lines to say.  I really loved this movie.  If you are into horror or just comedy I highly recommend you try this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a must see. It was an important turning point for John Wayne. He got his first serious role, and what a performance! John Wayne is still the best American actor of his day.    It's really a story of a man in a war-zone. Wayne, who was in the Army at the time, is a very honest man, and his portrayal of the soldier in the field is very sympathetic.

The story line is very good and the acting by all the cast is spot on.   When I saw the original release I thought it was the best of the James Bond movies. This one is great too.  A lot of people may not like this movie but if you like James Bond then you will love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last movie I watched with my grandmother was The French Connection and I've wanted to see it for a long time. I had a wonderful time watching it with her and her sister. It was fun seeing all the different types of police officers, both in the '60s and the '70s. It's the only movie I've seen with three different cops who are all great at their jobs.   My favorite moment was the ending when the detective tells the guy who committed a crime to "leave it the way it was." It's a great way to wrap up an enjoyable movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I saw was The Godfather: Part II. It's the one I wanted to see back when I saw it at midnight and it's probably the best film of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In case you were wondering, my mom made this for my son. She got him a digital camcorder to take pictures of our dinner while we ate and I made a few "food-related" movies. It made for a fun time with the family and he enjoyed it.   The movie has a great soundtrack with a little extra music in it, but I found myself missing the "realness" of the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My husband and I watched this in the theater for about 2 hours. It was worth the watch.  The action is good and the story is about a guy who was shot during a shootout. The movie didn't have much plot but did the job it needed to.

The acting is superb, the chemistry between Sean Connery and Timothy Dalton is great, and they both look amazing. All in all, a great movie. - December 16, 2013The best Bond movie ever

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at a cinema with some friends and one of them went into the concession stand. I ordered a cheeseburger and a soda and that is about it. Not enough cheese. A burger with lettuce, tomato and onions would have been better. The fries were also very good.    A good movie. Not as good as the first one. I think it was only the second time they made it as the director was fired but it was a great comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was good, but it wasn't my favorite. I liked it a lot more the first time I saw it. This is the film that made me a fan of Michael Bay. It really is an action film that goes at it's own pace. It has more action than any other Bay film, so it's fun to watch. I did not like the ending though. It had too many jump scares, but also too much time in between, so there was not enough time for the characters to come back and talk to each other. It was a shame to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very much a part of my life. I used to babysit my two little brothers when I was 13 and 14. I remember watching this movie over and over again and loving it. I think the reason it has become a part... Read More of my family's memories is because my dad played the role of the adult child who takes care of his siblings.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm so happy to see another film where the women are the stars. I love the plot, it's fun. I loved the costumes.   There are two actors who I always like, and these women have such great chemistry together, and great physicality.  Â  I'm a fan of Jeanette Nolan and the movie was so good, I didn't know who to root for. I hope this film gets released. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little unsure at first since I've seen a few episodes in the past, but this one has so much to offer! My son has no idea what is going on, so he has this thing where he will always ask if he is in an episode. The kid really enjoys it and his friends don't really care about the movie, but he always asks when it's coming back. A lot of times you just have to wait until the DVD/Blu-Ray is on sale. It will always make you chuckle at how ridiculous it sounds. The kids really enjoy it and it was just too fun not to be a part of!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen many of the Star Trek films but they did not really hit me. I had just heard that Gene Roddenberry had died and it seemed like an opportunity to see some of the old ones, especially the "old" ones. I went with the idea to see this one because it was made by a director that I really like, and also because it is on TV for a limited time! And I think I have found a great film.   Roddenfuss was not a director I would have given the chance of making a film with, he was only given a few films to direct in his life, and they had a horrible film in them. And this one has a great cast and really is great.  The best way to describe this film is a love story of two people in love who are stranded on a desert planet. Â They are stranded by their ship and find some help from some natives.  They discover they are not alone and that the rest of the planet is a desolate desert.  With some help they get back to the ship and figure out how they can get back home.  These two are very attractive characters, very funny and the plot is very good.  I really liked it, and I think it has something to do with the fact that it is only on TV. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is fun to watch for an all-time classic, and for fans of John Wayne and westerns. The dialogue is top-notch and the acting is great. It also does have a great soundtrack by a young composer. It doesn't seem to be re-cut, so there are still a couple of the original actors, and it's a great idea to have this movie in the first place. It seems too bad that it was a film directed by another one of John Ford's contemporaries, but it would have been great to see what John Wayne would have done with this story. - October 6, 2014Great movie for any fan of John or westerns

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie to keep your eyes and mind occupied! My favorite kind of movies to watch, when I feel bored and need a quick fix. The characters are all so charming and so well developed! It's a perfect example of the art of the "slapstick" film. The humor is on point, and it never takes itself too seriously. The acting is good throughout, especially for a studio film. If you're looking for a good comedy to keep you amused, or just a movie you can enjoy with the family, go watch it. It's fun to watch and you'll enjoy it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great film to watch on a rainy evening or when you have a craving for some good old fashioned Westerns.    This film is as close to the old Western as I have ever seen and it is just plain enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts out slow, but it picks up steam as the characters get involved, both the main and supporting characters. The pace is much slower than the film's opening, which I thought made the beginning of the film feel less like a thriller and more like a suspense thriller. There are some nice touches in the film, such as the scene where a character watches as a man who has just lost his wife is killed. I really enjoyed the film and felt that it did a great job at putting the mystery behind the murder to rest. The film also had a great score from an actor I had never heard of called Peter Stormare.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie. Very well made and very well acted. All of the main characters are really well portrayed.   I do have a few nitpicks:  -The film was made in 1948 so there's a few dated scenes but you wouldn't know it, even with the excellent VHS transfer.  -There are some scenes that don't make sense. I guess this is because this was made at a time when most people didn't realize that it would be such a big deal and were just happy to be allowed to say it.  But then, people today would know.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've never been a big fan of movies about children. It always seems that the adults are just doing their best to make the children look appealing in an effort to win over the kids and then the children decide that they are going to be adults.   Unfortunately, my favorite movie about a little girl was The Parent Trap and I loved it a lot but I hated the movie about my daughter because it seemed so forced, so childish and so annoying that I never wanted to see it again.  But I am glad that the movie has made it to DVD, at least in the U.S. so you can see what I miss about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a great example of American movies from the 1950's that are still funny and a bit different from the typical genre. There are some great scenes with the car chase, etc. and the characters are well developed, but this one feels more like a comedy, like a film about a guy who gets into a car and crashes it, which would never have worked for me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought I would see the movie because it was a little new to me and the reviews were good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I love these old black and white films"   - Bill Cogswell, Director   (I love the first four)   So here it is.   Â  The only thing missing is The Last Picture Show!   The film stars a very funny actor named James "The Cat" Cleaver.  He's a "freak" who lives in a circus.  After he gets caught in a very odd act, he's put in a psychiatric ward.  The doctor tries to break him out of it but he soon finds out that he doesn't fit in there either.  His friend and partner in the act, "The Little Girl", wants to get him out as soon as possible, so she leaves him to be taken care of by the circus manager.  When she returns, he discovers that her "baby" is missing, and she has kidnapped him.  Unfortunately, she has her brother come and take him away from him.Â   Cleaver is determined to help her escape and bring his "baby home".  It's a simple plot with some great performances from the main stars.  In addition, they put a very interesting "couch gag" in there.  This is a really fun film with some good performances and great humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The script was good and the action was intense. I would suggest to watch this movie after watching "The Warriors". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first film I ever saw on video was The Last Picture Show. I went on to see several hundred more, including a host of independent films of varying quality. The movie industry had a major makeover. I saw such films as The Blues Brothers, Caddyshack, and Ghostbusters, the last of which I saw on the big screen when it was released on video, just a few years before it was to be released in movie theaters. For me, there's a wonderful artistry and a certain charm to the movies that came out at the time. The music of the time was a lot like the music I was listening to when I was a kid, full of anachronisms and an atmosphere of authenticity. I had to work really hard to remember what those songs sounded like, but there was something about them that brought out the mystery of the old Hollywood. The most impressive thing about the movie is its sound design, using real instruments (such as piano strings, and drums), along with real sounds like bells, whistles, and the piano, which I had never heard before on a film. The film's director, Billy Wilder, had a very unique way of shooting the camera, which often looked like a snapshot taken from an antique camera. The editing was also innovative, as it allowed the actors to speak a small amount of dialogue, and allowed the camera to move around a bit as the dialogue was spoken. For all its innovation, the movie never lost sight of the fact that the characters were real people in real time, and that the picture is a very human one.    My favorite characters in the movie were the two children of the parents, played by Bill and Jane Russell, who made the transition from the streets to a life of glamour and celebrity. They had been poor when they got to Hollywood, and were trying desperately to make ends meet. The way they talked, the way they moved, and how they used the media to make themselves seem like celebrities was real and compelling, which made the audience care about them.  It's no wonder why this movie is so timeless, because it was so much more than a mere entertainment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is a classic "A-Grade" adventure, with strong acting and direction.   I really like the story and plot twists, the action is great, and the costumes are excellent, especially the costume for the dog.  The only thing that could have been better is the film's pacing.  When it's happening quickly you don't feel the suspense of the film.  But when you start to learn more about the story the pacing is fine.  I loved the film because it was the first of its kind I saw, and I really enjoyed it.  It is my favorite of the Star Trek series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was surprised to see how good this movie was. I've seen a lot of good movies on Netflix, but I didn't think this one would be a hit with the crowd.  The story is simple, but it's extremely well told. A young girl and her father are travelling through Italy when a local girl is attacked by two men. A fight ensues, and after an unconscious girl falls on the man's foot, the man gets the girl's father to pick her up. The man has the young girl walk down a street in the middle of the night, with all the lights on, while the men follow behind. In the middle, they discover that there are people around them who look like they are enjoying the nightlife. The young girl is shocked and surprised, and says she doesn't know what happened. But the man and the girl are certain that they are not going to be found out. The girl takes off on foot, and the man stops to check a nearby building. The next thing they know, they see a stranger following them. It turns out to be a local crime boss, who has been chasing the men from the beginning. The police never find the real murderer, and they try to catch him, but he escapes. They then head back to their car to get away. The car, on a dirt road, has crashed, and there's blood everywhere. They find a man, who says he doesn't remember anything, but that the two men they met earlier were the ones that did it. The boy goes off on his own, and it's not until he meets up with the local police, that he remembers what really happened. It's not a perfect movie, but the director has done an amazing job of capturing the tone of a young boy's confusion and anger in the aftermath of what he thinks has happened to him.  This is an incredibly unique and interesting film, and I highly recommend it for a movie lover like myself.

The movie follows a detective who is hired to search for a kidnapped woman, but soon finds that not everyone is the hero that he expects.  This is a thriller with a fantastic ending that will make you want to watch the movie again and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see this movie after seeing the trailer and thought it would be funny, and I wasn't disappointed. The movie starts off with a guy running away from the cops and the guy who has him is chasing him, and the cops catch up to him and start yelling and chasing him and he takes off. As he gets further away, the cop is yelling and yelling and then the guy runs up and the cop fires a warning shot and the bullet hits him in the neck, and that's how he dies. After the credits, it is the guy's girlfriend who tries to stop him and the whole time he is yelling at her and trying to run away from her. She tries to get him to come back, but she doesn't have the guts to follow through. It was funny. And it was great.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in college when this was released in the 1980s, and it was the first big movie I remember watching. The music and story were good for a low budget movie, but the dialogue, acting, and acting style were a big improvement over the first Batman movie (and later Batman Forever). This is an example of a good character actor, and a real good character. It is a great movie for kids who aren't afraid of dark themes. The action was fun and exciting, and the effects were good enough. It has a lot of laughs and a few tears. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a "must" for any fan of the "Frankenstein" franchise.   The film is extremely well done, the performances are superb, and it is full of suspense and mystery.  The creatures in this film are very original and quite creepy.  This is a good film to bring out of your collection if you haven't seen it yet.  The story of this film is about a scientist trying to bring a "new" monster to life, but what he is really up to is getting himself killed!   It really has a great mystery and the mystery is built up over the course of the film.  In this film we see the creature in several different forms, it is almost like watching different creatures in a horror film. Â

It is one of the most realistic and believable movies I have ever seen.  In my opinion, this movie has everything that makes a movie good - a plot, characters, a good story.  I saw this movie at the age of 15 and it will always be my favorite movie of all time.  It has all of the good elements that makes the movies great - a well written story, good characters and an excellent soundtrack.  If you are a fan of the classic films then this movie will not disappoint.

There is always more to the story. I found myself cheering for the underdog against the power.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had the privilege of watching this movie on a school field trip. It was a great experience and I highly recommend it.   - I like it   The only thing I would have done differently would have been to have watched the movie on tape and then read the instructions that were included. The whole movie was written to show how easy it is to use the radar and what you get for your money.  - What happened?   This movie was made on a lot of hard work and I recommend it to everyone who has a radar detector.  It is one of those movies that you see in a theater and think, "Wow, I wish I could do that" and then you look in the rear view mirror and it is you.  I saw this on a field trip and thought it would be a great movie, but it was so entertaining I had to go out and get the picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film! It has some good scenes in it and it's a good story.   The acting was fine and the direction was a little more interesting than the other films on the same theme. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good, if not great, movie. The plot is fairly simple. A couple get married and have a son. The problem is that their son is a complete freak, a boy that no woman could love. The story follows their struggle to get their son to like them. But even after his father gets him some affection from a girl, the boy will not like her. They will move to a new city and move their family to a more loving environment. However they don't realize that they will be moving to a place that doesn't accept freaks, and that is the very thing that will bring their son back to them.   I had a very hard time watching this film, it was hard for me to like it. It didn't really make me hate them. If anything it made me want to see more of the couple, and to see where their son was coming from.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never heard of this film until I saw it in a VHS rental, and was totally blown away. This was a movie that I had always wanted to see, but had never had the courage to see. I remember being completely blown away by this film, and really glad that I finally had the opportunity to see it. It is not a perfect film, but I think that it has a really nice story to it, and it shows a lot of the problems that the early Soviet Union had with their people, particularly regarding the education system. It also shows the problems of Soviet society that led to the murder of this man.   An interview with the director, Ivan Drago 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this film on video, and though it was never released on the big screen, it was a great introduction to the medium. The action is slick, the acting is on point, and it's got some genuinely cool looking sets and costumes. A lot of the action is shot with practical effects, and a few of the stunts look amazing, such as the car chase and the hand-to-hand match. While a lot of times you'll get the feeling that the actors are being used as glorified stunt doubles, there are a couple of very good performances in the film. The music is great, with a lot that feels fresh and appropriate for the film; there is some excellent music in there, which gives the film a real feel of energy. A great way to introduce the action genre to people who might not know much about it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is an absolute masterpiece and a must see for anyone with an interest in martial arts cinema. It was shot on 70mm and was made by the very great master, Masahiro Shinoda. This movie has been described as "a masterpiece of martial arts filmmaking", but I don't think it really can be called that. I think this movie is a perfect example of how to make a movie in a short period of time, and how to do it well. Shinoda did it all with a low budget, but it works, and he's one of the best martial artist filmmakers ever.   It is a great movie, and I'd highly recommend it, but I think it is better to just rent it than watch it in theaters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great, realistic and emotional movie about a young soldier in the Vietnam War.   Â  The movie is set in 1968, and follows the lives of two soldiers who have been stationed at a base in the desert, who meet, fall in love and get married in 1967.  The characters are well developed and believable.  Both soldiers are excellent actors.  They are funny and the performances are real.  I would recommend this movie to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie while waiting for the show to start at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night. I'd heard it was great and was so ready to see it, so I was ready to get to my seats. It ended up being so much better than I thought it would be. The story and acting are top notch. It was also very funny and well acted. Even if you don't care for the supernatural or aliens, it's a fun little flick, even if it's only 8 or 9 minutes long.   I saw this movie at 7pm on Wednesday night and it was worth every minute. It is a fun way to kick off your Friday night. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I don't know about you but I haven't seen a movie this good for years.   The acting was amazing and the movie looked amazing.  It has this awesome old school horror vibe that makes you feel like you are watching a classic.  The writing of the movie is a perfect compliment to the acting.  This was my first time seeing a movie where the story was told through the dialogue and that was really cool.  If you want a good horror movie this is it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie very enjoyable. It was not really what i was looking for when i was searching for some good horror, but it was an interesting story and I thought it was well written.   A good mix of the creepy and the dark   It is a movie that you have to see to believe and you might not think it is very scary, but if you watch it at least once, you will see that it is actually very scary. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first movie of the trilogy that has become known as "A Thousand Miles From Home." It features one of the best characters I have ever seen in a movie, a character in a world that has been forgotten for several decades.   It's a story about a man who decides that he must find a new way to bring peace to his home on a distant planet.  The acting is really good. The story was enjoyable as well as the scenery.  It was a fun watch and one that is certainly worth watching.  A lot of people will see it and never see it again but if you see it once you will see and know the story that is told.

The actors did a good job in playing the role.  It was a nice action movie.  The story was interesting. I think it is a good film.  A must see movie. It was not as good as a movie like "The Godfather" or "The Last Temptation of Christ" but the picture is great and the film has an interesting plot.  If you want a nice entertaining movie that has a good plot then watch this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is a real masterpiece.  This movie was made before Star Wars came out but this movie is even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie, not that I think this is an awesome movie by any means. I think it has some good ideas, but the writing isn't great.  The movie is set in 1844, and I thought the time period was interesting. It didn't seem like the era was really about war, although the main character is a slave.   Also, the movie was directed by Paul S. Taylor, who is probably one of the best directors in American history.  I think if you have never seen a movie, this is a good place to start.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in an exhibition of old silent movies and thought it was a great movie. The sound is fine and the story is interesting, but the story doesn't hold up when you realize that all the actors, including the leading lady, were actors who were in the silent movies.   And you can tell that they all were in a hurry, they had no time to think about anything except the job that they had to do.  They were a bunch of kids who wanted to be stars so they could get their big break in the movie business.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story ofÂ  theÂ  lastÂ  AmericanÂ  war inÂ  the lastÂ  decade isÂ  the story of theÂ  people who did not give up Â Â Â  theÂ  fight Â Â Â  andÂ  died Â Â Â  Â to protect their country's honor.   From the early days of the war in Europe to the final, triumphant ending of the conflict, this film tells the story with emotion and without any kind of pretense.  For this filmÂ  the actor that had to portray this war with so much passion, pain and courage was none other than Martin Sheen, who is one of the best actors of all time. Â  His portrayal ofÂ  this warÂ  was the epitome ofÂ  professionalism andÂ  pure courage.  I was a huge fan of the movie as a kid, and I think that its the best movie in the entire series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is definitely one of those movies that will change the way you view it, you'll never look at a film the same way again.   What it offers is so much more than just a good horror film.  There are so many things that this movie gets right, but that's not what made me love it.  This movie is more about character, and it does that in a very subtle way.  The performances are good, and they are all great.  I'm not one to enjoy slasher movies, but this one is really solid.  If you liked the slasher films of the 60's and 70's, this will be right up your alley. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this on the first day of it's release it was a movie I really didn't want to watch. But this movie was amazing. I would not pay $10 dollars to see the movie again. I recommend this movie to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My son and I went to see this film. He was only 3 or 4 at the time, but I couldn't help but notice how very young he looked (I thought he looked about 15) and I couldnï¿½t stop thinking about him and the characters as we were on our way to the theater. We bought the tickets in the morning and when we got to the cinema, I was stunned to see that the line didn't go beyond the third row. I was in awe of him as I watched the film, and he got more and more interested as the movie progressed. When I left the theatre he had been waiting for hours, and we were both so happy and tired. It took him a while to sleep after that. If I hadnï¿½t been so tired, Iï¿½d have had him look at me when he came in the next morning.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening credits are incredible. The only reason I didn't like this movie the first time I watched it was because I had a bad feeling about it. It's an interesting movie about two men who work for a large corporation, and when their bosses dies unexpectedly, they are the only ones who have access to the corporation's most highly classified plans.   I think it's quite entertaining to see the two men at their best and their worst at the same time. It has a great cast of characters, the acting is very good and I found myself really enjoying the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "There are few actors to whom you can look up and say "That's who that guy was." John Cassavetes is just that, and he's always believable as a hard-drinking, hard-nosed, hard luck New York detective. And he had a wonderful performance as a wise-guy bartender who knows that there's a pretty good chance his brother-in-law is a mob boss (a real character in this case). But it's the wonderful turn as the son of a drug dealer and an Irish cop that wins the film, and Cassavettes gives it everything he's got. "    It's hard to find one movie you won't like in the early 70s. And "Goodfellas" is a good one.

The setting of the film was excellent and it was really cool to see what happened with the children at the school the day before the storm struck.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A terrific film.   This is a terrific little horror movie that's fun to watch.  It was filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood.  A friend of mine, who was a very avid movie fan, watched it at the studio one day and was shocked by the special effects and special effects.  The story is a bit simple but the acting is excellent.  This was a movie about some scientists who came up with a cure for plague.  While the plague was being eradicated, they decided to hide a cure in a bottle, but it was discovered.  What happens is that the cure, when applied to the infected, cures the plague and leaves them completely healthy.  They travel from city to city seeking a cure.  Very imaginative.  If you're a fan of the slasher movies, you'll enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sure there are worse movies than this out there. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this was the first time I had watched this movie. I had not heard of this film and thought it sounded really good. There were a few scenes that I didn't even understand and I was surprised to learn that this film was shot in England in the 1930s and 40s. I found that this movie was filled with people of various ages who had a lot to say and I can't remember hearing of this movie before. I didn' t find this movie to be "bad", in fact, it may be one of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this on a dare and it was actually pretty good, in the way of a "wanna be" movie, the chemistry was there but it wasn't as funny as I expected. A couple of actors were really good and the story was fairly interesting.   Â    The best actor in the movie was Tim Allen.  The story is very well written.  My one problem was that the movie starts slow and there were a couple of awkward moments.  But overall this is a good watch and I recommend it to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It has been about a year since my last one of the original "Star Wars" series. I was not expecting much from a "new" movie about the prequels.   I have seen some great movies in the past and this one was not one of them.  The movie is set during the time of the Empire.  They were going to have a victory parade and we hear a little about it, but not much.  Luke Skywalker was to be a big hero. He was going to be the most powerful person in the galaxy.  It seems that there were plans to have Luke join up with the Jedi and go after the Emperor.  We find out that he has been using the dark side of the Force to try to get into the palace.  Darth Vader is very much the villain in this movie. He seems to be really evil.  He is definitely in the same league as Vader, if not above him. He is very ruthless, but has a kind heart.  I was surprised with how much of the story was told through the eyes of Luke and the Empire, not in any of the other characters.  One thing that I thought was cool is that they really made Vader a different character in the sequel.  You don't hear all that much from him and there is a lot more of Luke.  Also, Luke is much more in control of the situation in the second movie.  This is my favorite "Star wars" movie so far.

For many years, I kept it in the vaults, but it never had a release.  It has been a long time since I saw this.  The picture is incredible, and all of the actors were great.  This is a wonderful movie with an epic, wonderful ending.  I can not recommend this movie enough!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My family and I went to see this movie on a Friday night in the middle of the summer. The theater was packed, it was pretty hot inside (in the summer, I suppose), the movie was pretty good (despite the poor acting, and poor script, it had it's moments) and it was really fun to be in the movie. We weren't really in the "scene" (we were pretty far back in the theater) but we did get to see some of the action. The action was pretty awesome. One scene, a lot of cars were speeding through the air and I loved it. I'm not a car guy at all but it was definitely one of the more exciting scenes I've seen.    The action scene was a good highlight.  I liked it.  My favorite thing about this movie was the whole car chase with all the different cars and the crazy car guy who would get them all going. I really like the look of cars.  The acting, the scripts and the acting is pretty good.  For me, I found the acting a little odd, but maybe that's just me.  This movie was really well made and the actors were great.  I like it. I liked it a lot!

If it is a PG-13 movie I hope it will get better with age.

The story of a man who is given the gift of life by God and goes on a journey to learn the reason for his existence.  When it comes to making movies, one needs to give their all. The people in this movie did not take shortcuts.  They really took the time to get it right.  The ending of the movie was truly emotional and a great way to end the movie.  My only problem was that it felt like there was a little too much of a rush.

I think the best character of the film is the main character, the director is great at making the audience feel as if they were at the movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie at the movies when I was in my late teens. The scene that is about a girl getting sexually assaulted and killed is very much real to me now.   The director really captures the pain of the victim and the way she reacted to this horrible thing.  There are a few other people in the movie that were the victims of these horrible crimes and they all felt very much like the victims in this movie.  The movie is very hard to watch and I think the story could have been told a bit more slowly.  I do hope that this movie will come out on DVD one day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie before but the last time was when I was 14 and the actors are the same. They were not the same anymore. It was a good time though. I saw it in the 70s at a drive in theater and they played some old tunes on the jukebox. They also played "The Temptation of Adam" (which was also the song I had learned to play by ear) but not the song they actually used in the movie, so if you want to hear that one play and not the old tune, go to the drive in.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first heard about The Crow, I was initially skeptical. I thought it would be a cheesy, cheap exploitation movie. Boy was I wrong!  The Crow is a truly classic horror film.  The story is told from multiple viewpoints. First of all, we have a woman who works as a nanny for a rich man. He has a son who is very sick and doesn't get better. He spends his days in bed, and is very uncooperative. His mother, on the other hand, takes her son to a mental hospital to be cured. While there, his father shows up and kidnaps her.  However, there is a twist to the tale. The rich man who is supposed to take care of the boy's illness is actually a murderous man who doesn't care about his son at all. He just wants to get his hands on the boy and he takes out his anger on the nanny. The nanny doesn't seem to care at all about her life. Her only focus is to look after her young son, who is in grave danger.   The movie is not for the faint of heart. It may not be for everyone, but it is worth watching. The music is good and the acting is good. I always wanted to see how this would be made and how the poor woman would react.  A must-watch for anyone who likes horror movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this as a part of a film festival at a local college. I've always been a fan of films that show how much a young woman's life can be changed by a man's kindness and commitment. I can still picture the scene in the bar in the back of the film where one of the guys in a crowd was taking the time to listen to this young girl's story and making her feel special and special alone in her room with her boyfriend. It was the first time I'd ever seen a real man help someone like that and I was deeply moved. I loved the film, but the story is too big for the short film format and is far more powerful for this medium. It had the feeling of something that would have been very good on the big screen.

The original was just a great story, but this one has much more action and is way more exciting.   I've never had a character like Harry, he's just so realistic in every way, and the acting is great as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A terrific adaptation of the classic story, and not too shabby in itself, either.   It is not perfect, as it has an excessive use of long shots, and the acting is pretty bad (i've read that a lot of actors were only offered small parts in the movie, or were only asked to be "action" parts and didn't get the opportunity to play much), but it's still fun to watch.  I don't think it's a bad movie, but it does have a couple of rough edges that I didn't like.  It's definitely a film for the kids, but I would recommend for adults only if you're looking for a light adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is extremely interesting. I like the plot and the characters, and they all work together really well to form a cohesive story. It is not just about the three main characters, but all the supporting characters too, as each one of them has a purpose and helps the main characters in some way or another. I loved watching them become closer and see each of them grow as a person. I was not aware of the number of people she was related to until the end of the movie, and I was glad to find out that it wasn't just the main character she was in love with.   This movie is a little hard to watch because there are a lot of secrets and things that the characters have to hide that are more than they want to admit. It really shows how these people, who are meant to be perfect, have made some of the biggest mistakes they've ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The plot is simple, but it's not overly simplistic. A couple get caught in a bad car accident, and it turns into an adventure, with all of the usual stuff of road tripping and things to do. I like this movie, as it has a lot of different situations and things that happen. It's not a straight story, but an adventure movie. It doesn't have a lot to do with the plot, but the adventure aspect is nice.   A pretty good film in its own right. The scenery is great, and you see the entire country of Brazil through the eyes of a couple.  The first part of the film is good, and then it turns in to a different story. A good car chase movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film in a small multiplex. The theater was packed. They had just shown the last season of the show "Breaking Bad" before closing and had a nice selection of great movies. I would have paid to see this and the other films I saw, but instead I bought a few beers and went to the concession stand, where I bought some ice cold Budweiser and some fries. This was a great film. I saw it about a year after its original release and it was good to see it in theaters again. I wish they would get it out on more of the big screen. I am very excited to see the final season next year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am sure you have noticed by now, but "The Green Mile" is actually a really good movie, and there is a reason it has been nominated for 8 Oscars, and has become one of the most well-known and widely-praised of all American westerns.   There is a fantastic balance between the realistic violence and emotional melodrama in the film.  The cast is so perfect, and the director uses them well.  For example, Tom Hanks as Green Mile's Doc Holliday is brilliant, and he makes his character relatable even if we know he's never met a gunfight he didn't want to be a part of.  There are several other good actors, and while the film was shot in black and white, it is still well worth watching in color.  I also love the original score by Frank Zappa, and if you have never seen it, you should definitely check it out!   The acting is also so well done in this film. I know a lot of "western" actors are a bit boring these days, but Bill Paxton is incredible.  If you are not looking for a good western, and are interested in some great acting and character building, then "The Death of Johnny Green" is a must see.  - Jean Tait - A GOOD, HANDMADE VILLAINS MOVIE  A GOOD VILLAIN MOVIE :   "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is my favorite western film ever made.  Director Sergio Leone makes great use of this film, and this is the most authentic western I've seen.  "Good, Bad, and Ugly", is set in the late 1800's, but is not the kind of film that requires a lot a research, just a little bit of effort.  This is the film you want to show a family with.  It is not just about a simple killing.  All of the good, bad, and ugly about the American west is present, and is shown in a way that makes the viewer think about what they know about the west, and then questions them about the real west.  In all the films Leone makes, I have never felt he takes a character and makes him a villain.  However, this film is not as simple as just killing somebody, or a group of people, it has a lot more to it than that.  When you see the violence that is shown,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the most part, this movie is pretty entertaining. But there is one scene in particular that is totally out of place and does not make sense whatsoever. This scene is after a woman goes to give her boyfriend a massage. The woman gets out of the shower and gets a glass of water, and sits down to have her massage. While sitting down, she looks at her reflection in the mirror and sees that she has grown a big head. She goes to grab her hair, but before she can do it, the reflection suddenly explodes and sends her out of her body.   This movie is not just entertaining, it's mind-blowing. You just have to watch this movie to understand. It has such an awesome ending, the best ending I have seen in a movie. It's so cool to see such a movie make a comeback. This movie would make the perfect Christmas movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For this movie to be made in the 1940's, and so well preserved, you have to know what you are getting yourself into. This is a very honest movie, and it has a lot to say about life in the country. The director, a veteran of Hollywood, was not concerned with making a good picture. The production was so well put together, and the characters so real, you just don't feel like you are watching a typical film. I was born in the year that this was made, but I remember seeing this movie as a little boy, and my father showed it to me one night, and I had to watch it again, after his death. This movie has a wonderful feeling of nostalgia.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I attended the movie tonight and both agree this is a great movie with some great performances. Our favorite actor is in this movie and I can't get enough of his great lines. The script is very clever and funny and we love it. I also liked the way it was shot and edited.    I think it's a very interesting movie to see because it deals with people who are so different but can be friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film has an excellent cast and a story about a young girl, Nala (Haneen Zoghbi), who must learn the truth about her parents. It's not a particularly deep plot, but this is a film that's about more than just that. I really did love this film, because its message of love and friendship is something that a lot of children need to hear. The director, Jafar Panahi, also directed the excellent documentary about the Iran-Iraq War, "Farewell to the Great Patriotic War".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a number of movies on here that have given me a good laugh over the years but this one was a little bit more of a treat for me. It's funny, it's funny with a twist, it is funny with no "plot" and is a great example of "A Good Old-Fashioned Story". The actor playing John Paul Jones is a real hoot in this, he has a very likable character. The director of the film is a terrific one. There is so much more that could have been done with this film and made it more interesting but that's the way of the world, and John Paul was just a part of the picture. The whole thing is great. It doesn't really have anything going for it. It was a funny old-fashioned movie and it has some good moments. It is just a little different from other Hollywood films. It will be interesting to see how many other good old-fashion films there are in this genre. It may just be the way to go. The actor who plays the dog is a fine one too. The ending has some terrific moments too. This may not be for everybody but I was really having fun watching this one. It has a bit of a "B" rating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoy the cast of characters. I find that there is no one who is so in your face and so much like you that you can relate to.   There is a man who is not much fun to have around and if you didn't know any better, he might be kind of a douche bag.  He has the ability to get into any situation or situation and can make it interesting or even entertaining if he has a big plan.  The only problem is he is such a huge character that it's hard to care for him when he is acting like such a jerk.  I like that it can be a little dark sometimes and there are some great moments. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen the movie, but from what I hear it's a pretty good one.   It's got an interesting plot about a doctor who's having some difficulty recovering from an accident that's put him in a coma. When he wakes up he sees his wife and the doctor she works for. He wants to help, but his wife wants a divorce. This leads to a crazy and funny script.  A little late in the game for it, but it's still a great flick.  It also has some great actors in it, and a great script for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say I'm glad I saw this. It's the only movie of mine that didn't scare me when I was a kid (well... except for one movie where a clown attacked my sister, but that one only lasted for a little while)   This movie is about the search for the real Bigfoot. It takes place in the early 70s, when Bigfoot was still rumored and believed in. I think there is still some truth to the legend. The movie was really good and made me curious about the Bigfoot.   The movie itself was well acted and was good to see the cast members on the big screen again.  The only problem I had with this movie was the soundtrack. I'm not a huge fan of that type of music so it wasn't the most effective way to put this movie to rest.  I'd love to see this movie come out in IMAX, but it's kind of expensive for a movie that wasn't released theatrically. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is funny, and I like a good laugh. If you have kids, you need to rent this movie.   The movie was pretty bad. The story was cheesy, and the acting was not very good. But this movie is an adult movie and it should have been better. The plot was not believable. I do not think the movie was funny at all.  If you can get a DVD, you will like this movie, if not, you probably will not like it at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â If you want to watch a good action movie (I would say better than a great action movie) then I recommend "Predator"    I have seen this movie several times and it is always an awesome action movie. It has all the right ingredients to make a great movie (good characters, strong plot, solid acting, great action, etc.).   You need a great actor like Arnold and I recommend a DVD or VHS for this movie.   The special effects are superb. The Predator itself has a nice action-movie look to it.  "Predators" is not a very good movie. The film's pacing and action are just average. It seems to be more about Arnold than the Predator.  The story is very forgettable (more like boring filler) and while the Predators are pretty cool the script is very cliche. The last scene is great but it's really not that important.  Â    What makes this film good is the action (particularly the final fight) and the action scenes. It would be nice if the filmmakers would have tried something different with the story.

I was fascinated with it because I had never seen a movie that seemed like a live event. The set was immaculate and the camera, set and lighting were all amazing. I loved the special effects. The story and performances were great. I remember being at the theatre while the film was showing, the kids were laughing and screaming and the adults were crying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at a drive-in theater on a Friday night in June of 1978 and I have to say that it was a great night! The movie is very entertaining, and the music was great as well, and it was definitely one of those "when in Rome" type of movies. I got the feeling that it would make a good road trip movie, so it was great to watch the actors interact with one another at a movie theater in my hometown of Philadelphia. There was even an appearance from the real Marlon Brando!   My only problem with this movie was that the dialogue and the acting were not that great! Marlon would be the best to play the role of John Lennon, but he just wasn't right, it looked like he was trying to do too much and it just didn't come off like he meant it.   Also, I have no idea what was going on with the story line, but it seemed to be very "weird" to me. This movie is still very much in my head, as I love it and remember it quite clearly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Last of the Mohicans" has the feel of an old timey western, where the white hat guy and his Native partner face off against their evil Indian opponent and his men, both bad. "The Great Santini" has a similar feel, but more modern. The movie is a story of two men - Santini and his friend Joe - who try to survive in a world where the laws of nature are different than what we would think today. There are some interesting twists and turns in the story that make you question just how much of the history is real, and how much was just made up. One of the things that I was surprised by is the portrayal of Indians as a "dirty tribe", where they just don't have any respect for humans, and don't want to be part of civilized society. The film does a good job of portraying that Indians were in a primitive state of existence, not having even much use for their tools and weapons. The natives are the ones that are constantly in a race against the sun, with no way to make or maintain any kind of camp. Santini is portrayed in a sympathetic light, and his friends and family are portrayed as decent people who try their best.   The Native Americans in this movie are portrayed more as savages than as Indians, which I found interesting. While I don't really think they had much more of a culture, it still makes them seem more like wild animals to me than people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had to see this one. It's a very dark and edgy film. There are some really creepy scenes that really made me feel that this was an honest, realistic depiction of a life lived in the 80s. The acting is superb. I don't know if you can actually make a movie like this now, but it was a very fun movie back then.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went in with high hopes, and as I said it was more like the good-ish bad than great-ish good. The first thing I noticed that bothered me was that some of the scenes were very repetitive. I mean, they basically took the same scenes and did it over and over. I'm sure this wasn't intentionally done, but it bothered me. Also, the acting wasn't very good in a few of the areas. I remember some of them saying something, but I didn't understand what they were saying and what they meant. I guess the actors just didn't have a very good grasp of the material, or maybe they were just trying to do the best they could. I could really tell that this was a film that was put together by a bunch of people that were really not very good at what they did.   This film will make you laugh, but at the same time, it will make your hair stand up. It was just a little too long for my tastes. If you just want some laughs, this film is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It had some great moments and some scenes that were just as good as in the movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that this is a good flick that is good enough to warrant a watch.

I like the idea of making a film like this, and that's exactly what the directors did.  The writing is really good as well.  So far, my only negative thing about this film is the lack of any music.  Overall, this is an enjoyable flick and it doesn't take any of the actors for granted.  It's a great flick for an audience that enjoys good movies.

My wife and I were in attendance when it came out, and we really laughed at a few scenes we saw.  It has a very low rating in the IMDB, but it was really worth the time and money, it is definitely a classic.  I'm giving this a 10   It's amazing when a director is able to make something look like a joke, and still make it look like it had a purpose. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of those movies that never fails to entertain.   I am a sucker for a movie that takes itself seriously.  Even if it's a spoof on a popular movie, there's just enough seriousness and earnestness that you can't help but laugh and cheer.  I like this movie so much because I find it hilarious.  It is a comedy of errors.  The film takes a number of missteps from the beginning to the end.  Unfortunately, many of the jokes don't land on their feet.  But it's still a great film that has its moments of pure hilarity.  A real treat for the eye and the mind. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" at a young age, I had an idea of what I was getting into. I remember going on the tour of the Willy Wonka House and the "Danger Room" and how terrifying that place was. I wasn't afraid of being killed by Wonka or being swallowed by the maze. That is the perfect metaphor for the fear of adulthood and the adult world. But the movie is more about love, and how when you put your heart in the right place, the world becomes a much better place. There are some very talented people in the film and they are all doing well. The voice cast is phenomenal and you will see the world through their eyes. The special effects are just amazing. This is one of those classic kids movies that everyone should see, no matter what age you are.   "Wonka and Juliet" and "The Sting" are also good films that I recommend.

The voice acting is very good. The scenery is beautiful. The story is very interesting. The music is really good.    The only flaw is the way the "LONE RANGER" series was handled. The first two films are great, but the last one was horrible. It makes me want to go out and rewatch the entire series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't know the film was set in Vietnam, but it is based on the true story of the time when the US military bombed the city of Saigon during the Vietnam War, so it had the effect of being realistic.  A well-produced film that is very relevant now.   The film is filled with scenes that are true, yet it does not take away from the drama.  The characters are very believable and the actors do an amazing job.  It does not have any big action scenes and it's not a high speed chase.  I think the film is a lot better now than it was in 1975 when I saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a big fan of the films in the series and I was sad that we weren't getting any of the sequels.   This one was so much fun to watch and it was very realistic.  A lot of the scenes were based on actual events that happened to a lot of people in real life and this film really showed that.  Also, a great little bonus with the movie is that it's narrated by the real-life victims in the film.  This is the perfect film for people who were disappointed with the last installment in the Thelma and Louise series.

This movie is based on the true story of a man who was in a very dark place when he decided to kill his wife. He took an axe and went into the woods where he began chopping the body up. When he realized he was losing too much blood, he decided he would just kill her as well.  The story is very disturbing and really makes you think about what you would do to someone in your situation.  I really enjoyed the acting in this movie and all of the characters really felt realistic and real. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first few minutes of the movie reminded me of an old silent horror movie where a man gets out of bed in the middle of the night to hear his wife screaming.

It was also hilarious and extremely well done.  Â  It was very entertaining as it kept the tension very high throughout and kept you thinking.  It did a wonderful job of keeping your attention throughout the entire movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In "Funny Girl," the film's central character, a successful but sexually deviant business executive named Jody (Dane DeHaan), decides to take matters into her own hands by hiring a prostitute to seduce a rich businessman's wife.   DeHaans has said that his film is a critique of what's wrong with society, and it's hard to disagree with that idea.  As for Jody, her sexual desires are a manifestation of her need to be a star, and that's why she turns to prostitution in the first place.  Dehaan is a perfect choice for Jony, a lanky, athletic, and physically intimidating man who is clearly a winner, which is why she's willing to overlook the fact that he's a little weird.  In the process of seducing Jony's wife, the prostitute is raped, and the audience is left to wonder whether Jody will go to jail for her crimes.  Though the film does feature plenty of explicit sex scenes, the film ultimately offers a much more balanced take on the sexual politics of the 1970s.  While it's a bit too soon to write off "F Funny Girl" as a "Hollyweird" movie, the movie is far better than the box office returns have indicated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I went to see it last week. We had the same reactions that everyone else did-- the movie just wasn't that great. I liked the director and the cast, but we were just not very drawn into the movie. If they have a decent story that isn't ruined by bad performances, then it could make a better movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've just seen it for the first time, and it's the first movie I've seen that made me realize that Hollywood is actually a legitimate art form. It's so well made, so beautifully shot, and so interesting.  This movie shows a man, played by Martin Sheen, who has an affair with a woman he loves, and then has to live with the guilt.  He doesn't like it when she visits and he always lies to her.  But, for the rest of the film, he's able to come to terms with this situation.  A great film.   - - -  -

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an amazing movie. It really shows you the way men live with each other, and the way they treat each other.   I felt like I got to see how the world felt when women had rights.  I feel this is a movie that will stand the test of time and I think it deserves a lot of respect for its creativity and its depiction of the world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I am writing this review I am sitting in the car and I just thought to myself, "If only   this movie  didn't  take so long to get out,   I might have  enjoyed this movie a lot more  ." I have seen so many bad movies and I was disappointed with this one.   It was only a two hours film but  it seemed like  the actors and crew were in their element  and  trying to do  the right thing to make this a great movie.  I also  felt like  something  about the script was  off  and that  probably  explains why  the production fell apart.   My favorite thing about this movie is the  music and  I always think that  the sound effects that  come from the  actors in the movie  really get the audience involved !

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie about four times now and it never gets old.   There is a scene where the character is riding along the river when he gets shot and gets knocked out.  He gets up to walk away but sees a car driving slowly towards him and the driver has a gun aimed at him.  In a weird way it really helps his character get back up.  It makes the movie more realistic and realistic characters make more realistic movies.  I loved it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie about a young girl who meets the love of her life, and what happens when she starts seeing the people in his life. It's a story of how a relationship can go astray, and it was actually one of the better things that came out of the 2000's.   The movie's a bit confusing. There are several characters to pay attention to. It makes it hard to figure out who is who and what they are doing.  The acting is very good. I don't know what the actors did in the movie but they were very convincing. I also liked the way that they portrayed some of the characters.  They played these characters very realistically.  One of the best characters was the father of the girl's love. The way the director played with his emotions to make the father seem so real that it really made the father a more interesting character than he was in the book.  Another good character was the young man that is dating the girl. The director made him seem like an old man. I like how the director captured this old man's mannerisms.  I also appreciated the way they made the old man look very old.  A really good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a pretty simple concept, but it was so well done that I found myself having fun at all the right moments.  I don't think I've ever seen a movie that had a lot of action and didn't seem to take itself too seriously.  It has a very believable plot, which, combined with the comedy, was perfect.  My only complaint would be that I wish the action scenes weren't as intense and fast-paced as they were in the trailer.  The music is great, and the animation is really quite nice for a movie like this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A new take on the horror genre, and while it doesn't exactly have the classic elements of a good horror movie, it has an original story and is a blast to watch.   It is an effective scare for both kids and adults, and it has many killer scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge fan of the old Indiana Jones movies, even though I've never been a fan of Indiana Jones.   This is one of my favorite Indiana Jones flicks.  The acting is great, and Indy is just amazing.  His "I don't believe this...I think this is a dream" scene was great.  This movie had a great story, and an amazing "Indiana" character.  It's one of the greatest films of all time, and is a must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you are looking for a fun comedy, a real laugh, then you should watch this. This movie is a great comedy that you'll see again and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this at the cinema a few weeks back and it has been on my list ever since. It's a really fun time to sit down and watch a good old fashioned movie, and while it's not something that can be considered a masterpiece in any regard, it does the job very well. It features some great action and a great cast of characters, and a very clever and well put together plot that takes you through many interesting situations.  This isn't a perfect movie, but it still gets a 9/10 out of me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a story about the life and times of a boy born into a family of thieves. But he grew up to be a famous boxer and also a world champion and this film gives us a little insight in his life.   The acting is excellent and the story is compelling.  The pacing is excellent as it does not drag on.  I am looking forward to see the next instalment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really excited about this movie. I had read lots of reviews of it and was really worried I would like it. I thought there would be some sort of strange acting or something I would find weird or off. After I watched it I realized I loved it! I liked the direction the director took the movie in, even though I thought it was a little slow to start. The ending made me want to watch it again in a couple of years to see where they take it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a sucker for action flicks and if you've seen the Predator or Aliens   you've already seen this movie so I won't go into detail on it. But I will say that I liked it and I hope you'll give it a chance.   From the opening scene you know that this movie is going to be something special. And I had no problem with the acting and the violence.  It all played great.  I was hooked from the moment I walked into the theatre.  This movie has everything you need to kick ass and have a good time. I highly recommend you watch it  and you will enjoy it

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a long time fan of Joss Whedon and I thought I was watching something that was more of a prequel to Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog than a feature film. However, after the third act, Dr. Who became Dr. Whos. Joss has given the Whos some serious gravitas, making them not only a group but a family. J.K. Rowling (who wrote the Harry Potter books) also makes an appearance as a mother who is the inspiration for the entire group. Her character has some great moments and I hope that in the future we get to see more of her. Also, I am always interested in seeing the younger Whos in future Dr. who films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to admit that this movie is not your average one.  It has everything, from a good plot and good acting to some great action. I like that it was made by a director with no connections to the Hollywood world.    The special effects are excellent as well.  My only problem was that it had a long running time, which is not the director's fault. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The story is a simple one - four people, all in their twenties, find out that the world has been taken over by the evil, greedy alien creatures known as the Grays. While the Gray-controlled world has a great deal of natural beauty, it is also terribly dull. It's all about the Grates. In this way, it's a very basic horror story - the only real difference is that it's the Grasy-controlled Earth where the Grate's control is weakest." - Stephen King  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always enjoyed the Alien films, but not as much as some of the Aliens movies, so when I saw Alien: Resurrection (which I haven't seen yet) I was a little skeptical, but when I watched it, it was amazing!   The movie has a lot of things going on, but what made it so amazing was the acting.   Peter Weller and Kane Hodder are excellent, and the movie has moments that are hilarious, and sad.  I'd also like to mention the fact that the Alien suits really make you feel they are the bad guys!  It was really fun seeing the monsters as they appeared in the film, and seeing how they were different from the ones from the original movies.  There is a very interesting and unexpected ending that was really well written.  A great movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The action is so well balanced and well thought out. I love the fight between the old man and the young man to get the money, the camera work is awesome and the fight is amazing. The only problem I have is that the woman, who is playing the young woman, isn't a real girl. She's so thin, and the makeup is off. It doesn't help that you can't see her breasts when she's walking, but her ass and hips are still all there.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a love-hate relationship with this film. I find it interesting and fascinating that people still keep re-making these films, and in the early '90s there was a lot of controversy over whether or not it was art or just the result of a clever exploitation of an existing product. The fact that it was produced by a director who has gone on to do such other films, like a director's-director on a bad Saturday Night Live skit called the "Night of the Demons," makes it all the more interesting.   While it is hard to look past the exploitative elements of this film, the film is a really well-done and entertaining flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't remember how I got this movie, but I saw it at a midnight show at a theater in Boston. It had a special effect for me, a few shots that made me jump and a really good story. I can't remember why I liked it so much, but it was good.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, this movie is a good "old school" film. It has a great sense of atmosphere. The music was well used, and the whole production was nicely animated. This is probably the best movie that I have seen that was made between 1930-1935. It is an old school, "cute" kind of movie. This movie is all about a poor man and his family in the small town of Horsham, England. The poor man is a drunkard, and a very unpleasant person. He has no interest in his family, and is an unwanted presence in the family. The family goes through great hardship, while they try to support him.   The scene with the girl is a favorite of mine. It was the first time I heard the song "She's a Lady", and that scene still brings back the memories of my early childhood. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really impressed with the quality and depth of this film and the actors.   For me, it's the best American western film that I have ever seen.  The acting is so convincing and you get to see the characters in their true light.  When the outlaws first show up, they are a bit off and don't seem to fit the western film.  Later on, the cast is superb.  With the good acting and the amazing direction, this film is not just a good western film, but a very enjoyable film that every film-lover should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie I'm talking about is called DANCE! There is no other way to put it. It is the real deal and a must see. It's the same thing as DANCE, just better. And the dancing is just spectacular. It all depends on your point of view and if you are a fan of dancing.   I saw DANCE at the Cinema Arts Center at the age of 14 and I still can't believe it. My high school dance teacher in the 50s had to put up a "no dancing" sign. She would have killed me if I came to dance. If that happens to you, don't even consider a dance class.  The dancing is great and it shows a lot about the times in those years. There is a great scene at the end where the dancing teacher tries to tell her class, "we are so poor! How come we are getting rich while your people are in prison?" It makes me smile every time I hear it.  I wish this movie was made a couple of decades ago. It would be a must have in your movie collection.

I think the film has a lot to offer because it is one of the few times when we see the real Morpheus (I never realized that he was the same person until after I saw this film).

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A really well made film about a father and his teenage son on a camping trip. If you haven't seen the film, then don't let that put you off.   I've been wanting to see this since watching it at the theatre when I was young.  The story is really interesting. It has a strong female lead, a little boy and a really great cast.  It will keep you thinking. Â The music is also fantastic, and it will make you want to sing along.  If you like a good, rambling and somewhat sad family movie, then look no further.

I am not going to spoil the movie so I will let the movie speak for itself. If you like a good mafia flick or mafia drama then you should watch this one, this movie is very good. This is one of the best mafia flicks in a long time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't really enjoy the first "The Last Boy Scout". I wasn't crazy about the direction. However, the second one I loved. The character of Mike is just fantastic and you feel sorry for him. He was just trying to do the right thing for his family. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. And yes, the film is a little silly, but it does a good job of showing the struggle between the individual and the collective and the things that happen to make you question the choices you make. It's well done.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am glad to have seen the great work done by "Hudson Mohawke", one of the world's best living drummers, as well as an important voice in music.

I enjoyed this movie very much.   - December 20, 2005Hudsons greatest work  Reviewer: wwjunkins - favorite favorite favorite - September 4, 2005  Subject: Hudson on his worst movie! The only thing I can say that's negative about the movie is that it's not at all convincing. When I saw it it was a new movie, I knew nothing about the actor, and even knew he was not going to be able to do a smooth, convincing impression of the great artist that he was supposed to portray. All I can remember after seeing the movie was that I was just tired of the movie. I felt like there was no substance. - September 1, 2005Muddy Mud I saw a review of this movie on here a while back. The whole thing was about a poor guy that got into the band. He ended up going broke, and eventually he gave up playing, but was still trying to get by. The actor for Hudsons character was really good and really funny, but the movie just came off as phony and it just seemed like it was made by a group of actors who all thought they could get away with making a movie and no one was going to find out about it. - August 17, 2005Lets get this real. Hudson just got a job at the local mall, and is trying to save up to pay off his student loan. That is the story of his life, and I have to say, it sounds like a very bad one. What a way to end it. I'm sorry it ended like that, but it's too bad that he ended up not being good at it. He should be making more films. It would have been nice to see the actor with his real talent and not this guy with his fake talent. I would have liked to have spent more time with him, especially after the end of the film. It felt like they were trying to convince us that the movie wasn't as bad as we all thought, but when you actually watch the movie and see what it really was about, it wasn't even a bad movie. - July 19
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is the film that I wish had existed in the early 70's!   The film shows the world the war was not just a clash between two powers in the Middle East.   It shows how these two sides that were fighting each other, were just as much a part of the world at that time as America, and the world.  For people to know what was going on with the people in the film, and know what real wars were really like is a wonderful film.  When I watch this film I think of the time in my family where I was taught about real wars, and not just the ones you see in movies.  What a great film!

It was a movie about a guy who's crazy and wants to be a soldier in WW2 and is given some gear and told to go do this, so he goes and does it. I got a little bit of a kick out of this movie. It did take a while for me to figure out how to do the shooting but I did eventually get it. It wasn't anything like it was in the movie so if you haven't seen the movie, you might want to just stop and go see this one, it's a bit better than the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a good time watching this movie. I love it, and my wife and I enjoyed it a great deal. It was interesting.   The plot is pretty much like the one in the book. In fact, it is even the same book.  I only thought it was interesting to see who the actors were playing.  They didn't seem to know much about the characters, but it wasn't their fault.  All the characters were interesting, and very well acted. I think they were all good actors, so it is nice to have a movie with two or more of them.  My wife and daughter didn't notice a difference in the movie between the movie we saw and the one that was shown on TV.  The only thing I didn't like was the way the character was written.  In the book, it was a simple story, and didn't take much time to get started.  However, the movie is much longer and has a lot more action than the book does. The movie could be just a little shorter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in college when this movie came out. I was lucky enough to watch it at the cinema.  Â There were many things I liked about it that I haven't seen before.  One of the greatest things about it was the soundtrack.  I just loved the music in it.  What I didn't love as much was the way the movie was made.  It was almost as if someone who had never done a horror movie saw a successful film, tried to mimic it with cheap special effects and a cheap score.  In fact, the only thing I thought worked was the scene where there is a woman trying to get out of the house.  The other actors seemed to be on different pages as well.  This is probably the one movie I have seen where the actors did not act together well. I think that is why it was such a great success.  For the money it was worth.

The performances by Don Ameche, Dan Aykroyd, and Richard Gere are as good as you'd hope for. It's a fun movie to watch, with plenty of laughs and lots of action.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of this movie is fascinating and you will learn a lot about how life is lived in the villages of Tibet. The actors portraying the local Tibetans are excellent. They make you feel as if you are actually there and are completely immersed in the lives of ordinary people.   As the movie ends we learn about how the village is so impoverished that if there is no rain for weeks the whole village will be forced to go without.  In all of the films I have seen in my life this one is one of the most beautiful. The colors and the cinematography are amazing. The whole movie is beautiful and you feel it and it feels real. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The film opens with the most unusual sequence of images I have ever seen: a giant hand, resembling a hand with one of its fingers grown so large that the palm can be clearly seen, is raising a gigantic, almost perfect sphere. The camera pans back and forth, following the sphere, as a man in a military uniform, with his face hidden behind a helmet, watches with interest. "It is the biggest sphere in the world," says the man, "and I'm standing next to it." At that moment, the man on the pedestal drops his gaze and smiles. This is a scene reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but much more impressive. There is something very striking about the way the sphere suddenly shifts to a scene of a black-and-white photograph of the world. One of the first things the sphere does is to turn its back on the man who watched it grow. Then the sphere rises to a height of about fifty feet. As it does so, it suddenly appears to have a face. When it turns around, it is again seen from behind, staring off into space. The shot of the sphere's back suddenly becoming the back of a face is a brilliant visual trick; it seems to have taken place at the same moment the man dropped his gaze, and yet this was not just a single moment. This sphere has been observing all of us. It knows that we are watching it, and even that we can see it, because we are also seeing it as we watch it. The scene then flashes to the present. A boy has just been killed by the giant sphere. And as the sphere is about to rise again, the boy is raised and carried away by his mother. Suddenly, the sphere turns its back and is seen from the front again. Suddenly it appears to be a face! The film then takes off in an epic sweep through the present and the past, showing us the moment in which the sphere first took shape, a tiny dot of glowing white on a vast black sea. The past, though, is filled with ominous memories. The sphere is being watched over the heads of his parents as they sleep, and the little boy who was killed earlier is back again. The film ends with a shot of a beautiful sunrise over a blue sea, as the camera pans slowly back to reveal the little dot in the darkness. It is as if we are finally seeing the sphere and its creator in person, and it

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really excited when I saw this movie and thought it was going to be a pretty good movie. I had seen it on the big screen in the cinema and thought the acting was great, the music was great and the story was pretty cool. When I saw the trailer, I didn't think it would be as good as it turned out to be. The story was interesting, but it could have used more depth to it. And, the acting could have been a little better. In the end, the story just doesn't have enough depth to carry the movie. If they had cast someone better than the people who played the kids in the trailer (I guess the actors who did play the kids did really well...), this movie could have had a great storyline.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The characters were all so likable, you would never think they were in a bad movie, they all seemed really sweet and caring.   It really reminded me of the 80s cartoon films.  It was very entertaining and I enjoyed it a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie really surprised me. I have to admit it was my first time seeing a vampire movie, and after watching it I thought I was going to vomit. My friend and I got into the movie late, and I was very nervous. I think it was because of the scene with the vampire and a baby. I thought that was pretty messed up for a child. I really didn't like how they put the vampire on a leash like a dog. Then the whole thing started to freak me out, like the character was actually coming out of the vampire. He was really cool and looked like someone I knew. The acting was pretty good, but I really hated the vampire in the movie. The best part was when the vampire got a kiss on the lips. I never saw that in a vampire film before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the only movie I've seen where the people were all black and it was just cool.   I've seen a lot of movies about the Great Depression and I never thought I'd see a black man in it.  The people in this movie didn't act like the average person from the 1930's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good. It was shot and scored by David Hoberman who had an excellent score for this movie on a Hollywood soundstage. The music is good, the movie is very interesting, and David Hauer's direction is excellent. This movie has many elements that can be appreciated. The cinematography is beautiful. The acting is strong. The special effects are very good. But the story is very strange, with the actors giving the roles that are most likely the most interesting to them.   A great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the words of Billy Bob Thornton   (in the movie, not me): This movie is a bit like a bad dream in which you don't want to wake up, you don in fact want to stay in bed.   The story of the film revolves around the adventures of a man, Billy, who is living in rural Indiana. Billy is obsessed with the legend of the legendary Silver Bullet Riverboat. His aim is to meet the old man who was the driver of the riverboat and the man who drove the gun carriage. The old man is supposed to tell Billy the story of how his old driver died, and how he got out of the boat. This is a film that should be in the collections of anyone interested in traveling to the old west.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was very good. I enjoyed it very much and I feel it was well worth the time it took to watch it.   This movie is a good "action" flick.  Â   I have watched other movies of this genre and they all were so dull.  For example, the other movies were always about "fighting" and "drama" but this movie was a bit different. It was more like a "thriller" in the sense that the main character (Tom Cruise) gets captured by terrorists and he has to escape and he does so by breaking into a "terrorist facility" that's under heavy guard and he ends up being captured by the terrorists who want to torture and kill him.  I had the same feeling that Tom Cruise had in the movie, he is trapped and he is really in trouble.  The main hero and his girlfriend (Jessica Biel) went there and rescued him and the rest of the movie we are following them and they have to escape. Â   This movie is not very good in the "action/thrilla" category.  But it has a good message and it is a pretty good action flick. Â  I just finished watching this movie and I liked it. I highly recommend it. Â 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie about 4-5 times over a couple of years and enjoyed it each time. It was a bit of a stretch but I never really thought it was a movie I would see again. I'm a fan of science fiction but there are so many great movies out there nowadays and this one just didn't feel like it was up to the standards of some of the ones I have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on the big screen and was very excited, when I got home I watched it on a TV with the sound off, but when I turned it on I realized why it was the most hyped up film out there. I had to see the original movie first before I saw the remake, but now I want to see it again!   It had that great feel to it, and I thought it was good enough to make it into a cult classic.   The acting was excellent, but the movie needs to be seen on the screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen this movie in a while. The story is really good, but the direction and the acting is very dated, and it was a very difficult movie to watch. Not worth the watch if you don't like the director or the script.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It took about 2 hours to see this film for the first time, but I love it.    The best part about this film is the acting, particularly from the two actresses.  From the beginning, we get a great performance from Kim Basinger, who plays the role of Jackie "Buster" Lind.  As a person who was raised as an Evangelical, Basing  This is a good film.  If you like the James Bond franchise, you will love this movie, but as I only have seen one Bond movie, and only in a bad way, I can't comment on it. However, Bastinger has a very sexy, seductive and mysterious style.  A good story and the actors are good at playing their roles.  I only wish there was more of the humor in the film, especially the comedy scenes between Basingar and Jones. It is not an action movie, so there should have been more of it. Overall, I think this movie will be a hit.  This movie was rated PG-13, so it may not be for some. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't love this movie, but it is quite funny, and there is a nice scene where the girl asks her dad, "What is it about white people that make them all such bad drivers?" This movie is funny, but I'd never watch it again because I was expecting something more, and that wasn't it. This is one of those movies that just seems to be a bit of a letdown. It might have been better if it had been made before.

The film is made of great actors, and the story is extremely well-crafted. It's easy to see how it's going to be a cult classic, as it's got the same type of film-noir feel as Taxi Driver.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first saw the trailer for The Wolfman, I got the feeling that it was a rip-off of Scarface and I didn't like it. My dad was really into The Goonies and I really enjoyed it so I decided to take my dad to see it. We went to the midnight showing at the local multiplex where the projectionist said it was great, except the guy in the wolf suit was way too tall. It's one of those movies you know when you see it, but I felt like I was looking at a film that was made for kids, with that one scene of the kid hanging from the monkey bars, and then the Wolfman guy running away from the camera. I would have been more comfortable with it if it didn't have the kid's face in the movie. It just felt like a cheap rip-on of the goonies. I ended up watching The Goons instead.   A few years after that, I was in college and my friend said he saw it at the multiplex, so we went to see. I think my dad saw it as well, although I don't think he liked it. The wolf guy and the kid in the costume looked great, but the wolf guy was way over the top. The kid was really creepy and the movie was way to long, so I never really saw it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a really well done piece of cinema.  The story, acting and performances are all very good.   It's a hard movie to find, it's like watching a different kind of film.  I'd recommend you to try this if you have some free time on your hands. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Star Wars" movies are my absolute favorite. From the first time I watched the original trilogy to the newest one, every movie I've seen or have watched is just fantastic. "Star Trek" is just amazing, "Titanic" is amazing, and "Indiana Jones" is great. But I haven't seen "The Phantom Menace."   My only criticism about this movie is that they didn't put a lot of the "Starfleet" stuff into it. It was almost like a "new" episode, a "reboot". So the only thing I got out of it is that there was some of the old Enterprise crew that appeared in the original series, and the one that is in this movie.   This movie is not very good. It's okay. It has its moments, but it's not something that I would really watch again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The man in the middle" is one of my favorite lines in film history.   I saw this movie about ten years ago and it's still one of the top movies I've seen in my life. Â I think that's because this is one movie that has no boundaries when it comes to it's characters and it really explores a lot of different types of characters.  "He can't read, he can't write, he has no clue what he's doing. Â  How does he make a living?"   You won't be able to put this movie down.  The acting is top notch and the screenplay is just as great.  It's a good action movie with good dialogue and is just a fantastic movie to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all honesty I was really expecting to find an old film from the 80's but was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box.   There is a whole lotta charm in this film and it doesn't hurt that it was made in 1981.  The plot was pretty basic but I really like that it focuses on a husband and wife who want to have a family.  Although the story isn't original there are some really good acting from many of the actors.  I also really like the music and I think that the film gets better every time I watch it.  This is a really fun film and I really recommend it. Â

If you want a good, suspenseful thriller that is just about finding out who is doing what then this is a movie for you    Rated 5 out of 5 by TKP from I like it...great stuff!   Very interesting mystery story about a killer and a man who tries to help the woman he loves.  It's really interesting that both characters are so believable, and I loved how the main character doesn't give up hope.  I love the film's soundtrack, the cinematography and the acting...and even the music that's played on the radio.  A must see!  I enjoyed this movie very much, and the killer is so well played. I would definitely recommend this to any horror fans out there!

Don't even watch it if you've seen it and you think you know it inside and out. I saw it for the first time in 1993 and immediately recognized it from all the interviews I had seen on TV.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was quite good. This was the first film I saw that really had an impact on me. I saw it at my parents house in the summer of '81 and watched it for the first time when I was in 8th grade, and my mom came home from work and we sat in the living room and watched the film. I can still remember the feeling of seeing it for my first time. I was enthralled, and then intrigued. My mom had just gotten my copy of the "Alfred Hitchcock Picture Collection" and I was watching it. I don't remember many of the actors, but this was the film that started my love affair with film.   As someone who was born into a household that only watched movies at home, this film was a revelation. I think it's the best film that Hitchcock ever made. It really does set the stage for the rest of his career, especially when it comes to the Hitchcock films in the '40s. It was also the first movie I saw where I thought that the film was "more of a thriller than a crime story."   This is a film that I look forward to watching again, for whatever reason. It's always been one of my favorites, and I will watch any movie Hitchcock has made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago my parents bought me a movie called Star Wars: Episode 1. It was one of those films that you couldn't get away from at first. But it did get me hooked on film and I would sit through multiple viewings until I could finish the film. I remember being terrified when Luke Skywalker appeared on screen and I didn't think he would last very long. But as time went on, I came to love him more and more. The fact that he was young and naive and didn't have a lot of experience made him an even better hero. Star Wars has aged really well. The new films (I think The Force Awakens) look great. My wife and I went out for a movie last night and it was great. It's a great space adventure and a good family film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little disappointed that the movie wasn't as scary as it seemed to be. The people in the movie looked like some of the people on the show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I would like to thank the cinematographer of this movie, Mr. Thomas Schlamme, for his splendid work in creating this picture. It is a picture of the beautiful and wonderful people who are so desperately trying to keep their lives intact and the happiness of their families alive in a land where most are so unhappy that they make all kinds of terrible decisions. Mr. SchlamME's picture brings into vivid and dramatic focus the lives of these people, who have lost themselves so completely. One can almost feel them suffering and struggling to get back on their feet. The film is so well-directed and filmed that it is difficult to believe that it was a real picture. I am so glad that it has been made, and that it will give a good example of the human heart."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story follows a young man who is sent to a mental hospital by the government. The man is then visited by two girls, who both tell him to meet a man they call "the doctor".Â    This film is not for the faint of heart. It is a hard-hitting story with a very dark ending.   It takes some time to get into the story and there is no explanation to the actions that the characters are doing. It will take some time for you to fully understand what is going on.  This movie is not just about the action and gun fights. It really focuses on the characters and their struggles and how they must deal with life.  They have to live in a world that is a very different from their own.  There are several moments in this movie where the characters seem to be "on their own". They don't understand why something is happening to them. They don' t seem to know what the outside world is like.  These are some of the most realistic films I have ever seen.  It is amazing what they were able to do with a limited budget.  While this movie is no longer available on VHS it can still be found on DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to see a funny movie, look no further than "Reds."   A young man is living on the street when his buddy introduces him to a strange woman named Judy.   Judy is in fact an older woman, but this does not take away from the humor and fun of the film. Â It's an amusing film and a little touching at times.  It was a lot of fun and you can't go wrong with a comedy with a woman in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title says it all. This is a good story about good people with the right intentions.   "You see that? That's the old house! The new one's brand new! It's a house of mirrors... A house where no one can find out what's in them."  The old house is still a home to some of the people who live there.  Some of them are trying to make it better, while others want to leave.  It's clear that some of them have been fighting with one another for years.  The main character, a young man named Bill, is trying to find the source of an electrical leak in his attic.  He finds the leak is coming from a vent that runs to an air vent on the roof.  There's some very good characters in this movie. Â The actors do a great job.  Â  The actors all do a good job of showing who they are.  When they act, they show the real emotions they have when they are in different situations.  They are all good.  Sometimes when watching a movie, I wish they would all be in one movie.

We were transported to the real world with just the right mix of humor and heart that makes you feel like you really are there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In my opinion, John Carpenter's film The Thing is a horror classic. The story is a great combination of a man's desperation to survive an extraterrestrial assault, and a woman's ability to use his fear and pain to drive him back into the dark depths of the Antarctic. This story of survival and terror is a brilliant use of story structure, and the visuals are top notch. The creatures, particularly the gigantic tentacled ones, are truly terrifying, and their horrifying appearances are never over the top.   I highly recommend this film for anyone looking to see a masterpiece in the horror genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this because my family is big on "good films" and I thought it would be good. Unfortunately, it wasn't very good at all. My father hates it and my mother hates it, and I am not much of a movie buff, so I couldn't even tell you if it was good or bad. It is one of those movies you go to see if you don't care. The only thing I enjoyed about it was the song about the evil queen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last two years of my life have been an utter waste. I was on top of the world. I thought I had finally found my niche as a screenwriter. That's how I kept myself in film-production jobs, and then suddenly they're gone. So many people seem to think screenwriters are lucky to have the privilege of being around. That they have a special connection to the screenwriting art form, and that it's an easy career for anybody to get into. That can't be true. When I left Hollywood I really felt I was being let down. I didn't feel that I had made it, but I also wasn't sure I had ever made it. I had been at it so long, and so hard, and just at the bottom of the barrel, that I started to think, "How did I end up this way? And how do I get out of here?" I kept getting in my car and driving around the San Fernando Valley, looking at houses with their old pictures and old windows. They're just sitting there, unoccupied. I think I started going to houses and telling the owners, "Look, if you're going to let the film industry get away with this, maybe you should just do it yourself." There are so many great filmmakers that I would have loved to work with. That is a long list: John Huston, David O. Selznick, John Ford, Howard Hawks, William Wyler, John Frankenheimer, Oliver Stone. A lot of those names come up in my films, and I feel like I got passed over for many of them. I don't think that was a bad thing. I felt like if I could have gotten my foot in the door and done a little work, maybe I could be a part of a team and get some work done. I've always been happy to work on a limited budget, and with a short schedule. I like the isolation and the focus and the control that comes with that. I also like that the more money you have, the less chance you have of making a great film.   This movie has some really good ideas. The story is interesting, and it has a great script. It's a shame I never got to direct this one.   Trivia:  Was a graduate of USC. He attended with the intention of graduating, but he never graduated due to the amount of stress it put him under to have to put together a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie.   It is not just that this is a good, entertaining movie, but it is also a really beautiful film.  It has a really nice, almost pastoral look to it.  When you watch it, you are just looking at these people walking through this countryside and the scenery is beautiful and beautiful to look at.  I loved this movie. The cast is great, especially in this movie, and they really did a great job with their acting.  There were so many memorable scenes in this film. And I know it sounds cheesy to say that this film is a classic, but I really think so. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie by Steven Spielberg.  This is a classic.  I'm glad he didn't give up after the success of Jaws.    I think I was 8 when I saw this.  The characters are great. Â I never got the idea of it being a shark movie.   I saw it when it first came out in theaters. I wasn't a big fan.  At the time, I was living in California and would see it on tv. I remember it being in black and white with a huge cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first heard about this movie a couple years ago. It seemed to have a very well-developed script and a great cast of actors. It is not hard to imagine that the film will be an instant classic and possibly even a classic. It's an old-school spy flick. The plot is straightforward and the characters are all believable. There's some romance and some suspense and a little bit of suspense. The music and cinematography are wonderful. I have been a fan of John Boorman since I first saw The French Connection. I love his films. I don't really know if I can rank this in any particular order. I definitely think it is a must see. The movie is funny, sad, suspenseful, and suspenseful.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great.   For a horror movie, the plot is pretty interesting.  Â  There are plenty of scares and blood.  This film is also funny at times.  I really like the music.  My favorite song is the intro song "You're so weird and strange...".  It's a funny song and I love it.  The acting is also great and it made my day.  "   I hope they will make a sequel.  A little more gore and more blood would be nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a classic film of the 70's and I was born during the 70s and as a kid I always wanted to see this movie on TV and in the theaters. The cast was great and they captured the essence of the film perfectly and I always loved it.    The movie is based on a novel by Anthony Burgess and it has a great story and good acting as well as a great soundtrack and great effects. Â    I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves adventure and action and if you want to experience a good action movie, don't miss this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the movies from this movie.   They are different.  This is a darker movie. But it is very well made. I wish this movie was made a long time ago. Â  It is hard to believe how good they made it.  They were on the cutting edge in many ways.  I always thought they were the best filmmakers around.  But the film is over now.  The film is not a bad film. It is very good and it had an impact on many people. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think the story could be better, but this movie is worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first heard about this film I was pretty much underwhelmed. After watching it again, however, I have to say that it is just about perfect!   It's a little bit silly, but not in a bad way.   I was also surprised at how well it fit in with the film's theme.  Â  The film doesn't necessarily delve into the "what if" plot, but it's not an overbearing plot either.  It is a nice little piece of film that just takes a moment to relax and enjoy the scenery and scenery only.  I had a hard time deciding on my favorite scene and the one that has me most excited for my next viewing is probably the scene where the characters are looking through an old photo album and seeing pictures from their youth.  The film has a great deal of detail and is well worth your time.  I look forward to seeing it again and hoping that it gets a theatrical release. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never heard of this movie before watching it, but it was a real good watch, it was not a movie where you saw all the bad parts, and the movie did not suffer from bad acting. It was a very good movie, I have seen it before.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was amazing! It was very well done and the director was very clever with the use of flashbacks in the story. It had some great actors too, which is always nice to have in a film.   There is a very interesting mystery to the plot, and I loved the twist at the end. It was also very funny at times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a terrific picture. It tells a terrific story. The cast is superb. I was glad to see Jack Lemmon in a leading role. I think he was having fun with the role.   The "The French Connection" is in some ways a little too on the nose, but the movie is definitely fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, I think it's great, but the music is very over the top and very irritating. It was so over the edge and I have heard it so many times and I really don't know why people can't just use the original music. I wish they had used something from the 1950s or something.   Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't see it as a horror movie, but more a movie about a group of individuals trying to deal with an illness.   The acting isn't the best, but I think the characters are well written.  It's not the most intense, but the people that are effected by the virus are believable.  The music is great, as well as the editing.  I hope it was just a short movie and we never get to see them in a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those who have watched the original Star Trek  , this is a great retelling of the story, featuring many of the original cast.  It's pretty much like a're-run' of the pilot, with the only real change being the introduction of the Klingons.   The movie doesn't really go deep into what happened between the original series and the movies, but instead shows the characters in their new roles in space.  The actors do their best to do their part, and you can tell that they love the series as much as we did, and want to bring it to the big screen as much they could.  My one concern is that it's a bit too 'grown up', and the action is a little too intense for my tastes.  But it's an interesting movie, and a good retelling, if only for the fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would not say this is a good film, and it definitely isn't as good as 'The French Connection'. It isn't too bad, but it certainly doesn't measure up to the great classics of the genre. But, I'd rather watch 'The Graduate' than 'French Connection', or 'The Godfather' if that's an option.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this before, but it's good fun, so I was glad I re-watched it in the cinema. I like the way they did it, and they made it look real. And it's funny, with all the characters having to go through the same situation. I was watching this while having a pint at a local bar and having a great time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film has so many aspects that are well done. It has a great atmosphere and the story makes the atmosphere much more intense. I loved how the action scenes were captured and how the scenes with the aliens were done. The creatures in the film are amazing and I loved seeing them on screen.   I also loved how this was a very personal film. The actors were all in character and their characters were developed perfectly.  The music in the movie is also wonderful and it adds to the atmosphere.  This is a film that you have to see if you are a fan of science fiction and aliens. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen "The Black Dahlia" at a film festival and it was amazing. There are so many different types of directors, actors and styles of film, and this film captured everything, from the first scene to the last. And the best part was that it was so fun to watch.   There were a lot of good performances in this film, but I liked the performances of Paul Nash, Richard Widmark and Robert Mitchum most. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this film quite a bit and really enjoyed it.  It is a great adaptation of a good book and it is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen.   The actors did a great job and the scenes are good.  The story and screenplay was amazing.  A really good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching "Rescue" I have been on a long searching for a good old fashioned "old fashioned" suspense thriller.  The only other movie I have seen with a plot like this one is "The Hunt for Red October", so this was an extra "wow" and made me think, "How can a movie be this good?"  A nice, good looking film with great acting.   The whole film is like a mini-pilot, to really take the story and action to a higher level.  While it would have been better if there were more action (and some of the acting, especially of the main guy, seems out of character) it all works well.  I really enjoyed it.  What this movie does really well, is have the story line be something you can see coming from a mile away, while it also takes the suspense from you with the plot twists and turns.  It takes you by surprise and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire way.  And the acting is superb... Â    I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this movie you will see some really great stuff!   This movie is really well done, and the actor does a fantastic job.   The movie is also fun to watch, and is a little bit of a goof on an old classic film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The best "A" movie I saw.   It has everything you would want to see in a movie; action, suspense, comedy and romance.  This is a great film.  I would highly recommend it to any "A"-movie fan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the "Superman Lives" movies. I wasn a big fan of Superman and all the DC heroes but the original "SuperMan Lives" was just a bit much for me.   But "SuperMen" turned out to be the film I've been looking for.  I love the movie and I really love the chemistry between Chris O'Donnell and Sean Connery.  The plot is pretty straightforward but it's not predictable.  There are some cool action sequences and some well written dialogue that I really enjoyed.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to fans of the original trilogy and the modern Superman movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was very, very good. I really liked the movie because the director did a good job in showing you some of the good points in the movie such as that it was very well done with a good story line and a good plot. I found that this movie was a good comedy. The film is very good and if you like funny movies, you'll enjoy this movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know how some people will give you a grade of A+ for something good?   This is a little different...   They tried to make the story of the film about the real life relationship between a guy and a girl but failed miserably.   I've never seen a movie in my life that shows how two people can fall so hard for one another, and it's also just a beautiful little movie.  Â  The romance is a bit forced at times but I really don't think that's a bad thing... I really loved watching this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Star Trek Into Darkness" is a really good movie. "Star Wars" is better in every way. The difference, though, is that the story in "Into Darkness" has more heart and doesn't seem like a retread of the prequels. "Intro Darkness" tells the story of James T. Kirk as he takes command of the Enterprise after Captain Christopher Pike's death. The story isn't too bad, but it isn't original either.   I also really liked the cast.  "Intra Darkness" features the best performance of Chris Pine yet. The acting isn't always great, but when it is, you feel it.  For example, at the end of the movie, we see him and Zoe Saldana in an office talking.  In the movie we see Saldanas character in a dress at a desk. In the film, it's her dress with makeup. She looks awesome in this movie, and I hope we see a lot more of her in the future. Â Leonard Nimoy is great as well. I loved how he was still himself.  I was so surprised when I learned that he was in "StarTrek" at the time. I was actually really impressed with the way he had turned down acting in the prequel movies. He didn't seem to have any regrets, which is unusual.  Another interesting character was Scott Bakula. He was a good addition to the movie and had some great scenes.  The music in the movie is wonderful.  It was a very emotional movie, but that's why it's not for everyone.  At first, I was thinking that it was too violent. After watching a few times, I realized that it's more suspenseful and more realistic.  If you can get past the violence, "Intreedom" is an entertaining action movie.  There is no shortage of great fights in this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best part about The Incredibles is the end. It has such an emotional payoff.   A great movie.  The action in this is great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My husband and I had just come from a large festival at the old theater in Westwood (in my younger days I had gone with some friends) and were looking forward to watching a classic, "The Wizard of Oz". My husband loved the old one better and was also disappointed that he did not enjoy the modern version as much. What I really enjoyed about the old film was that there was no dialogue. I have seen a lot of old silent films and have seen many more with a few words on the screen.   The film opened in New York on October 12, 1939 with the first scene and it opened on time (I think, I am not sure). It had a great cast and crew and the scenery was fantastic. It was the first time I knew of Dorothy's father (Lincoln Stein) and he really got to the root of Dorothy and her parents problems. The music and the scenes were amazing.  In the 1939 version they had added a lot to the story. In 1939 they had made the story a little more realistic by showing Dorothy's parents not being real and having their real family members (Mrs. Hughes and others) look at them from a distance.  I saw the film several times over the years and always found it to be very well made and quite wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You are watching a movie that has a lot of flaws, but they are all covered up by its beauty. It's a movie about how it's hard for a gay man to be accepted and have a life in America. In fact, they will never be accepted in America because most of them are so scared of how people will see them. The movie is full of so many gay stereotypes and so many homophobic comments. This is how the society sees us. And it's just not fair to be treated this way in this modern age.   It doesn't matter if you like this movie or not, just know that people are still being treated this badly and it's not right. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful, funny, and very endearing movie that is filled with comedy, fun and drama. The plot is complex and fascinating, and the characters are all very likeable and likable. I was just absolutely delighted at how well the actors portrayed these roles, and I had a great time watching this movie.   Watching this movie reminded me of watching an old fashioned silent movie. I think it's great that it was made a long time ago, and that it has not been changed too much since then.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film itself was great but a bit confusing. I had a bit of difficulty finding the various bits and pieces of the plot. However, there was still a great bit of mystery to it that I found entertaining. It certainly wasn't a straightforward film but that was the point. The performances were fantastic. There was just enough depth and humor to keep it from being an absolute slapstick disaster. I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants a bit more out of their science fiction adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "We are looking at a film that has the makings of a classic"   This is a great movie. I like the way it is being made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am an avid fan of sci-fi movies, and one of the first movies that came on TV when I was a kid was the original Star Trek: The Next Generation, which was an epic show. I have never seen a show as amazing as Star Trek before. When they brought it back, I wanted to watch it over and over again.   The movie is fantastic! It has the perfect balance of good story, characters, and action.  It's really hard to find good movies about space exploration, and this one certainly holds up well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the film 'The Lost City of Z' starring Tom Cruise. I loved his character, his chemistry with Nicole Kidman, the action, the set pieces, and everything. I found the original novel 'A Journey to the Heart of Asia' to be even better than the film and even thought that the movie was a little better. However, 'The Last King of Scotland' is even better and even more beautiful. Nicole Kideman is incredible as the title character, but she has to wear a lot of makeup and has a few scenes that are edited a little more than the others. I liked the ending of the movie where she leaves Scotland on her own and has the last of her family taken away from her. The movie was set in 17th century Scotland and was a romantic comedy with a good script. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidmen franchise, a wonderful story with great acting and beautiful music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen it a few times in the theater. It was the best acting I'd ever seen from a film of this nature. It didn't leave me wanting anything from it.   The story has a dark and tragic undertone. You get the feeling you're watching someone's life slip away. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie! The story is good and the characters are great. It's a good action film that doesn't have too much of a long drawn out fight scene. There is a lot of great fight scenes in this movie and the fights are a lot better in this film than the later movies, especially in the third and fourth films.   The only problem is that it's not in my top 10 movies, but it's still worth watching, and it's one of my favorite films of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was pretty disappointed with the first two movies that James Bond has done as 007.   The first two films were pretty bad and were really just to make Bond into a more famous actor.  These movies also did not explain the mystery of 007 as a character and how he has grown over the years.  He had no flaws in the first film and he seemed very unbalanced and was very easy to hate.  It was then after the fourth film when he really started to go downhill and I stopped liking the movies.  Now I am glad that the movies have finally been done and I will be a fan of the character going forward.  I thought this was a great movie and the actors did a great job.  This was a nice way for 007 to be seen in the films he had so many great moments in. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't really remember much from the film, but what I remember is that the character of the movie is interesting, and I'm glad I saw it at the right time of my life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was hoping for a good, straight to the point "how to" horror film. Well, this film is exactly that. A well-directed, well-acted, well shot and acted film that gives a real scare.   In the end, you will be surprised how many different ways this film can be scary.  It is one of the most realistic and unsettling films I've seen.  I loved the scene with the blood.  If you are looking for a quick and easy horror film, then this film will do the trick.  The effects are perfect and the actors do an amazing job.  Not sure if I will ever watch another film like this again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In terms of technical quality, there is nothing in this movie which is not quite "fine" (and we mean not bad or not "excellent" either). The animation is very good, but as usual with the Japanese animation, it's not always accurate to the characters, and sometimes the effects are not as good as we could wish. But we shouldn't worry too much about this.   The acting is very well done, especially by some of the "real" actors. It's not like they were playing a fantasy film.  There are many, many references to other films, including some of my favorite movies from the past. If you like a film with a good balance between the dramatic and the humorous, this might be your movie.

It is a good looking film that is very much enjoyable and I highly recommend this to those who want something that is not too intense.   This movie had my attention right from the start. It was a very well made movie. The acting was excellent.  If you are a big fan of action and a good story then this movie is perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was an entertaining movie, one that I look forward to watching again and again.  There is a lot of action here, but nothing overly flashy.  It's more of a slow paced movie, but with a lot going on.   The only real disappointment was the fact that no female leads were present, with the exception of the character played by Barbara Eden.  I wish that they would have gotten a female lead, because if they had then this would have been a movie that I would have enjoyed for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie had me hooked from the first scene. When you think about it, it is just a movie in which the three main characters fight the enemy. The scene where the kid shoots the sniper in the face and he dies. There is a little part where the kids are in the helicopter and it is raining. I'm not sure what it is. But this movie made my head spin.  I loved this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on a screening in a movie theater in New York. I remember that it had a lot of "action" in it but wasn't really a lot like the movie. This is a classic western with a lot more of a realistic feel to it. A lot of actors that played in this movie are still around and do a great job. I love how they all wear different clothes and act in a way that is authentic to the era. It is a great movie to watch on the big screen in a cinema with lots of people.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised that I liked this movie.  I really don't like many horror films and the ones that I do like are either really bad or really boring.   This one had a ton of gore but it didn't bother me too much.  There are a lot of scenes of suspense.  The director is good at making people scared but still able to maintain a normal human expression.  This is a good film for kids and I think it's worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really surprised to find this one on DVD, and even more surprised when I found it on VOD in less than an hour. I'm a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's work, and I can't say that I've ever seen one of his films that has really pulled me in so much. The story is wonderfully well told, and the music is just gorgeous to listen to. I don't think I've seen any other Kubrick film that has been this good or this memorable. It really is a remarkable work of art.   The acting is top-notch. It's like Kubrick was able to bring out the most raw, raw performance from each of his stars. It doesn't really matter who they are playing, so long as they're in a good scene. It has an eerie, eerie quality to it, and you can feel it as a viewer.  The special effects are wonderful, and it's worth seeing just for the beautiful special effects.  All in all, I give this one a 10/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My mother took me to see this film at the cinema a few years ago.  I must admit, I am not a huge fan of sci fi,  but I liked this film.  It was not a mind numbing mind numbler.  The film had some great actors and a great plot.  My main complaint was that there were not enough explosions. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge fan of all the Marvel movies.   Marvel's films were always amazing and still are today.  Even though they had a limited amount of movies, they always got right back on track with the quality and they still hold up to this day.  I thought Captain America was great, Iron Man was great as well and the other Avengers films were great aswell.  It was great to see all the characters get their moments to shine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that this is the only film that has made me cry, not once but twice, and I can't say that it's the first movie I've seen that made me weep like this. I am a great fan of film noir, and have loved the films of David Lean and Humphrey Bogart, and to see a film like this one, made in 1939, I knew that it was going to be a real gem, and one that I would keep in my collection. I wasn't too impressed at first with the acting, especially the performances of Robert Taylor and William Holden. It was all very generic, but it worked on the small screen. The dialogue was great, as was the cinematography and music, and the costumes and sets were also very good. It wasn't until I heard the score that I really fell in love with it. For a few short minutes, it reminded me of the great films of noir and detective movies, such as The Maltese Falcon, with a touch of Vertigo. It's a shame that it wasn't better received, as it would have been a true masterpiece. But that doesn't matter too much, as the film, along with all the other noir films of the time, was so good that it has stood the test of time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard a lot of reviews about this movie and it's quite an enjoyable one at that. It's an example of what I like to call, "The Best Of Two Worlds", where the two worlds are quite different and often seem to be at odds with one another. The movie starts off with an alien visitor, "Uri" showing up on Earth and being amazed by what humans have accomplished. This alien (or possibly a robot) then goes on to say to the humans, "These are the last of their kind, and as we grow up we will all want to go and live amongst our own kind." The humans respond by saying, "But that will be impossible," and then throw Uri into a spaceship (I don't recall how the whole "going to another planet and having people on it" idea was presented to the audience) to "travel to the other world." They also say that there is only one way to get there and that is through "The Portal" or something similar. When Uri first arrives in the portal he thinks he's in another world, but when he gets off he thinks that they're in fact on Earth. This is a nice change from the usual alien movie where they arrive on Earth, are amazed by the technology and then immediately want to kill every living being on the planet. The humans are very much in control of the alien visitors, with one of the human visitors even saying that he wishes there were more humans like him. The only time a human is actually shown to have some human traits is when he's a little boy, where he goes on a long walk and he finds a dog and lets it go, but eventually it goes after him.   The movie takes place on a space ship (the Prometheus) that has crashed on Earth because of an accident, but the humans have set up an emergency bunker. When the ship is first shown, it's at night, but after a while, a light appears on the ship and then it's revealed that the ship was still in operation at the time the humans were setting up the bunker. There are many scenes in the movie where the people in the bunker or on board the ship are seen, and they are quite impressive, and are often thought-provoking.  The first sequence in the film starts off really good, with the alien being introduced and the first few scenes. It seems like he's pretty intelligent, but then he gets angry and runs off to attack an

The acting is amazing and the music is awesome. It's so good you feel like you're in a movie.   Also the story and the characters are great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a big fan of horror movies, especially slasher movies. I just love seeing people being murdered in gruesome ways and I think that's where this movie really hits home for me.   My wife and I went out for dinner and then watched this film, we really enjoyed it.  My only concern was that the movie was starting to get a bit repetitive as the main character was killed over and over, but once it got under way, I was really enjoying the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My mother was obsessed with this film and bought the video copy from a rental shop when she was about 10 or so. She was very fond of this film, and she would go through my family's old VCR tapes and record scenes for us to watch. This film is very entertaining and shows that life can get quite interesting.   I highly recommend this film if you have children.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good comedy. It has all the ingredients: a great plot, witty dialog, and plenty of laughs. It may not be very subtle, but this is a great little movie. The jokes come on quick and are funny. The story is well done.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is pretty much the same as the one in the first. The main difference is that it seems to focus a bit more on the story and the characters and the events a bit less. The way the story is told makes it look like a detective story in a sort of high school.   It's not a bad movie at all, it has a good cast of characters and an interesting mystery. I recommend it for people who like spy movies, mystery or a really good detective story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is definitely not a 'family movie', but I do think that they have the right to depict a family with a small kid.   I believe that I've seen more than the last few of the films in the 'Twilight' franchise, and I enjoyed every one of them.  The film was a good 'pump and dump' from the movies 'Darling in the Franxx' (2012) and 'Grimm' (2014).   In the 'Frenzy' we see the effects of 'cocaine' on one woman and the effect it has on another.  This story gives us a glimpse into a couple of different lives.  In 'Freakshow', we see how society and religion has shaped the life of a prostitute. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was thrilled to see this movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought the cast did an excellent job. I liked the idea of a girl who's being taken into the woods to "take the edge off" before she becomes a widow. I think a widow should be allowed to go on about her life in peace until she's ready to die. The way they dealt with that in this movie was clever. I thought she should have some sort of a "sisterhood" type of friendship with some guys on the way to take her out. But she's pretty much alone on the trip, and when she gets to the camp it's just the men, and she's the only woman there. The movie didn't make me laugh, but it kept me intrigued.   In general, I liked it.

This is the type of movie that would give me nightmares.  There are some really sick fights.  They all look cool and the stunts look really good.  The movie is also very funny.  A few of the characters seem kinda stupid in some scenes but that is pretty much just a side effect of the movie.  I give this movie 5 stars for being a great movie.

The tension rises when it becomes clear that our hero is being pursued by the police. The detective is very confident and a good guy. I have a feeling that he has an ulterior motive for pursuing this person. It is not a great film but very good with a very enjoyable story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie because my sister and I saw it at a movie theater and we really enjoyed it and thought it was great, and my sister is not a fan of action movies but enjoyed the movie and we had a great time watching it together.    This was the best movie ever made of Star Wars.  This movie is so realistic and so well done, and I loved all the different actors that were in this movie.  I think the real star of the movie was the amazing John Knoll who is the voice of R2-D2 and he is such a great actor.  It was such an amazing movie to watch, and we all had a lot of fun watching this movie, and that is how you should have fun watching a movie like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did watch this movie when I was about 10, and even then I remember it being very boring and not entertaining. I have since watched it numerous times, and have learned that it is not just one of the lesser-known movies in the Harry Potter series, but also an entertaining film with many moments of levity.   A young wizard who uses his family as pawns in an elaborate prank is captured by the wizarding authorities. The wizard's aunt, uncle and cousin are arrested, but the young wizard escapes. The young wizard then decides to take the Ministry down, which he does in the most ridiculous and silly manner possible.  The film takes a few liberties with the source material.  I know it is based on books, but I think it is very well-done.  There are quite a few funny moments, but it is obvious that they are taking liberties with certain details.  This is a good one to see at a Halloween party, or anytime you need a little laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "One of the best films I have seen this year, and a real standout."  - Mark K. Smith  "The perfect blend of action, thriller and suspense."   - Matt K. Steeves  "I found myself wanting to see this movie again and again."  From the trailer, you might think this would be the "Eugene O'Neill" of the modern-day James Bond films.  Â He's the man in the hat, but not in the way you might expect.  His identity is that of a brilliant, dangerous, brilliant inventor, and he doesn't need a disguise to do his work, because he has the skills of an expert in disguise.  He doesn't play a secret agent; instead, he's the bad guy.  For a long time, it seemed that a film that focused on a man in a hat could never be a success; so I was surprised when the film was a huge hit, especially as an original concept.  The character is not exactly a hero or villain, but he seems like someone who would be a good foil to Bond.  While we are introduced to the man, we see him from the outside, and it isn't until the final moments of the movie that we really get a look at the man behind the hat. The character, with his ability to do just about anything that is necessary for the situation, is very good at his job.  Like many of the James Bond movies, the plot is very simple and, like the "Goldfinger" film, it doesn't really need a lot of explanation to follow.  I thought that this was the best installment of the series since "Live and Let Die."  The music and sound effects, as well as the action, was amazing.  It wasn't the most realistic of the "James Bond" films, but there is more of a science fiction theme in it.  If you like spy thrillers or just any James Bond film, I strongly recommend you check this one out.  A few other notes on this film:  The film was made in 1967, when most of the other James Bond's films were made.  This was also the first James Bond to show that he's an inventor as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is really a beautiful film that is well-made and entertaining.   It is a little hard to follow the story, but there is no need.  It does not disappoint and the performances by the actors are all excellent.  The cinematography is amazing.  I have seen many movies but this is a really good one that has a dark under-belly that is not apparent at first but really shows as the movie progresses.  There is no question that it is an art film.  A very good film with great acting, great locations and an unforgettable movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is very well made, and the acting is very believable, if you like to see some serious and powerful actors in a drama. It has a wonderful soundtrack, which is really good, as well. The characters are all very realistic, you have the average guy, the rich girl, a guy who can read minds, a man who just wants to get out of his boring job, a poor but friendly young girl who just got out of prison, a detective, a doctor, a thief, a girl who is only 17, a woman who just married, a pretty boy, and a woman that wants revenge. It is not just a story about revenge, but a story that is filled with people who are suffering in one way or another, and I think that the best acting that I have seen in a movie. It really shows how it is like to live in the big city, to try and survive in the bad parts of a place.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know much about the old horror movies when I first saw this, so the first time I saw it, I was scared out of my wits. The old black and white stills were beautiful and I was absolutely fascinated with the movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the gore, but the acting and the suspense was great. I was especially hooked on a scene with a guy dressed as a skeleton that stood on his head and tried to break out of his coffin.   Â    The ending was amazing. I don't know what the audience was expecting to happen, but by the end of the movie, I wasn' t even sure that the guy was dead. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movies are all comedies and I love it when they're funny! So the fact that it's set in the future is cool. I also love that it takes place in space. There are lots of really cool things going on in this movie that are not really apparent to the audience.   The acting was great. The special effects were great. There were really well-drawn characters. The music was very cool.  I really like the whole concept of having the future as a movie studio and having to work at a studio. It shows how little control society has over people in the middle of the 21st century. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have never been a big fan of "Hitchcock", but when the film was remade in the late 90s, I found it to be good. The director was still very prolific, making an incredible number of films. This film, by contrast, is very much a throwback, and the casting is superb. The original cast is all here, but this time the film does not suffer from any over-acting (well, it has some, but not nearly to the extent of "The Birds"). This film is one of the best "under the radar" thrillers out there, and a must see for anyone with an interest in film history and the great American actors who made it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really love this movie. If you have seen any of the movies you know this is one of those films you love to watch over and over again, especially with your boys and then the women.   In a world where the males are usually seen as the bad guys it is always interesting to see how the females act in such a bad situation.  It is almost like a comedy of manners, a real "manly" movie.  The cast really shines here, with Tom Cruise always one of the best in the business and it's nice to see him again, after the huge success of "Mission Impossible" (which I thought he was brilliant in)   For all the critics who don't like the movie for not going "back to the future" I think they missed the point, as the movie is not really about science, it's about a group of individuals who go on a special mission to stop the next great threat and they are not the good guys.  They are the baddest of the bad and they make the best out of a very bad situation,  I also love the "backyard" scenes with the boys and the women,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in a theater and the film's director was talking about a film he'd done in Poland.Â  I'd never seen anything like it, he said.Â  It was filmed in a tiny, secluded location, and there was no audience at all--only a few locals and an Englishman.Â  The actors weren't paid.Â  They were not hired actors but farm hands.Â  He had an actor on the farm shoot some animals, and then he had them play themselves, the animals, in front of a tiny screen--the same set with the same animals but a smaller screen.Â  Then he had a woman in a dress play herself.Â  And then it went over to a farm, where an English-speaking farmer, who was also shooting animals, played himself--only, he was talking into a phone--just for the heck of it.Â  One of the scenes is filmed backwards, so the camera will cut back and forth when the animal is killed.   In that small town, there were no theaters.Â  There were only a few little houses where the film was shown.Â  A guy who made these films had been living there a long time, but when he died he left all this stuff behind.  So a bunch of people set up a projection room, and on a little screen hung the film they'd shot.  The only way I can remember seeing the film at the time was by seeing it on a projection screen, at a farm in Poland, with actors playing themselves.Â  No, I don't think the film had any success at first.  But then word of mouth spread, and more and more people showed up, especially women and children.  By the time it was shown all over Europe, it was a big hit, and they started making it themselves, with the actors as extras.  This is actually the first known picture from the silent film " The Story of the Sow," an adaptation of a fairy tale by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.  When I was little I'd always heard about this film, but in my case, the word "silent" was always used to mean something that was not as exciting as something like "talkies."  The first time I saw the film, in 1968, it made a big impression on me, and I was immediately fascinated.  In the first scene the animals run around the farm and the humans are busy eating, just as they're

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this on television a while back and was so excited when the movie came out. I didn't know what to expect of it at all, but it turned out to be one of the most unique and entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. There was a time in my life when I wasn't into horror movies or anything "dark," so this movie got my attention because of its uniqueness.   There are a lot of films out there that are similar to this film, but they are all pretty lackluster and they lack some of the other aspects of the movie.  I think the reason why this movie is so great is because it's so unique. I'm not usually one to watch a movie, especially one that was made 30 or 40 years ago. But this film is so good that I didn in love it the minute I saw it.  It's dark, violent, and has some genuinely good writing that never gets old.  Even the acting is great, not too many actors can pull off the evil clown like performances that Peter Cushing does here.  All in all, this is a film that deserves more recognition than it is currently getting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie in its original version at the cinema (the original version is the one I saw in the theater as well, and I am glad it is.)  The original version had a much different feel, as I remember. It is really a different film, with a great cast.  It feels like it has a real dark side to it, that goes against the very popular films in the movie, and that is very cool.   The story is a little silly at times, but really dark, and the acting is great.  And I really like the movie overall.  This movie was a cult hit, and was in my top 10 of all time.  I remember when I saw it, my mom said it was good.

There are moments in this movie that would have made me cry if it weren't for the fact that it was so serious.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror and want to see some great special effects. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A friend of mine and I had seen the film twice (at different theaters) and we were just talking about it a little before she went to bed. I know you'll have to pay to see this, but I thought I'd share some of the things we did learn: 1. The "spider" that is crawling on the wall is the same kind of spider that is found on trees in the Florida swamps. 2. A big spider that appears to have been sitting in a tree near the start of the film was actually the "Tarantula", which has long legs and a long neck that is capable of catching insects. 3. There is a scene early in the film with an old woman talking about how she killed her three daughters so that she could take care of the family's livestock. 4. The scene where the police officer shoots at the giant spider in the woods in order to kill it was actually very realistic. (The man shoots at it and a little while later the huge spider goes out of frame and back in again). 5. In the very beginning of the movie, a large spider is seen flying around in the background. When the cameraman takes a picture of it, it quickly gets away. (This would be a great scene for a short film to film). 6. The spider that comes up from the dead leaves and then drops off the back of a car as it is passing by is the "Golden Retriever" (a real dog). 7. The guy in the black suit at the end of the beginning of this movie is the real "Patton". I learned more about this movie than I ever wanted to know.   What a movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Rip Tide" was the first film I ever saw by Robert Rodriguez. I have never seen anything quite like it and I still haven't. I am really glad I saw this movie. It has great acting, great sound and has the ability to make you laugh out loud and cry when the right lines come up. I don't think you could find a better director than Robert Rodriguez to make a good action film.    For a few years now I have seen the same "Rumpelstiltskin" film. The only difference was that I found his work to be a little better. This "Rippin' Tides" is not bad but it certainly isn't very good either.  I still have my original release of this movie but I still get a kick out of seeing the film on the big screen. I wish Rodriguez would do more than one of these films. I can see the possibilities but I just love Rodriguez for his work.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Nick C. from Beautiful film, great director I never saw a movie as beautiful as this. The set design, the costumes, the performances, the sets, the makeup, the stunts and the story. If I had my choice, I would go back and watch it over and over again. The acting was top notch and there was no one in the movie I didn't like. The camera work was phenomenal, especially when they did the close up shots. This film has to be seen to be believed. If you love action films and you love Robert Rodriguez, this is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story:  The movie starts off with a prologue where the main character and his sister (an actress named Christine) are in a movie theater. In the back of the theater they meet and fall in love with a couple and decide to move to California where they both work as a waitress at a coffee house. The movie follows the couple as they get involved in a love triangle and eventually decide to commit suicide. This movie is a lot of fun. There are some parts of the movie that are not too great, but there is something that keeps you watching. The best parts of this movie are in the beginning. Christine has a great personality, and I can't help but smile when she tells the story about her love triangle. This is a very realistic movie and the acting is great. The only complaint I have is with the ending. After seeing the ending, I have to believe the character's lives would be better if they never committed suicide. But maybe it is just me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very good movie. The action is terrific and the characters are great.   The director and scriptwriters really know their stuff, so it does not get too complicated.  I loved it, and have re-watched it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never got into horror, but this film left me impressed.  It was a chilling and realistic horror, with some very tense moments.  I would go so far as to say it was the best film I saw this year!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a pretty good movie. It is a good action movie and also has a great story. It's a great mix of action, adventure, and suspense.  The film was really good and I found myself really liking it.    It had a strong cast and cast a pretty strong film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion, this is one of the greatest comedies ever made, and is one that every comedian should see, especially if you are a standup.   The movie is full of hilarious bits. I loved the parts where the characters talk about how "the Jews" are running the world, and how they just won't give up, and that their plan is to take over the world.  I loved how much humor the movie had.  There was a little bit of violence in the movie, but it is never really shown.  The only real violence was when they threw the bottle at the guy who was on the train car and hit him.  When the guy threw the bottles, it was not the real people who got hit, it is only the actors that were supposed to be hit by them.  This movie would be even funnier if the violence wasn't real.  In this movie, you never knew who was going to get hurt, or who the real targets were, it just seemed like everyone got in the way.  It is a very funny movie and I highly recommend it, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you were to choose between watching this movie or getting the rest of the "Star Wars" series, you should do the latter.   I have seen and enjoyed all the other Star Wars films.  I felt that this one, while interesting, was a bit of an over-indulgence for me, and not enough of a sequel to really justify its price.  After this movie, I would love to see a new generation of young fans learn about the characters and the events from this movie so that they can truly appreciate the "epic" nature of this franchise.  "It is a time for revenge."   There were so many things wrong with this movie.  The acting, in my opinion, was all over the place.  In one scene, you had a young boy who knew that his father was a traitor and went to find him and take him out. He was then captured and tortured for information.  Another time, a young girl is being held captive and the two guys in the movie tried to convince her to talk, but she refused. She was then tortured, but not in any interesting ways. Â  The plot and the action scenes were so bad that I felt like it was going to ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Â  I felt as if the actors and the directing were not very well known, so their performances just seemed rushed and uninspired.  It wasn't until the last 20 minutes, which were mostly set in the middle of the galaxy, that the story began to develop into something really cool, but it was all in the past tense.  There is something missing in the story from all the movies.  When I first saw the trailers for "Return of the Jedi", I was amazed to find the characters that were in it.  Even though Luke was just a kid, I felt he had grown up with the events of the last movie and the rest were able to play off of him.  We also got a great performance from Yoda and they had such a great relationship together.  But, at the end of the day, the acting was just bad and the movie just felt like a rushed rush.  Overall, if you like "Return" or "Revenge of the Sith", then you should watch this.  However, if not, do not waste your time and try to forget about this film as soon as possible. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The "Jurassic Park" movies had to be great, right?   There is something great about those movies.  They show that even the best movies can go wrong sometimes, but that there is still some goodness to it.  The films are fun and the characters are well developed.   "Jaws" was so good.  If you can get this movie, just watch it and you will have a great time.  "The Lost World" is a great sequel to the original and is even better than the original.  A great movie for the fans of Jurassic Park or just good fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm so happy that I finally got a chance to see this film! I thought the cast were amazing and I didn't want it to end! I highly recommend it and I loved it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a couple movies from The Crow, but this was the best so far. It was the first time I really saw them together, so it was quite strange. I do like the idea of a Crow being "hung", but they could have made him a bit younger, maybe even a young kid or a teen, and had him actually being "caught" doing it. I think it works, and it was good, but it could have been done better. Overall, a good film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this movie I thought it was a little on the "nervous" side, but as soon as it went in I was blown away. I was pretty impressed that he managed to make a movie that had no dialogue, in the manner of a silent film. He really has a knack for making movies that are a little off, but he also has a great sense of humor that just oozes out of him. The acting is great as well, and all the characters are very well portrayed.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - Excellent movie 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best way I can describe this movie is 'Gone With the Wind' meets 'The Princess Bride' - in fact, the movie's very title is literally the title of the book on which the movie is based, 'The Prince and the Pauper.' I was surprised to find out that the book wasn't made into a movie until almost twenty years later!   I love this movie - it's the best thing since sliced bread. I think it has a lot of the best things that make a good film, the right amount of humor (especially for the time), and a great cast.   Director Charles Laughton (The Wizard of Oz) was a young man when he wrote the story, and his script for this film was almost identical to his script of The Wizard of OZ. However, he did change a few things about the plot that made it a little more original and interesting. He also changed a few names and locations - most of which didn't make it into the final film.  It was so good that Laughton actually ended up having to re-write some of the dialogue of the film to keep it from being too ridiculous - it was so funny, and it was such a great, emotional movie.  One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â This movie is really really good, I am glad that it will make me to watch some movies from my childhood.   The acting are really really great, and the plot is also really really interesting and amazing.  I would suggest this movie to anyone, and I recommend it to all of my friends! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As an adult, I am thrilled that this movie was made. It had my respect, it had my love. I had not seen any movies in a long time when I first saw this and I was blown away! The cast is terrific and the director has a unique vision for it. I do have to say that when the movie ended I was a little disappointed in the ending and not because of anything else that happened in the movie. I felt like it was a waste of an awesome movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just watched this movie because it was a favorite of mine back in high school.  The story was good.  It just had a twist I didn't think was needed.  My only complaint is the ending.  I would have liked to have been told who the real mastermind was before the whole thing was over.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great comedy that really hit the spot.   This is a great movie, it was very funny and was funny on a lot of levels, you will enjoy it if you have the right taste.   I do wish that the film was a bit longer than it was, but there is a lot going on.  I have a hard time not loving this movie.  It is very interesting and the actors really did their part to make this fun and entertaining.  There is not much going on in the film, but it does have some action and humor to keep you engaged.  The only down side to this film is that it was shot in black and white and it is so easy to watch this in black & white and see how much fun it is.  You will definitely enjoy the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just wanted to watch this movie for the first time. I never thought that I'll ever see such a beautiful film. A beautiful, kind, funny and sexy film. My only problem was that it was just too long. You might think that it would have been better to cut it down. I don't know if I'll watch another film like that but I will watch it again. The music is very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love that it had such a low budget (which I didn't expect at all) and that the actors looked like they actually had fun and really enjoyed working on the movie. It's the most fun I've had in awhile and I hope you guys have a lot of fun with it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. This movie is a masterpiece and if you haven't seen it then do so right away. I wish there was a 2nd and 3rd or 4th. I've been wanting to see this movie for over 5 years. The special effects in this movie are amazing and the characters are just hilarious. The voice acting and performance by Jim Carrey is so great. He does it all. He is so funny, sexy, charming, and sad all at the same time. It is so very believable.   The plot of the movie is very simple. We get an old man who is really close with his grandson. They have a special relationship and all the time the grandson is away he can't stand his father. The old man starts to abuse the grandson, and it goes downhill from there. I think this movie is about every father and son and how they are forced to grow apart because of things that are taken away from them and you see their life from their child's perspective. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie that is not great.  I liked it a lot but there were a few things that bugged me.  A couple of things bothered me. For one, a lot of people who watch the movie never get to see the ending of the movie. A lot of viewers never see the end of the film.  They could've been in the theater during the beginning, middle or end.  This movie has been out for a while, and we still don't know why it is taking so long to come out.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a real piece of work. The cinematography is superb and the direction is brilliant. The acting is so great. If you like this movie then you definitely must see it again.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that this is a very interesting movie. Not too long and not too short. It takes place in a very different time and place and the plot does go off the tracks but at the same time makes for a good film. The acting is excellent. The film is worth watching. I don't have many movies in my collection that are worth watching in a theater.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love The Terminator movies. They are just fun. I don't know if it was the acting, the set, or the acting alone. I didn't expect this to be good but I am happy that it was.    The main actor and director have always been amazing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie. It was my first, and it has a good story. The film was enjoyable as well, as it took place in a small town, where a few of the people had a lot of problems (a girl and her brother who run away from their mother, their neighbors who aren't very nice, and a man who has gone insane because of his wife). If I ever see this movie again, I will have to make sure I find a good quality print, otherwise, I'd have to buy the dvd. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a good one. I had never seen this before, but I found it to be a pleasant, easy to understand story. I would not call it a classic (I would not even call it "good"). The story involves a man, who can see the future, who has problems with an evil doctor and his daughter. The doctor wants to sell her on the idea that he can cure her of her vision problem. The only problem is, the doctor is trying to kill his daughter by drugging her, so that she can only see her husband die at a party, not herself. The film was written in 1956, but did not hit the big screens until 1972, when a small film distributor, bought it at the local flea market for $6.00. It was a big hit in those days, with many people seeing the movie for the first time. There are a couple of parts that are hard to watch, but it's a good film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am not a great fan of horror films. This is a solid thriller that kept my attention, especially with the great acting of David Carradine and the good cinematography. I will definitely be checking out the sequel, "Fade Out".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie at the B.O.B. theater (bobcat) after I watched it at an open mike in the back of the house on the west end of town. It was a beautiful day. The show was beautiful, too. I just wish there was more footage of the show, but at the very least it was a great time.   The actors were great, but I don't think I was that crazy about the movie.  My wife and I saw it in our car on our way to the beach. It took a while to get the whole thing through, but we both enjoyed it and laughed our asses off.  A great night on the town, too, at the beach (by far my favorite beach in Florida).
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie if you like sci-fi. I liked it a lot. If you want to watch a good thriller with a great plot, watch "Dune". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A terrific, funny and thrilling western. There's a certain appeal to this kind of movie that's not present in the typical action movies. I didn't find it particularly exciting, though there were a few surprises, but the characters all seem real and likable. There were several times I'd stop in the middle of a scene and go "Gee, I wonder what he's thinking?" He's obviously a real character, and a good one at that.   "The Wild Wild West," like all westerns, had its share of screwball comedy, but "The Outlaws of the Marsh" really captures the spirit and style of the old West. There are a lot of colorful, lovable and eccentric characters, and the story is so fun to watch that you really can't put it down.  "If you've ever wanted to see westerns that make you feel as though you've stepped back in time, you've found them here"   "The Outlaw" was a movie for the ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw this movie, it was on my Netflix queue and I knew I had to see it. I had seen some of the best films in the last 10 years, and this was the only one I didn't really enjoy. However, I would give it a pass, especially if you just want something silly. The movie was a spoof on the 1960s TV series of the same name and the story line was so silly that it made it worth watching. I found the actors all quite good and the plot was funny. The music was not great but it was well done. I wish it had been longer but for a one time show, it did a good job at getting me interested.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is an excellent comedy and the only film I've seen about a girl who gets kidnapped by a family of serial killers. The family, of course, is the ones who kidnapped her and she ends up running around with them for several days. It's a fun movie with some great performances. The plot is not all that complex but the performances are very good.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In spite of its age, this movie has many good scenes and ideas that I enjoyed. The character development is strong, and the characters are fun to watch.   The cinematography is a bit better than the music; this movie is full of beautiful shots. The only fault I find with the movie is that it is overlong at about two hours, with little or no humor to keep it from getting tedious. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie. I liked the actors and their acting, and the story was interesting. It took place at a college, which was not really my cup of tea, but I did enjoy it. The movie was not bad either.   This is a classic movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After seeing this movie I had to see it twice more. The movie is absolutely fantastic, it is a fast paced action movie. There is no slow down and it is fast paced with some great action. The one problem I have with this movie is it's ending. I loved the beginning and middle of the movie, but after the first time I didn't care to see the ending again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had watched the film "The Last Days of Pompeii" and was really intrigued by it. It seemed to be a kind of spiritual sequel to "Pompeii."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After watching the "original" version of this film in theaters, I found it to be a very enjoyable action film and a lot of fun. It is a little dated in a lot ways and it shows. The special effects are pretty dated, but the film is still very entertaining to watch.   When you watch this film, you have to look closely to see the special effects. They are not pretty but they still make a good action film. I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it and enjoy watching this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think I've seen such a good, funny, well-acted movie with such an awesome soundtrack that is more like an art film than a horror movie.   A bit of a different take on what horror films are supposed to be and very enjoyable  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this movie twice now, and I have never had a better, more suspenseful performance. There are so many different layers and secrets and things to look at that the film really is hard to look away from.   This is a good thriller that makes you wonder who or what is pulling the strings, and who really is at the top. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are an old hand at the B movies, you'll have to find something new to enjoy in this one. It is certainly entertaining enough as a B movie. The story doesn't hold much interest, although there are moments when the dialogue comes close to the real deal. The actors are good enough for a B film and the story doesn;t get any more intriguing than that. But what you should do is not pay for this B movie on a credit card. It's not worth it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My parents had seen The Muppet Movie when they were kids. At first I thought they were nuts, but they were so impressed and entertained by it that I wanted to see it. When they had gotten me up to the movie I knew I would be watching this movie every year for the rest of my life. This is the best Muppet movie that I've ever seen. The writing is so well done. All of the characters are memorable. It's not a puppet movie, and it's not "just a movie". It's a Muppet film that captures what makes Muppets so great.   It is fun to watch the characters interact and to see the creative writing, especially by Jim Henson. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â  I had never heard of "Crazy" before reading this movie. It really surprised me. I always thought that this "crazy woman" was just a stereotype. Well, this movie is a true story, but in a more realistic way. This film has no soundtracks and the main story is told from different people's perspectives. It doesn't feel rushed and the scenes are well paced. The film is also filled with many interesting and humorous moments.   And now, on to the main topic of this movie; who was the crazy woman that started it all? Well, no one actually knows who the crazy lady was, but she had a great impact on the people around her.  This movie also has two great performances. Both of them are great actors. The great part is that they both get the best of each other.  There were many people that did not know this story at the time, but now know and love it. It is a must watch film and I highly recommend you watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In fact, a great movie.   I like this movie more than the sequel which was far more over the top.  The movie was pretty much on point.  It was also enjoyable to watch the actors on the set having a laugh.  Also, I was surprised to see it wasn't made for kids but for a mature audience.  There were some scenes that were very dark but the scenes that needed a little humor to lighten things up.  A real fun watch and great for the whole family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very enjoyable movie, it is one of the first time I saw a movie that could have been a film for a teen.   The story takes place in the 1940's where a girl (Jessica Lange) is called to join the Army.  She goes to the base where the army is recruiting and meets a guy (Tim Roth) who is a soldier.  Once they begin talking they start doing a lot of things that they don't intend to do.  The acting is amazing and the actors have a very nice chemistry.  Very romantic and fun.  It was worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The two star reviews on this website make me wonder if you really want to see this movie. The quality is good and the acting is great. But I will be very careful about seeing it. It has many plot holes that should have been cleared up in the movie. It's really sad that the two stars can't take the blame for not getting the movie right. They can't understand why the audience wouldn't get the point of the movie (and why the two star reviewer can't see that). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie with a good story and good acting.   The movie is set in the 30s and tells the story of a black man who has just been freed from a prison where he was kept for an un-fathomable amount of time.  He goes to a circus where he meets a white woman who has a young daughter and has the baby removed from her care.  The next day he goes to an inn where the baby's parents have taken him and they plan on selling him for a small fortune.  This is a very good movie.  It has the feel of old movies like "The Manchurian Candidate" but it also has a nice little story which makes you feel as if you are in the middle of it.  I highly recommend this movie.

The acting was excellent and the plot was funny, even if the humor wasn't too original, and the characters were all believable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting more out of this movie, but it did what it was trying to do and did it well. The plot was good and the characters were interesting.   A couple of the movies I had seen were so long and they were filled with too many characters and the plot just felt so slow and drawn out.  This movie didn't have those issues and everything kept moving forward with the characters.  It is one of the better movies that I have seen recently.  I liked the cast of actors and their chemistry worked well.  The cast was so funny and I really didn't mind the long scenes.  If you like action, a really good time, and good action movies, this is one movie that will please you.

I will tell you I was disappointed that it did try to fit into the "JAW" genre, however, it did the job and was a wonderful movie for all ages.    - April 5, 2012It was just an awesome movie  Reviewer: mrlg90210 - favorite favorite favorite - March 30, 2012  Subject: I'd rather be under water I was going to give this movie five stars but it just fell short. I think the movie would have been better if they had used the real life footage of the underwater attack on the submarine. That said, the movie is still enjoyable because it does not take itself too seriously. This movie is pretty good and I recommend watching it. - March, 30, 20124I'd rather ariasate under water  Reply to this review:  People: I have read of people taking the film in a negative way. It is a story of two men on a secret mission to capture a submarine. The movie tells the tale of this secret mission. We get a good idea of why these two men want to take on this mission.   I agree with the reviewer below about the story being farfetched.  ....  ...... - March 25, 2012I would rather be underwater  by TheManInBlue

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First time seeing this movie I had some preconceived notions about this movie. I had always heard of it from other reviews and had always thought of it as a sci-fi movie so my expectations were pretty high. I wasn't disappointed. I thought it was a great flick. It was good fun, great acting, cool futuristic designs, great writing, a good soundtrack and a great acting cast. I would have to say the best thing about this film was the writing. It's really well done and was very clever in trying to mix together sci-Fi, sci-mystery, and romance. I don't think I ever laughed as hard as I did watching this movie and really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I can't say I didn't expect much from this film.   One of the reasons why the film is not good, is that the screenplay for the movie by Ron Howard and Tony Gilroy is extremely cheesy.  Ron Howard, who is one of the better screenwriters in the business, is given some of the best lines by the lead actor in the film, Mark Wahlberg (although he does a better job than Wahlburg with the two characters from the original).  The story was supposed to be more action-packed, but what we got was just as cheesy and lame as the original film. The new twist on the story is just as bad, but at least the characters are still there, and it is just a fun ride.  At times it was just fun to see Mark Waugh (as Mark Spitz) try to keep up with the new guy (as Frank "The Butcher" Spano) who was much quicker.  The only thing this film does well, is it keeps you guessing as to what will happen next. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was great.   This movie takes place at the time of the war and the movie is a good depiction of what the soldiers go through, the way the people in the war were treating them, and how they were treated back.  It is not a very good movie, but it is a great representation of the Vietnam war and is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this movie I get to see what the great John Wayne was all about.   Wayne was not the star, but he played a great part in this movie.  Wayne is a real movie buff and knows what is good and what is bad and he used his experience from the screen to make this one of the best movies that he ever did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie does not need a rating to say it is a good comedy. It is very well acted and well written.   I watched it on DVD recently so the story line, characters, and locations are not as fresh as they could have been. But the movie still works great as a comedy.  I really enjoyed the movie, although the plot isn't as fresh and original as it could have, the jokes, characters and the dialogue make it worth watching.  The cast is very good and the actors have perfect timing.  What makes the movie great is the acting. If you are looking for a good laugh or if you are not sure what the movie is all about, you will not be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was my first time watching a movie, so I was kind of scared going in. The movie does get a bit out of control at points and there were a few scenes where I was wondering if the director was having a hard time directing.Â  But the ending made me feel so happy!   There are so many different emotions on display here.Â  The emotions that really struck me the most were:Â  1) happiness 2) sadness 3) rage 4) joy (I'm glad I was able to see the movie when I did) Â  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great comedy that's not a horror movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When it comes to this movie, you get what you pay for. If you want a fun, action packed movie that's full of surprises, this is it. There is just something about seeing a group of kids on a bicycle doing a stunt in a park that will put a smile on your face. This movie isn't for everyone. The music can be a little cheesy and the editing can be horrible. But when it's done right, this movie is a blast to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie that's great, and the only thing that could make it better would be if it had a little more action. But, like I mentioned before, it's a fun movie to watch, and it gets you into the good old 80's, without making you feel as though it was too long ago. It may be hard to get into, but if you give it a shot, you will be glad you did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've never seen a film quite like this one. In a world where movies like the ones we're used to nowadays are getting repetitive with the plot and acting, here's an original story with just enough suspense to keep you in suspense as the camera focuses on what is happening. If you're into good suspense, then watch this one!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film starts with a short intro that introduces us to our protagonists (in this case, "Kraven", played by the awesome Tim Roth) and his partner, "Red", played with such great gusto by Samuel L. Jackson. We are quickly introduced to the story as the two work together in a city called Gotham, where a criminal named Bane has set up a "justice system" for the "super criminals" that live there. The two must work together and work in concert to bring down Bane and his group. Unfortunately, they have to deal with the criminal underworld in Gotham, including the Joker, who has a bounty on their heads. The movie has many great action sequences, and the fight scenes with Bane were well directed. This film has some great villains and great action scenes.   One of the best scenes is a great scene in which a helicopter, flying in the city, is caught by the flying car of Bane, and we see the helicopter explode in mid-air, with the engine spinning out of control and the propeller striking the side of the car.  It is very much like a real car explosion, only it is a helicopter and the explosion goes off from the top of the helicopter.  The other good action scenes are the scenes in which Bane is chasing down the two heroes in a car, and when he crashes it into the Joker's car, he hits the windshield with a bat-blade and kills the Joker instantly. This is just great, since the car and bat are both very well designed, and look like they are from an actual Bat-vehicle.  When it comes to the villains, there are quite a few. There is a very cool one (voiced by Ray Park) who is a professional thug and master of disguise, and he is very well-executed. There are two others that are really good (the French accent of David Carradine is great, and his villainous performance is top notch. The only real bad guy is a henchman for Bane (Kevin Conroy) who appears very infrequently, and only appears when Bane is trying to get a certain character killed. This character has the most despicable, despicable character type, and this was played with a lack of subtlety, but this is only because Carradina did not need to be that mean. The third villain is even worse, but I am not sure if this was intentional, or if it was a matter of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never seen this movie before. I didn't expect it to be that great of a movie. Well here it is. I watched it on DVD, I don't remember what it was called, it was probably The Great Train Robbery. It's about an Englishman in the late 1800's who is kidnapped and is forced to go to America. It was very exciting. I really enjoyed it. I think the music is excellent and the story was interesting.

However, the movie made me want to go out and see the movies I had missed. The movie is very funny. The action scenes were great. The music was really good. I enjoyed watching the guys in black and white. There was no plot, but the acting was excellent. The only problem was that the movie did not make me want a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a certain magic about a classic American western that we've all seen hundreds of times, the way the actors bring such warmth to their performances, and the fact that a script so clearly has been written by someone who loved the genre, that it can create such an emotional, memorable experience.   The film is a modern classic, a true Western from the heart of Hollywood.  The cast is great, and I was actually surprised to see how much of a contrast in ages the actors are. I really loved the two actors, Bill Paxton and Morgan Freeman, but I found Bill Paxtons performance to be a little older, but somehow still effective.  I'm glad I saw it when I did, it was a real treat, the perfect western to spend a day with, and something I'll watch over and over and always be reminded of. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was very impressed with this movie as it is such an excellent example of a story that has a story behind it.   This was my first time seeing a story about people who were once on the top of the world. They had no problems climbing up the ladder, it wasn't until they were in the top ranks of society that they ran into problems.  This movie was made by a master of his craft, and as an aspiring writer I can see why he did so well at this.  My only complaint is that the last third of the movie was very dull and had a lot of slow, meandering dialogue that made me tired of the story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen The Lost World several times now, and every time I watch it I am struck by how beautifully acted this film is. I have seen the original two films in the series, which was fine, but they were more about action and excitement, while this film takes the time to develop the characters and develop their relationships. It is beautiful to watch the film unfold in front of your eyes, as the action is so great and the acting so good.   A must see.

I think there was an editing error or something, but we both agreed the film has the potential to be good and I wouldn't turn it down. The acting is really good. The action scenes are really good and the ending was a real head scratcher.   There is a reason we have not seen more of this film yet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film when I was in school, and I can safely say that it has a lot of good things about it.  It was a good showing of a very interesting and well-written film.  A few characters were extremely well-drawn. Â It was also a good example of how the films that are made today seem to be more like a television series than a feature film. The best thing about the film was the acting.   All the actors were good, and the plot made good use of them.  While it was a little slow for my taste, I have to admit that it was pretty entertaining, and you should definitely give it a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a little different than some of the other movies we've watched, because it takes on a story that wasn't too popular in Hollywood at the time. The story is about a woman named Alice Parker, who, after being raped by a man named Mr. P, is left pregnant. She is forced to give up her house and car to the man's family, and she becomes his mistress.   I found this movie enjoyable. It has the same kind of atmosphere as a good film set in the late 1800s might have had.  I think the story, although not really original, was interesting and a great example of a story with a dark underbelly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful, sad movie. What a great way to close out the season.Â  This is what happens to these people.Â  There's a group of people on their way to Mexico.Â  These people are all in a car that is headed out of town.Â  The police, they don't believe the story, don't give a s*** about it.Â  But these people go, there's a police officer driving behind the car, he comes out of his car, and he says,Â  "Do you have the papers?"  Â And these people say,Â  "We don't have them."Â  The officer says, "I'm going to have to run a check."   I really liked this movie.Â  It was very honest.   My favorite was the part where they went to the border, the car gets stopped by the police.Â  We see the policeman checking a driver's license, and there's no money on it.  Then the man says to the policeman,Â   "I just went across the border on my way to see my girlfriend.Â  She lives in Mexico and I just wanted to see her and my mother.Â  I came back in the car and they took my money." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    1 out of 5   A well-made movie that I had no interest in, or had read about, but just happened to stumble across at the library.   I know, I should've paid more attention. But if you want a good action movie that's not too violent for your blood pressure, then this is a good one. The lead actor is a very good action star and it's a shame that he got so into his role and was too obvious.  I hope that the studios give the actor another chance, because he's still got that kind of personality and it works great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it does have some problems. The main problem is the bad acting, the only reason why I gave it a four star is because of this. One of the best acting roles in the movie is the one played by Gary Oldman who is absolutely brilliant in this movie. The other two main stars are very bad, but the acting is still very good and makes the movie worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is worth seeing!   The story is fun and very well written.   What is missing is the ability to film on a real set (they had it on a film in the 1980's), but the movie looks great!  I found myself thinking of that wonderful movie "Beverly Hills Cop" when the action scenes were going on!  The effects work is very good, and the special effects were quite good as well.  For the first time in many years, I found the time to watch a film on TV (the film was on tv in the early 80's) and was reminded of the great movie "Fantasy Island"!   I have a copy of the original movie on video (I used to have it in VHS) so I really enjoyed it.  The action was as good as the original (I can't think of a better one!)   If you like movies like this, this is a great film.  A MUST SEE! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know how you get a film with a good screenplay that doesn't really get made for some reason, or a good director that's just too old to direct something, or something in between? Well, I love all of them. And this movie is a really great example. It's a good story, and an interesting take on the subject, and a really good acting job. It would have been an even better movie if they had just gone ahead and made it as a feature and done the other things they wanted to do. There's some really good stuff in it, and I'm pretty sure that's what all the fans are hoping for.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised at the great performance given by the movie's main actress, Kate Beckinsale. The movie, called "The Impossible," is a psychological thriller, and it really took me by surprise how much Kate had to say. Her character is a psychologist, but she's an excellent actress, too. I've seen her on TV on TV, but I never got the impression that she had any acting training. She didn't come off as fake, but it wasn't exactly convincing, either. In fact, the movie seems to be more about the real thing than the psychological. The whole movie was beautifully shot, with great lighting and great angles, and Kate was great in every scene. She just had a great delivery, and I loved her performances throughout the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been looking for an original SciFi movie to watch for years, and this is it.   The crew, especially Paul Bales, did a great job in taking this movie and making it their own.  As for the plot, it is still in the "out of this world" category of sci fi films.  And this movie really shines the humor out of a movie where most of the action is on the exterior.  The story itself is interesting and makes for some great sci fi entertainment, and it even manages to be a bit more mature than some of the more recent sci fi movies.  This is a great Sci Fi movie for the whole family, and as a sci fi fan, I highly recommend this movie.  I think it would be a great movie to add to your DVD collection as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it to everyone.   The movie takes place in an urban setting, and shows the horror of what can happen to someone without an education.  It shows the violence that can happen without having been involved in a serious crime, or even knowing what is going on.  There are a few scenes of graphic violence, but the violence is never shown and nothing really happens, the violence was just the shock factor.  Â  It is also interesting to see how someone can go from a good student to a criminal without knowing it, especially in an area where you would expect such a thing to be more common.

It shows that while it is impossible to stop time with this technology, you can stop it from progressing so that there are less accidents.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the best comedy movie I have ever seen. The main idea is really nice, and the actors were all great. However, the way they went about getting a movie made was a little... unprofessional. The guy who ran the studio told the directors to get rid of the lead actor, then told the actors they didn't need to do anything to get the job. All the actors and the director looked very confused.   As far as I am concerned, if you are a fan of old school silent films and comedy films, I would suggest this movie to you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this movie is pretty good.   The movie is made with love and great care.  Â  It is about the life of an old man (Roddy McDowall) who has had to put up with a lot of insults from people in town.  He has a son (Burt Lancaster) who is also very sick and needs help.  They go to a place in town where a doctor (Peter Boyle) gives them a potion which makes them very strong.  The father goes out and gets into a fight and it is mentioned that he was shot in the leg.  There is talk in town that the doctor is doing this so he can make more money.  When the father leaves, he takes the potion to his house and keeps it there.  His son then comes back and tells him that he is sick.  Then he tells him he must get rid of his medicine or he will die.  While going to take the potion, the son is shot and killed.  After the fight, the father gets the old woman (Marlon Brando) to take care of the son and tells her where the medicine is.  But the mother is afraid of her and runs away.  In the meantime, there is a man (Peter Finch) who does not like the medicine.  So he goes after the medicine and has a fight with the old man.  Finch gets a knife and goes after his father who is trying to put his medicine down on the ground.  It is mentioned in the film that the old men are always drinking from a pipe that never gets empty.  I liked how the old people always drink a lot in this movie and have a pretty good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this film to be great. This is a very interesting film and takes a look at how a group of friends in the suburbs could become involved in some weird stuff. While there are some good scares and things that could be considered disturbing (one of the characters was pretty freaked out by a picture of a dead body, and another had the whole apartment filled with stuff), it is pretty much just a bunch of kids who find something out they should have found out a long time ago.   If you want to watch a little bit of the real American horror past, this film is for you.

"The best film ever made by a major Hollywood studio, the one that gave a lot of people the courage to try and do their own movies and still do better." --Jack Warner, studio president, MGM. -from "My Movie", by Robert Aldrich  This is one of the few films that was made on a budget under $10,000. The cost was raised by the sale of the original negative, which was donated to the National Film Preservation Foundation, and the film was eventually found and restored. The story centers around a young girl, named Elsie (Janice Griffith), who, when a local newsreel film crew goes to her home to film the funeral of her father, she gets a great fright. When the cameraman leaves the house, Elsie runs in a wild panic to a neighbor's house for help, only to find that the man, George (James Coburn), has left her with her mother (Mary Astor), and that the film crew has been replaced by a group of men who make a lot more money than she does. The young girl is taken in by a wealthy woman (Lois Chandler) who lives in the mansion below, and who helps her find her way to her "new home." The film is also notable for introducing several Hollywood stars --including George Cukor, Jimmy Stewart, Howard Keel, Marlene Dietrich, and Gene Tierney, to name a few-- and for its use of color, as well as its technical expertise, which included a camera that took black and white negatives and black and whites in reverse. A few people have claimed that the ending is false, and that George has committed suicide. But there is no evidence of this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the film first appeared in theaters, in 1966, the title of the film had been changed to Â  "The Manchurian Candidate". The director, Robert Bloch, had changed it in order to make a little more money.Â    The film was a huge hit and is considered by many as one of the best film of the 70s. This film was released on October 17, 1966 and was the first full-length horror film that was created using special effects.   Bloch was not a big movie director, he had only been in a few films before. In fact, the film was filmed in just 3 weeks in the summer of 1966. Â   For more info: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072264/
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fun movie.   It was a little bit of a "woo hoo" type of movie in that everything was done in such a cute and colorful manner that the whole movie had that feeling of the innocence of childhood.  It wasn't anything overly dark in the beginning, but as the movie progressed there was a dark and menacing atmosphere to the movie. I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie on DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It has great acting and some really great action scenes. I liked the whole premise of a kid who is just trying to find his way in the world and is not going to get along with anyone, so he has to build a new identity with his new friends.   There are some good jokes in this film and a really good plot line to tell. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I already said in my first review, this movie was amazing and I really liked the movie, but it felt as if it was a bit short on story lines, it was pretty short, but as an animated film the animation was excellent, I enjoyed the movie and it was just fun to watch, even though the story line was not all that interesting.

The movie is a comedy in which the main character is a former boxer turned drug dealer who gets hired by an ex-con to kill his next target.   It is quite funny.  The cast is all good.  A good story.  If you like your movies with a little more action than in most Hollywood comedies.  This is a good one.

I really enjoyed it and if you like comedies with great acting then this is definitely one for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens in a very interesting way. In one of the first scenes we see two men walking down a street. They are talking to each other in an odd way and we see the two men, one wearing a suit, and the other, with a suit jacket. The two men start to talk to each-other and then suddenly there is an explosion in the background. The camera starts panning down to the explosion and we start to hear someone screaming. The men stop talking to get a look at what is going on. The man with the suit is covered in blood. We then see the man on the ground. The blood covers the man's face. We see the explosion that the two have been talking about. The film then pans to the two people, one of them covered in bloody hands and a gun in his hand.   This film is really worth seeing. The soundtrack is great. It has a very sinister feel to it but also gives us a look into a very dark and twisted world.  In the end, you just want to see the film again.

The acting was good and there was some great scenes that was a really funny. I like that the director took some of the more dramatic scenes to create more comedy scenes.

It was fantastic! The acting was great and the story was so beautiful!   I didn't feel like I was in a horror movie, it was so much fun. It has a real feel and I thought that it was just perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was my first time seeing this movie (had seen it previously on the TV). I was very impressed with the film. The acting was great. The plot was very interesting. The editing was done very well. There was a lot of action. The music was great, but you never really noticed it. I had fun watching this movie. It is an old timey classic. I don't really see it as a cult classic. It's great.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie with my sister, and I think she was really impressed. The film is very well done and very realistic. The story follows the life of an ex-soldier from the Vietnam War, and we see all of the things he goes through. He gets separated from his wife and his family, and then gets recruited into the local war. The way he is introduced to the local soldiers is very effective.   This was my first time seeing this movie, so I don't have anything to compare it to. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story itself is not bad, it's about a man and his son who decide to take a vacation to Europe, and while they're there, they end up traveling with two prostitutes who are trying to save money by working as waitresses.   There are a lot of twists and turns throughout the movie, and it seems that each twist/turn has the potential to end up being a great turn, but it never does.  The sex scenes are quite good, and they aren't really gratuitous.  However, I would have liked the movie to have been more focused on the characters, but the movie really focuses on the sex scenes.  If you want to see a good plot and good characters, I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was great and I'm a sucker for these kind of stories, they're all so well put together.  The cast was great, and the actors in this movie were so great, it was always great to watch the guys in the scenes they played.   I think that it's one of the best looking movies I've ever seen.  It's a great movie and if you love the 80's movies or just some 90's movie, I highly suggest giving this one a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie. It had some good jokes. Some were so bad it didn't even bother me. The film was also good in the way it used the actors. The actors are so different from each other. For example, the guy who plays Mr. Saito is a bit funny. However, he was acting in this movie because his brother who played Mr. Hidetake is in this film. The director made sure to make the scene where Mr. Honda's father (played by Masanobu Takagi) asks him to help out with a case with Hideto's friend to make sure that this movie isn't a comedy. Hiding Hidetsuke's family was very good. It made Mr. Takagi's character a little more interesting. The one thing that was really good in this is the fact that this film has a strong plot. It doesn't waste a lot of time. The movie has lots of little details that really help to tell the story.   If you're looking for a good comedy in Japan, watch this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was at the theater and had to wait for a couple of minutes before the movie was even started. I know that movie is not worth it, but when someone is watching and someone else is in the front row, it makes a movie worth seeing.   What I found really interesting about the film is that, there were some things about this movie that I really liked. I was glad that the movie stayed true to the story, but I think it could have been a lot better.

It has a great acting ensemble, and a good story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw the movie for a first time about 10 years ago when I was in college and I really enjoyed it, the story is very unique and I don't think I've seen anything quite like it in the past decade.    It's a short story that follows the character of a young boy who finds a mysterious journal and is given access to a world he never expected to see.  The visuals are fantastic and the sound is top notch, I can remember the soundtrack was great and I remember it was a great time watching this movie.  I especially enjoyed the scene in the first movie that shows a great deal of physical training with the boy.  It was a bit jarring when the boy suddenly lost his shirt that he wore in the other movie and I thought it was very cool.  Â    Another great aspect about this movie is how realistic and moving the movie was, it's like watching a movie you loved as a kid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to stop my rambling here. The main point is this: this is a good looking movie that doesn't have a lot of depth. There's a lot going on in this movie that people will find distracting. Some will find it hilarious. Others will find this movie dull. But I'm a sucker for a good love story and a good director. The actor who plays the lead gets plenty of lines and is really fun to watch. The music and the production are great. And the cinematography is great. For those who don't like rom-coms: don't watch this. For rom-comedies: watch this!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot in this movie is a bit confusing. You want to know what is going on with the character's so you watch the entire movie but there's nothing to look for. The acting isn't amazing but it isn't bad either. It's the acting that you need to watch in this film. The plot is quite simple with a small cast of people and they are all played pretty well. The special effects used in the movie are good. The cinematography and lighting are well done. The soundtrack is really good and really adds to the movie. The cast in this are really good. This is the only movie that you should watch if you have never seen it before. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie that you can watch in one sitting. The music is good, the acting is good and the story line is interesting.  The story goes on for quite some time and it's a good one.  It's not the type of movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a story of a woman who is a detective and she has to go and find the man who has broken into her home. She has the help of a man who knows about a case that had happened years before. The movie is quite well done and it has some suspense.   It is a good crime movie.  For a crime film, it has a lot of heart and it just has to be seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen the movie over 40 times, and it has been one of my favorites for almost as long.   The story is simple: the police are investigating the murder of a woman in a movie theater, and the killer is someone who looks exactly like the guy who killed the woman.  It was an easy watch and the actors were great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished this movie for the first time. It's a great action movie that's funny and action-packed. The actor portraying the villain was great, but I would have liked to see a more original villain.   A great film and good action scenes.   I gave it 4 stars, but it's an ok movie, but the only reason it gets 4 stars is because it was made in the 60s and I love action movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is funny, and there is more humor in it than in any other comedy I have ever seen. The movie is a spoof of a 1970s television show called " The Adventures of Superman " and the actors, John Barrymore and Peter Boyle are the stars. The film does not contain a great deal of plot, but it's still amusing. The characters are all well known and they are fun to watch as they try to outwit and out do each other. It's a little strange how the film has become the butt of jokes. The plot itself is a little boring and it's all really very silly. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. But the people who liked it will probably enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen a few bad, mediocre movies and this one was pretty decent. Good cast, good screenplay, decent direction and good action.   This is one of the few movies that actually captures the feel of the real-life story.  I think it is the story that makes this movie enjoyable, not the actors.  This movie is a great example of a character in the midst of a tough situation (the only thing that's tough is the script) and having the ability to do whatever he has to to get out of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a huge fan of The Wizard of Oz when I was young. The musical version is great and I just loved the way it played.   This is the version of the Wizard of OZ that was made in 1958 and was the first one made with live stage actors.  It is one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen and is filled with lovely music and a great story.  There is some terrific acting by the actors in the movie and they really capture the spirit of the movie.  I had the chance to see this movie in the 1950's so this is the kind of version that I was so glad was made and this version is well worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this one really funny and enjoyable, but a little bit on the silly side (in a good way). I loved the idea of the film--the two men that work at the same car dealership are trying to outwit the guy that sells their cars. I'm not sure it really works as well as it might have if they had just hired a real car salesman who was always out to get them.   It's one of those things that you want to see but that you just don't get.

I highly recommend this to people who enjoy horror films.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen this movie before, but for some reason I felt that I had forgotten a few facts about the character in this movie, so I found the DVD and started watching the movie again to find them out. I had been looking for this movie for a long time, because it is by Steven Spielberg and it was his most successful movie.   This is not the first movie of Spielberg that I've seen, but it was definitely his best.  Steven Spielberg was always a dreamer and he is a very good one.  I have seen some of his movies, but not as good as this one. I have read some good reviews about it, so if you haven't seen this one, you may want to do it.  There are a few flaws in the movie that were not made to be shown.  Some of the scenes do not look good, because the angles of the camera make you not see anything that's supposed to be there.  They have added more violence and sex, but to no point, which just ruins the movie. However, I have to say that the ending is great.  This movie is good for people that like a good suspense story with good acting and good acting.  It is a well done movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie when it was first released in the 70's. It was so far ahead of its time and I never thought it would get the attention it did. It is about a teenage boy who is involved in the drug world in the south and he is caught with drugs and arrested. He is locked in a cell for a year but he manages to escape and gets to the South and makes a bunch of contacts and helps other people get into the drug business. I don't know if there is any plot or anything but I loved the characters and the style and the music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all fairness to the director, he actually put a lot of effort into making this movie. It takes an hour to reach the start of this movie and it does take that long for the film to really get going. It starts off with an eerie, almost foggy look, but then the director brings in some real atmosphere and adds in the voiceover of the man that is on his way to meet the woman he's interested in. The voiceover does a great job of explaining what the man is going to say to her, which is a nice touch to the movie. But then, things start getting really intense. Things get a little intense and very unsettling. At one point, the character is on the phone, and as the movie progresses, we get a great deal of insight into the man's mind. You can feel the intensity of the film and the tension as the characters wait for the woman to show up. If there was one complaint about this movie, it would be that some of the sequences were a bit hard to follow. Some of the characters were not clearly defined and it would have been nice to know what exactly was going on.   One of the main characters is quite interesting. The man on the run is quite creepy and very unpredictable. You are afraid every time you hear his voice and every time the film takes a step forward. He's not afraid to run and make a mess of things, which makes it a little hard to figure out what is going on behind the scenes, which gives this film a creepy, and a scary feeling to it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the summer of 1968, there were no major Hollywood studio movies. Instead, a group of college friends in the West Village were filming a scene from a B-movie entitled Night on Bald Mountain, a low-budget feature about a mad scientist's plot to create a super-soldier that will destroy the world. The original script (written by director Bob Rafelson) was written in 1950.   The movie was filmed in the streets of Manhattan.  The filming was quite a success and the cast and crew toured around the world as well.  This film has never been released on DVD and there are only a handful of VHS copies, so check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â I had not heard of the original film or the original novel. I was not aware that the film was made in Canada. I found out that a version was made for a Canadian television show. I enjoyed this film and found it was fun to watch. The film was filmed and edited very well.    Funny and funny.  The original film features the late Robert C. O'Hara as a "curious old man" who takes a trip to the Arctic in order to view a seal with a rare condition. The seal is eventually found to be a male with a strange birth defect. The doctor who examined the seal found it had a birth defect and that the father had died when the boy was only a few days old. The father was never identified, however, and the only information left was that he had gone to the north. The new film is actually a retelling of the story with a new director. The cast is great. Odom (who played the doctor) was great. He is very funny and you have a sense of what it would be like to be the father of this little boy.  I loved the song in the film, "I've Got the Blues."  I had never seen the original movie, and I was really disappointed that it did not get a theatrical release. I liked it, but I think the film should have received a better theatrical release to be as much fun to see as it was to watch it.

The movie is made better by the fact that there is not a great deal of dialogue, which makes for a better action film.

The use of a single line is worth watching.  You should see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful film that's very poignant and poignant about the loss and pain that many people have experienced, and the loss of friends, and of the relationship we have with them that goes on for years and years.   One of the most memorable scenes in the film is the last one. It really hit me hard, and is one of the best scenes that I have ever seen, and it's not the only scene that I think is wonderful, but it was the only one that had the power and the weight to make you stop and really realize the weight of what you are watching, and for that reason alone, it's a great scene.  This film really made me think and question what we know, and we have a tendency to believe that there is nothing we can't handle, that we can handle the pain that we've lived through, that there's nothing that we haven't experienced, but there is.  I'm not sure where it all went wrong in my life, but somehow, at some point in the past few years, I lost my family, and I have to believe, and truly believe, that all of that pain and loss was real, because, you know, I was there and I lost someone to suicide, and, it really hurt me deeply.  My friend, who was my boyfriend at the time, was also at the last party with me. He had died of a drug overdose, and while I was able to recover from the loss, I also lost him.  And I think that's when I lost all faith in people.  It wasn't until that point, when I was going through my second suicide attempt that I really began to question my own sanity, and my own reality, and began to realize that everything I had been told was a lie.  For me, this film, has also shown me just how strong the human spirit really is. I think this is one film that anyone, who is feeling lost or has been through some kind of tragedy, or is thinking about suicide, should watch.  There are a lot of good movies out there that portray suicide, but this film does it with a strong and powerful narrative that makes you want to watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I did not expect to enjoy this movie so much. I'm not an expert on the history of the world but I did learn a few things. There are two sides of the moon and these are the most important parts of the entire world. The other planets are not even noticed. What this world has that the others do not is the water. And the water is the life blood of the planet. It's what gives life to life. If we were not given the water, the other planets would die off. It is this water that allows us to live on other planets. The film is not as well written as I thought it would be. For example, at the very beginning when the main character, Sam, is on the moon, it appears to be dark and empty. Sam then goes to look at it and he sees the stars and everything is very beautiful and vibrant. Then as Sam is looking at the stars, he sees some strange and evil looking figures. Sam goes to investigate and when he looks closer, he see the dark figures. He then goes into space to find out what the heck these figures are. He realizes that these people are trying to kill him by stealing his water. I love this movie and if you ever have a chance to watch it, I recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you like a good, fun-to-watch thriller about a cop who comes across some disturbing evidence, then look no further.  The whole thing is about getting to the bottom of what happened to the girls that disappeared from a small town.   The director of the movie, Tom Savini, is a friend of mine, and he did some great stuff when he made this movie.  I also like that this movie was made on a shoestring. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie in the early 90's and I loved it. This is a great adventure film. The special effects and special acting of John Hurt and the way he interacts with the audience were amazing. This movie was good for kids, and I think it was even good for teenagers.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought that the story was very interesting and I really enjoy movies about people who are in dire straits and trying to get by.   The movie is funny and well told.  It is a slow build and it was interesting to watch this guy who was broke all of his life trying to have a better life with this girl.  The acting was spot on.  I loved the movie and it would be a good comedy/drama for those who want something to laugh at. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       In fact, they've done a lot more with this than just make one movie. This has evolved into a really, really strong, big-screen series.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good buddy movie where the crew of the Starship Enterprise gets pulled into a new and dangerous mission.  The story is not the most original in my opinion but it is well done and the acting is top notch.  This was a film that I felt like I was watching a different kind of Star Trek.  I did see this film on the television so I did not realize how much more advanced the technology in that film was than the ones from the old TV series.  A special mention to Brent Spiner, who plays the Captain of the ship who has a son who he loves.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been a fan of J.C. Chandor for years now and I've always been amazed that his filmography is more or less all about the same basic plot lines... I love his style and his performances are consistently top-notch.   If you love the story of the man who is fighting in a war, the war in a cave (I know some of you out there love the cave story) or the war from an alien world, I think you'll like this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a little funny, a little sad, and a little beautiful.   It was a long time ago in a world where movies were made by people with little or no talent.  This film shows us a little bit of that time in an interesting way.  I really enjoyed this film.  - April 17, 2010Not for a younger audience
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think it would have been better if the first episode were longer, as the second was just over half an hour, but for a children's movie with such amazing characters it's worth the time.   It is a very good cartoon, a lot of fun, lots of smiles.  And the voice actors are great.  I don't want to say too much about the plot or characters since it would spoil it for you, but I think everyone would like it, if you love kids cartoon movies and like kids cartoon stories!   If you're a fan of cartoons and you have a kid and a couple hours to kill, get this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The acting was all-time great. The film and the director knew exactly what they wanted from the cast and how to put it on screen.   It had so many twists and turns and the characters were perfect for it.  What a great script by Joss Whedon.  The ending was absolutely perfect, it was one of those movies that you can't even think about getting out of the theater and the ending is one of the best ever.  I can't wait for this to be made into a television series, it is such a great idea.  If you want a real good time and don't want to watch your life burn down around you, go see it. Â  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great story, and the acting was great! I loved this movie!   I love the fact that the movie is in black and white, and I think that was a great idea for the story.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is okay.   I think the ending is a bit off.  Also the movie got a bit slow.  In the movie, you see a lot of weird things.  There is an underground bunker, a huge air-tight chamber where the air is pumped out with huge fans. When it is time for a nuclear weapon to be tested, the bunker starts to leak, and it is now raining. This has nothing to do with the plot, but that's what makes it interesting.  But there is more.  The real story that was being told, the real story is how the Russians came to build a nuke that would destroy a whole city. A secret operation, an operation that will go down in history.  One secret operative, who is working in the US, and is in danger. A very big secret operation.  However, the movie shows how dangerous it is and how the situation could get out of control.  It seems the real-life scenario that was shown on TV, has been changed and changed again and again.  This movie is a little dated, and you have to give it credit for being a good thriller.  You get a lot from it, but the movie is not perfect.  I don't think that this movie will make you want to see more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was amazing! This is the first time I've seen anything on tv that was so realistic, even though I'm sure it was just a special effects show, and I had no clue how real it was. This movie was so authentic, it's just so fascinating how they were able to pull of it, it was like a real movie. The acting was just awesome! My favorite was the lead actress (I believe her name was Diane) I loved her work so much, and she got the role because she was hot, so she took it seriously and didn't show any feelings, it made me feel like I was watching my own movie and not a cheap one. This was so fun and well done.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember this being a good film.   This is another movie by Roger Corman, that really shows how much he has grown since his early days with such low budget films.  Corman is still just as good a director and a cameraman as he was in his early film days.  While the costumes are quite cheap (some of them quite ridiculous) and the lighting is bad, it is still worth watching.  The violence is not that great in the film but that isn't even a concern as you have Corman's other movie (The Living Daylights ) and he is not a director of cheap violence anyway.  This was one of the first horror movies I remember watching and I am glad I saw it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have loved this movie since I saw it when I was 15 years old. Now that I am older and more experienced with movies, it is one of my favorites.   My only complaint is that the first 15 minutes of the film were a little boring. There were some cool, high action sequences.  But the rest of the movie was a little bland. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie I always wanted to see. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it really was.   This film reminds me of something that a young Bill & Ted did.  I think there are great jokes and great comedy throughout the film.  There is also a good soundtrack of classic movies.  It was definitely worth the time I spent watching it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first watched this movie about a year and a half ago, and I've been having nightmares ever since.   It had me hooked from the first frame, and my brain still hurts from the second it starts to run down the drain.  It's also an extremely accurate portrayal of what it's like to have a mental illness, and the way that I have a hard time dealing with the day to day stresses of my life.  I'm really glad that I finally saw this, and it's the first movie I've seen that has truly captured my attention.  My favorite character is definitely Dr. Ried. Â I was a fan of his work in "The Matrix" (along with Keanu Reeves), and the rest of the cast does a really good job of bringing him to life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I was a kid, I used to watch these old silent movies with my Dad. He would often show us how he found the hidden gems in the movies, like the one about the ghost. My little sister and I loved the ghost, and it still makes me laugh when I see the movie. I love old silent films.   This movie reminds me a lot of my dad's movies. It's a simple and simple story about a simple man who's trying to make a living.  The old films are a great way to relax, but this is also a great time-killer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is interesting and well-done.   A little overlong, but it is still fun to watch.  I like that they don't take themselves too seriously.  The story is a bit long, but all the characters in it are interesting.  If you liked "The Graduate" or "Scent of a Woman," this movie will give you the same thing.  It is a nice twist on the film noir genre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie a lot. It's well-written, well-acted, and well-made. It has a nice story, and an even better ending.   It's a bit of a slow film, but it's done with a lot of respect for its source material.  "The film's director, Richard Fleischer, was also a writer for this play, and they knew each other. In fact, the writer, John Sayles, played with Fleischer's son, Gary. Fleischer even has a cameo in the film in his old age. Â The production was very good and there were a lot more great people involved in this film than I remembered. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the movie with my son and the conversation and laughter were enjoyable and a lot of fun. I was quite shocked by the movie as I've seen some of the better movies in the world. We all laughed a lot and I had to watch it again to appreciate the fact that it's really funny. I can't imagine if it was made in the US. The director is very professional and I loved the character of the young boy. His reaction to a child doing something very bad and disgusting was very funny.   A beautiful, strange, funny film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never seen the "Shining" in the theater (as it's title suggested) but had heard that it was quite good. I saw the film the day it came out. It was good, but not what I was expecting. It's got a lot going on and the film feels rushed. But it does work on its own merits.   A well written and well directed movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw this, I had a hard time seeing it as it's a parody of '80s action movies. But I'm not really the type of person who enjoys '80's action flicks. I liked the whole idea of it, however, and thought the character work was really good. I think it's interesting that when we first meet the two characters, they're in jail, and then we see them at a bar after they escaped. It's funny to see how different the characters look.   This was one of the most enjoyable movies I saw at the New Beverly Cinema in Santa Monica. It was really well acted and it had some good laughs.  This movie is not a "funny" comedy but it does have some good jokes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â  If you like horror films or suspenseful films, then you'll like this movie.   It is a simple film that leaves a lot of unanswered questions.  For example, when he finds the missing girl, why does he tell her he's going to kill her?  It's a story with a lot going on, so if you're not sure how to feel about it, just sit back and enjoy the ride.  I give it a 10/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a scene where John McClane (Bruce Willis) and his SWAT team goes after a high-tech terrorist cell.   He's running along the side of a bridge and he has his gun pointed at the ground and they get a good shot at him, but he dodges right out of the way.  The guys running after him are in the SWAT team.  They shoot at his feet and a few seconds later he's flying into the air and his head explodes.  It's such a fantastic scene, it's almost like a dream, it was like watching a cartoon.  I'm very pleased that they were able to do that because it has such a huge impact on the film.  This was made in the early '80s and it was one of the first big action movies.  When the film came out, it did well, it got a lot of attention, and it got sequels, but it never had a huge following.  What was so cool about the scene was that you didn't see a big explosion, you actually saw the head explode, the neck and the body.  Now I can't believe I'm typing that sentence.  So it was a great scene that you really feel like it's a cartoon sequence.  Cinematographer:  This is the first film that I shot that wasn't in 3-D.  At that time I had gone to film school and they were experimenting with 3-dimensional stuff and shooting on 35 mm.  On this picture we went to a really beautiful place in upstate New York, this mountain called Devils Tower, I really wanted to shoot in that area because it's so beautiful.  He also did the music, it had this really cool score.  But the action scenes, as you saw in the film, were really done in the 3-d. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a gem that I have loved from the beginning.  The acting, directing and acting skills of James Stewart are absolutely stunning.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in college when this movie came out. I really enjoyed it and still do. This movie does not do a whole lot for me and I am very sorry that it came out when it did. This was a good old-timey "dandy" story about a bums old friend that takes his little brother to see his new girlfriend at the opera. They make out and then there is an incident in the opera that leaves the bums little brother with a broken arm. He wants the opera to be over so that he can go home and rest but the bunts friend convinces him to continue seeing his girlfriend. He does this and I think the movie would be good if it wasn't a 70's throwback.   The actors were all great. George Sanders was very good. He was very charismatic and had this sense of the fun he had playing a real good time bums kind of guy. I loved the music. It was very jazzy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I am not sure if this movie is based on a true story or a novel, but it does tell the true story of the man who started the first organized hunt for Bigfoot. The film is a good example of what made these movies popular.   The story is a lot more intense than most of the other Bigfoot movies I have seen.  I enjoyed this film and it was a good way to end a long summer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-made action thriller. You will be scared by the "good guys" and scared by those in your group.   The editing and camerawork are great.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you feel the adrenaline rush.  I especially enjoyed seeing this as a young man because of the "un-natural" look at youth and the violence that can come from a youth's point of view.  A great action thriller that has a great twist ending.  - The cast is good and fits the characters well, but it does feel a little forced.  The story is really just a "plot", and there were times I felt the editing was a little off, or the characters a little too similar. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My second viewing of the classic movie The Exorcist was really the best.  The film has been re-released numerous times, but I love watching it in its original release.  It has such a powerful feeling.   The story follows the priest at a seminary who has been possessed by the devil, and his family and friends try to help him.  This movie is one of the most frightening and controversial films in movie history.  There are still people who deny the existence of demons, but you don't need to be religious to see this movie.  Director and screenwriter William Peter Blatty had already done some of his best work in his previous movie, The Exterminating Angel, so the film isn't too different than any other of his other movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is all about the old-time movies, so it's not the same movie as you might have seen before. The acting is good. The special effects are fantastic, the music is also good, but not quite the same music, and the story is a little hard to follow. That's why it works. The movie has some great one-liners, like the one where a girl says, "I'm going to hell!"   There's a great sequence in which the old people and the babies go out to lunch, and they have to do a whole show of them doing the old things and going down the slide.   This was the last movie they made. The director died.

However, there is a child that has a problem with their own body and wants to be a human. But is he the right human?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not care for the first half of the movie.  The acting was so awful that I was thinking the movie would have been better if the two main characters had had more lines.  I liked the second half of this movie. The acting of these two characters are so perfect.   They are in love and I could tell from the beginning that they were in love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's like watching a documentary on the history of the gay and lesbian movement, with clips of Stonewall and the Stonewalls of the 90s, and all the interviews with leaders and the participants who were there. It's a fascinating look at the evolution of LGBT politics and is very informative. It provides a little bit of history that most don't get the opportunity to see. If you're a little on the fence about seeing this, I'd give it a shot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had just seen "Zoolander" and thought it was a fun film.   That all changed when I saw this movie!   It had great acting and a great sense of humor.  When I finally saw "Frost/Nixon," it blew me away.  My daughter loved it and so did I.  I think it's a great comedy that makes you laugh.  It has all the elements to become a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie! The story about a man who is paralyzed by the same disease that his wife died from is so powerful! The writing of this film is so well done, and every actor is amazing! You can tell that they really took the time to find out who they wanted for this movie, and all of them gave it their all. You feel for the man, and then his wife in her pain and despair!   It's about as real and as powerful as a film can get! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film that has the biggest impact on me, the film that changed my life.

A little over two hours of heart breaking heart breaking tragedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Very well done. I liked the way the plot unfolds. I also enjoyed the way they made the main character an outsider.   The story was told in flashback in order to get a more realistic view of events. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's so funny and very funny. Great acting and great acting. I have seen this before but never really paid attention to it. It's a bit different from some of the other comedy films.   The guy at the end says "We should do this again". I love this so much.  It reminds me of how it used to be when we used to watch movies on TV. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was so excited to see this movie that I bought the ticket when it was on the list at a local theater. I only had to wait about an hour to be admitted and then watched the film again. This movie was actually quite good. I enjoyed the performances and the story. I really think it was a good film for the kids who were out there to see a kid-friendly movie.   My daughter watched the movie with me. I think it would be nice for her to see some classic movies with her friend.  A must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie for the first time recently on tv. The first few minutes were quite a shock for me. This is a VERY good movie. The movie shows a lot of different kinds of problems and people. The main character is very realistic. He lives with his mother, but it was very different to my life as an older man, where I would often stay at her house. I was amazed at the fact that he really had to pay his bills, but at the same time he couldn't stay in her house, because his money was almost gone and he didn't know how he could support himself any longer. I'm a little bit surprised by the fact of how realistic his problems are. I felt so bad for him. There are so many different kind of problems a young person has to face, and this movie shows them all very well. My favorite part of the movie was the ending. It was so sad, but a perfect way to close the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoy the way the film portrays the experience of being a teenager. The movie seems to capture this feeling very well, with the director using the most realistic and realistic looking teens I have seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit, I was a little bit worried at the time I saw this. But after seeing the film on film and talking to the director and writer of this film, he made it a great film.  He took all the best things of the old gangster movies like Scarface, The Untouchables, Scarface: The World Is Yours, and made something really special.   This movie is awesome and should be watched by anyone.  If you haven't seen it, make sure to watch it as soon as you see it on DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love to see a big, fat, monster made for the silver screen (no pun intended) and with the best cast to boot.

For me, this is the kind of movie that I enjoy seeing (after the first one), which is why I love it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but I had no doubt I'd be in for a fun time.   This movie isn't the kind of thing you'll have to be "in" to see, and since I've seen it, I can see why.  It's a fun movie with an interesting premise.  The humor, the characters, the humor, and the character development are all pretty good.  This isn't a bad movie, and if you are looking for a good old fashioned comedy, this is the one for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My dad had a small part in this movie, which was actually hilarious because his character was kind of a wuss. He was one of the actors who was on the plane with my dad when he got shot down over Libya. He played a French guy, and he looked like he'd be in a movie like the movie The Fugitive. The rest of the cast were great, including Steve Martin.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not really a fan of sci fi films, but for the money this is a good one. It's set in the year 3100 AD where the people have become more advanced than we are. It has lots of twists and turns but doesn't take itself too seriously. The actors are excellent. The special effects are amazing. The story is also pretty good. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a good sci fi story with action and good acting.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only problem I had with this movie is that it is too short. It only ends with a cliffhanger and I was left wondering what happened next. The action is great and I like that they show a couple more scenes of the next day and in the future. I would definitely watch it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great!  The people in this movie are not like in movies of yore where the black guy was the only one of his race and so every white person was there to be used, and the movie is not as far gone as some, there are some real moments, the white woman is a little more than just a slave or servant, she's a woman.   The movie is very good for the 90's, and it's fun to see the 90s come to life.  I would recommend watching this if you have a chance, and you might enjoy it if you are looking for some 80s action.

I don't remember seeing many of them when I was a kid, but this was really great for me. I know I'm old, but it still blows my mind.    - August 23, 2013I'm old
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie does a nice job of blending old film noirs and modern noir elements. I can't think of a better combination of old and new films, but the movie takes you back to old New Orleans.   My favorite aspect of the movie is how the noir aspect feels like it is taking place in the past, but at the same time still very modern.  I really liked the movie.  The story was told well and I didn't mind the use of film noir as the main form of setting for the story.  And I love the ending, it's a perfect ending to the movie that is not a cop out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great flick for those looking for a fast paced action flick with great sound design and action. The movie looks great and the action is amazing.   The story of the movie revolves around a group of criminals that want to rob a vault at the local bank. A young girl named Katie, a good girl, is hired to help the robbers.  Katie's father is the leader of the group, and the whole movie revolves the love and hate that she has for him. Â   Â Overall, a great movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think I remember seeing this movie in the early 80s and loved it!   So when a new version came out (1986), I knew I had to see it.   This film is about a family that owns a hotel and what happens to it after the owners are murdered in a mysterious fire that doesn't leave any trace.  The movie was very enjoyable and the murder scene is pretty chilling.  In one scene you can see the killer, I was very afraid!  The acting was pretty good in this movie, although I think the young actors were just doing what was asked of them.  Overall a great movie that is definitely worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a must watch! If you want to see a true crime film made by a true journalist go to Blackfish, but I think Blackfish is more like an in-depth look at the media in the early days of Blackfish that has a different subject, but no one cares about that, they all just love the documentary. This movie looks like it could have been made in the 70's but the style and filming make it modern and enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter and I loved it. We were the only ones in our little group to do so and it was great.   As a mom and grandmother, I am thrilled that they gave a young man of my generation the chance to do a movie like this.  He could have played any one of his favorite characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went in for a friend's birthday, and was pleasantly surprised when I found out it was a "fun" movie with a good cast. This is another great, enjoyable movie that should be seen. The story is a little strange (it follows a young man and his girl friend who go to a wedding, and the girl falls off a building, but survives), and the acting (by most of the cast) was great (I especially liked the acting by the girl). The music is good, and I enjoyed the soundtrack.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! It was a fun watch! And at the time it was still funny. I loved it when my friends and I were playing hockey on the frozen pond and playing this movie. This was a good family movie.   It was very fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think much about this movie when I first saw it. I know, I shouldn't be the one to judge a movie based on its first showing, but I was in a small town and it had just opened on the local big screen. I had seen a few of the movie's trailers and the poster and thought it was just an American horror movie set in Germany, I didn 't think much more of it. When the movie opened, I thought to myself, "Is this the one?!" The whole thing just seemed to be set in a very rural setting and the movie really had an eerie vibe. The lead character was a woman, who had disappeared into the woods, when her boyfriend found her, tied up and beaten to death. I was not surprised that it opened so well and I was very happy to see the cast in this film. The movie was really well acted, and the entire film had this "realistic" feel to it, which really worked with the movie. It was a very disturbing film, and I think that the whole cast really did a great job portraying their roles. I really thought that the film had a very real atmosphere, but it did have that "haunting" feel which really added to the movie and really made it scary.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A really good movie. The acting is terrific and the action is very well choreographed. The ending is also great.    The acting in this film is very good. The story is well written, and it's not all one-liners. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. It is funny and has great actors. The whole story is about how a man (who is really a woman) gets a divorce and goes on to become a beautiful woman named Jessica.  Â It is good for people who enjoy a good laugh.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves laughs and laughs at times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The great part is that the movie was made before the series and they could make the story interesting without it being over the top.  It was great watching the crew of the ship get into trouble while trying to find a way to get into the black hole.  This movie also has great shots and great voice acting.   Great story, fun to watch!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love movies. And this movie is one of my favorites.   A young boy is sent to the island of "Namu" with his mom, his sister, and his two dogs.  He has very little food, water, and no shelter. The food, which he gets from a local man, is inedible and only makes his stomach pucker.  But he gets his share of a life threatening disease.  The disease kills the man, but the boy survives. He learns that the man is a vampire and he must save his sister.  It is a touching and realistic tale of what happens when you have no friends and have to survive alone.  Â  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would say this is a good time.  I have not seen much of his films.  He is one of my favorite actors and this movie is worth seeing.  His acting is so great.  And there are funny parts.  It is really well made.  The scenes are funny and I was laughing out loud all the time. There are some sad scenes too but still it is a great time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw "The Magnificent Seven" when I was a child, it was on the big screen for the first time, and it was thrilling to watch. My parents put me in front of it for the entire day and we were both hooked. The movie stars "The Wild Bunch" cast: Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris and Frank Sinatra. The main characters are the Wild Bountys, and the plot was the story of the first robbery and the trial of the two Wild Bill Hickok's who were tried. The plot involved a big fight, and a gun fight between the two men. The story was great, and all the actors were great, from the "Wild Bill" to Sylvesters and Frank. The music was great too, and one of my favorite scenes was the shootout. The western's theme of greed, revenge and the "shoot 'em up" is still alive today in the movies, such as the recent movies "The Fast and the Furious" and "Hercules". I still love these films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â  This film is one of the most exciting and original movies I have seen in a very long time. The screenplay was brilliant and the direction was amazing. I loved the whole thing and wanted to make sure I was there with the cast and crew so I can witness it for myself. It was a fantastic film and should be seen by everyone. I highly recommend it and will definitely see it again.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie really had me hooked.  It was dark and gritty and the acting was top notch.  They were actors who actually knew how to put on a performance.  The film had lots of tension. The way they used the characters was very effective.  I was actually very disappointed that the film was not more successful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a certain something that you can get from watching a good drama, and I always find it exciting when I get to watch a good historical drama about a fascinating era in American history.   It is also a real pleasure to watch the characters' complex relationships play out.  In particular I loved the scene where Jack and Catherine are at the house of the friend who is trying to get the money from the family.  Jack is getting ready for a confrontation with Catherine's sister and friend, but Catherine is busy looking over a book.  They find a letter from a friend of Catherine's to Catherine saying how she wishes Catherine had been more attentive to a woman in trouble.  It's a touching scene and reminds me a little of another old drama I have watched, ''The Best Man'' (1959).   I also enjoyed seeing the younger Jack and his brother, William, play pranks on the old folks.  Another point of interest in this movie was the film's depiction of the women who lived in the upper classes.  Some of the characters have been done to death in Hollywood, and ''The Virginian'' gives us a different kind of women. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little nervous about seeing this on the big screen, but I think it turned out great. The performances were top notch and the plot was interesting. I do think there were a lot of unnecessary cutaways and quick cuts, but if you are looking for something fast paced, this is your movie.    This movie does not have a particularly good script. I never understood how they would make a movie about a blind cat (with a pretty girl for his pet cat) about an entire week of a family and their cat that doesn't go to work.  What we are left with is a nice story.  And it's a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A fun family film from the late 1930s. The film takes place in a rural part of the country. It's pretty hard to believe in the film as it's set in the 1940s. A little boy (Edward G. Robinson) and his mother (Gloria Grahame) move to a small rural town in an attempt to be closer to his older brother. The older brother, played by Sidney Poitier, is the town sheriff, but he doesn't like the townspeople very much. He believes that they are thieves and bullies. The boy's brother, (Bruce Dern) moves in next door, and he's a very sweet guy. He's an aspiring actor and his wife (Kim Hunter) is a talented pianist. He wants to join the sheriff's department and he gets the job as a substitute. He quickly becomes friends with the sheriff, who likes him. They form a close friendship. The real plot starts around the time the boy's mother is hospitalized after an injury. The townspe and other townspe don't like her, either, and she's not allowed to work. The sheriff decides to move in with her, but his step-father and mother are furious. They also want him to leave. The movie's funny, though. It has great performances from the young actors and a great soundtrack by Irving Berlin. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was excited to see "The Crow" because it seemed like an original take on a horror film. The filmmakers actually thought the movie would be too funny to be scary so they cut out everything that would have scared me. I don't know why I didn't read the book because it had me so scared I couldn't read for over an hour.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to have a laugh as I'm not the best when it comes to serious things.   The story is very interesting and very well-written.  There was something that stuck in my mind from when I watched the first one: the "stompy" walk, and it made me smile.  The "walking with the devil" thing is still there.  I also think they put in some really funny bits to give it a different atmosphere.  A little something for all your old-school horror fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the other reviewers said, this is not the best movie of 2001 but it is definitely an improvement on the original movie and is very entertaining.   Â My favorite scene is the one where Richard Dreyfuss and Marisa Tomei are walking down a hallway. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie, the best, but it has flaws. For example, in one scene, the guys are at the bar when they notice a girl who looks like they are in a dream and she has two men in her arms. They are both in the dream, one is in the background but he's very much alive and the other one is a man in the front of the group. It was a very weird thing to see and it was hard to concentrate on watching the movie.   The action is good, especially the motorcycle chase in which a man and a woman riding a motorcycle jump out of a car and crash into a group of criminals.  The characters are well drawn, especially Bruce Willis in the role of the assassin.  A great action film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The first "Star Wars" movie. There are not many films about a galaxy far far away that make you feel the nostalgia of a time when this franchise was still fresh and the hope was still alive.   The film is about a "Star Destroyer" crew who has a bad case of "vacation fever" while they are away on an away mission.  The movie makes it's mark from the very first frame where our crew members are walking to their ship, through a scene that is reminiscent of Star Wars: Episode IV "A New Hope".  In the film the "Sith" have been defeated and there is an exciting new era in space. Â  "The Empire Strikes Back" is probably the best "Star" film in my opinion. It is not the most original, or the most realistic, but it is the most impressive and memorable in my books.  For some people this may be the best of the franchise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It wasn't all that easy to watch. There were some scenes that were hard to watch and it took some time to get the hang of the plot. I am not sure if it is the acting or the writing or the directing. I think it is all of the above. The acting was great. There was a great chemistry between the cast and it was nice to see a movie where both the boys have chemistry.   This movie was a lot of fun and it made me laugh a lot!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching this movie in the early 90's. I don't know if the remake came out before I saw it, but I liked it and it is good. This is a really cool movie.   "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and the sea and all that is in them, and it was so. And there was evening and there was morning, a time to be born and a time for death.Â But God said, 'Let there be light,' and therewas light. "In that time God said 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.Â Male and female let us be created,' and God made them. "And God said to Noah 'Let Us make man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.' Noah said 'I will not take care or put him into the garden.Â For if I do, I'll kill you. "Then God said "Why not take some of your friends and friends of your wife and kids and staff and have a feast and invite all the people of the world to come and eat with you?" Noah said, "I'll never do such a thing." "But then God said that he would show him the wonders of the earth. Noah then took his wife and his sons and all of his animals and he put them in the ark and Noah set out on a long journey and God brought him back. But Noah and his animals were hungry so God said he would make him a great feast and He made everything good in the earth."  Â "God then said 'Here is the world, and all things that God has made are good.Â So, I give to you to eat.'"   This movie is really good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you've got a script that's this good, you don't need to make it look like it came from a movie. Instead, you create a film that's actually funny. And when you see this, you'll realize you donï¿½t have to worry about a lot of things.    This movie is a classic that will still make you laugh at the end of the day.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this on a TV show and was a bit skeptical at first. But when I saw the movie I was totally sold. It's the first time I have seen a movie like this where there was no bullshit, no one was taking credit, and the acting was so realistic. It has such depth and realism to it. It made me appreciate the actors more and was made me realize how important this movie really is. It really does show that a movie can really change an actor's life. The acting was great, and I really felt like I was in the movie. The ending was just perfect, I mean it brought me to tears, and it left me thinking of how great it will be when this movie is all over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think "The Big Lebowski" is a wonderful movie, and one of the best films ever made. It has a great sense of humor, and it's great to see the great John Turturro in a movie. There's just something about him, and that's all the more reason to watch this wonderful film. It's a great time for fans of comedy and Turturturros. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many others I was drawn into the "Sidney Lumet" film " The Thin Blue Line " as it was released in 1975. As a young kid I was intrigued by the premise that a police detective killed a young black boy. I'm glad that I've been able to revisit the movie recently for the 20th anniversary. The "Sly Stone" character in this movie is as close to "Sandy Grady" as I've ever seen. I loved watching him go from a naive, harmless innocent to a man ready to do what's right in the most difficult of circumstances. He's not quite as charming as the character in the film, but he's still a great lead. I particularly like that his relationship with his son was depicted as being equal in strength and maturity.   It's a great film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie, and an excellent remake. It's definitely not a movie for children. But if you're a fan of the original, then this is a must watch.    "I thought you might like this one, so I thought I'd share my experience." I thought this was a really fun movie. It doesn't have the crazy antics of the earlier film. It does have a really good soundtrack. I think I was just drawn into the storyline. I'm surprised the director wasn't fired. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very enjoyable movie with a very good movie. It has been re-done in the film and in the book. It is the same plot line but it is good. Great acting, a great story and the best parts of the book are told in the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It has everything I look for in a good thriller, including a great and engaging story.   A bit more suspenseful, and a bit more realistic than the movie that came out in 2012, I can't wait to see what happens next. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was my first time watching a movie that has the potential to become a cult classic.   The movie is set in the year 1859 in the town of "Toulouse" in the French-speaking part of South America.  A man named Pecheval was a wealthy land owner and he is married to a very beautiful and educated woman named Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se. They have several children, one of whom is their young daughter Jean-Baptiste.  Pecheavel has been very close to Marie-thÃ©rÃ¨ses family for a long time, but Marie- thÃ©rÃ¨es parents are dying, so he gives them away to the hospital to be cared for.  The children are left with a loving but distant father and their uncle.  When Pecheevals father passes away the children take their time visiting their auntie, the late Madame de GrÃ©goire, to say goodbye.  Madame deGrÃ©goires eldest daughter is an extremely sick girl.  One of Pechedele's nephews, Jean-Francois, is a skilled horse rider.  This movie was not very good for me at the time, there were a lot of mistakes in the movie, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth watching.  I think this movie would make a great movie for a small group of people who would enjoy this type of movie.  If you like French movies this is a good choice, it has a good plot, it is not as good as the original The Quiet Man, but it is worth seeing if you like romantic movies.  My rating for this movie is a solid 6/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's up with that? I loved "It's a Wonderful Life"   My dad, my sisters and I are all from Tennessee, and I always enjoyed hearing it on the radio.   It was an important part of my childhood.  The kids from the town we grew up in all loved to watch it. We were all in the local movie theater on weekends when we were growing up. It was always a big deal to get a movie ticket for that big classic.  I'm not sure how this movie got such a bad reputation. It's not a bad film in any way, but it's just a good one with a lot of great music.  It's still fun to hear it today. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen quite a few different comedies, but this one I love. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   As a child, I always wanted to be a writer. I never wrote anything, because I didn't know how. My father, who is a lawyer, knew some, but I didn t have the confidence to pursue it. Later on, after moving to NYC, I started taking writing classes, and was a happy accident. This movie had an incredible impact on my life, and I hope it can have a similar impact on others.    A great film about the importance of dreams and determination. I highly recommend it for every person who has ever thought of being a writer, or has always thought of quitting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those rare times where I watched a movie (or two) at a movie theater and thought it was the best thing I had ever seen.  It's one of the few movies that is both funny and tragic, so in my opinion, that's what makes it so great.  The best scenes involve the characters who are both funny (Tom Hanks as the hapless waiter in one) and tragic (the wife and her children who are separated due to a divorce) and I'm surprised that I haven't seen it before.  I would love to see more movies like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to give this movie 5 stars.  First of all, this is a great movie!  The acting is great, and the cinematography is excellent.  The story is very well-done and has many layers.  I was thoroughly entertained, and I am glad I saw this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know that scene where a guy tells the police officer to "watch his step?"   This movie is really funny.  It makes me laugh every time I watch it.   I've watched the film many times over.  They really nailed the "stalking and killing" thing.  I wish there was a DVD release of the movie so I could listen to it on my old stereo.  If you like "stalkers" movies then you'll like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â I had seen the movie at the end of a long day of work and just wanted a quick release.    There was no "plot" or "drama" that kept me from enjoying the movie.  Â  I was just looking for a quick way out, nothing more.  It was one of those movies that you see on TV but in person you realize how real it is.  The movie was just like a normal day at work for those at the plant. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an awesome movie! The writing, the acting, and the direction is top notch!

A great movie, good acting, good soundtrack and a pretty great ending.  I liked the movie as well, but i am not as big a fan of the actor as most of the people here, and i guess the movie was not made with big stars in mind (i think it could have been a great movie had it had someone like mackie, james jackson, or robert deane in it).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been wanting to watch "A Touch of Class" ever since I saw the trailer for the film. It's a great film, and I love that it's set in the 1880's and is a romantic comedy. It has a great cast and excellent acting, but I wasn't entirely sure I would be enjoying the film at all, but the performances made up for it.   The film takes place in the small town of "Faulkner" (and was filmed in Pennsylvania, just like most of the other movies in the series), where "Cab Calloway" is making a movie, "A Good Day to Die Hard". It's really hard to find good old fashioned romantic comedies in the early 1900's, but it was a real treat to see a film set in such a time and place, and with an excellent cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only negative thing is that the first act was pretty boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great film that shows how a good director can take a film about the dark side of the American dream and make it into a dark comedy.   The plot of this movie is a little weird, and its a bit more of an action film than a comedy. And, it does have its own twists.  While some people may look at it as a bad movie, some others will look back at it fondly.  The acting is wonderful, especially the role of Ray Liotta and the film is an homage to Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had only seen the trailer for this film and it looked like something out of a horror film. However, upon seeing the film for myself, I was very impressed with the acting, the storyline and the atmosphere of the film. I was amazed at how believable the atmosphere was.   The story was the perfect blend of suspense, horror and romance.  I have not seen another film with such an amazing atmosphere.  The characters are so great.  This film definitely would have a lot of attention in a horror/drama film festival.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a film lover like myself, you probably already have heard about The Wicker Man. You should watch it immediately. It is a classic film that still holds up a quarter century later. The movie is based on a book by the great Edgar Allan Poe called The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, which tells the story of a man who goes to the woods in a quest for the truth about what happened to his family. The story is so fantastic it could only have been made by an unknown artist at the dawn of the 20th century. The cast is all so good, the actors have a chemistry with one another and they bring their characters to life. This movie is so dark and it is hard to believe the story took place in a world of fantasy. I was so mesmerized by the story and I loved watching the characters change. This is one of the few movies that I think is truly perfect. It just has so much heart and it has aged very well. I really love this movie and it's such a shame that this amazing story has been lost. I am sure if it was given a proper distribution it would become a classic.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you can stomach it this is a movie for you. If you don't, you can get a much better movie for around 10 dollars, and probably less.    The plot of the movie, and most of the characters are not original, but this movie has the energy, and the performances to make it great.  There is a lot of dialogue, and I found it to be a lot more interesting then the "shopping mall" movies.  The movie makes you feel like you are part of the gang that is out there robbing and doing bad stuff, and they all get together and plan and then they pull off a good robbery, and everyone gets arrested and in trouble, and you get to feel all of their guilt and regret.  It was a great movie to watch and the acting was great. Â   I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys movies and is looking for something different. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was the first film I have seen that gave me goosebumps after seeing the first couple of seconds of it. It had everything a horror movie should have, except for a monster, and it was scary, original, and really disturbing.  It is also the first movie where I ever saw John Carpenter and Michael Myers on the same film.   I think this movie was one of the best movies I saw in my early 20's, and I still watch it every now and then because of the creepy, unsettling feeling it gave me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is pretty good. I love how there's tons of people around the hotel and they never see each other's faces.   I thought it was kind of a boring movie. It was kindof boring the whole time.  It was supposed to be like " The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly ". I guess they shot the part that was like that but that was it.  The hotel had a lot of crime going on and the characters don't know that they're in a hotel. The scenes with people being shot and killed were really cool.  One of the more disturbing scenes was when a man in a black suit was walking down a hallway and he was about to kill one of the women in the hotel. He was holding a gun in his hand but it was unloaded. So he ran right past her and left her to be shot.  This was a pretty good movie to watch with your young nephew and niece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a HUGE Star Wars fan. And I have watched every movie that has come out from the original trilogy up to this date.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember seeing this movie as a kid when it first came out. I remember how awesome it was to see a movie about the real life story of someone living in the United States who is transgender. I had always wondered what that was all about, and the movie made me a believer.    The best part was seeing how the whole movie was filmed in the woods.  It was such a great experience.  My favorite character was a man that is in between a woman and a man. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those who have seen this movie and have no reason to go through all the other "Shark Busters" sequels, I will say this is a good one. The underwater scenes are great and the story takes you in a few different directions with great results. The only complaint I have is that the "Sharks" seem to have a bad habit of not appearing. For instance, one scene has the sharks attacking two men in a cave who are trying to get to the surface. They were able to make it to the boat. The next scene showed them walking toward the boat without any sharks. The last two sharks, one on either side of the boat, don't even move.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director's cut was the only version I saw of this film, and that is very unfortunate. It is one of the best looking and most enjoyable films of all time. It was my introduction to black and white and the era it represents, and it has remained to this day one of my favorite films to look at on the big screen. If you haven't seen this one, do it.

The whole cast was very well cast and there were some great characters. The movie had some pretty funny moments and I can't say this is the best, but it is definitely my favorite. I think that if I'm going to watch a comedy, I would suggest watching this and also watching it with a friend who can enjoy all the laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was so pleased I watched this movie. The movie has a good feeling. Its a classic from the olden days. It has a great plot, a good script, and the actors are good. This movie does not have anything to do with "The Godfather" or "Raging Bull." This movie is a great movie from the 60s. The soundtrack has a nice old-time feel to it. Its an amazing movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember seeing this film as a child. My dad took me to see it on a Saturday night. My mom was home, so my sister and I stayed behind and watched the movie with our parents. The movie was kind of "what's that, a Christmas movie". Well, it was Christmas! We were treated to a pretty, yet scary, Christmas movie, with some excellent performances. I remember it pretty clearly, even though my sister (and I) didn't actually get to see the movie.  I really enjoyed this movie as a kid. The scary parts were actually pretty scary! I liked the little kids more.   Now, I'm an adult, so I can watch the movie a lot more carefully.  This movie was made back in the 1960s, so the acting wasn't as good as it could be.  The ending was not very good.  But for a kids movie, this was pretty good. I recommend seeing it as a Christmas special, with a good scare, a "What's This?!" Christmas theme and a nice song (or two!).
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. The acting was great, the acting was well. It was really fun to see the kids who have to act in a real life movie and have it work. The kids did an amazing job. The movie was full of action. I think it was one of the best action movies ever and that's what we need more of these days. The way they did things was good. I liked how some of the villains were scary but at the same time had a fun time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie during a commercial break from a marathon I was watching at the time, and I must say, I was impressed. It was well-made, well-acted, and well-edited. A good watch, and it left a great taste in my mouth.   It's a shame, but there's no need to get all philosophical about the meaning of the word "journey". What it really means is a journey to find something to love in life, in any form, and the film made that message really well.  This film is a must-see, and you must see it when it comes on the airwaves. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie. If you want an action movie with lots of blood, nudity and explosions, you'll probably like this movie.   This movie is a great example of a story with a twist.  The story begins in the early 1900's, where a gang of thugs (called "The Brotherhood") has just murdered a man (John Gilbert) and set fire to his home. They have been caught, but they escaped the police. They are tracked down by a secret service officer (played by Robert Duvall) who's trying to get revenge on them. The Brotherhood consists of a former gang member, a woman and an ex-husband.  Duv I think the best part of the film is that Duvalls character was great.  I was surprised by this and I was glad he was the lead.  He is very good in the movie and has a lot of great lines.  One of the best parts of this movie is the way they shoot it.  It was a great experience to watch a film that was made with very little money, and yet looks as good as it does.  This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen.  - August 8, 2010A Great film

I loved the movie, but I would have preferred the film to come out when we had just arrived in Spain and to have been shot in an authentic Spanish style, instead of the English style of this film, which at times had the feel of a soap opera.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those who are curious of what the actual plot was of the movie about, it was to give a character in a movie about Hollywood in the early 40's. It is about a young man who goes to the Hollywood studios to make a film about Hollywood, but the young man gets fired from the movie and he has to pay the damages to the movie company. So he went to see the studio, and the only way to get them to pay damages is to blackmail them. It was a very good movie.

It was not as good as the musical, but it was pretty funny in its own way.   "The Best of the Beatles" is about a guy named Frank and his girlfriend, Connie, a young, pretty waitress. He has been invited to the home of John, Paul, George and Ringo and they take him to dinner. We see some scenes from the set of the movie and some backstage. The set is done very well.

This was an awesome movie to watch with my kids.  We laughed so hard!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You'll notice that the movie is set in the '70s, but what it lacks in authenticity, it makes up for in humor.   And while the humor is pretty bad, the acting is top-notch, especially for the supporting cast.  The only real problem is the sound, which isn't great.  If you have a big home theater and can get the sound up, this is worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film takes place in the late 1930s, right after World War 2, where the Nazis are about to take over the country.   I was not impressed with this film at all.  In a way, it reminded me of a film about the Japanese occupation during World War Two, or perhaps the war in general.  I think that the film is just trying to make a buck.  Even though the film portrays what appears to be a great fight scene, the film ends on a dull note, as if the film's producers didn't think that they had a good story, or that they really believed that they were telling the truth.  The movie is pretty long, and the amount of fighting that takes place is excessive.  However, what the film lacks in action, it makes up for with the characters.  Although it's a little too long to be entertaining, the characters are fun to watch.  Unfortunately, it feels as if this film was produced in a rush, because it doesn't feel like it's been carefully researched, and it's all about a simple plot.  There are no dramatic changes in the plot, which is a shame, because there are some good scenes that are worth watching.  Overall, this is another film that I don't really think that you should waste your time on, unless you really have something else going on in your life, and really enjoy fighting scenes, and like Nazis and WWII.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really an epic, epic, great film about a great man. The movie was shot in England during the war, and has a great storyline that ties together the different parts of the movie. It's a great action film with lots of good stunts, and the cast is very good. If you have seen the Christopher Nolan Batman Trilogy or the two parts of Man of Steel, then you have to watch this film. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the sound effects at the beginning and end of the film, they seem to be recorded from a different camera angle. I don't know why it isn't the same angle on all the sound, so I can't really complain too much.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was so good, I went back to watch it with my brother. It is a wonderful piece of art, made in 1945, a time when many people were sick of war and wanted to make a movie to show the world what it really was like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When we met back in May we agreed that it would take a while before we would be able to meet for a proper movie night. After all, we were at the last minute to make our first trip of the year and we both had other events scheduled. So, we agreed to meet at the movies together.  We were lucky enough to have the day off, but as always, we made the best of it.   We went to the movies with the intention of seeing The Matrix, but when we found out that it was already sold out, we went for the more "out of the ordinary" movies:  The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring   It was pretty quiet at first, but by the end of the movie it was pretty loud. I don't think I've ever had such a big laugh out loud! I really enjoyed the scenes where Frodo and Sam are fighting off the Nazgul.  It really gave me chills.  Another movie we watched was The Last King of Scotland, it was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  There was one scene where the king was fighting with another king's son. That scene made me laugh so hard I ended up crying in the movie theater.  The best part about The Lord is that it had two completely different movie stars in one role. One of them was an older man, the other a very pretty young girl. It was the most perfect casting I've seen.  They also cast James Coburn as an older guy and I couldn't believe it!  We ended up staying at the same hotel that the movie was filmed in, but unfortunately, the hotel was sold out as well.  So, my buddy and I ended the night at the mall and had a great time.  Even though we were too late to see the movie that night, I'll forever be grateful to my buddy for getting us the tickets!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie "Rent" was filmed in 1984 and was an adaptation of a novella by Joseph Conrad about a young German who finds himself with a baby on the run after a botched robbery. It was directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock (who also directed the earlier "Rebecca") and has some of his best writing and acting. In "Rental", a man (Richard Farnsworth) is hired as a courier for a mysterious "Company" who is transporting a mysterious cargo.   A bit like "Blade Runner" with a bit of "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy", this movie is a suspenseful thrill ride as the German is chased across the streets of London by a British cop who tries to convince him to turn himself in.  This is a real treat from Alfred Hitchcock. The "Ragtime" music from "Romeo and Juliet" gives the movie a very unique feel that I just love. Richard Farnsworth is the real star of this movie. He was very charismatic and really captured the movie. Farnsworth was perfect in "Rothko Chapel", "The Man Who Knew Too Much", and "North by Northwest".Â   This movie is so good I still find it entertaining to watch.  The film was shot in Italy and looks and sounds absolutely fantastic.  I love the scenes with Richard Farnsworthy as he tries to persuade the German to turn him in.Â  Â The film was also well shot and had excellent special effects.Â  Â  This is the movie that made Alfred Hitchcock a movie legend and is still great today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed watching the film in the theater. The acting was terrific. The characters were so well developed and believable. I liked how the whole film was shot in the old style of filming - no CGI and very low budget. I was glad the film was in black and white. I think it is very important to show the audience that the Civil War was not a good or even a just war.    The most interesting part of the film, IMHO, was the role of General Beauregard. A general who, during the war, was a very respected figure in the Army of the Potomac and the North.  He was very brave, loyal and very hard-working. He was a man of many talents, including being an excellent actor and horse-breeder.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An exciting, action packed and suspenseful tale, it takes place in the early 1960s when the Soviet Union launches a massive attack on the United States.   Â  In the course of their efforts to achieve that goal, the Soviet forces accidentally destroy a US spy plane, killing the US Navy Lt. Col. Jack L. McCall who was part of the CIA-supported operation to provide the Soviets with photographic intelligence about the American military. Â It seems to be a case of bad timing as the United Nations Secretary General, Nelson Rockefeller, dies from an exposure in a chemical gas attack.  In the aftermath, the CIA is forced to work with the Soviet and Chinese intelligence to get the facts to the US about the bombing.  The action-packed thriller takes a dramatic turn as a man with a heart condition, and a Russian wife are sent to the United Sates to cover the story.  Although they have to deal with various obstacles and cover-ups, they eventually succeed in exposing the Soviet attack. The film has a lot of great set pieces and suspense that is well choreographed.  One of my favorites was the scene where the men in military uniform are being driven to the scene of the attack. A closeup of their eyes as they are being shot with a gun.  An interesting commentary on the role of the US intelligence community in keeping things secret from the American people.  Very well acted by the three leads.

The special effects were great and I love that the guys are wearing black suits and hoods. I really liked the fact that the movie is about two kids who rob a bank. They are never really in the movie and when they are they do it as teenagers, not kids, so I loved that.

He gets down on one knee and says that he will get them out on one condition. He'll get a part in a movie called "The Fly" which is an adventure film. He is not given any part, but he gets to spend a day on set with the director and the two leads. He has a good time but the director is really unhappy about his performance.   This is a very pretty film. It is funny and entertaining. It also has a heart to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm in the process of getting my hands on the entire first season and have watched it four times already.   There are a few flaws in the first season but they're minor, in my opinion.  There were times, as with so many shows at the time, when things got rather bogged down, but it still kept up a good pace.  This season was pretty darn cool, especially the first few episodes that I saw.  At one point, there is a very cool-looking car chase scene.  The dialogue was good, with some great writing by John Schuck.  Some of the best stuff in this series was in the fourth episode "The Furies of Fate" which is where the whole "The Black Company" thing gets started.  While this is another example of a spy movie, it actually manages to have some real depth to it.  I really enjoyed this series and can't wait to see more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie over the course of 2 nights, and I can only describe it as a fun, lighthearted romantic comedy. The story is really interesting and the romance is great! There are moments of "ooh what a cute girl! I wish I had a cute girlfriend!" and moments of heart-wrenching despair.    The soundtrack is great, and the movie does a great job of setting up the two main characters and their romantic tension. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie because the director is the same guy that directed The Black Hole (1993). This movie is even better.   It's a great science fiction movie, with lots of thought put into it. The special effects are incredible!   The acting is good.  The special effect is awesome.  It has the same feel that you would get watching a "Star Wars" movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great movie. My boyfriend and I had to laugh our asses off. The film is a parody of the 80s and was amazing. Definitely worth the watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a good thriller. The plot is not new, but the characters are well drawn and the pace is quick. The best scene has to be when Michael Douglas and his girlfriend, Lisa Bonet, drive away from their new house after Michael tells her, "It doesn't happen to everybody."   I am sure some people will find this film too depressing, but for me it was a great suspense film that kept me riveted through the entire movie.   - Jean Tait - THE PREDATOR (1989) A small-town cop and his fiancÃ©e, Mary Lou, find themselves in the middle of a vicious feud between a vicious killer who seems intent on getting even with them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very well made and engaging movie. It is an interesting twist on the modern love story. It does not take itself too seriously and shows a very realistic portrait of a modern couple that comes together. I would say it is a more realistic take on the whole story than the romcom's that are popular these days.    See it in theaters:  This is a fun, funny and entertaining romcom. The actors are wonderful and they pull it off so well. It shows the ups and downs of a very real love affair. There is a lot of love and affection on both sides of the story.  For me it is one of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is actually really funny and has some really nice performances. I am not sure how it is that some films don't get made but this movie was actually very well made and it is very entertaining. There are many scenes that just will make you laugh hysterically.   I am really happy that there are more movies that have women in the lead. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has everything I love and more: a high production value, a very talented cast, beautiful locations, a compelling story, amazing dialogue, and an excellent cast of actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't usually like comedies with heavy horror elements, but the gore and the tension in this movie are really good.  It's not an original concept or anything, but it works very well.   Overall I really enjoy this movie, and I'm a fan of horror movies from the 70s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A well-told story about a young girl with a secret, a girl who comes to understand her own desires, a mystery that never ends and a story that ends in heartbreak. The movie's ending is as haunting as the girl's, and her voice over the end credits is a beautiful piece of film-making.   I watched this movie as a gift for a friend. It was perfect for me to watch again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is very unique. It does not have a clear-cut goal or main character but rather the focus is on some very unusual people who are in their early to mid-thirties, and there is a very clear conflict between the older people and the younger ones, who are trying to establish a new life and get a place in the world. The movie is very moving and is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm glad I saw this movie. It's a comedy, and I like comedy, so I liked it. I did notice that the characters don't seem very realistic. There were many characters in the movie that were either actors or actresses that I've never heard of and they made the characters look ridiculous. However, some of the best parts were the songs and I loved the song for their hilarious, yet realistic lines. If you like comedy or if you're a fan of songs and love to laugh, this movie is for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is an example of the old school noir style that is very much alive today.   I will admit that I did not know how to approach the whole story.  There is very little dialogue, and it doesn't make much sense. I knew from the start that it was a mystery, so I didn't try to figure it out.  I just found myself listening to the movie in my hotel room with my earphones in, trying to hear the sounds of the police searching for the murderer.  That said, I found the movie very entertaining, so if you are looking for a good mystery, this is it.  The actors play it all very convincingly and the story is excellent.  " It was a dark night.  He was lying in the dark.  As he lay there, he noticed someone moving in the shadows.  His heart pounding in his chest, he was determined to find out who was out there, for as he sat there, the man reached around to his belt, pulled out a.38, fired it, and shot him.  Then, as he dropped to the ground, the gunman walked away. "  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of "Sugarman", in which the film takes place is a classic.  The actors are well cast, and all the parts were played very well.  It is not a film that you will see too often, but it was a film I would like to see again.  I don't remember too much of the film, but what I do remember is that it had a good balance of emotion and comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really good movie. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction.   I had just watched Star Wars and was excited to see the first live action Star Trek. I was not disappointed.  The acting is excellent, the story is solid and the special effects are very well done.  You have to pay attention if you want to enjoy the movie.  There are a couple of minor problems that make the movie a little short and a little disappointing.  If you have seen the movie, you know what to expect.  This will appeal to fans of the original series as well as to people who have never seen the original show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie. I love it and think all the good parts are in the movie.   The special effects are wonderful. It's like an old school James Bond movie. The music is perfect and there are so many great action scenes.  It's a little hard to watch, but I'd definitely see it again.  Posted by Rob at 1:48 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My friend had some friends over and had been looking forward to seeing this movie, so I gave it a try. It's a very interesting and entertaining film. The actors are superb in this movie and I really enjoyed seeing them in the role. The best part is seeing them go through these great emotions and try to come up with the right answer to the question. I think that's what is fun about the story of how one man's memory starts to get corrupted.    I highly recommend this movie for those that like action and are looking for a good comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most beautiful and sad movies I've ever seen. The acting was outstanding, especially the two actors - Edmond O'Brien and Jack Warden.   And if you like the old-fashioned ghost stories like 'Haunt of the House on Haunted Hill' or 'A Christmas Carol', this is a nice time for you to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the better movies that's ever been made.   I never would have watched the movie in a theater (I had been a fan of the television show and would watch the show only from time to time) and I'm glad that I decided to go see it.  There are a lot of things to like about this movie.  Firstly, the acting is just amazing.  I love the fact that there is a lot more to the characters than they appear to be and you never know how things are going to go down.  Some people may find it boring (although that is a bad thing) but I always enjoyed watching the characters come to life.  You get the impression that they're all having great fun.  A lot of the jokes are funny and even though it's a comedy it's not overly vulgar and there are a few sex scenes that make it a bit racy but nothing that was really objectionable.  The writing is well written, funny and the acting in general is very good.  If you like comedy and good acting and a little bit of drama you will like this movie and I really hope that the TV show eventually gets a second season. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you want to see a funny, well written movie that will leave you feeling a bit blue and your nose wrinkled, go see The Muppet Movie. It has a great story and great acting. The Muppets, Kermit and Fozzie are great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the 1980's, I went to a movie with my family. It was an old time western/drama/sword and sandal movie. I must admit that I never really thought much about this film. All I remember is, "Wow, it's a really good old timey western".   The reason I never cared for this movie is that I didn't understand it, in the same way that I don't understand why anyone would like it.   However, when I saw the movie again a couple of years ago, I remembered it. I had forgotten it until then.  After reading a great review of this movie, I decided that it was worth a look.  It's really not bad, and I am glad I went back and watched it again.  As long as you don't get lost in a movie that is only about a hundred years old, it is great.  "All he had was the gun and the knife."   This is a great little film, and it doesn't take long to find out that there are many things that are better than guns and knives.  If you are a fan of Westerns, and especially Westerns in the "old time" style, this is definitely worth a watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great and I wish I would have seen it when it first came out, I loved the film.   I was never a huge science fiction movie fan, and I never had a problem with Star Trek. But this movie was awesome.  The effects were awesome. The special effects were impressive and made this movie an instant classic.  And the performances are so good.  I liked Gene Hackman as the villain, and Leonard Nimoy was so much fun as the android, Data.  So many great performances in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good sequel toÂ  The Godfather II.   It would have been nice to see more of Sonny Corleone in this one.   The story was also a lot better thanÂ  The Lord of the Rings. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a little weird seeing a movie that's supposed to be a comedy about a family of aliens in space in the genre of a sci-fi film, but it's great.  The story is quite funny and well executed.  There are many great special effects, especially the space suits that look fantastic.   I've already seen a lot of movies that have a space theme, but I had never seen one as entertaining as this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of my favourite movies, and I wish it would be made a trilogy. It is so original and thought out. I love how the actors all had distinct voices. The acting is fantastic and they are all playing very different characters. I really liked how they filmed this in a different style to the westerns.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The acting is great, the director really got his actors to break out of their roles, and the ending makes it all perfect!   This movie has a dark, creepy, and funny side that I absolutely loved! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fantastic, hilarious, heartwarming movie. It's not the kind of comedy you expect at all. I've always been a sucker for the kind where we're just having a good time. Well this movie has that in spades.   It's a bit slow at times and it has a very old school feel, but it's really fun to watch. It features great voice acting, great songs, and some great action. It had me laughing out loud and kept me going through the whole thing. It was well worth the time of a Saturday evening.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you hear a movie about a war with alien invaders, you might think you're in for something really intense. But you would be wrong. This movie is actually very peaceful. It has a wonderful and very different story.   I'm not sure why the movie is so short, since it is about 70 minutes long.  I can't give it more than 4.5 out of 5 stars.  This movie was so great that you'll want to watch it again and again.  The movie is set in the 1930s, and shows the history of how the Nazis used alien technology against the Allies during World War II.  It also shows the first humans on Mars.  Another movie that will give you a wonderful insight into the history.  A lot of people are complaining that this movie is too old, but I think that is just the reason it isn't as good as it could be.  But it is a beautiful movie, that you will enjoy.  If you are in for a really good movie, then watch this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie about a family's struggle to escape the city. It was quite a departure for me because I really had been looking for a movie like this and didn't get to see one.   It was well done with great acting and beautiful cinematography. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like to watch this classic film at least once in a while. It has some great songs.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is a nice change from the last few movies in the franchise. There's a lot more attention to detail in this movie compared to the previous ones.   This movie is based on an earlier script by director John Milius but the new screenplay is much more fun and imaginative.  This is a good sequel to one of my favorite movies from the 80's, The Long Kiss Goodnight, which I gave a B+.   If you like this movie and have seen it, please do yourself a favor and see The Long, Long, Happy Life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is definitely worth it. I love all kinds of movies but I really like movies that are a little edgy, dark and scary. I'm a big fan of the horror genre, so I definitely liked this movie. I especially liked the scary music as well as the characters.    It's a great movie, and you should totally check it out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is great. The story is interesting. The action scenes are intense and violent. The plot is interesting and the acting is good.

It has a wonderful, eerie atmosphere and has some wonderful images. The performances were good and the acting was good. I'd recommend this to anyone and everyone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a pretty decent movie. I was actually a bit afraid when I was watching it for the first time. I had been taught that a monster movie meant you didn't have to be scary but there was something very off about this film. I couldn't really put my finger on it. It is a very subtle film and I think that's why people liked it so much. It didn't feel like it was trying to shock you. It seemed a little more like a natural horror film.   It really feels like it has a bit of a weird charm about it. I really think you should see this movie, especially if you like a good old fashioned monster movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very entertaining. I like to watch comedies and this movie does not disappoint. The acting is good and the jokes work and the story is well told.    The movie was good in my opinion, but I have some issues with how they shot it.  The opening scene with the car with the license plate of the movie is filmed very quickly and the cars in the background do not seem to be moving.  I believe this is one of those times where it should have been shot at more than one speed to keep up with the action.  After about ten seconds of the first car in the scene, it jumps around and does not look right, then it seems like it jumps off camera and back onto the same location.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love that I saw this as a kid. My parents used to always put it on for me, and it was always a good show, but I never really watched it with other kids because the language was too crude. The show started off pretty tame, but then, over the course of several weeks, it got wilder and more violent. It never got really bad, but there were plenty of times where it seemed like the action just wasn't going to stop.   In the end, I think the violence was pretty tame compared to what we've seen in a lot of cartoons, but still, it's hard not to be at least a little bit uneasy by the whole concept.  If you want to watch it, you really should watch the whole thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie it was on VHS, and I was skeptical. I wasn't sure if I could get a good laugh out of it, but I went in with no expectations. I was surprised and glad that I did! The movie is very funny and made me smile more than I normally do. It was a different feel than anything I had seen before, and definitely made me want to watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A true classic and a favorite of mine.   It is like a dream come true to be a part of such a unique movie.  It was one of my first "star" roles in a movie, and I had a great time playing the part of "Joe."   I loved being able to play a character that had an edge.  Even though he was somewhat of a "loner," Joe still had this edge about him that makes him dangerous.  And that is what makes this film so scary.  The way the character was portrayed was so perfect.  I thought the film was so great, and it has this feel to it that is perfect for a film like this.  If you haven't seen this movie, you should. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic, an icon, a movie that every film lover must see at least once. A masterful master.   If you have ever seen the movie, you already have a favorite movie and will love it.  And if you never saw it, you really must watch this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is excellent and the acting is very good.  The cinematography and editing are also excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of horror movies and thought I'd always avoid them as they tend to get boring. So I thought I would give this one a go. I was really surprised. The acting was great and I thought the gore scenes were great. I like the setting of the movie a lot. It was very creepy and I liked that it took place in a hospital. I thought it was a good addition to the genre.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this in the theater and it was pretty good. Very scary and thought provoking, it really did scare me as I thought it would. I felt for the kids, because their parents are so far gone in their condition and the kids have to stand there while their parents scream.    There is a very disturbing scene at the end. The children go into the woods and are chased by a man dressed in white. The girl, dressed in pink and with long blonde hair, says to the children, "There are people in the woods with guns and knives and they are killing them." I'm not sure what to make of that, but that's not the point of the movie. It's all about the kids. The director was great, but the script was too long and was written for the big screen, not the small screen. It would have been great to have a 2-hour movie, but I was really disappointed by this one.

The dog is being mistreated by some people and is in real pain.  A boy who loves the dog comes into town and saves the dog.  He goes back home with the dog and learns a lot about dog training.  It shows how a family can be together even when they are different.  I really like the story line and it is very entertaining.

This movie was absolutely disgusting, and made me squirm like a 5 year old.  It's definitely not for everyone.  I would never have given this movie a try if I wasn't a huge fan of horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I saw the movie, I wasn't even going to see it. I watched the trailer. The first thing I noticed was that the title was really odd. In addition, the trailer didn't even show that much of the movie. I just figured that it was going to be another "prestige" action movie. That was, until I was sitting in my car watching the movie and suddenly I heard the music, and it was a slow, melancholy song. And then I noticed that a car with some other guys was driving up in the trailer and they were all smiling and talking. Then they just rolled down the window and they all burst out laughing. It just didn't make sense. I thought "what's so funny?" Then I heard that the guy playing the lead was very funny, and that he just loved the movie too. And it was actually really creepy at times, so it all became clear to me why they kept the trailer on the front of the film. I never thought I'd see the movie again, but I watched it and it's very strange and funny.   Posted by mike at 12:17 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot was a little slow, but the action and acting was great. You will never hear about this movie in the history books.   The movie starts with an old man in a wheelchair talking with his son. They are both talking about the future and the way things were in the beginning of the 20th Century, but things are not as they seem.Â  A strange storm appears in the sky and starts destroying the area around the old man. They go outside and see the destruction and see how little they have left.Â  Â  This is the film version of "The Great Storm", which was a popular book written by H.G. Wells in 1916,Â  and is the sequel to "The Time Machine".  Â This was filmed in 1919 and stars the great Buster Keaton as the old, wise and crazy professor. Keaton is such a genius actor that it is a shame that he was not able to do more acting during his lifetime, although I think he would have become even more famous if he had kept playing this type of roles. Â  The movie was well made and even if it isn't much of a classic film, it is certainly entertaining.  Â  I would highly recommend this movie for people who love the science fiction genre and who love to watch a classic Keaton film.Â    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this on my computer when it was first released. It is really hard to find on DVD, so I bought it here. The movie is well made and you will feel like you are in a movie. The whole thing has a very dark and mysterious undertone. The actors are great, the scenery and setting are very nice and creepy. I was very scared throughout, but still enjoy it when the film is done right.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really wanted to like this film. I've never heard of the person who directed it, but I've read a couple of reviews and I thought they were quite good. This film is an interesting and well-made film. It doesn't make you wonder "what the heck was that guy smoking in the background of that picture?" It has a clear story, and it has a definite style and a little humor, so it's definitely something to watch for those who don't watch many movies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title of this film is not in question. The premise is absolutely fantastic. A group of people try to solve a mystery in a post-apocalyptic environment, and they do not succeed. There are many moments where the audience sees how people in that situation must come up with their own ideas to solve this problem. As far as story is concerned, this is a great one. Some great performances from a lot of people.   It is one of the most important movies to come out in the last couple of years. The action, characters, and themes that the movie has are so brilliant that the film becomes more than just a film.  The fact that this movie has the potential to change the entire genre is a real testament to how good this movie is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this film, I went to see the first scene that was shown, but my dad got so upset when he saw me watching it that he got really mad at me. I know he had no interest in seeing it in the first place. I am glad that he was upset about it, because I know it is a very funny movie.   This movie was pretty great. It had a great story and a great sense of humor.  A very well done movie with great scenes.

I think the real shark was a great addition. I don't know why it was only released as an 85 minute film.    This movie should be required viewing.  The acting is so real and believable!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I was so excited to watch this movie because my parents have been watching it all through high school and it was their favorite movie growing up. When they found out about the new trailer and I saw that it was about a girl who was in a coma and woke up in a room full of strangers, they couldn't take it, but I finally understood why. I'm sure everyone else did too. If you liked "Hook" or "Dynasty," you will love this. If not, then it's still pretty good."

The only thing I can complain about is that there are many scenes in the movie that go on too long, but that's not a problem because there is really nothing else to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a must see film, but only if you really want to see how the film industry works, and how Hollywood gets its movies made.   I think this film is a fascinating and important look at the movie industry, and a good film to get in your own collection.  I'm glad the producer was able to get an audience together, and really entertain them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Â  The one I remember most from when I was young was a little thing calledÂ  The Pink Panther. Â  The Pink Prince was about a prince who was so taken by his love for a woman called the Pink Princess that he has to marry her before he is able to save his kingdom. Â  As we all know, the Pink Prince never got married and it is only in his later years that he finds out that his beautiful wife has died in a car accident. Â  I must admit, the story was pretty much what you would expect it to be. Â  The princes was just so nice and funny and the Pink Princes pretty much looked like the Prince was a cartoon. Â  It was a simple story and I think that it was one of those kids that really grew up when I watched it. Â  But I am so glad that it has been made into a movie. Â   Â If you have never seen a Pink Panther, this will be a great movie.   I love the Pink Panther and I know many other people do too.  My favorite part about the movie was the two Pink Princesses. Â  They were so much like each other.  The Princesses at the movie theater I would love to watch it with my friends!   Pants with a Pink Prince and his beautiful bride.  The two princesses could play all of the Pink songs and even some of the Prince's songs.  They were both really cute and they played along with the Prince really well.  I will never forget my childhood and it was such a pleasure to watch this movie with my friend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie at the local multiplex in a town called Alameda California. A friend and I were both very impressed with the movie. The movie did an excellent job of capturing the old west. As the story progressed we saw the bad guys (the Indians) get stronger, more brutal, and more dangerous. The good guys never had much luck.   The best part about the movie was the amazing acting. You can tell these actors were doing it for the money and they do an excellent, if over the top job of playing the part.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves the west. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is set in the late 80's during the heyday of the punk rock movement in LA. We follow our two lead characters as they go to a punk concert on Hollywood Blvd and the band are performing the song "It's Not Over" in the middle of the street. A passerby, who's walking his dog runs in and tries to stop the band. This causes the crowd to come alive and a riot starts. The scene in itself is very funny and I have never seen it performed. It takes place at night with a lot of reds, whites, and blue. The riot has just ended when a woman walks in with her infant son. She runs to a safe room and cries out that the kids are killed. The baby boy is covered in blood, but he is still alive. As the movie goes on the baby boy gets up and asks if the people that were in the riot were his mother and father. When the boy goes on to ask if he is alive or dead, he suddenly disappears and a figure is seen in the shadows behind the wall of the safe room. We see that the figure is the father and that the baby is still in the safe area. The camera then takes us back to the riots and the scene of the man in the white suit and the woman in the blue and red dress. It is shown that the man is holding the baby in the hand of the woman. The woman tells the man to take the baby and run and he does as he is told. The boy starts crying and we hear the screams of the people as the riot continues. This is a very disturbing movie and I must say that I enjoyed it a lot. I recommend it for fans of the film "Laserbeak" and "Cabin In The Woods".
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very interesting and thought provoking film.   It makes you think about the effects of "drugs" on humanity in general and the human body and the physical changes that occur in it.  It explores the effects and uses the human mind as a tool for a deeper insight on the world around us.  This is a great film to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't think I've ever seen a movie with more original, clever and fun concepts and set-pieces than 'The Martian'. It was a fun, engaging, and a very entertaining experience, and was probably the best film I saw at this year's Sundance Film Festival.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was good for what it was. A lot of people complained that this was not as good as the first one. I never really cared for the characters in this one and I would only watch this if you had seen the first.   This movie was great.  It had action and was awesome. It was the best movie I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen a lot of good movies on the big screen and it's rare that one gets my attention and gets me pumped to go see more movies.   The story is good and the cast does a great job.  I'm a fan of the films of James Bond and I was very interested in seeing how the man behind the famous suits would fit in to the film.  My only reservation was I didn't think there was enough to keep me excited through the first act and it would have been nice to see Bond go on a more wild adventure after meeting Vesper Lynd.  It took about two weeks to get a rental because the theater was out of the big titles and the one rental I got was the last one.  The sound and music are good and some of the sequences were very well shot.  Overall a very good movie and a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot. It has so much heart and humor. It is not a realistic or dramatic movie, but it does have a good balance. I loved the lead character. I think he was a bit different than most, even though his life did not seem normal at all. His sister is in the military with him, but she is not very nice about it, and she keeps things from him, so that he does not have to be told the hard truths, and he does tell them anyway. She is not all bad. I thought it was very important to show a soldier's relationship with his sister. The movie makes you think about what it would be like for someone else to be a soldier.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this on TV at my local big box store and bought it to share with my husband. My husband and I have been a big fan of the show for the past 25 years. The movie was really good. I am not an expert on the show but I enjoyed it very much and it was just a funny movie. If you want to see something different than the rest of the television shows or movies, then give this a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've always loved watching movies from old Hollywood. I guess that's why I love the classic movies. It just so happens that I was at the right time of my life to get into seeing a film like "The Jazz Singer", but that wasn't even what drew me in, it was how beautiful the film was. The music was beautiful and the performances were well done. I don't think you'll ever see another movie like this.   This film will bring back memories of a time when there was so much more to the world.

The whole cast is great, especially the two younger ones, Kevin Connolly as Charlie and David Carradine as Mr. O'Toole.  It is a lot of fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The acting is the best you will find in a Western. In fact, it is so good that I felt that I was watching a western that was taken to a higher level.   From the opening scene, the actors, from the leading man on down, all add to the story, and the character development.  The characters are well developed.  From a young boy to the grizzled old man who is protecting him from the Indians, they all add in their own personal touches.  I loved how the Indians were portrayed, and I loved the acting of the Native American, who gave the role the life it deserved.  With all the action that takes place in this movie, it never gets boring.  All the actors give their all to the part, and they deliver.  Also, the editing, in order to keep the action moving at a quick pace, is not perfect, but it is a very good addition to the movie, and it did not interfere with the film at all.  If you like Westerns, then you have to see this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie about 15 years ago at a drive-in. It was the day it opened in the big theater. I remember watching it with a guy I worked with in college who was just so excited about seeing it. I love how it just brings that feeling of "oh, yeah, that movie, that is what I want to do!" To this day, I still look at it and smile.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the movie The Good, The Bad, The Ugly (1931), directed by Vincente Minnelli and starring James Cagney and Katharine Hepburn. The main character of this story is a character named Tony "Hollywood" Hushpuppy, who is a singer who is traveling across the country and making money by singing and dancing. He gets a part in a film in Chicago and goes on the road as the film progresses, but he loses the lead part to a very attractive woman who has already been in the movies before. When he returns to Hollywood he's still making money but he's getting ready to leave for good and doesn't have the heart to let it go. The film is extremely long and there's a lot of stuff going on, but the acting is great. It's a romantic comedy with a lot to love about the characters. There are some great performances as well, from the great Katharine and James to the not so great ones like the other singer, John Barrymore. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never liked the movie, but for some reason I kept watching it and I found a movie that I am really interested in watching now.   This movie is a real eye opener and the acting is great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to believe it's been 11 years since this movie came out. The first time I saw it was on a cable TV channel in the early 2000s and I loved the look and feel of it. It's very unique, very fun and very memorable. There are so many people I have no recollection of ever seeing this movie, so I'm sure you'll get many more people who've seen it over the years and who will appreciate it all over again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has many great scenes that can be used to make a very long movie very long, and has a great script that really made this one a joy to watch.   My wife and I watched this movie at her parents' house and I think that the best thing about this movie was watching it at my parents' place.  It's a story of a young girl named "Alyssa" who lives with her father, and they run an orphanage in Africa.  Alyssa is very smart and is very funny.  And she has a very nice sense of humor and the characters in this movie made me laugh a lot.  But the most important part about this story was when her father told her that he was going to go out and try and find her, and when he comes back he tells her that she's very special and that he wants her to come and live with him in his new apartment.  This is a great movie and I recommend it highly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best thing about this movie is that, in contrast to other zombie movies in the recent years, this is all about the characters.   A group of survivors who find themselves trapped on a sinking ship.  And it is an amazing set piece.  The characters are so well portrayed that it is impossible not to be touched.  There is such depth to the characters that it's hard to get over it.  I really can't explain it except to say that it truly was a movie to remember.

There is a certain aura that radiates out the screen like magic from this film. From the visuals to the sound to the performances to the themes it has everything it needs to be amazing. I have never seen such an incredible film and I am so excited to see what the producers will do with it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really looking forward to this film. I knew the whole cast from the TV show and thought I would get to see a great performance in this film and some of the best acting ever, especially from Michael Caine, and to top it all off, this film was directed by Sidney Lumet, who made some of my favorite films, including The Godfather. This film was so good that I still have to wonder if I made a terrible choice in seeing it.   A nice romantic comedy about a young woman who works as a secretary in an apartment building, while the man who is living in the building comes home every night with his lover.

The acting is also fantastic, and the story line is so gripping that you don't want to miss it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of those movies that every one of us at some time had in our "collection." I love it and it's a great movie to watch and a great lesson in how to be a man.   A movie about the man who has a good heart, but a bad attitude. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie before it was released in the theatre, and I loved it!   I didn't enjoy the first two or three acts of the movie, but then I caught on to the plot. It's set up really well, so that after the first twenty minutes or so, it's easy to follow. The plot is fantastic, and it seems like everything is leading up to a big action scene that is going to happen and it just keeps getting better and better!  The acting in this movie is great, and everyone does their jobs so well. It isn't the first time I have seen someone give a great performance in a film, but it really is worth watching.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film starts off with a lot of blood but the gore in this film does not look like that of the typical slasher film and this film also has an interesting plot. The film shows the main characters are friends and they meet the killer at a lake. The killer gets a hold of their boat and drags them to the water. While the two friends are struggling to make their boat float on water, they see an unidentified man walking along the water wearing black and red shoes. When the killer runs over them, one of the friends stabs him with the knife. The second friend holds the knife while the other stabs the killer. The victim dies on the floor while the two boys leave the scene. The next day, the friend who stabs and strangles the killer is confronted by the police who are investigating the murder. The friend tells them the killer was in the lake and they didn't hear anything. The cops tell him that they will catch the killer soon. While he is trying to help the police, he is also trying to find out if his friend actually killed the killer or if he is guilty.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Somewhere between The Shining and The Silence of the Lambs, but with better characters, and much more violence.   The main character is a cop trying to arrest a serial killer, and the film follows his investigations as he tries to piece together what he can about this killer.  " S   You can't go wrong with this one.  A good story about a cop looking for answers, and he is very entertaining in it.  I have seen this film several times now, and it has never failed to leave me wanting more.  It is a very different take on this killer, one that goes deeper into his character, rather than the easy and obvious one.. "   I am not an expert on the movie, and you will need to check it out to see for yourself, but it is definitely worth it. I am a HUGE Kubrick fan, and this is a great movie.  If you don't know about The Shining, this is an awesome way to see it. "

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I saw this film I laughed my head off at the fact that these two were having such a great time together. I think the two are best friends in every way. They are both funny, smart, kind and all around fun. They always look as though they are having a great day in the sun (and even though you think they are they never seem to get bored with each other) and this film proves that every day of their lives are fun and entertaining.   I loved how they never let their fun go to their heads and they kept looking into each other's eyes (or at least I did).    When their friends finally show up at the end of the film it was fun seeing these two together again and I was very happy to see that they still have it together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a huge horror movie fan (I don't even know if I'd consider myself a fan of horror), but I've watched a couple of these and this movie was a little more well put together than the other two I've seen. This movie does what a horror movie should do: scare the shit out of you. It starts out as a straight up horror movie but I don't think there's a single "trashy" part. In fact, some of the more realistic things they show happen in this movie as they should. And, that is something I'm always happy to see.   The acting was pretty good, especially the actors who are supposed to be dead. I think they all did a good job, especially Tom Cruise, who I think has a lot more to do with this movie than I'd think he does.  And, the gore scenes were all well done. I was not shocked by anything in this flick. It scared me a little but I wasn't expecting any of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film was a treat to watch. It was a very dark, dramatic and intriguing film that had me intrigued. It had me asking a lot of questions about the characters and what was going on in their mind. The performances were fantastic. They made the character of the serial killer look almost like a character in a mystery novel. If you want something that has all the twists and turns it has, this is for you.   I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies that are dark and intense. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not a big fan of horror movies. I guess my friends are all into it, so this made them laugh. I'll never see another movie by this director, though.   It was a fun horror movie, not scary or bad. It was funny at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is just great. It's one of those movies where you can relate to just about anyone, because they're all in a tough situation in one way or another. Some are better off than others and the story takes you through it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never heard of the movie "The Wizard of Oz" until I was about 8 years old, and when I finally saw the movie it blew my mind.   This movie is worth a re watch for just for the fact that Dorothy, Toto, and the Scarecrow are all great and the ending was just amazing.  My favorite song of the film was "Don't Be Afraid to Dream."  I saw this on a TV movie marathon at my high school (not my best film, but it's a great movie and the soundtrack is great, I think).  I really think that people should watch this movie over and over again, it's so great and I love seeing it in the theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen many films with vampires but I have to give this one 10 out of 10. It's not your usual vampire movie, instead it has a very original and interesting plot, and is very entertaining. This is an action-packed vampire story.   It is well-shot and is enjoyable to watch. The acting is very good, and the vampire looks amazing.  The only bad thing is that it feels a little bit like a rip-off of the TV series (which is a shame because it is quite good) but that is just one of those things.  I highly recommend it to all the fans of the show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, and I am a fan of both the movies that are based on the original story and of the later versions of the same stories.

It has an epic feel, and the music and the special effects work very well in the story.

The acting was spot on, the plot was well thought out and I really enjoyed the gore, which was done with enough flair to keep things interesting. This film has a great cast, and if you haven't seen this one yet, I highly recommend it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't really like this one at first, it was the same "thing" all the time.   As the movie progressed I got more and more into it and started to get into the atmosphere the movie was trying to create.  I love it when a movie goes out of its way to show you it has an evil and dark underbelly.  This movie gives a pretty interesting look at that.  When you get into it, you will find a film that is very fun to watch and I hope you find yourself watching this one quite often.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My first movie was The Last Man on Earth. I never knew a director had that much respect for a film. So I was thrilled that he had the same respect for me. I had seen a lot of his other films, but this one was a total surprise. I loved it! A fantastic mix of horror, comedy, action and romance. A great ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you think about it, the most realistic thing about the movie is that the people in the picture aren't the main characters.   They don't even look like people.  If you think that the movie doesn't take you inside that environment, you're wrong.  The people are the point of view, and the movie explores the relationships, and how those relationships develop.  This is just another example of a movie that focuses on the relationships and life inside the film, rather than focusing on the action.  I would recommend this movie for anyone that wants to be in a film that does that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the premise and am very interested in seeing this movie.  This is a very well made and well directed movie. I've watched a lot of movies, but this one stands out from the rest. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on TV and loved it.  I have to confess, I had never seen the movie.  It was great, as I said in my other review.   This movie is one of my favorite "Star Wars" movies.  The scenes are so exciting and intense.  You are in a world of terror.  This film was not made for the "Star WARS" fandom.  But, it is a very fun movie to watch.  George Lucas has made his mark.  There is no way this film could have been made without George Lucas.  That is a fact.  One thing I can say about this film, is that it was made by someone who was a professional who loved movies and wanted to give fans what they want.  To be honest, I thought the film was the best of the "Jedi" movies (except for "Star Tours").  And, as an action-packed movie it was great to watch, although I am sure there is a lot of that to come in the "prequels".   In conclusion, this is a must see for "the fans". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent movie and it is funny and very well made. It is good entertainment and it will make you laugh out loud.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great. It's hard to say why we love it so much. It could be because of the great acting, but also the fact that they really knew what to do with the script. It also has the best ending to a movie ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen this movie more times than I can count and have always loved it. It's the first one I saw in 3D, the 3D wasn't really noticeable. It was one of those movies where you can really feel the tension, it's a great thriller with a well-made and very unique plot. The 3D really brings out the effects, and I can't imagine how they'd do it without 3D.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It has all the charm of a good film but doesn't try to be anything but a film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film has an outstanding script. It was shot in such a way that the action is always moving. The action is fast and furious. It's got that old school '70s sense of excitement. The cast is great. They are all wonderful and funny. The film itself is great as well. It is full of great dialogue and there are some fantastic performances from all of the leads. There's also a great supporting cast with Paul Winfield, Robert Patrick, Robert Shaw and Christopher Lloyd.   A must have for any fan of action movies, a must watch for any fans of the old '70's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have not seen the original, but it was a great movie. I don't remember who played the character but that's why I'm going with the movie.    It has everything, good action, great acting, great plots. The only thing I'm not sure on is who was in it or who was supposed to be in it.  I'm pretty sure they did the right thing by giving the actor an honorable death. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never seen any other version of the movie, except the one I watched in the 80's, and I'm glad to have it on the shelves of my library.  The acting is fantastic, and the story is a classic.  This is a film to watch with the kids, or with the adults, because it is an entertaining adventure.  If you want a good story, this is the one.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie's good, but there are things wrong about it. I am not sure who the Director was, but he/she should not have cast him/her. He/she had to take out all the best actors. All the best acting actors are in this movie, and they do not deserve to be taken out, I hate to say it. It was just a "dip and dunk" movie. A good movie is better than that, not an average one.   I recommend this movie to any one who liked "Ace Ventura". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found this movie to be well shot. The actor who plays the lead character is so believable and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast. If you like a good action movie you will find this one to be a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at the same time as The Exorcist, and I'm glad I did!   The story revolves around a couple who go on a road trip after their house burns down, and it has an all-out "scream" to it that's not for the squeamish!  The acting in this film is just about perfect.  The whole cast and crew put a lot of effort into this film, and they don't just do this to look "cool" or to make a quick buck, but they give it their all.   This film is not for kids, and no one should make this a "tween flick."   My only criticism is that the ending is a bit contrived and unnatural.  I would've preferred if the two teenagers in the car were able to live their lives after the accident, and the parents decided to leave town, as the film ends with them taking a walk and talking.

I am glad that I came to this movie, as I was really looking forward to watching it.  The acting was good, the acting was great.  There is no other way to describe it than this movie was amazing.  This movie is so great that I watched it on the plane on my way to see a friend.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is my favourite movie   And it's a good one at that    I loved this movie and have been watching it a lot lately   My favourite movie by Peter Jackson   Â    A great movie  The first thing that you need to know about the Lord of the Rings trilogy is that the first two movies were directed by Peter Johnson. This was not because the films themselves were bad, but more than likely because Peter Johnson was on board as director of this one before he was even hired to direct the other two movies. Johnson's first film, Return of the King was not so great and the third film didn't fare any better. But now here we are at the final installment, and Lord of The Rings is a very good film. This film takes place after The Fellowship of the Ring, and we find that the Fellowship has disbanded, which I think is pretty great because it really makes the Fellowship that much more believable. The characters are still the same, but now they are all in different roles. The film also really does a great job of developing the relationships between all the characters, and makes the characters feel more rounded. I loved all of the scenes that take place in the Shire, and they really make it a real destination for Bilbo and Gollum. The only thing that I wish they had done was change the scene in which Frodo gets his ring back into one that takes place earlier in the story. They also should have changed the ending, but this is the film, and I'm not going to complain.   One thing that really got me was the fact that they did a lot of research on Middle Earth for this film. They really studied everything that was out there and made sure that the creatures and locations were authentic to the time period. They even added Easter eggs for the movie fans out there.  So now we're down to the end of the story, and Bilbo has gotten his ring, but there's still one more step to go. This is a great sequence and one of the best scenes in any movie ever.  I don't even want to spoil it, so I'll just give you the synopsis: Bilbo, Gandalf, Radagast, and the Company of Dwarves go up to Rivendell. There they meet with Elrond. The conversation goes like this: Bilin says that he has decided to try and get back into the good graces of his father

I didn't see any of the sequels, but I think they would have been great.  My favorite scenes are the ones where they go to the hotel where the crime happened. It was very hot there, so they wore masks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this as part of the Hollywood Backlot Tour last week. This film is not for everyone, but if you are into old, low budget movies, you should definitely try it. The acting in the film is amazing. I had never seen anyone so believable as Charles Laughton. This isn't a Hollywood movie, but it is a true story and worth seeing for the actors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a film I have heard of, but I didn't know if the studio would actually release it.  It was released on video by the U.S. version of the film.   The film is an interesting documentary about the life and times of Elvis Presley.  This film has a nice look to it. The cinematography and sound effects are amazing.  The cast are all great. They all do a good job.  Elvis and his team were very successful at building up the image of Presley and his movie.  You will learn a lot about Presley, his friends and his life in Memphis.  My only complaint about the movie is that it has a few too many flashbacks.  A few too few flashbacks would have made the movie more interesting.  If you have never seen Elvis Presleys movie, then this is a must see.  I hope they release this on DVD, so we can watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so glad that I finally saw this movie. It's the movie that made me go see all the old classics.  It was such a strange movie that I never realized how it was supposed to have a meaning. The movie is about a woman who takes off to Europe for a year with her boyfriend. She is an American woman who has never been abroad and is worried about her health and safety. I've been trying to figure out who this character is and why she was in Europe. It seemed to be a dream for her to travel and travel and have a new experience. When she comes back, she is still a little nervous. Her boyfriend thinks that she has gotten over Europe and that she is back to being the girl that he fell for. In the movie, she does take a vacation in Paris for a while. Â I remember reading the Wikipedia description of this movie and having no idea why I was watching it. It seems like a strange film that is really about the relationship between a woman and her boyfriend who she never met before. The film was so unique and I think it's the kind of movie that could have become successful if it was put into production more years ago. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the movie starts the first time you know this will be good, but then a great director pulls out all of the stops, and does a marvelous job of telling this story in an extremely satisfying manner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie, and I hope you do too.   This is one of the most interesting movies of the year and one of our best.  It is an amazingly good movie about the "American Dream" in general and about how we need to think about money and what we really want to do with our lives.  If you like movies with interesting characters, interesting plots, and interesting stories, you will love this movie.  I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.  The cast is superb.  John Travolta is great as the "dreamer" and this movie is an amazing portrayal of this man's life.  Richard Gere is a great choice to play the "mascot of American prosperity".  You should see this movie and then make up your own mind about John T. Williams.  A must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "One of the best "action" movies ever made."    Â  In a time of excess and violence, The Green Berets was a rare, good example of action movies that weren't just for bums on the street.   In fact, in a time when action movies like Rambo, The Terminator, etc were all the rage, Green Beretes offered the perfect mix of old school action movie charm and the sort of gritty realism that makes today's action movies feel dated.  After a young Army man, Jack Slater (Bruce Campbell) is wounded and left for dead in Afghanistan, he's nursed back to health by an old Army friend who has a secret identity as a super soldier.  Jack is then sent on a rescue mission and, on a mission to save his sister from the ruthless Afghani militia leader, the leader has placed a hit on Jack's brother, John (Lance Henriksen).  Luckily, John has a way to contact the American Embassy and is able to send Jack on a back-up mission, where he finds himself in Afghanistan once again.  With some help from his old buddy and a few CIA-trained Afghans, Jack is able once again to rescue his brother from death.  This movie has the perfect blend of action, romance, intrigue, humor, and a very realistic, yet still gritty look at war.  Unfortunately, it also suffers from the same problems that are common to other "action films" of the era.  One of the problems with most action movies of the '70s was that they tended to focus on a specific character or area of the country with little in the way of context, especially if the film wasn't from the era of the original Vietnam War.  It's this type of approach that makes The Green Beret's story a little difficult to follow.  Even if you're willing to suspend disbelief for an era where movies were shot on 35mm, it's just not easy.  The movie doesn't really make that much sense for an action movie from the early '70's.  That's also a problem with many action movies from the time of that era. Â  Another issue with the movie is that the acting is rather lackluster.  Many of the characters feel somewhat "stunned" at the start, as if they're still used as props.  Perhaps this was done to make the film more "realistic" but it's a weak way to go
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a beautiful film! I think I'll watch it again and again.   "The Last Battle" is another excellent film. It tells the story of the battles at Verdun and Passchendaele in 1916. It is well made and contains very little dialogue.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is just awesome, as a kid I wanted to be a super hero so bad that my parents would take away my powers. Now, I look back and think that was a really stupid thing to do because I love comics and I've read so many amazing comic books. This movie was a great way to get me into comics, and when I was 12 it changed my life. I'd always wanted to try doing comics as a career, and this movie was the best example of how I should do that, but in a real story line.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is really good, with a great plot and great performances.Â    "The Thing From Another World" is a movie about a scientist who goes to the Antarctic to study something he has never seen before.Â  As a result, he is attacked by strange creatures, and is saved by a group of American soldiers who are searching for an abandoned ship.Â  The two groups meet again, and the scientists help the soldiers in their mission.  Â   The best thing about this movie is the way that it shows the human characters as humans.Â  They are scared, but not in a "you're a freak" way.Â  Instead, the two groups have to work together.Â  This movie works better because it is very short (about three hours) so there isn't any long sequences.Â  Also, the characters are very interesting.Â  Their feelings and actions are interesting because they have to do a lot of different things.Â  Finally, this movie works because it has a lot to say about the dangers of going into Antarctica.Â  If the film had not been made, it would be the greatest movie about Antarctica that I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never heard of this film until I saw the trailer for it in a theater and I instantly fell in love with it. I've seen it several times and I always look forward to seeing it because I enjoy sci-fi movies.   The film takes place about 1000 years after the last human being died out from the plague. A colony on an alien planet called Earth has just moved from Earth and they have built a settlement. It is a long way from Earth so the colonists have brought all the technology they can from Earth.  A scientist named Doctor Morley is the only person still alive on the planet. He is an old man but his science is very modern. His daughter, Alice, has a special connection to the colony but she doesn't want her parents to be separated. Â I love the film because it is filled with surprises. I loved the twist that Dr. Morley has become an alien and his connection to Alice and her father. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â "Dirty Harry" is a classic film that is an interesting piece of film-noir history, it is full of memorable scenes and dialog.    It is a story of how a great actor (Harvey Keitel) falls under the spell of a bad boy (Steve McQueen) who just wanted to prove that he could handle a gun.  The movie was made before there was a "street" in Hollywood, when a wealthy couple had one or two henchmen with whom they could keep an eye on their servants, or their girlfriends.  If you don't remember "Dirty" then you haven't seen enough movies!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â I found this movie very interesting. Â It's about a young man named Nicky who works as a DJ in a club.  One day Nicky gets into an argument with a bouncer over a parking spot.  Nicky is told that the bouncer doesn't want to get into a fight because he is black.   At the next club Nicky notices that this same bouncer is getting into fights all the time.  The next night Nicky sees the bouncers again and they get into an altercation over a piece of parking space that is worth more than Nicky's share of the money Nicky has to pay the bounciers for their fights.  So Nicky becomes very interested in the bouncier's fights because he knows that they are very violent.  Once again the main character is in a gang called the Black Disciples.  They fight constantly for the parking space and to keep it in their club.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not only awesome to watch but it is the best movie that i've seen with the character of the evil doctor.   The actor is perfect and he is just great to watch.  This guy is just crazy and it's amazing how he will just go crazy all the time even if he is doing all those weird things to people and animals.  His character is so intense that you have to see it twice to believe it.  It's great to see how he is so scary to his patients and even people around him.  The evil doctor also has a great performance too.  If you want a good horror movie that has some gore and blood, this is the one.  I really recommend this movie and if you want an awesome scary movie, I would suggest watching this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of "pops" in this film, and they are well presented. As with many of the other films of this genre, the acting is fairly decent, with John Cleese and Eric Idle (who has a nice turn as the doctor) doing their usual, though they give the film quite a bit of extra life as a result. I always enjoy the more eccentric aspects of such films, and "The Love Guru" is full of them.   For the record, I really didn't think the film was a bad film. It did have some fun aspects, and I thought it did a great job of giving an inside look at a cult which was a lot more interesting than I gave it credit for. I'm not going to go so far as to say it's "great", but it does work as a good comedy and as a fairly well-made drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie a lot.Â  If you've been paying attention to a long line of "Star Trek" movies, you've probably already seen a few.Â  This one has it all.Â  The set-pieces are great.Â  What makes them great are the roles the actors play, including George Takei.Â  He plays the original Captain Pike, who becomes a Federation ambassador and ends up romancing a woman of the other side.Â  She's played by Nichelle Nichols, who does a great job.Â  There are some great performances in here, including William Shatner playing a character who is actually Spock (the original Kirk).Â  I liked it when he showed up.Â  And I think Nichelle is great.   There are only a couple of bad parts in this movie, and they are both very brief.Â  But there are several good ones.  What really makes it a classic is that all the actors were great, and all of them, minus the original Kirk, were played by non-Trek actors.Â  They were terrific, and it's great that we are getting them all back together again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you first meet the main characters of the film you will notice that the movie was made in 1940, and is very faithful to the period. I have always been impressed with the look of this film, and there is not a lot of CGI here, but when there is, it looks very good. The cast does a fantastic job of portraying the era. The film itself is a bit heavy on the "Hollywood" feel, with a bit of a campy charm to it. Some of the movie's best scenes are when you get to see the people in the movie world do everyday things like walking down the street, and going to work.   After watching it once you will wonder when you were able to see this film 40 years ago. I love this movie, and it was great seeing old movies like this.  I had a great time watching it and would highly recommend it to all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many, I had to watch this one twice, once in high school and once in college. My high school memories of the original were even better, so my experience with this one was much more pleasant. It was well-shot, but a bit uneven.Â The film has a bit of a goofy feel to it, but the director, the co-writer, the cinematographer and the composer all had a lot of fun making it. It's one of those movies where a guy wants to have his cake and eat it too. He wants it to be a comedy and not a horror film. He makes it into a comedy, but then it's turned into a scary horror movie.  I had no qualms about watching it when I was in highschool. The cinematography was excellent and the actors did a great job, which helped to make it more realistic than it initially seemed.   A good comedy, so to speak. I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie, a good horror movie. If you're a fan of horror then you really need to watch this. I saw it when it was first released, I loved it and still do. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie did not disappoint me, and will make me want to watch the whole series.   It is a movie that not only entertains the audience, but also makes them think about things that we should never even think about.  "Dirty Harry" is more than just a movie, it is a story about people, that if you want to be successful, don't live in fear of being murdered.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was my first movie I've seen on the big screen, and I was very impressed with the movie. The acting was great and the storyline was very thought-out. It was easy for the actors to get into character. This movie was definitely worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never had any interest in a monster movie, but I really love this one. It's one of those movies I want to see as a kid and I never saw it. This movie is one of the best I have ever seen and it is the most horrifying. I don't think I will ever see any other monster movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is a classic.   A lot of things that make the movie so much fun is what make it such a good film.  The chemistry between the actors is great,  It is funny, Â  It is sweet,   and most importantly, it is beautiful.  It tells the story about the relationship between two very different women that just happen to have the same name and they are always having a conversation or two. Â  They try to make their relationship work, but they can't even be there to see what each other sees.  When things do come to blows it is great to see the two of them get into their roles and have a good time while in the middle of a fight.  I really enjoyed this movie as it is well written and a great movie with great performances.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is like a movie you watch in the theater for the first time. The movie is good, but not very different from the other movies I have seen in the cinema. It's very well acted and shot.   The story is about two little people who are going to the big city to visit their aunt and uncle. The uncle dies. They are then sent to the small city of Toulouse.  The uncle is a very nice person, but they must get back to their aunt in France before the uncle dies from a heart attack. They get back and it's raining. The little boy is a real star. He's playing with a small balloon in the back of his head. When they get to the airport they get stopped by some French police. They explain that they are traveling by balloon. The policeman is really nice and he tells them they must go to the police station in Toulon. They take off on the balloon and don't know what they are going through.  When they arrive at the station, they don't feel any better than they did before they started the trip.  There are a lot of bad characters, but the boy is really great.  I was so bored and tired while watching the movie, but it was nice to see that a movie can be done right. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The script is brilliant. You'll get lots of laughs but you'll also get a glimpse of some really real life horrors that happened during the war.   One day it will be released on DVD (probably early next year)   It's one of the best documentaries on this war in all of our history. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a whole, this is a fine movie. The acting is fine, and the story is a nice one. It does get a little boring towards the end, though.   It would have been nice to see the characters grow up and develop a little, but that isn't much of a complaint. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie, especially in the first half, is wonderful and full of life. Even though this is the second film of the series, it's not a repetition of the first one. The characters are fresh and the plot does not feel stale. I wish it was a little longer, but you can see why it was so popular.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was at a friend's house when she gave me the DVD of this movie with a note that said it had been a big deal for her to get the soundtrack. I have been looking for a decent animated film with a good score to watch for years now.  It is well made and the film is actually fairly funny. There are a few good visual jokes in the movie but there are too many to count.  You don't need a score to enjoy this movie.  The only thing that I am sorry about is that I didn't find a more suitable song to the song.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last "real" Star Trek film was directed by Nicholas Meyer. And it was excellent. But this one is really a sequel to the TV series, with Kirk and Spock playing the two leads. It follows the Enterprise crew as they are sent into the Delta Quadrant to recover the Kobayashi Maru, which had taken Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and his crew and crewmember Spock (Leonard Nimoy) to a "post-scarcity" world to be judged.  The script has some neat ideas, like Kirk's character going around the universe with his ship, as well as Spock's "super-strength" and all the science.  When you think of Star Trek in the 80s, it is really about the Enterprise and the crew, not about the Klingons. This is a fun little film that isn't too complex. And with some nice special effects, and the fact that it was made in the 1980s, you will not be disappointed. It's also pretty funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Very good movie. It's not a romantic, but you will learn that the main character is a little bit gay. There is a scene between him and a couple of other characters that you can find in almost any of the gay movies of the past. It makes you understand a little of what his life is like. It is a simple movie but it made me laugh so much. The actors are really good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I love this movie and if I ever have to see a movie in HD, this is it.  - The music in this movie is wonderful, especially the violin.   I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves films like this and the art of film making. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when it came out. I thought it was good! I liked the music and the way it was shot.   Like I said, it was a little dark for my taste, but I like that.  I have seen this movie a dozen times.  It is a good, fun movie and if you don't mind a little more nudity, then this is the movie for you.  My husband and I both liked it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was fun and very well made.  It's good if you like comedy, not for those who hate comedy or for those looking for a serious movie, but if you can get past that then it's a good watch.   If you're not going to get your kicks from watching a silly movie then maybe get the original, but you can find the DVD for pretty cheap online and get a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film was a total surprise for me, and I am glad that I discovered it. This film is very funny, and the characters are all very interesting, but the real star of the movie is the actor who played the part of the "jazz musician", John Barrymore. It is difficult to believe that he was so well-known at the time, and that he appeared in so many different films. I have always felt that there were some very good films in the "John Barrymore" catalogue, and this one is definitely one of the best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My parents brought me to this movie in 1977, when I was only 4 years old. My parents didn't have a lot of money so they took me to see it with them. I loved it! I loved the music and the characters. I still love it today. My sister and I went to see this movie together, but we didn't understand the language and couldn't understand some parts. We still remember seeing a few of the lines in Spanish and Italian that we didn?t understand.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw "Tales From the Darkside", I was hooked and I have been meaning to watch it ever since. I found that it was far more violent and violent than I ever imagined it to be.   This is probably one of the most unique and original horror films I have seen in the last few years.  The actors are fantastic and are definitely more than willing to do the violence if they have to.  It was great to see that not all of the vampires were as ugly as they seemed and there were some that seemed nice and nice.  As always, the direction of the director and the way the camera was moving was top notch.  I have a feeling that I will be seeing this movie over and over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is the best animated feature I have ever seen. The quality is impeccable. The film is filled with memorable characters. I have never seen anything that has such a complex and fascinating story line as this. The art is beautiful. It's not like Disney or Pixar or a live action show. It is actually more like a painting. There are great characters and the story goes deeper than a kid's cartoon.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was able to see this film during an early screening at a small cinema (maybe 2). It was a bit of a surprise, because a lot of the films coming out at the time were far darker and grittier, and it was a joy to see a film this light and fun. I loved it!  I think that the director is a great storyteller, who is able to show us the dark side of life and love, which makes this film so appealing. I really love this movie, and the fact that the actress who plays Marcy is the sister of the man who's been convicted of her murder makes me feel really bad for him. I found it incredibly touching.  The best performance of the film was the way James Caan played the part of Marcy, which I really liked.  I also really like the way that the two women played by Jane Fonda and Barbara Carrera, look at the film as a reflection of themselves, rather than as outsiders.   Overall, this is a film I would absolutely recommend. I think the story would really go well in a movie theatre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been a huge fan of the "Star Wars" films ever since I saw "Empire Strikes Back" on TV when I was very little. I watched the three original films for the first time in the theatre when I bought the DVD. I thought they were all great, but I was always a little disappointed with the "Episode One" ones. I finally got to see the entire saga (even if the "Special Editions" weren't great) with "Star Trek" and I was blown away! "The Original Series" has become one of my favourite shows, and now "The Next Generation" has really captured my imagination. I'm glad that these new episodes are in fact as good as the previous ones. There's just something about the look and feel of the sets that gives them a certain charm that really makes them feel like they were part of the original series. The new crew seem to be even cooler than the original crew and it was a lot of fun to see all of them.   One of my biggest complaints with the original three films was the lack of special effects in them. They all just looked like cardboard cutouts or claymation, and they weren't animated, so there wasn't much to get excited about. I think that these four episodes have done a pretty good job of making the series look a lot more alive, and I love that the new episodes feature all new effects and effects shots, rather than trying to fit in an old one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved the film, and it's nice that it is not an "action movie", so you don't have to be a "hardcore" action fan to enjoy it.   It has an excellent cast, which is why I gave it 5 stars.  A very high quality production.  In a way, it's kind of like a musical in that regard, as it's a "love story" about an artist who wants to get out of his "self-made" situation.  The characters, though well acted and the direction, is not for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have only seen this film once, at a preview show where my friends and I saw it in the theater. I was just about to buy it, but I was saved when I heard it had a cult following. I bought it anyway and thought the film was fine. I had no idea that a cult movie could be so good.    This film is definitely a must see for fans of science fiction and horror. It is a great film, with a strong visual style and good production values. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is like "Shall We Dance" in a way. It's an odd movie because it's a comedy/drama/horror movie, but it has a lot of humor in it.   The movie has a really cool look about it, the cinematography is pretty awesome, and the voice actors are pretty good.  The guy playing Michael is great and has an amazing voice.  I really enjoyed this movie.  A bit confusing in the first hour or so, but once you get the story, it's good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to give props to the Director for this film, it really captures the mood, attitude, and of course the attitude of a gangster. I really liked the character designs and of the entire film.   For sure this movie is a lot darker and grittier than the typical Gangster films you see and is a good mix of action, humor, and emotion. It was a lot of fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen it twice in theaters, and have only watched the TV version with the audio added. The first time I saw it I thought it was one of the better shows on television in the early 1980's. It was also very, very funny. I think it was on for almost an hour!  I was always looking for something with that kind of energy and I think this is it. The writing is quite good.  The acting, particularly by Peter Falk, is excellent.  I thought that Michael J. Pollard had a fantastic performance as well. The only thing I didn't like was when the villain says, "My dear, your father is a criminal," to his daughter.  And to me, that was a sign that this wasn't a good guy.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film's production value is good and the music is good. The film is also very exciting and the plot is very well-executed. This is one of those films you must see, but keep in mind that it is an old time classic, so you might have to watch it in its original Italian version (and some parts may be better seen in English).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm really glad I went to see this, and I really didn't want to see it. My boyfriend is not a fan of gore, and he didn't care for this one. It's all pretty tame, but not very interesting. The gore makes a strong impression on me though. But the story is actually pretty interesting, with a really good premise. It really shows that the film world isn't exactly that safe.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fun film to watch.  The actors really play their roles really well.   It is very unique and a good story to tell. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The whole movie was fantastic. The characters were funny and were not afraid to show it.    I loved that they let the actors just get into the characters.  It was so much fun.  My only complaint was that it was over a century later and my favorite characters were no longer with us. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched the movie because it was a favorite of my dad and I was so excited when I heard it was coming out. He always liked sci fi so this was a really fun watch. It's definitely not something you watch all the time but if you have time to catch it once in a while it's a really good movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but when it arrived, I thought it would be very disappointing.  It had a story that was rather weak and the acting was rather bad.  They had to cut out the most important thing of the movie.  There was also a very disturbing scene at the end where the guys are hanging from the cliff, and all of them were very drunk (it was a party, and the guys seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I wouldn't really call it shocking, but it was a very uncomfortable scene.   It's a very cheap movie, and if you look at the poster and don't think you'll like it, you're probably wrong.  The characters are pretty stereotypical and they are all very thin.  If you like the TV series "Frasier", or "Frasho", or anything by the "Franks", or just have any of these old movies, then you'll probably like it.  Also, if you watch the show, there is a short scene at about 2 minutes in where there are some pretty hot girls in a bikini, and it's very clear they are getting their money's worth (and that they got plenty of it). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a sucker for films with a great cast and great production.   This film has all of those, and also the feel of a good story.  It's a great mystery and one of the most gripping film noir I've seen.  The cinematography in this movie is fantastic, and the scenes are so well acted.  There is a lot to like here.  If you are a fan of the genre, look no further, if you haven't seen a noir before then this is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you want to watch a great movie, this is one of them. Not a "special" or anything (though the plot is very good, with a wonderful ending), this movie is just great to watch and has a great story to tell. Great acting, and lots of humor! Great soundtrack too, and a great director, the same guy who made "A Hard Day's Night".   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite movie ever isÂ  Star Wars. It is the first one I saw. I was very young and had no idea who they were. I just loved the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First, if you want to understand what was happening with the "Cult" scene and the whole cult movie genre, read a movie like "The Exorcist". I really don't see how the whole thing got so messed up and it all ended up as a "cult movie".   The movie is entertaining and has an interesting plot, but the problem with "The Cult" is that everything is too fake.  The "cult" is set up on a school bus, when some students arrive.  They go to a house, get dressed in a black gown and a mask, and proceed to do a ritual.  Then, they take the masks and dress themselves.  It seems like a very real movie, except that it is very well made and acted, but it is just too far out to be considered a real cult.   I liked the movie, but I wish the "cultists" were more believable and had something more than the mask and robes.

This film is about the most realistic and entertaining "real life" story ever told, and one of the best movies ever produced.    - It is a must see for everyone who wants a real action movie with no gimmicks, but at the same time, it is not an action movie at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is fantastic. I loved it from beginning to end.  I just loved it and when I watched it again I enjoyed it more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is good but the acting is terrible.   I am really disappointed, if you are looking for a good action movie, it is not there.  It is good for a movie that shows a little bit of an older guy in a modern setting, but no action or the usual Hollywood stuff. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't often write positive reviews, but this one really stood out to me. The story is pretty straight forward, and it is well done. I can see it being seen as a kids movie, but it really does have a bit more to it. You can't really help but be entertained by it and I loved the characters. There is a girl that runs around all over the place and her best friend is a cat and I found myself wishing I had one of my own.   This movie has it all, it has a great soundtrack, and is a great action flick.  I highly recommend checking this out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A really good movie that is a must see movie for a movie lover. I think this movie was a better remake of a movie of the same name from the 60's. I really think it is a great movie. The story is simple and the characters are great. I recommend this movie to everyone that loves a good laugh. If you are a fan of 70's comedies you have to watch this movie. A good flick.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie about a young girl who is on the run from the police because of a mysterious explosion that occurred in her own hometown. It is the tale of the young woman's search for an explanation and her feelings for her father. I must confess, I wasn't a big fan of the film, but once I did realize how good it was and how powerful a character it portrays, I loved it. I never found the ending to be entirely satisfying, but I found the film itself to be a powerful, touching and beautifully composed story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a nice movie.   If you haven't seen it, you should. It is a movie that everyone should see at least once in their life.  It is funny and heartwarming.  They showed all the people in the hospital having to fight for their lives after the accident.  The scene in the morgue with the cadaver was a really cool one.  My favorite scene is the one where the young girl is in the ambulance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's the movie I was looking for. It's a bit slow and the plot is kinda confusing. It has some excellent performances and good writing. I did enjoy watching it with my kids but it would not be a good film for a younger audience.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot has been done so many times, and has always come out with a twist or something that makes the ending totally unexpected and gives it a whole new look and feel, as if we just discovered something new. So, here is another great one that shows how this movie can take on any scenario and still come up with an unbelievable twist and really puts you on your feet. It will leave you guessing and asking yourself if what you saw was real or if it was staged.    I give it 4 stars, as the twist at the end is good and you think you saw it all and can't believe it was just a great set up to the plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My boyfriend and I rented this movie for the second time last night and I have to say, it was not what I expected.   I got to enjoy it before the bad reviews started coming out and I enjoyed it, but it was definitely not the film I had imagined.  It was much more comedic than I had hoped.  I wasn't really too excited about seeing the movie as the trailers didn't really tell me much.  First of all, I did not expect it to be the sort of comedy where the characters are constantly in different situations that are funny because of their own actions.  The acting in the film was not funny and I never liked the characters.  There were too many scenes where I found myself laughing a lot but the characters just wouldn't do anything funny.  Even the "tough guys" didn't have much personality, and were mostly there to just look tough.  This was one of those movies where if I wanted to see a movie that I could really get into it would be something with some great characters. I know some people may get a kick out of the comedy but I think this was just an annoying movie that had poor acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Very good movie!  It was very entertaining and funny.  The scenes are well-cut. The soundtrack is very cool too.  My favorite actor is Jackman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is simple, yet captivating and captivatingly told.   It tells the story of a young boy and his dog who spend a day at a nature reserve, which includes a trip to a cave that has some very creepy, crawly creatures.  I really like the way the film shows a lot of the sights and sounds of a small nature reserve in the country, including a little waterfall, the sounds of water flowing, the birds singing, and the sounds in the cave.  It's the details that really sell the film, like when the dog comes across a dead animal or how the boy has to go through this strange place while avoiding these creatures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really good film. My son and I enjoyed it so much. I did not understand how the story got so interesting and I was looking for an easier film to watch with him. This one was worth watching with him, and it was fun to watch. It is a short film, but it is worth watching, just the right amount of time. I liked the dialog in this film, it was not too hard on your ear. The acting was excellent and the music was good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film follows one man (Manson) in his fight against mental illness and his own personal demons, but he never loses his enthusiasm and charm, and always makes the right choices.  The cast is terrific, as usual. In addition to Marilyn Manson, Paul McCartney, Rob Zombie and a bunch of other musicians, the cast also includes: Paul Kalkbrenner, Tilda Swinton, Brian Cox, James Belushi, Jim Carrey, Steve Buscemi, and Dennis Hopper.   I've never seen this movie before, and it's a fun film with an original plot, great acting and a great soundtrack. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a big fan of the original "Jurassic Park". I thought it was a masterpiece and I remember thinking it would make an amazing sequel. The new movie, though, is a little disappointing. The original movie has a fantastic cast and the creatures, though great, were a little generic. I love the CGI work they did for the movie. And I loved the dinosaurs on screen.   The new one, though is not the same. The characters are a little bland and the acting is not as great. But, for a family movie, I think it is a very good one.  In the original movie, the theme park was a pretty nice place to spend an afternoon.  I wish the new one could have lived up to that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the only film in my collection that I haven't seen yet. I'm looking forward to seeing it.   I was very intrigued by this movie.  I've heard great things about it. There's some nice acting, but nothing I haven in mind to watch.  It looks like an entertaining movie, I just hope they make a follow up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first watched this film as an eight-year-old. My father had rented it and that was all I saw. That is not something I would have chosen for my father to watch. At the time I thought that this was the worst film of the year. When I saw it for the second time with the sound back in 1989 I could not believe how much I had missed out on it. It was like watching a film from the 1950's and not being able to get the subtitles. The only good thing about this film is that it shows the effects of the atomic bomb in a realistic and believable way.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very happy to find the DVD of this movie at a store not too far from my home. I have seen the film on television so many times that the image still looks good to me. The storyline is so well executed, it's easy to see what's going on. The scenes are well filmed and the characters are all believable.    The film shows the difficulties a man has in accepting the reality of the Holocaust, and the fact that some of his friends had to be spared the fate of the Jews who had nothing to do with the Nazi crimes.  This film was a must see for me and I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the Nazi ideology and the suffering of those who had to carry out the mass murders. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is the greatest comedy ever made. It's a great combination of funny, action, and good acting. And the music is wonderful as well.   The reason this is on this list, is that this film was made over a decade ago, and the acting is still as great as it was in 1989.  There are still some great characters in this film, and there are even some actors that are still in their prime.  My only complaint is that I wish they had gone back to do another sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An excellent story about a man who has lived an entire life in solitude. I felt that it was a true and honest depiction of an old man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am in no way a horror film fanatic, so this was definitely a "new" experience for me.  Â There are so many different ways to approach a horror movie that it's amazing when one comes up with something original, so my original idea was to try and make a movie about a man who is trapped in a room and slowly going insane.  He starts hearing voices, has flashbacks to his past and doesn't like it.  Eventually, he begins to act like the madman he is.  But after all is said and done, I think he will come out of it all with a better outlook.  In all honesty, I was scared for a good five minutes, which I'm glad I didn't see.  The acting and production design are top notch.  My only gripe was that there are only two shots of the actual movie: one when the actor is locked in the room, and another when the character is walking down the hallway.  It would have been cool to see the rest of the film.  A few extras were included as extras.  I would highly recommend it, and if you don't like scary movies, you should check it out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I couldn't wait for the real thing. This is a great family-friendly comedy with excellent characters and humor. This movie is so much fun to watch that you might forget you're watching a movie.   It's a family movie, but it has a real dark edge. There is one really bad guy in the movie, and it's one of the best villains in years. He doesn't speak a word and all he does is look evil and evil, and his actions are just despicable.  What I like about this movie is that it doesn't hold back from showing how mean people can be and that people can go down so quickly.  It also is a true classic. I don't think there's a movie in recent years that can match it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film once years ago and remember thinking it was amazing. After seeing it again the film has aged well and is very enjoyable. This film is full of funny situations and it has just the right amount of tension. I think it's a film you should watch with your kids to get them involved. It's definitely a good time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of horror movies.   The first one I saw, was at an opening night showing for a good cause, so the movie itself was not bad, but it was pretty low budget, and didn't really have a strong horror sub-genre.  A few years later, I watched the original.  It was a much better movie.  The story was much more involving and much scarier.  I had not really seen a lot of old horror movies, but that was it for me for a long time.  Â  The first film I saw was about this man who was in a mental hospital, who was being experimented on by a scientist. The doctor would kill him, and take his organs.  Unfortunately, the scientist was also working for the government. The scientist would kill the man, and also take his body parts.  After he was killed, the man had no memory of his life.  Then came the sequel.  This time, it was about a woman who was obsessed with the doctor who killed her boyfriend.  One day, the doctor is killed by the woman, and a secret government agency is trying to find him. Â A young woman, starts working at the agency, and the story progresses.  My favorite part of this movie was the ending.  In the first film, the girl is in a hospital.  Now, she is a young woman.  She is having a heart attack, and she is being treated by some doctors.  As the doctors try to save her, she goes into shock.  But, as she dies, she sees her boyfriend and says that he died the way he wanted.  What a perfect way to end the movie.Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie as a teen and am now over 25. It was a good film, not as well written as most of the others on this list. It had some cool ideas, but there were a lot of things thrown in that made it hard to figure out what was going on. However, this film is very interesting in its own way. The whole film is like a dream, where the actors all appear to be real and the story is told very carefully. It's like watching a dream come true. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love the movie, but i am a little disappointed on how the movie turned out, and how the director took the characters from the comics, but made them into actors and put some of them in films for the first time. So far I love how the film is, but how it turned out.   The movie was very well-made and was well shot.  I would say that the actors are all very good.  In the movie the director was quite careful on the dialog to get everything exactly right so as not to confuse the viewers, but at the same time to keep the movie original and make it really different.  Overall, the movie is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this case the first 30 minutes are excellent as well as the final two minutes that ends on an extremely creepy note.   This movie really gets some good action and some good suspense to make it a good action/thriller.  I also like that in the movie, the writer/director used some real people as villains.  This kind of film is usually made in some "low budget" movie.  So in that way this movie works as a good example to how to make a low budget movie and make it worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A classic film from the 60's. Not sure if you will like it because of the age of the actors. It is still a great movie that should be seen with a young audience.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   It is an interesting take on the world of super heroes, and I liked that.  I thought it was a good way to explore what it was like to be super hero, and not being super really was a nice change.  The story is well told, and there are some great comic book inspired bits, especially in the first half of the movie. There are a lot of cool fight scenes, and some really cool scenes between Superman and Wonder Woman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was really entertaining, I loved the character development, and the story was really cool. I really liked the look of this movie and how they used a lot of old Hollywood film stock in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was looking forward to this movie. I am a big fan of the 1980s and the movie was a real treat to watch. As a young girl, I remember seeing this movie for the first time, and it was just an amazing experience. It had amazing visuals and the acting was just terrific. I was thrilled to see the "new" character, who seemed to come from nowhere. I also enjoyed the look of the city, and the music was just perfect.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is an absolute hoot. The cast are all very talented and the movie is full of great, funny lines.      I loved the film, the actors were hilarious and the humor was great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a pretty great movie! The first half is about the young couple in a bar, where the girl is about to be arrested by the police for doing drugs and the man, a police officer is about find the couple and take her out of the bar. During the police questioning, she takes the cop's gun and shoots the officer in the face and she is then put into the police car and the cops are driving off, not knowing that it was the girl and not the guy.  The second half of the movie shows the police arresting the couple, who are driving in a van, when the police officer gets shot by the girl. This movie makes you really feel sorry for the couple in this bar because this guy was the one who did all these things to this girl, and now she will have to live with the consequences for the rest of her life.

"Don't worry about me, I am not afraid of you." The characters' names really stuck with me, like "The Madman" from "The Big Chill" for example, the character was so outrageous.  This was one of the funniest films I have seen in years, great fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie in the theatre a couple of years ago, and I never watched it again. I was in the mood for a sci-fi movie and decided to watch this one, and although I was not entirely convinced, I did not mind it. There are many things about the movie that I enjoyed, from the acting, to the graphics, to one particular scene. However, the scene I saw in the movie, where two aliens walk by the house and sit on the front porch, I felt uncomfortable with the way they were acting. When the aliens were shown on the screen, there was nothing but a black wall between them and the camera, and they looked just like normal people. They looked like they were there to look at the scenery. This kind of thing doesn't usually bother me, but this was a little too much. It would have been better to show the aliens on the wall in an actual movie theater, or something.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is about two young guys in Vietnam that are both sent to guard a minefield. One is a good guy and the other is a bad guy. The guy who is a "bad" guy is always the more cautious one, so he thinks that the guy he's guarding is a harmless civilian. After all, the minefield is just a few meters away from the mine, and the guy is just an easy target. One day the bad guy has just got tired of waiting and decides to break through the mine to find out who the civilian is. He comes across a woman and they become friends. When the bad guys try to get her to give up the information, she gets very angry and refuses to cooperate. After a lot of struggle, the bad dudes are able to get their hands on her and force her to cooperate with them. The bad guy is then able to tell the good guys where the mine is, and they are able later to find a bomb to destroy it.   I remember when I first saw the film in the 80's, my dad rented it for me. He thought it was really funny and I loved it. It has a great cast and the chemistry is great. It's definitely one of the better Vietnam movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I first saw the trailer for this film before it was released. The movie was the perfect blend of suspense and humor, and while it was definitely scary, I was also hooked from the beginning. When you think of the movie you think, 'Well... what would happen if...?' and this movie took that question to a whole new level. I was scared when I first saw it, but the suspense was very real. I never wanted it to end... It just kept getting better and better.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought the movie was great! it gave me a great "shooting" feeling. the scenery was really nice! i saw the movie in the theater in the morning and it was wonderful! the cinematography was pretty good. i liked how the scenes were filmed, and the director wanted to keep up the suspense. there were a lot of action scenes, which gave me chills. the ending was really interesting, and i was really pleased to see how the movie ended.    A very, very good movie.  I highly recommend it, even though there are some parts in which the director does not put enough time into it, it is really worth the time and effort!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Beneath a broken sky, beyond a shadow, a lost continent, a mysterious city."Â  This movie is the perfect example of a story that is filled with life and adventure.   It's a bit cheesy in parts, but it's a very good film and it's always fun watching a great film that gets better with age. Â    This movie reminds me a lot of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom   with the evil, crazy guys who are just trying to get their hands on a great treasure.  This is an adventure and a thrill ride that I would love to see one day. Â 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a great little gem of a horror.   I don't think this is a good film to watch when you first get into the genre. It is a little slow, but if you really take your time to get into it and enjoy it, the little things and the little twists that they make can really keep you going.     Also, I'm not sure about the "gags" in this movie. I feel like some of them are a little weird and aren't really funny, like when they're in a bar with some guy and he's going on about how he's gonna beat up some girl if he catches her looking at his penis, or whatever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fine movie, with a nice blend of action and drama, as a former soldier, James Conrad (Daniel Craig) is taken in as a CIA agent, working for an agency that is being manipulated by an enemy nation. After being kidnapped in Vietnam and having to fight his way back, Conrad is sent to Thailand to retrieve a captured terrorist, John Cazale (George Clooney). The plot is very simple, and the acting is very good. The action scenes were great, with very well choreographed action sequences.   I also like that this movie has some Asian elements to it. This could be seen as a white man's film, but I like that there are some interesting Asian characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is pretty good for the time it was made.   This movie was made in 1936 and has a unique look about it.  I am a huge fan of the original series so I was interested in seeing how the show would evolve and change over time.  The actors were great and it looked like a real episode of the show.  It is a great movie for the classic sci-fi movie crowd and for fans of the series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film after the release of a new movie called "The World Is Not Enough." The movie was fun, and the characters were fun.   I found the characters very likable.  It was easy to relate to, and they had the right kind of laugh, but this is not one of those comedies I usually like.  The acting was great, and it didn't take away from the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is so bad.  I like movies about drugs. They usually are good.   I watched this one just to see if it was good. It was terrible.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie over and over, but always enjoyed it more and more as it got closer to being finished. It has all the hallmarks of a classic, and it has been compared to such classics as "It's a Wonderful Life", "The Wizard of Oz" and "The Sound of Music".   It's not a great story (or a good one, for that matter) but it's not without its merits. This is a movie where all of the elements come together, all of them working to tell a great, moving story. The acting is always great, the acting as well as the writing is just superb, and there are also some great musical numbers. This movie is timeless, and I can't think of another movie quite like it, that I've seen before.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a movie of a person with a broken heart, who, despite everything, keeps on moving forward, trying to find peace and happiness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it comes to action movies with guns, there are only a few that truly satisfy. The Fast and the Furious franchise is a great example.   The Fast Five is a solid action movie with a decent amount of action.  It is no Fast & Furious, but still enjoyable.  The characters and the chemistry are great.  I think it has a lot of potential to become a very popular movie with fans of action films.  This is one of the best action movies I have seen since Fast Five.

This is an interesting and interesting look into a very unique and unusual way of living and the effect it has on those around you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What an amazing movie! This is one of those movies that I'm glad I saw when I was a kid. I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to watch it when my family comes over, or when it's time to watch a movie with friends. I love how funny it is, and how well acted. I also love how the director is a genius and has an amazing eye for action, suspense, and emotion. The action is very good and there are so many different ways to get from point A to point B. My favorite scene is when he goes into the school with the dog, and then the dog goes into an office and attacks the guard, but the dog is still able to escape.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a well made, well acted film and very funny in some parts, but at other times it loses focus and is not the funniest thing you have seen in a long time, and its not the only thing that is funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first saw the film, I was immediately taken back. I have to admit, I had a slight fear of clowns before seeing it. But when I saw this movie, I did not notice a difference in the clowns compared to my horror films. The film was very entertaining.    This is one of those films that made a good impression on me.  The story of this film was not complicated and it was a fun film.  With it's humor, this film will be loved by everyone.

I had heard great things about this movie and I was excited to see it.  "Halloweener" was the best of the John Carpenter Halloween films, and probably one of my favorite of his films as well.  I thought the characters were fun and the special effects were good.  I just want to thank the producers for the DVD and for the high quality of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When i heard this was a prequel i was a bit skeptical at first as most movies prequels are terrible. The first two films are great however i have to say the sequel is way better. The art and animation are excellent and it is very funny. I love the way the characters look so much better and they still look like they are still in high school. The plot is pretty much the same as the first film. However there are new characters in it such as a high school teacher that teaches the characters how to dress and their love life. The director for this was Tom Hanks who is also a great actor, very talented. He really brings out the best in the actors. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good rom-com.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just had to make a review about this movie. My wife had seen the same old film on TV a number of times. We have watched it a number times and this was the first time we saw it in the theater. We loved it! I do not usually like horror films, but I really liked this one. I know that horror films have become more and more common but I have always loved them! There were some scenes that were disturbing at times but I loved the overall atmosphere. I have never seen a film where I felt scared more. The film is set in an insane asylum where a group of patients and staff are being held. There are some pretty good actors in this film but it was all too perfect. There was just something about this film that made me want to go to see it more than once.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a great movie.   A beautiful film about love, longing and what we can lose when we don't know how to love or live with ourselves.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. My only wish was that the soundtrack (which has some pretty great stuff) would have been included for the whole film.    The plot is interesting and takes place in the 1960s.  The acting is excellent and there are some memorable moments.  I do have one complaint though. There's too much of the film that is about the characters at the beginning and then gets lost in the middle of the movie. I mean a little bit of background on them and they're going on adventures.  My favorite scenes are the ones that happen after the film ends.  "I don't have to tell you anything..." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie last year on opening night at my local CinÃ©mathÃ¨que. It was a great movie, and I really liked it. There were a couple of things that were a little off, but nothing to really make me feel like it was a horrible movie. It is funny, it has heart, it's got a really good cast, and if you like movies about young girls it's worth a look. The acting is amazing, and the movie just has a nice feel to it. I recommend it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am really happy about my experience with The Other Boleyn Girl. The script is not exactly a novel, but there is definitely a great cast and the plot is interesting. The performances were very good. I was surprised by the intensity and darkness of the play. There is so much suspense in the play that it's almost scary and the drama is intense. There are some great actors who don't have the most impressive resumes. However, they bring their all and give it their best effort in their roles. They all give it what they can.   The cinematography in the film is really outstanding, especially by Ken Loach. The film does look a bit dated now, but I love the film. I'm sure that many people will enjoy it as well. I am glad that there is more of this kind of film coming out now.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is good but there is nothing amazing about it. The movie starts well but there are just so many plot holes that it's hard to sit through this movie. The pacing is slow and it really takes the film's pace and drags it down. It's hard for the story to take place with no real consequences and the main character just goes through the motions.    Also the only good thing about this movie is the opening credits.

If you are a fan of the "Taken" movie series, then you should watch this movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is great!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I don't know who wrote that wonderful poem of the dead." - William Shakespeare I first heard about this film when I was very young and it was on my father's collection. It didn't get much attention. My parents eventually did get a VHS of it which is why I still have it. It was a little disappointing because I thought it was just a cheap horror film. When it first started playing on my VCR it was playing in the beginning and then it went to one of those horrible black and white cartoons, which didn't make me want to see it any more. But as time went on, I started watching it and realized that this was one of the best films that had ever been made and it should have been on all the "best of" lists. The acting is incredible and you almost can't believe that it is a true story. There is never a dull moment. The sound is great, especially when they are in closeups. This is probably my favorite horror film that I have ever seen.

It was definitely a different take on the Frankenstein story. If you want something a little different and with a different set of monsters, this is it.      Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in a movie theater and I loved the story. I liked the characters and the way the plot was developed. This is a good example of how it can be good to shoot a film with a group of friends in a small town. This movie is worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is one of those rare great movies that isn't really made for a big screen. It works very well as a horror movie, and it can be scary as a real ghost movie.   A lot of people have mentioned that it reminds them of H.P. Lovecraft's work. I didn't really get that, but I know it's a nice reference for many.  Â   Â If you're a fan of the Silent Hill series, and you're looking for something new and not scary as shit, give it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been a fan of The Big Lebowski. I haven't seen it since 1999, so I wanted to watch it again.   The cast was great. I found myself giggling every time the Dude said something witty.  I think he may be the most underrated comedy character of all time.  The entire film is a fantastic piece of cinema.  The Dude was my absolute favorite character. The story about his life in the Lebovskis and his wife Anna is fantastic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a fantastic look into the dark side of a well known show, and a great "what if".   It is very funny and well thought out, even though you don't know what's going to happen in each episode.   There is some great character development, some of them very strange.  It was really great that after the movie ended, a lot of the cast from the original series came back and re-introduced themselves.  Also, it was really cool to see how they did the original characters, it gave the show a sense of history.  I would recommend this to fans of the show and to people who like classic sci-fi.  This was a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie and I thought it was a very good and interesting movie. I think that it has a lot of potential to make another great movie.   The production design, the costume, the production values, and the acting were all top-notch.  I found the story very interesting and I think it would be interesting to see it done a second time.  It was fun to see the other characters and to see how the movie would be received in other parts of the world.  The ending is also very good.  In short, this is a good and entertaining movie and it deserves more than just one.   See more â¼ See less â²  Carmen Sandiego (1985) Watch on Amazon Prime Video Get More From Me! Â» See all 42 reviews Â» This movie, directed by Richard Benjamin, is an odd one. The plot is very peculiar and the character performances are weak. The cast is very good, but the writing is very bad. The story involves a very strange, twisted family, which is split up by the accident that killed their mother and the baby. The baby turns out to be autistic. This is very strange and the film is very weird. The film is set in the late 19th century, and is a very well acted movie with a very dark and weird atmosphere. The only reason that I gave it a two, is that there are a lot worse films out there, but I think this one deserves a better rating.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title of this movie should be self explanatory. You are in the mind of a psychotic killer. When you watch this movie you should take it as a horror film with a twist. The story is set in a mental asylum which is run by a crazy old man who believes he is a prophet and who is responsible for the death of his wife. This man is haunted by his daughter who has been raped and tortured by a fellow patient. She is locked up with him in the psychiatric hospital. The woman is kept locked in a small room and has to be fed a gruel. The old man has a little girl and he believes she is his own child. The girl and the patient who committed the rape and murder of her mother have a very special relationship. The killer is very creative in how he murders the patient but he is also very cruel to his daughter.   It is very disturbing. You will never watch this film the same way again. The atmosphere of this film is so chilling and disturbing that I have no idea how this movie will ever be released again. This film is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the first movie I've seen where the title of the movie is the only thing that means anything, I really appreciated that this movie never uses the word "movie". There are some nice characters in this movie. There are a couple of good jokes and some really good suspense and some great effects.   The only problem I had with this movie was that I wasn't feeling the effects too much, they don't have that much of an impact. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've watched this movie over and over in the hope it would get the right rating to finally understand it all.   This is the most amazing film ever created and in my humble opinion.  This film is a masterpiece and it deserves every ounce of praise it gets.  The whole cast are amazing, I mean in all honesty they have to be the greatest actors ever to have worked.  From James Dean to Peter Sellers to James Mason and even a young Harrison Ford.  When I hear that they played Batman and Robin together they just put on the best performance ever.  They just have so much chemistry together and it really shows in this movie.  I would highly recommend watching this film at least once to understand the story and then go see it again to see how it was improved over the years.  You don't need to know what happens in the story to appreciate it as it has so much depth and a story that you just don't see on the big screen.  So enjoy this movie and watch it with your dad or watch it on video with your friends as this one is a keeper. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The script is terrific. In fact, the best thing about the movie is the performances. The actors (in the case of David Oyelowo) have such a wonderful chemistry. I love him. I've always loved his characters and this one is a little different than what I've seen. It's also very well-written. And I always appreciate when directors try to make something a little more edgy and experimental, which this is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In all fairness I did see this movie when I was still a small child. It was at the local movie theater in my hometown. I was probably around 5 years old. The people who run the theater let me and my sister sit next to the older kids who liked the movie. The movie was about a family whose son accidentally kills himself. The whole thing was pretty bad with a lot of blood and gore. It's kind of an ugly movie in many ways but it does have an ending. The mom has to kill her son but she doesn't want to. She gets him to the hospital and he dies. We also see a few other kids who have to do the same thing and are also killed. The rest of the movie follows the family as they make a trip to the morgue to bury the boy. It also makes me wonder why we even go to the dentist at all.    It's pretty messed up. I don't really remember much except the mom is sad that her son has died and she doesn to bury him. The ending is pretty bad but at least it doesn't make the movie better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a must-see! I always found the actors acting the part of their characters rather than their acting the role of themselves.

I thought that I hated the film at first because it didn't have that much of a story and didn't seem like it was going to give me any insight into the real world. I was wrong.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is actually a good adaptation of a true story.  It really did show that "The Greatest" was one of the greatest football teams of all time, and their run really is incredible.  I love when the writers of a movie are really creative and try to make it their own, and this movie definitely did that.  This movie does not show you the football in its entire glory (like all the other "greatest" movies of all-time), but they put a lot of great highlights and great shots to the game to make the movie seem more like a classic movie.   This is a true true story that happened in 1969.  There are some great scenes with all the players.  The cast was awesome, especially Robert Redford.  Even though it was in a real game, the actors were so in the scene and in love with each other and their characters.  A must see for football fans of all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've heard a few great horror movies over the years, but never had the chance to see them in the theater. The cast was terrific, and I've seen the film several times. I just felt this was an inspired take on a good old fashioned slasher movie.    Overall:  I know a few folks out there will tell you this film is bad. But I can assure you, I'm not so sure. This film was well acted, and very scary, and certainly, the cast was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was the first time I have ever seen a movie from the 1960s. It really is one of those movies that doesn't really get a great deal of attention. It's not a particularly great movie, it's just kind of a forgotten gem of a movie. It is a bit of a mystery as to what made this movie famous or even made a lot of money, but it's probably for the better, because there are plenty of other "good" movies from the 60s that would've made a much better profit if they were remade or if their producers had decided to make them a full length feature instead of a short.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie at a special screening. At the end of the movie, an audience member took off her jacket and said "it was nice seeing a little bit of old-timey movies". I thought it was cool she was thinking of old movies. The acting was fine, and I found myself laughing at the old jokes. It's not a bad movie to laugh to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens in a deserted city, with a group of children playing in the dirt. They are about 8, 10, maybe 11 years old, and are wearing nothing but ragged old clothes. The children begin to cry, in fear. They hear a strange noise, and then they find a man, who is standing in the middle of the street, holding a revolver, pointing it at them. He points it at the little boy, but then he points it in the direction of the girl. The man points the gun at her, but she throws a box at him, knocking the gun out of his hand. The little girl runs into the shadows. They continue to play, but now the boy becomes afraid of them, and they flee. The next day, the little girl comes back to the street where she had played before, and the men are nowhere to be seen.   While the film is not at all a comedy, the film's plot is rather amusing. The story revolves around a little girl, named Lily (Peyton Reed), and her friends, Max (Logan Marshall-Green) and Alex (Ansel Elgort), who are playing hide and seek in the city. Max is a good hunter, and Alex is just a good child. Lily finds Max, and decides to help him find Alex. Max sees Alex as a threat, but Lily is not afraid, and begins to help Max. The movie is not overly dramatic. It focuses on the little girls, rather than the hunters, who seem to be in danger every second of the movie.  Lily and Alex play hide and go seek in different areas of the city, but they are always caught by the men. The only people who are able to help them are the girls' friends, who play with the boys. The girls eventually find a way to escape the men's clutches, and begin their journey back to where they had gone.  This is a very funny movie, which was enjoyable from beginning to end. The actors, who really steal the film, make it a fun ride. The screenplay is well done, and has a funny ending.  A good film, worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was never a big fan of the genre of these genre films. These types of films are mostly boring, cliched, and in most cases, a little too predictable. So when I heard that a writer from a respected magazine like the Hollywood Reporter was producing a film of this type of film, I was interested. In fact, I watched the trailer. I was so excited to see a film that didn't disappoint. And what a wonderful film it was. It was entertaining, entertaining and entertaining. It left me in tears.  It's a very hard film to describe in a nutshell, because it's so full of different characters and their stories, and it's not a typical movie. It's almost like a novel written by Raymond Chandler, with some of the scenes from a Robert Altman film mixed in.  There are plenty of action scenes, but it's still a very realistic and very hard-hitting film, and at no point did I feel like a stereotypical tough guy. It is a great film. I love it and I hope that more films like this are made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been a fan of Robert Altman's films since they were released in the 70s, so I'm happy that I have been able to see this in theatres for the first time, which is a nice change of pace for me. Altman is at his best when he has an idea that's not being carried to fruition and he keeps at it till the bitter end. This is a must see film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've never heard of John Waters before, it's a great shame. His filmography is quite extensive, and he's a director that we haven't seen in quite a while, so that's exciting. This is a film that's a fun trip to a world of his, where his humor, gags, and dialogue are more prevalent than usual. The story is pretty unique, but Waters isn't afraid to make it a bit ridiculous. Waters and co. are great, and they're a joy to watch.

If someone who knows the movie and has seen the DVD should comment, it might be too long for me to read...but you may find it more than worth your while. The story is not very well developed, but the story that is told is worth the effort. A nice story with a strong villain, some great stunts and a fantastic final scene. This is a movie that you need to see on the big screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I liked this movie more than the first one. The film doesn't change its style, or anything else really. But the humor does. The movie is not really funny, but it has a few great scenes that are quite funny. It's just the plot. The main character does not know what he's doing at first and then it becomes so much more clear to him. If you have never seen a movie like this before, this is a must see.

This movie was really a great movie to see in a dark theater.   "We all know it's the girls.

You know the first time you see them, they're so pretty. You say, "Oh my God, what's this?" And they start all over again. And they keep at it until it's just too much for you. I mean, that's what we're here for." -Kirk Douglas "I always saw her as a sex symbol. She is sexy, she's sexy, and I loved that about her. I think that there is nothing sexier than a woman who has been seduced." -James Dean, who was cast in the film "She always said to me, "Kirk, you know, when I was 17, I met this girl in a coffee shop and I knew immediately, she was my girlfriend. I thought she was pretty and beautiful. I never once thought that she was anything but good looking. I always thought she could hold her own with a man." -John Wayne "The man who is so handsome when he looks down on the world is the man who knows that it has been taken from him and that he is the one who has to make it right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved the first one and this one is better.   For a first movie, it is surprisingly good.  It seems like it is written as a true story, but it really isn't.  The characters are real and the story is interesting.  Like all true stories, you can't trust your own eyes.  I have seen the movie a few times and it is not a great movie.  But I enjoyed it so much that I re-watched it last night.  This movie will stay with me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never got tired of watching the "Dinosaurs" films. So, I was happy when they decided to try to make a tv series in 1997. The idea of a small group of people living on an island (and sometimes other continents) on a large turtle was a good concept. The animals, both real and imagined, were the only problem. I really loved the fact that they didn't use CGI, or any of the real animals for that matter. It gave a natural feeling to it, and that was always good.  The cast was good, especially the leads. They were in good form, and the action was fantastic.  Some people have complained that the music and other sounds were cheesy, but I think the cast did the best they could in the situation. I don't remember the "Sleeper Cell" theme, but that didn't detract from it, as the sound is great.   There were some technical flaws with the show, but nothing too bad. Some episodes could have been a little longer, and some of the characters could have had a little more depth. I'm not sure if that was just the budget of the time or if they wanted to move away from the dinosaurs. But that doesn't take away from it all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a good flick, but the action sequences aren't very exciting (no one fights very hard in any of the fights).

I found the acting to be very good (except the two main characters) and it was very well done.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's one of those classic old films that just never gets old. I love how the director makes every shot seem so small and natural.

I loved how the two lead characters were different.  Both were strong, intelligent and flawed but the world they inhabit is a dangerous place.  It is sad to see how people can abuse and mistreat people and they are not held responsible.  These people are in the wrong place at the wrong time and suffer because of it.  The ending left me with a smile on my face.  This will definitely make me check out the rest of the movies in this series.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the real deal.   I love it.  This is one of those films that will make you feel bad for the evil guy (which is always fun) but will give you goosebumps everytime you see a new scene.  It is like watching a silent film with the music on, and I have seen some pretty amazing silent films, and this is just one of them.  I like the director (Steven Seagal) a lot and the cast, and it is an all-around wonderful film.  The film is pretty much a perfect blend of martial arts, action, and horror.  At the time of this film, all these genres were still fairly new to the western world and all the films in the genre were pretty damn good, but this movie really is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there was ever a film I thought I was going to love but wasn't, it was The Muppet Christmas Carol. The concept was brilliant, and I was hooked when I saw the opening scene with Rowlf the Dog and Santa Claus, as he had just arrived in a sleigh with a red beard, all alone. The music, as in the original film, was just perfect, and the puppets were so lifelike that I could see myself in them. I was in and out of the theater, and, even though I only saw it once, I felt a connection with the characters.   When it came time to go to work on the final version of the film, I was given a copy of the storyboard that I had to draw with chalk on the bathroom walls. I remember trying to match the voice of the old man in the first scene to my voice when I did my audition and then thinking, "Oh, god. If I can't get a good version of this, I don't know what I am doing with my life."   The final version was a complete success, with Muppet magic and a terrific script. When my mom saw it at the box office, she said, "I didn't expect you to get an Academy Award."  From left to right: Chris Miller, Rob Reiner, Jim Henson, Tim Curry, Jane Seymour, Peter Lord, and Jim Hensons.  I would watch it again today, and think how lucky I was to see this amazing film when it was being made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In all honesty, this is a pretty standard movie - not groundbreaking. However, the story itself is pretty original, and I felt that this film was a bit of a departure from most of the horror movies that are being released in the U.S. today, particularly those that are made to look "horror".   As for the cast, it was nice to have a couple of new faces that were able to make the movie their own, and while the film was definitely not scary, the performances made it all worth the price of admission.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting movie that I enjoyed watching.   It is a bit old-fashioned in the way it deals with people and how they are treated.  It deals with the lives of four women who are being considered for military service and are on a panel of judges to decide if they are fit. They are all in their twenties and the women in the movie are in their early thirties, and one of the women has a very large family.  The movie deals with an old-school view on what it means to be a woman in the military. The story shows the women trying to figure out who they are, what they are for and what they want out of their lives.  This movie is not for everyone but if you want something interesting and fun to watch then give it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw the film, I knew this was a great movie. The film is an examination of why we have to deal with the atrocities and suffering in the middle east. I liked this movie a lot. It is not a political drama in the classic sense, but a realist portrait of life and death in the most horrific, terrible way. The cast is all great and they made you care about the characters.   I am happy that this film is being made again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good film with great production value. I'm not much of a horror film fanatic but this is one of the better ones to come out in the last 20 years.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    After my recent viewing of the movie "The Best Thing I Never Had" in which the author, Anthony Hopkins, played by Bill Paxton, and his wife, Anne Bancroft, played the roles of the couple that were in the movie, I was really pleased to see that he also was involved in "The Dark Side". This is a nice film and I'm very glad that it was made.   The film is based on a book by the same title by the author of the novel, which is still in print and in print again, so if you want to see this story of the author and his love, it is still out there.  What I really liked was that there is an interview in the book where the author describes what it was like to be in the presence of a master actor and how difficult it is to be a star.  His character, William Conrad, is portrayed by George C. Scott who is very good in the part.  The movie also has a very nice cast of supporting actors.  It was very hard to imagine in the late 80's what it would be like if you were an actor, but in the era of "Mondo Cane" (a popular movie magazine), where celebrities were getting plastic surgery and even going under the knife, the glamour was there to be exploited.  I'm sure that George C Scott didn't have the plastic surgery because it was just too much for him.  This film really was fun to watch and if you don't mind a little bit of violence and some nudity, you'll like it.  (5 out of 5)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was definitely the best movie I've ever seen.  I was in awe.   It made me feel like I was right there with the people in the front row of the movie.  And the effects are fantastic.  This movie takes place in the 1940s.  When they talk to each other at the end of the film, they're very serious.  It's the type of movie that will have you wondering why it took so long to make this movie, and why so few people got to see it.  The story is not over yet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really disappointed with the quality of this movie, it's not a bad movie at all, just the acting was a bit amateurish. The cinematography was decent, but the scenes between the three main characters were all boring. The plot was decent but the way they were going about it made it really hard to follow. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie, by the way, does not feature a single real-life person.  It's like the kind of movie that would make a kid from the Bronx look into the camera and say:  "Well, the movie about my life has come to me. I guess I'll have to give it a chance, huh?"  The movie tells the story of a boy who's father is a rich banker and his mother is a homemaker, and his father's life is a mess (the movie is set in the 1970's) as his wife tries to have an affair and then gets fired from her job, leaving him to support her and his kids alone. The father dies of a heart attack when his son is 10, and when the boy grows up he's taken in by a family that is quite affluent and very religious (the son's mom is from Germany and her brother is a priest), and when he's 18 the boy starts a business that makes the people around him happy. The whole movie is so bizarre, and so filled with weird, weird things that it can be hard to take at first. But when you've seen this movie, you'll see the real story behind it and you'll realize that this is actually a very good movie.   The only bad thing is the movie's ending, which is completely unbelievable and so far out of character for the movie it's hard to believe that they ever made this movie (but they did).   So, if you like weird movies and you want something more than you see on the screen, and if you're looking for something to watch with a bunch of people and not a single person who looks like the actual people in this movie or the actual directors, you should watch this movie. You won't be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is really good, especially for the period. The acting is quite good.  Â The plot is quite intriguing, and it really does tell you what the real problems were in the 1930's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting more from this movie, but the movie did not disappoint. I can only speak from my own experience.   The cast is really quite good. The two best actresses are in the movie and they are also very talented, although in different genres. She is a good, believable actress, even though I've never seen her act.  It's interesting to see people who have done so much in other genres do something completely different.  If you've ever been attracted to horror or science fiction, this movie is not for you.  This is not a good genre for a movie to make, but this movie does a wonderful job of making it interesting and even scary, even for someone who has not seen a lot of sci-fi.  I did find the movie very hard to watch and quite scary for the first half of it, but by the end, I found myself being very interested.  The film's main theme is fear of the unknown and a person's fears can sometimes be very powerful, and there's plenty of it in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember watching this movie with my dad as a kid, and he loved it! It's so old, so classic.   This movie does a great job of capturing the fear and excitement of the time.  The first one is an interesting film, but I never thought it would hold up.  It does so with a great twist!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There is so much in this film that is good, but not great. The acting is so good. The pacing is great. There is just something in the film that seems to appeal to a wide audience, which is a positive thing. The humor and the acting work together so well and the way the film builds to a climax is really impressive.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has so much going on, it is the movie that everyone thinks of when they think of horror. I have been waiting to see this movie for a long time, this is the first movie I saw from John Carpenter that was made in 1975 and he did not disappoint.   In the movie you get to see the story, all of the effects and the gore.  There are a few scares and it has some great camera work.  The ending is great.  John Milius has a great performance and if you like the movie "Army of Darkness" this movie is good too. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie about a group of people living in a small town who all look exactly the same. The main character is the son of one of the other kids and is a little odd looking. One day he is sent away to live with his grandmother, who is also a child, because his mother died. He meets a group that are a different ethnic group than his group. He is forced to live apart from the others and it does him no good because when they get into trouble it is he who ends up with the bad guys. A really good movie for those who like a little mystery and those who do not want to go into an all-white town. The other thing I really enjoyed was the portrayal of the kids.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie really was a treat. It's a very good and realistic retelling of the true story of the real life Bali bombers. There's no wierd plot, just a good story.   As mentioned earlier, it's a realistic re-telling. There are no wacky scenes, just the story of a couple of college kids who took off to train with the Bali Bum.  For those who think this movie is a rip-off of the movie, think again.  I've seen the movie many times, and it's never been so good.  There are so many good scenes, and so many great moments, that this movie should really be seen by everyone.  It is a must see for any fan of the B-52 bombers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was in the UK when this came out and I was very excited. The film and characters were very funny. I also liked the way the film portrayed the UK and our food (and alcohol) and other cultures. I saw it at a comedy/musical festival at the cinema and thought the film was great! I'm glad we have such great British comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is all over the place, but there's something really fun about it. It's a mixture of a couple of different genres, and it's easy to see the influence of Lynch's films on the film. As for the acting, it's decent, especially for such an obscure film.   It's about a little girl (Julie Christie) who lives with her Aunt (Anne Bancroft) and Uncle (Tom Baker) and her grandmother. One day, Julie's father (Mick Jagger) sends her to the hospital, and she learns that her grandfather (Frank Langella) is dying. When Julie finds out she doesn't really want to go to the family's home in the suburbs, and instead wants to stay in the city to go shopping and spend time with her friends. So she goes with her grandmother to stay with her aunt and uncle.  It definitely has a Lynchian feel to it, and I can see it as being a sort of homage to some of the themes of his earlier films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie I was a little disappointed, but after seeing the remake with Tom Cruise, I have come to really enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie.   I love all the old flicks I grew up watching.  Like a lot of people, I thought that John Wayne's character was a total fool when he had to go back in time. That was not the case, but he didn't have a clue that his character would make such a big mistake.  When I saw this movie I had to see if I could get away with this, as I have done for many years now.  This was one of the first old time action flicks that I had seen, and it was a must see for me.  It was a little rough around the edges but still had some great scenes.  And the music by Ray Milland was so great.  I loved the old style and thought that was the only way to do it back then.  All in all, a great movie for the fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My son is a big fan of the "Star Wars" films and so I was very pleased to receive this Blu-ray combo pack of the movies and the special edition book. This was the first time I ever saw all of the Star Wars films and, for me, the special editions were extremely fun to watch again. Even though they're not as good as the original films, they're still fantastic. They also include an audio commentary for every film (except the original trilogy) that is informative and fun to listen to. The quality of these extras is pretty high and the only thing I would change about the extras are to add a bit more background info on the characters and the technology (such as the TIE fighters).   Overall, this is a great package for fans of the series and I highly recommend it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In an age when everyone is into self-indulgent nonsense like "Me and Earl and the Dying Girl", there is a lot to be said for the idea of taking a genre like comedy and taking it as far as it can go.   "Gimme Gimme" is a perfect example of how to make a comedy of a situation.  The movie is an adaptation of a short story by the incomparable George Plimpton, and there is nothing in the way of originality here.  In the book, a young man who is on his way home from college is robbed at gunpoint by two drunks on his bicycle.  We are introduced to this young man's friend who happens to be an attractive woman.  He is told that the girl has been taken away to a police station to be examined.  This makes him think it is his last chance to have her.  After the man manages to convince her not to go, he makes his way back home, but before he can get there, he gets caught up in a chase with a man in a motor home, and the chase takes them through the woods.  What makes the film so good is the way it keeps us guessing about what will happen next.  While it is true that in the book George Plimspton is a pretty loose writer, the movie makes good use of this fact to make sure the characters have more than one way out of a difficult situation. Â   It is funny, and it is very good.  Fantastic, and very fun.  As it stands, I wouldn't watch the film again unless there was some sort of sequel.  If you like George Plimpons short story, this is definitely a good one to check out.  It isn't a perfect film, but it is one that you shouldn't pass up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of this movie and i had to watch it again on DVD as I watched it on TV a few years ago. I was really surprised when I saw the original version on television in 1977. I had to see it on the big screen and I love the film. It has a very dark and atmospheric feel to it and it never gets out of hand. This is a film that you just want to sit back, have a few beers and enjoy. The movie stars John Lithgow as David Clayton who is a private detective who specializes in cases involving missing children and is obsessed with solving this mystery. Clayton's brother Peter has been missing since August 9, 1973, but when he returns from a trip, he never shows up again. After Peter's disappearance and subsequent return, Clayton finds out his brother has been in a lot of trouble and it leads him to dig deeper into the case. He is in search of a woman who was an associate of Peter's who disappeared after he was involved in an accident and was left with a very young daughter. Clayton believes the woman is his missing brother. The film is well made and shows Clayton's frustration, and his love for this case. The ending is very dramatic and a surprise as the movie left you wondering what happens to Clayton. The soundtrack is also very good and gives the movie a very gritty feel. The only thing I don't like about the film is the lack of dialogue. I really wanted more and I believe that was one of the main reasons for the film's failure on home video. This movie is amazing and worth a watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a few movie fans like me out there who always find themselves watching bad movies and never watching them again. I'm in a position to watch the whole "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" series and never get tired of it. I remember when I was a teenager my mom and I watched "A Hitchcock Movie" and loved every second of it, the plot was extremely funny and it had a killer soundtrack. It was a shame that we had to wait until I was in high school to watch "The Birds." Then again, that is why I love watching the "Twilight Zone."

When I saw the movie I had no idea what the characters were talking about, and I thought that was interesting.  The characters are quite interesting. I think they need a good amount of dialogue to keep the action going.   The music is great.  I love all the different songs, and the score is great too.  And I must say that there is a wonderful ship in the movie.  This film was a huge improvement from the original Pirates of The Caribbean.  If you haven't seen the original you should get it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film I highly recommend for anyone who is interested in film noir:  There is nothing wrong with the film, but it does lack some things I'm used to in a film noirs (a certain atmosphere, a bit of "glamour" with the characters, a certain sense of menace and mystery, and a "black" mood) - like a certain moody and atmospheric score (which is much better done in a good classic noir than in a cheap, rushed "drama").   In a lot of film noires I'm not so sure if the film is trying too hard or not (I think it is sometimes) - I think it's just not being able to find what it wants to be.   It has been compared to a lot (for instance the Hitchcock films, and the other "black comedies" of the 1940s, and more recently films of Alfred Hitchcock and Bresson, and even some of the noirs of the 1960s and 70s) and this comparison makes it even more interesting.  So it seems to me that in the past, "black humor" was mainly an international phenomenon, but not so anymore.  It might be because the "black comedy" genre (as I call it) is not as popular anymore, and not to say that people no longer care about the genre.  Some of them are not even that great.  I also think that some people are not yet comfortable with the black humor (or at least a certain kind of black humor) - maybe it's because they're used to seeing more "serious" films with happy endings - maybe because they have grown tired of certain tropes that seem to be common to film noire (the woman whose "life was over", the man who tries to get his wife to get "too good", the "good old days" or the "old world" in general).   Now we live in a world where films about "blackness" are more and more popular, and people are starting to take it seriously - maybe that's why the "dark" films are not as interesting anymore. And I think that the "sensibility" of film viewers has grown to a certain degree - I still feel there's a huge amount of "darkness" in the world, and it's no longer just the "low-life scum" you see on TV.

It was funny, it had a good storyline, it was funny in every way and it is one of the better horror films to come out of the 80's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think I was born the year this movie came out. I was 10. It was the same year I started watching Star Wars with my sister. It took me about 2 years to finally finish watching this movie, but that's just how much I loved it.   A great story that has the Star Wars universe feeling but without the movies.  The only thing that makes this movie not perfect is the characters. There's so many characters, not enough screen time for each one.  It should have had a couple more scenes with different characters.  I liked the movie. I love the music.  In the movie, Han Solo and Chewbacca are both at the same party and they are both looking for Han. Han's looking for his son.Â  I don't know what happened to Han and Leia, or what happened between Han and Chewie, but whatever happened, we see them on the planet Tatooine (but no, they don't go to Tatoo and it doesn't even have a name. The planet is called Mos Eisley) where they go out on a planet with a big planet that looks like Tatoo. There is a huge desert and they have some lightsabers. It's amazing how they keep them all in the desert.  There's a lot of action in this movie. Lots of shooting. Lots and lots of explosions.  This movie was so much fun to watch.  Star Wars was always my favorite part of Star Wars, but this movie really took it to another level.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The original version of this film was done on a shoestring. The budget was so meager that I've seen it shown on cable and not once did I hear the director, Joseph Hahn, give a hint as to how he wanted this picture to turn out. I remember that when this was made, he would call up every prop department in Hollywood to see what they were capable of producing at the time. In order to get the costumes to match the actors, he had to do a lot of alterations to the original designs. I have to say that even after all this time, I still don't think he realized what a great job he did. It is an epic, action film that should not be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have been waiting to see this movie for some time now and i finally got my chance to watch it at the BFI.   It is an epic story of a battle that takes place in the fjords of Norway and a beautiful story of two warriors from very different backgrounds who decide to join forces to face the greatest threat the world has ever seen.  A good story told with a few action set pieces and a very interesting character and a lovely soundtrack to listen to.  The film does not have any of the usual CGI that are usually seen in many action films but i think that they add something to the film.  It may seem a bit dated at times but it's still worth a watch.  Â  - I am going to start this review by saying that i was pleasantly surprised at the fact that I was able to find this movie at the big theatres.

This movie is great fun, and is an early example of the movie's action, which would become the norm in its later years. The way the character's dialogue changes, even for the most minor of moments is genius. And the special effects are fantastic.

This is a very interesting movie that is about how the government gets into the movies industry and makes a great movie.   If you are into old movies and think that the actors are too good to be true you will love this movie. If you have no interest in old movies but still want to see great acting go see this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie when it first came out and I was instantly hooked on the movie. The story about a guy who goes after a super hot girl is absolutely insane. He is always in the wrong place at the wrong time and is totally hopeless. I remember thinking how great it was when he finally manages to track her down and she comes to him at a club and has him hooked right then and there. When she finally gives him a call and tells him she was leaving town it was just such a rush to see the guy finally get what he wants. The sex scene was fantastic as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am sure there were many who did not know the name of the director, but he has produced some of the most underrated and best movies in the past 20 years.   For his follow-up to "Carnage", he chose a noir movie that would appeal to both fans of crime flicks and those who love a good story.  While this may seem a little on the slow side, "The Black Dahlia" has some great suspense scenes and is a fun movie.  It may have been his weakest film, but it is still a must-see.

It is set in the mid 1800's, is about a boy who must find a young girl's love. And he must find her at a time in the past where she and her lover were involved in an infamous act. However, the acting, acting, and acting in general was really good. I think he was really looking forward to making the film and he did it with real warmth and warmth. In fact, I would like to see more of this movie in the future because it was so well done.

You never really lose interest.  They were so good, they got the script and made it even better.  There's some really great action scenes in this film.  It may not be the best story, but it is the best action scene in the entire series.  If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to see it!   A must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My father was a fan of westerns so he gave me a copy of the movie for Christmas and I enjoyed it. My brother saw it, then my mom and I. My dad is a huge western fan and it was great to see this version of the western.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best film I have seen. I really thought I would be disappointed in it but I was not. The cast is great, the director is very professional, and the film is a good one.   I have watched the film multiple times in the last two years but this time I will not skip over it and watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie! The story is amazing and it is about a little boy and his dog who are out in the woods. The main point of the movie is that you will always see little Jack and he always wants to play. Jack is in his favorite spot where he is very comfortable. He is in the shade of a large tree and is totally hidden from sight. He will always have his toy that he can play with. He loves to play with this toy but he has a big dog and the dog won't play with him. They both play with their food but the dog gets tired of playing with Jack and takes off in the other direction.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great and funny movie about the dangers of trying to get on a football team, which is a really funny and light hearted movie. My family has it on VHS and I still laugh to this day.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a wonderful feeling about this movie that will never go away. You may feel that there are some things that are missed out on. For me there is an important scene of a car coming down a street. The camera is set to a close up of the cars and the driver (Lorraine Warren) is crying as she looks out of the window. I'm not really sure what happened but you get the feeling of what happened as the car approaches. The driver tries to make a turn and her eyes are almost closed. When she gets to the turn and sees the car still coming down the street she swerves and crashes into it head on. I felt really good about this scene. I hope that they bring her back for a sequel.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main story takes place in a modern-day city. There are a few other characters present but none of them are important enough to get their own scenes. It's interesting that all of the female characters have very revealing cleavage.   Â  This is the first horror movie I have seen where it is very clear that the director knows the genre and knows how to use it.  Â  There are multiple suspenseful scenes where the killer is stalking the city streets, waiting for his target to come by or have an important meeting, or be at a party or whatever.  But the killer still manages to be scary.  He is extremely well made and well acted. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It is a fun movie to watch. I loved the characters, especially the ones that were just teenagers. I also liked how it was done in a way to look like a movie on a TV. I think this is a good idea to get younger people into the movie world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My dad and I had to go to this movie because we were in the same city. I had never seen this movie but I remember it well because it was a great movie to watch with my dad. The story was about two guys who meet in the bar and have a good time and at one point both get drunk and the guy that was drunk is seen going down on a girl. It was a cool movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little worried about the film, but I couldn't really find a lot wrong with it. It had some beautiful cinematography, a very interesting plot line, and good acting. The music was also very nice. The only negative aspect of the film was the ending. The ending was really abrupt and it did not leave any impact on the characters.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great family adventure and a wonderful film.  If you love children, I'd recommend this film. I'm glad it didn't have a silly ending, but it would have been nice if we saw more of the movie in a more relaxed setting, so that we could learn more about the characters, their personalities, and the places where they are going.   It is worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot was great. The actor in the role was wonderful. The story was great, even if it had a lot of things that needed to be cut out or changed. If it was not for that, this would be an amazing movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie really has an interesting plot line, some very creative effects and a great soundtrack.   I have watched the movie two times now and the plot line keeps changing. At one point you think you are going to see a lot of "old time" stuff like in the old movies, but then you're led down a very confusing path that leaves you with nothing to say but the ending line.  I found it really strange that it was an old movie and I could never figure out how that was possible.  This movie has an amazing soundtrack, but I only watched this once and I have been sick for two weeks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie! It was great fun. We really needed something with which to spice up our vacation. I would be happy to recommend this movie to everyone.   I have the best seat in the house in this movie!!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had the chance to watch this on television. I must say this is an excellent adaptation. I also had the opportunity to watch it on the big screen. In this case the screen was not quite big enough so I had to watch the film on a little flat screen. The picture is very clear. The film was well acted and the plot was very compelling. It wasn't very easy to follow but the actors did a fine job. The special effects were excellent.   The film contains one of the finest acting performances I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are no words to describe how much I enjoyed this film, and how much it gave me hope that there is more to come.   It was so refreshing to see that we are not alone, that there are other sentient beings living in this universe, and we are capable of feeling the pain, happiness and happiness of others.  This film also showed us that there can be hope for the future and that there has to be a better way to live and deal with life as opposed to sitting down and accepting it.  It will change the way that we look at the world and our lives. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was amazed and really enjoyed this film. The plot is very intriguing and the film itself was quite enjoyable. The music in this film was great. I loved the voice work by Tony Todd and even the voice of the main character, Richard.    The film also had a nice look to it, a very unique look. The lighting was amazing, and even though it was all done in black and white it looked so good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie with my dad. He saw a TV show about the original movie and wanted me to see it. He didn't realize how much it changed the way he viewed movies. I don't remember the plot as I had seen it many times on TV, but I know that it wasn't a romantic comedy. It was a horror film with a supernatural element. It takes place in a small rural town where a young girl is attacked by a vampire and wakes up in a blood bath. Her father and her boyfriend are on their way to a nearby town when they are forced to confront the monster. I had never seen a vampire before and it was pretty terrifying. I like the movie and love the soundtrack. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason I haven't seen this movie is that the theater had only a couple of the early prints and we had to wait a long time for a digital copy to come along. I think they are getting better copies and digital downloads are getting easier. I wish they did a better job on the advertising. The first two trailers and two TV spots don't do the movie justice. It's a very good story, and the acting is good and the performances are very good. I look forward to more films like this. It reminds me of one of my favorite movies, "Mystery Train".
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is just amazing. Great story line, great acting, awesome action, and a lot of fun. The actors did not disappoint. I think they are the best the industry has to offer right now. I can't imagine another actor, no matter how great, can play this role. It's just a real shame he is not as good of an actor in "Rambo 5" or some of his other movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I was in elementary school I was really into horror movies. I was a really scaredy-cat and this movie really scared the crap out of me. That scared me even more because I was only a little kid.    This movie has really scary elements to it that just freak you out. The ending is really amazing, and has you shaking. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really surprised that I liked this film. When you put the whole film together, and have the whole cast on top of the movie, it's hard to beat this film for the special effects.   There are so many awesome and realistic images and creatures.  The movie really has everything it needs to make an amazing sci-fi thriller.  I just had to love it.  "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" is a sci- fi thriller starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Kate Winslet, and Sigourney Weaver. The story is set in 20,100 Fathom space where a ship crashes into the Earth after a collision.  A group of scientists find the ship and are sent to search it for the remains of the crew.  They find the crew alive but have no idea who they are or how to contact them.  It has a really great story that's very suspenseful, which is one of the things I really liked about this film, and also it makes the film go much faster than the usual sci- rf movies.  Although there are many sci- sci- phic pictures and movies that can be compared to this film "The beast from 20,,000 fathoms", this is by far the best sci-fantasy film that I have ever seen.  This movie really made me feel like I was a part of the film, as I could really feel the emotion the people felt when they were on the ship, and when they found out the reason why they were stuck there.  Definitely a must- see for sci- am films, it really puts a lot of time and effort into making the movie look and feel as realistic as possible. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You never know who you are going to run into at the right moment. I had the misfortune of seeing this movie before it was released on the big screen and that was a good thing.Â  I would recommend this movie to anyone.   The acting is fantastic and this is an action packed film that you won't want to miss.  I just love the way this movie came together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've only seen this one, and while I've always been a fan of the characters, this movie didn't quite hit the mark for me. The film is pretty solid for the most part, although the screenplay is a bit hard to follow sometimes. This one's an entertaining story that shows some of the good and bad of this world. This is definitely a fun little film that's worth watching for the laughs.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has great acting and an amazing plot. I am a fan of science fiction and action movies and this movie has some really cool stunts and sequences.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was quite impressed with this movie. It is so well produced with really good acting and good editing. The acting was well done with lots of different characters. And the directing by William Dieterle is great. I like how the film has different things that are done to make the plot seem more believable. If you watch this movie and get bored then just wait until a few weeks after it came out and the second film will have the same story. I think the idea of the story was brilliant and really the only thing that was really different. If I ever want to see another movie like this I will buy it right here. I really hope this movie gets a big theatrical release in America to make it more marketable for a big budget.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie isn't good, but it's not bad either.   A fun, colorful action film.  It has a lot of fun stuff going on, including some really nice special effects and special effects stunts.  I like the music in the movie.  The story does get somewhat convoluted, but you can't really blame the director for that.  Overall, a fun movie, with some fun special effects.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was funny. There were two major problems with it:  1) The movie didn't really make sense;   2) The acting was awful.  A lot of times, the acting was a joke, like when the guy goes up to a girl who is on her cell phone, while he was sitting on a toilet. He didn't have a chance to look at the girl at all, and he says "Hey, bitch. Let's go.  The first scene of the movie had this guy playing a doctor. He says to a woman that his patient just went to the bathroom. He goes in the bathroom and comes out with his penis gone and a bloody handkerchief.   There were also some scenes where he was on the phone trying to get back on the girl, and she was trying to call the doctor.  Even the music they played was lame. There was only one song in the movie, and it was a rock song. The movie is about a guy who falls in love with a girl that's got a penis and a vagina.  And while they are trying to hook up, the guy is running around the hospital, trying to find his penis. He eventually finds it, and the movie ends!  The only good part in this movie is the ending, but if you have problems with the writing or acting, this movie isn't worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really loved this movie. I have to thank my mom who picked this one up at the store for me. I knew that I had to get it, it was that good.   The best part was that this movie didn't have much sex. I really like that and it's something that I wouldn't have expected from a sex comedy. The cast and crew really made this movie and I really hope to see more of this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little worried about watching this movie, and my biggest fear was that it would be too over-the-top, but instead, the plot was really funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was my first time watching the movie and it did not disappoint. It has a real solid and strong story that stays with you, with very interesting characters. My only complaint is that at one point it got too dark and intense, but that's probably a byproduct of me being out of the room for the first time ever, but the movie was still very good.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie in a special screening of it at the San Francisco International Film Festival and the director was actually there and it was very enjoyable, but I couldn't help thinking the film was better with a more modern, more interesting, and less dated production. I also thought it was interesting that the film had a lot of music that wasn't in the book. The acting was excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a great movie. The cast was all great, and the cinematography and editing was excellent.   The story was not the strongest, but it held together well.  The best thing about this movie was the ending.  I felt that the film's ending was a little too simple. I like movies that go beyond that.  It is worth seeing just for this ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was quite a challenge to make it look like a movie that was set in the 1930's in Italy, and when the film was all done, we had a good laugh at the expense of the film's production.   The picture is full of life and the costumes are beautiful, with the best of them being in white.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I enjoyed it, despite the terrible acting.   The film does a good job of building up its atmosphere to create a real suspense, which was enhanced by the amazing soundtrack, which could be considered a real movie-film score, although a bit too melodic.  It is a really creepy and suspenseful film, and is a true horror classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent movie with a great cast.  I have to say that the acting was excellent.  It was really hard for me to figure out who all of the actors were in this movie.  For the best part of the movie I have never seen the characters and it is such a treat to see them again after such a long time.    - I think that this is one of the most underrated films of the 70's.  - It is an interesting story that you won't see too often on TV. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The originality, the humor, the tension, the love-triangle, the romance, the atmosphere and the characters; these are the three components that make the film so unique. The story of two young lovers in a small Texas town who fall in love, are lost in the woods, and then decide to reunite after some years in Mexico, is fascinating and heartfelt.   If you enjoy suspense, romantic comedy, love and suspense, you will find this film irresistible.  And when you see it in 3D, you see just how real it is.  One of the few "great" horror films, and still one of the best.

The story is a little slow, but it's a very enjoyable and very good film.

I give this movie five stars because it really is a great film and it is really a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen "Fatal Attraction" in a few years but I recently saw it in the theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of a group of young people that have the unfortunate fortune of attending a prestigious prep school in the midwest, where the best are hidden away, it's as much a comedy as it is a drama, and is very well put together. It's filled with well developed characters, a great cast of voice actors, and a plot that isn't overly complicated, but the main characters are all so well developed that it gives you a great understanding of their lives. I can't tell you how much I appreciated the cast of characters, all of whom really did give the movie a sense of reality, and I found myself enjoying the movie more and more as I watched it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so pleased to say that this is an excellent movie. It's so easy to relate to and it makes you feel like you're going back home with your parents. The kids are all really funny. I loved the character of Jimmy who had a great time in the house and was the kind of friend who just sat in the back yard playing and watching the neighbors kids. I wish it was in the movie theaters. I've seen it so many times in the theater I've forgotten all about it.   A great movie that everyone should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a well made movie, but I can't help but feel that it's a bit too short. The story follows the life of an African-American girl who was sent to live with her abusive mother in an urban ghetto, with some help from a man named Bill who helped her learn how to fend for herself.  I'm not a huge fan of the exploitation genre, but when it's done well it can be very entertaining.   For an interesting movie you should really pay attention to the interviews with the actors and actresses, including a very entertaining interview with the actress who plays the heroine.  This movie is great if you enjoy a fun adventure, or you just want something entertaining to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a film I recommend anyone who wants to experience the true story of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" watch. The story of the movie is a very good one and is worth seeing. The only thing that is kind of an issue for me with this movie is that the original English dub did not sound so great to me. It seemed a lot of the dialogue was out of sync with what we hear on the film and also had some pretty obvious mistakes. But for the most part the cast does a good job and it still sounds pretty good to this day.

On October 22nd, 1962, they were on a train going to California when they were ambushed and both John and Daniel were killed in an ambush. Daniel's body was found several days later. The film explores the aftermath of their tragic murder and the murder of three other rock groupies who also died in the ambush.   A great film about a fascinating band.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you love the movies "Dawn of the Dead" or "Day of the DEAD" or any of the other horror movies from this era, this one's for you.   "The Strangers" is a movie from about 1980, that takes the classic story of "Day Of The Dead" and adds some new elements to it.  It's a real old movie and is really entertaining.  The plot is similar to "Day", and is much darker and more realistic than the old one.  "Strangers" has some great actors and you can tell they love their work.  This movie has a little bit of everything.  Lots of gore, some good performances, a little dark humor, some great performances.  All around a good, fun, and memorable movie.

This is one of the best action movies to come out in years. I haven't seen many action movies in years so it was great to see someone like Schwarzenegger bring this style of acting to it. I'm a huge fan of The Rock and this is a perfect addition to his filmography.    He is a top notch action star. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm sure that you've already seen the movie , it's good, but it has its flaws.   Unfortunately, there is very little action in the movie. The film is about a little girl, Alice, and her brother. The father was absent from his daughter's life for the most part of the movie and this lead to a very sad and isolated atmosphere, this movie would have been perfect if they had gone further and had the whole family come to live with the grandparents.  For me, the movie is a good way to escape from some family problems, especially for kids like this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, it's an old movie that has never really been updated.

A great movie with excellent acting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm so thankful that I found this movie and found it worth watching.   The story has some elements that I think will work well for an older audience, and I think the actors can really bring the performance out of each other.  The soundtrack is great.  When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a bad movie because it felt like it was just trying to be a romantic comedy.  But after watching it again, it's very different.  It's not a romantic movie by any means, but I think it still has a lot of charm that a little romance can add to a movie.  For the time, this movie is very good.  I've already seen it twice in the theater, and have watched it on DVD several times.  My recommendation to anyone who wants to watch a fun romantic movie with actors they know.

The movie was based on the real events of a real man who was a member of the National Guard who was killed in the Korean War. I always loved movies like that so much. It's great to have something like that re-created so well.    This movie is a lot of fun. I don't think there is another movie like it out there, even for fans of the old movies. The actors are good and the writing is funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a girl that was molested by her father when she was a baby, and when she's a kid, she and her mom move to a small town in the middle of nowhere. She has a great character, so she gets caught up in things and gets caught in a drug war.   A very good movie about the abuse of power and drugs that happen to people who are too weak to stand up to people that want to control them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I was a child, my grandmother and father bought me a film ticket from a movie theatre in the town where I grew up. I was never a big movie person, but I would watch it as often as I could. The film was in fact called The Great Train Robbery. I knew nothing about it until my late teens, when I learned that it was one of my father's favorite movies. The reason that I've seen it so many times is that it always stays with me. I'm sure there are many other films that I would have loved to have seen with my father, but the Great Train robbery is my favorite. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been a film lover for years. I'm not a big "franchise" guy, but I always enjoy any of the action packed thrillers. The original "Die Hard" was just such an experience. The fact that it was so low budget and with such a unique story, is the reason why I had fun every time I saw it. The movie had such an adrenaline rush to it that I think a lot of people enjoyed the movie a lot. This movie was the start of my love for the action genre.    - October 19, 2014Die Hard

If you want a real thriller then watch this movie!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last few years have really not been great. My father was a very good actor in the movies of the 80's, and as a result he became very ill and suffered many health problems over the years. It was hard on his family. I went to him at his home in the country to say goodbye and let him know we loved him and that we miss him every day. After a couple of days, we went to visit him. His condition had deteriorated so much that we just decided to stop, but his wife was there and asked us to stay. My younger brother was 6 months old at the time and I remember telling my dad to just "live it up" and make it a nice retirement while he was still alive. My dad was always about money and my brother was very young and couldn't understand the reasons for it. Now that he's gone, my sister and I have to take care of him, and it's taken a big toll on our family. This movie is an honor for me to watch, and for my dad's family to see. I'm very sad that I won't get the chance to see my dad again, but it's just been hard not to see him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never really wanted to see a horror movie, but since I saw this movie, I'm looking forward to my next scary movie viewing.   I loved this movie.  It was scary, but not in a "scary movie scary" way.  I don't know about horror movies that are more of a shock, but this is just a "not scary at all" scary movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie, and it has great music and good acting. There is something about the music that gets in the audience's blood and makes them want to get up and dance.   A great action movie with a good story and a nice ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a story about a family in love and trying to raise a family. The movie is very sweet and very touching. I'm glad it ended on a happy note.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good comedy with a good story.   It is a bit long at 2hrs 50 mins but I guess that is because it is a family comedy.  It has great jokes that are well written.  The special effects are very impressive and good.  There are a few very funny scenes and a good ending.  I really liked this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is brilliant.   It captures the essence of the 60s, and the music is great, especially in the scenes with the boys in the motel.  The best part of this movie is the part where the boys are all hanging out in the pool, but the camera cuts off right as they get in the water, so you don't know if they are swimming or hanging out.  This is a great movie, it's a real trip and a good laugh.   Rated: R The film was produced in 1966 but released in 1967, so it is a prequel, but I didn't think it was very good.  It has one of the best soundtracks ever, and it looks great.  I think it would be a much better film today if it was made in 1969. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I think it would work well as a short film that you show to your friends.   The story is very simple and well told. I'd say it's like something you'd see on a kids TV show.  They made a movie about people who just moved into a new neighborhood, and it's nice to see it happen. The movie was a bit long, but that only adds to the charm.  Overall, it's a good looking movie and I thought it did an excellent job of bringing a little bit of life to the world of New York. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie really helped me understand the importance of a family.  This is an honest, sensitive and beautiful film which gives you an insight into a family that just wants to live a normal life.    It is a great film to watch with a small group of friends.  The cinematography of the film is beautiful.  One of my favourite films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent, entertaining film.  The characters, the story, the plot - all are fantastic. The humor and wit, the chemistry between the characters and the music, are just all things that I love.    The only thing that kept me from loving this film was the length of the movie.  But this isn't the most important thing about this film. I loved every minute of it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was good and fun and I got a kick out of the idea of it, but I don't think the execution was up to par.   It was a good idea to have the movie be on a small boat with a bunch of people, but they all did pretty much the same thing, which is to look out the little windows of the boat for anything they can see.  I know that sounds lame, but that's really all there was to it.  What's more fun than being on a boat with other people?  This was the last film I saw from the director of Memento, and it's been a while since I've seen anything from that movie.  The acting was pretty good and the music was pretty nice.  Overall, I'd say this is a fun film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is based on a true story that happened in the 1940's and tells the story of the three young girls, one black, one white, and one Japanese. They all were girls on a fishing trip. They were going to the Philippines for a few days to look for wild fish. They had nothing but a tent, a small boat, and a few bottles of water. The three girls all lived together in one big tent and the two Japanese girls were at the other end of the tent. When the girls were getting ready to take off the boat the girls went to the other side of the camp, where the other Japanese girl, had hidden some food and some money. It was late and they didn't have much time to spend there. The girls went back to the boat, which was now loaded with food. They told the Japanese girl to leave the food for the other girls to eat when they returned to the beach. The Japanese girl did not leave the other two girls food but instead went down to the bottom of the ocean. She came back with a large amount of money in her hand. As the girls all went to return their food to the girls at the boat they were waiting for her on the beach where she had disappeared. The boat was now very heavy, and the other boat was very old. All three girls went ashore on the rocks at the end of a long, rocky beach. They looked up and noticed a white boat. It had a sail on the back and was very high. The only thing to be seen on the boat were two old women standing on the front and back of the boat. One of the girls said "Look!" and one of the Japanese girls said the same thing. Both of them were white. The other two Japanese women were standing close by, not noticing. The girl on the top of the vessel was dressed entirely in white. When they approached the boat it started sailing toward them.   It was only two hours later that the girls saw the boat return and that the three women were still standing there on the shore. One was standing on top of it and the others were walking along side the boat on their feet. The white women asked the girls "What are you doing down there? Who were you with?" The two white women were the only ones who knew the real story of their story.  The women are now in their late 80's and are in their 80's again.  It's the story I always wanted
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "B" (I think) is the best action film I've seen on the big screen. A solid action movie from the days of the original Die Hard, starring a great cast, including Sean Connery (I never got to see him as James Bond, but I always thought he was awesome), Michael Jai White, Bruce Willis, and Sam J. Jones. The first half is solid, but the second half is when they went for "crazy". The explosions are wild and impressive, with a good mix of slow and fast. I loved the way they handled the destruction, with great editing and visual effects. Also, the special effects are really great in this movie.   It's great to see this kind of action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think a lot of people didn't think that this would be a great movie for children but they needn't have worried. The animation was good and the voice acting was great. There were some really funny scenes, the kids are very sweet and the adults were good.  Â I can't say that there are any adult characters, but there are some funny jokes, including one where one kid is stuck with a frog (I wish the adult characters came more often, not just in this movie, but they really came in handy later on).   The only problem I had with the movie was the ending. I know that when a director ends the movie with a joke it isn't a great ending, but in this case it wasn't funny at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie! It was an easy favorite of mine in high school and it still is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is an excellent film. It is a true story of an airplane crash, with real survivors.   I have seen a number of airline disasters, including an Italian Air crash in 1969, but none have been as true to life. There is no sound in this film.  The movie is well done and the passengers are well portrayed.  I was very happy to see this film, and I am glad I saw it before they started making more movies like it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not one to look for an "action" movie, so when I saw this on television and read the description, I jumped on it. I liked the movie. Not enough violence and gore, but that didn't stop me. The acting was very good, as was the special effects. The story was very entertaining, but I don't remember the "story". It was very fast-paced and violent. The only real problem I had with the movie was the lack of anything resembling a plot.   If you're looking for a good fight scene, this isn't it. But if you want a good action film, look no further.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A well-done film with a very unique style. It's got a lot going for it, but it's the best story on the subject that I have come across and it's a real treat to see.    - "Dylan is a young black boy living in the West Virginia city of Morgantown. After his father has committed suicide, Dylan and his sister, Maggie, who is a black woman, go to live with their grandparents. While Maggie has not yet decided to become a prostitute, she is a talented artist. They spend their days practicing and painting. They take a trip to Paris and take a shower together. Soon Dylan begins to have sexual problems, and Maggie's father finds out. The two fall in love. In the midst of this, Dylan gets involved in a drug-running scheme, which ends badly. Maggie is also involved and tries to help him. At the end of the day, Dylan tells Maggie to leave him. She does and leaves Morgantow with her friend, but Dylan sees her leaving. He drives after her, but crashes into a tree and is killed. Maggie becomes obsessed with the story of his death. She and her friend then drive into the mountains and Dylan's skeleton lies on the ground in front of her." - IMDb

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I liked it very much - I don't believe I've seen anything so original in such a short time... It's one of those rare movies which seems completely fresh and new.Â  There are only a few bad parts: 1) the title - the whole story sounds so much better as "Escape from New York"; 2) the acting -Â  the only thing which I couldn't agree with was the voice of the villain - "Murderer", but I think it was because he had nothing to do with it."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had the chance to see this movie at the film festival in Toronto, and it's a really great film! The score is fantastic, especially the final section when it goes all out and the sound effects are just awesome. It's a movie that deserves a place on my collection of great music films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie this is! The film has a lot of action packed parts and it's one of the best movies in the "Shawshank Redemption" series. It also has some great acting and good humor.   The story of the film revolves around a man named Billy who is out of work and in the middle of a fight to get back in the Army. A gang of criminals (the Redhawks) have taken over a liquor store (Redhead's) and they want to rob him of all the money he has. As Billy tries to get the gang out of the store, one of them hits him on the head with a heavy object and knocks him out. The gang then uses a ladder to get to Billy and take him back to his place.  Billy wakes up and realizes that he is on the top of a ladder and he is tied up and he doesn't know why.  The gang members are on the other side of a bar and as he's talking to his girlfriend he realizes that his captors are watching and talking about him. They come up to him and ask him to show them where he is.  As he climbs up the ladder, he sees a window on the side and climbs through it.  When he's out of view, his friends come running up the stairs. When he comes back to the bar, the Redhawks come up and rob him again and he escapes.  After a long and tough fight, the gang comes to him in a bar full of other gangsters and they get him tied up. He's asked for his name and when he shows his badge, his head is blown off.  In the middle, there is a long shot and Billy is in the back of a truck with his head blown off and the Redhawk on the hood.  I can't say that I'm a big fan of "Shawshank Redemption", but I loved it and it is still one of my favorite movies.

I would love to see this movie on a big screen but unfortunately I'm not in that fortunate position and have to use my laptop for the movie.   This is not a great movie but it's an entertaining one.  The acting is not so great but that's fine.  I think I could take a lot of great pictures from this movie if I was able to take enough pictures of the camera.  As for the music, the ending is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are some truly remarkable and moving scenes in this film.   The acting is superb.  The film also benefits from the use of the silent film style.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If I'm being honest, I hadn't heard of this film when I was planning on watching it. I'd always wanted to watch it, but never really wanted to get too involved, I guess. This was an "in the neighborhood" movie, I believe. I love watching movies at my local theater (I hate going out of my way to go see them, they just don't work for me) and a movie like this, and I knew that it had a good shot at making it.  The only problems I had was the sound, and it's one of those movies that you have to be in the middle of the action or you'll have no idea what's going on. That didn't stop me from enjoying myself, however.   And, that said, I really do recommend this movie, and a few others on this list, it's great. I've never seen a film that's as entertaining, funny, and well acted as this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've just watched "The Little Shop of Horrors" and the only thing I can say is... I LOVE it! I can't believe this is my first time seeing the film but I just fell in love with the movie. The story is a bit hard to follow at first but the twists and turns of the story make it easy to follow. This movie has been shown on many movies and television specials and has made an impact on the horror film genre. This has to be a movie that a lot of us should watch in our lives because it's scary as hell! The actors, actresses and crew did such a great job with this movie that it's not hard to watch this horror film and not get a feeling of horror. The movie also has an extremely well thought out story that made the movie very well acted.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was a must see. I had never seen the movie before. My wife and I had just got married, but we had never had sex and didn't really want to do it. Our sex life was always a mess and we were trying to stay away from the more painful parts of it because of the messiness of it. We were very interested in watching this movie because I was curious and my wife was in love with the main character. We watched it for about four hours. It's interesting that all the sex was in the bathroom, not on the bed.   The scene with the dog and the neighbor was very cute.

The production quality was really top notch and the music really fits the scene.   This film is a good watch.  The acting and story make you feel good about this movie, even though it was really difficult to understand the events of the movie.  This is a great movie. I recommend it for anyone who likes a good mystery movie, with a good cast of people and a beautiful set of locations. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie when I was in the 3rd grade and it was one of the movies I watched in high school that really opened my eyes to the fact that people could be kind, and do great things for other people when given the chance. I didn't even realize there was a problem until it was too late, and when I realized what was going on I decided not to let it happen again.   My favorite scene was at the end when the cop came into the house, because the girl is telling the cop that her dad has been dead for 3 days and she doesn't care. The cop told her to go out there and say she's the one who died. The girl goes back inside to look for her daddy, she sees him laying on the kitchen table, he says "I'm still here" and falls off the table.  I also enjoyed the ending. It was a beautiful scene.  The movie is very violent and very intense.  This is not the kind of movie that you watch just because it's on TV, it has to be seen live. I watched it in the late 80's and I was a very little girl then, and I remember just being very scared and wanting to go hide under my mother's arm so I could get out of there as soon as possible. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best American film in the last 25 years!   My god, it's a gem.   It was a perfect movie from beginning to end.  In the '80s and '90s, there was not a lot of action movies that were like this. It has the '70s era, like the movies of Robert Mitchum and Robert Forster.  It has some great performances, and even some great action, with great fights.  The plot is not a story with a beginning, middle, and end. It's just action, and suspense, and character development. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was really entertaining for what it is. I am not one to watch a movie with the sole purpose of seeing the actors. If the script was good, then that is all that matters. This is a movie that is about two young boys who do not want to be in the military because of some silly "ideals." I know that sounds corny, but that is the way I felt when watching this movie. It was good to see two boys who were like "finally" being able to see what it's like to be "soldiers". They were never really that good at playing this part, but the two kids did their best. They acted in a very realistic way and showed how important it is to be able to do something that is your true calling.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â This is the best adaptation of the old classic, The Wild Bunch.    Â  I'm glad that this film got released in its original cut, I don't think that it would've been made without the original film's negative feedback.  For those who haven't seen this film, or the TV miniseries, don't expect this to be like the others.  Director John Landis is a masterful storyteller and he brings his talent to a great film.  This is an epic story that has everything, the brutality, the love, the sex and the drugs.  It's hard to believe that the original production was such a commercial success.  I really wanted to see more of the characters from the miniserie, so I am glad that Landis expanded the story.  As much as I enjoyed this film I'm always glad when films that I liked get remade because it brings the original into the public's eye again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was good and is one of the few of its kind. Great story and a very nice cast.   The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that it was set in the 1960's and I would like to have seen more about that era. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening scene of The Last Stand was one of the most gripping and disturbing things I've seen. The story takes place in a small town in New Mexico where a local sheriff is on his last days, and his last hope lies with the FBI, who need his help to find out what happened to the town's only child, and who may be the mastermind behind it all.   This is one of those films where the first time you see the film, you will find it hard to believe it is real. The film looks fantastic, and the editing and sound effects are amazing.  The acting is perfect. The acting throughout the film is really good. It is great to see a real cast of characters, and they are all very believable.  My only complaint about the film was the ending. The final scene didn't seem as well thought out as it should have been. This film was really hard to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie, which is better with a good soundtrack, and for those who are familiar with the "Halloween" movies (and the remake of "Halloweentown", which is just as good), will get some great scares. The story is the same and the characters are the same, but the horror elements are improved (though it's still good and not a parody of the Halloween movie genre). I loved it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this for the first time in movie theaters, about 8 months ago, and fell in love with it from the first frame. My only complaint would be that it lacks some of the more classic horror movies that I used to see on TV and film as a kid, like "The Thing", "The Evil Dead", and "Nightmare on Elm Street".   My favorite parts of this movie are the "The House of the Rising Sun", where he gets attacked by the killer's goons while the family is away, and the "Swinging Door".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best way to describe this movie is as a dream where you are watching a documentary on a war in the middle east.   In one of the most surreal scenes of the movie a young american man named Adam is driving an armored truck to the border when suddenly the truck is hit by an improvised explosive device that goes off with a bang!   And as the camera pans down to the boy he appears to be in agony as if a bomb went off under his vehicle.  The young man was later interviewed by a reporter named Bill and told about this terrifying event.  Adam said that the whole event felt like a dream.  Another interesting part of the film is how the american soldiers in the field act as if they were living a fantasy.  This movie is a must watch if you love war documentaries and want to see something that is truly frightening!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was looking for a decent horror film, I had watched "The Haunting" by Tod Browning. I didn't like it at all. The only horror flick I ever saw was "The Exorcist". The movie is a mess. I think they shot this movie in the 80s or 90s. Some shots were too dark, some were very grainy. Some were just awkward. It was just a bad movie. I guess the actor could not remember his lines, because they were so bad, so they re-shot. I am not sure how the people involved in the making of the movie got into it, but it wasn't me. I was glad when they finally found a distributor for this movie and put it out in DVD. I did not buy it, because it is really bad.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " I just finished reading the book "The Time Machine" which the movie is based on and its based on the novel by H.G. Wells. The Time Machine was written in 1895, and the movie was made in 1959. The film is very entertaining, and very realistic.   My wife and I watched the movie before going to bed. The scenes with the traveling through time are very realistic, and you will be taken back in time.  "   The movie is interesting because of its realism. If you don't know about the novel you can watch the movie and the film will give you a full background of the author and of Wells.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you say this movie is not the best, it's not an insult because it's well made, and the ending is absolutely perfect. The acting is good (Cameron, Scott, Anderson) and the story makes sense.   The one thing you need to know about this movie: the ending of the movie, well, it doesn't really make sense. For all the characters it should be more like a TV show. It's like they're making it up and then they change the ending. But the ending should have been more of a show.  For people that love The X-Files, this is a good one and worth watching.  I highly suggest this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just came back to this film for a new Blu-ray. When I heard that it was made by Universal, I was not sure I would like it as much as my previous Universal films. The reviews that I have read do not make me feel that way. I feel that this is the best Universal film to date. I was so impressed by the film and how well the actors acted that I am sure I will watch it over and over again and I will be looking for this film on the big screen someday as well.   What I liked best about this film was the use of music, the actors, the location. I hope that the Blu-rays come out in the near future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been watching movies with my mom for the last 25 years. It's a family tradition. Last night when my mother came home, she asked if I wanted to watch "The Secret of Kells." I said yes and then she got excited. "It's all over the internet! You're going to love it!" she said. I looked at her, puzzled. "What?" I asked. "The movie's going to be on the Discovery Channel." And I'm looking at her and saying, "I don't think I want to watch that." I'm only 7 years old, but I didn't want to see that "thing" on Discovery. I didnï¿½t want to hear the word "fantasy." We spent the rest of the evening laughing. I was hooked on this movie from the first moment. I had to see it again, right then and there.  What I like most about this movie is that it's all about how amazing a storyteller is.  Itï¿½s funny, suspenseful, sexy, emotional and a bit touching at times.   The movie also has a wonderful theme of redemption. It also has several different endings. This is a must watch for any Disney movie fan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was awesome! The story is great, I really liked how it was done in a very cinematic way. I liked how the camera focused on characters that you would never think of seeing. I also liked that I didn't see a lot of dialogue as I was so immersed in the film.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to admit that this movie did not leave my mind for long. It is a nice story, but it leaves one too puzzled about how we got here. I would like to know how the American Government would react if their airplane was shot down. Maybe the Russians did it, but I cannot see how the United States would believe that we did it. The story of the crash seems to be a little too perfect.   A good time, good actors, a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The great thing about this movie is that it not only does not take itself too seriously but is more than a bit amusing as well. The acting, direction, and music all work in concert to create a very unique experience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An interesting, well-made film. The first half, which is about the history of the Vietnam war, is quite interesting.   In the second half of the film, when the conflict comes to an end, a young man is involved in a car accident and is taken away by the military.  I really like the characters. They are all very likable, even if they are not exactly as good as they appear.  Very well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have never seen anything quite like this film and I hope it won't be my last. I was really surprised by the way the film was shot. I don't like many of the more elaborate camera tricks and special effects, but the picture is incredibly detailed. There were so many amazing shots throughout the film that I had to take a break and look around for a while. A lot of people I know had to wait to see this movie for a long time. If it was made on a big budget I think it would have been better. I loved all the characters in this film. Especially Jack Nicholson's. He was so wonderful as the detective trying to catch the killer. I wish I had the chance to see the rest of the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never thought I would see a John Landis movie but the only problem with this movie is the acting. It is all done by just John Landes and John Schlesinger (if you want to see them in a movie, go to a movie theatre).   But the movie is really cool. It does not matter if you love the horror genre or not, this is the type of movie that really works.    It really is a good action movie and it shows some action in it.  The special effects were pretty good and the actors in this were great.  I love this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my opinion, this is a perfect movie. It's a story about a couple who don't quite understand what their relationship is. The wife has always hated her husband, and has done everything she could to bring him down. But his job is to run a very complicated nuclear reactor that supplies power to hundreds of thousands of people. He takes the love and respect he deserves very seriously and is willing to take risks for his family. A couple who has been in love for so many years can be at each other's throats for a simple disagreement. Yet in the end, their love is stronger than anything they ever could have imagined. I love the scene where they kiss at a wedding. The two go to a park, look at the sunset, and fall in love again. I'm amazed that this movie is a family comedy with a plot that works so well. It has humor and heart and a good plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is good, the only problem is that it is a bad film in a way. But hey, it isn't like the film is an epic story about a hero trying to get to the top of his own mountain. This is a slow burner with good acting and a beautiful score. If you haven't seen this film before, you might enjoy it. If a little boring, it is still well worth seeing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very entertaining and funny movie from 1970. The characters are all likable and I can't believe how far ahead of its time this movie was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â There is no way this movie can be called a "horror" movie. This movie is not scary at all. The only thing that scares you is seeing people walking around after this movie.   It is not a good horror movie. The acting is good. The characters are good. However, this movie is NOT scary. This was a big budget film that was made for one movie. There were many other scenes that were WAY better than this movie was. I wish I was just given the movie to watch it because the acting is decent. I would watch the movie again but NOT recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not a huge fan of the first one, but this one is much better!   The actors are very good, the songs are a lot more upbeat and danceable, and the songs they do have are better than the original, especially the ballad.   This movie is a lot different from the first, which had more of a crime movie feel to it.  It has more of an action/drama feel, with a little romance mixed in, but it is not really the same. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you've ever seen The Blues Brothers then you know that it was about a family on the run from the law.   There's no doubt that John Landis and his team are masters at capturing the essence of a wild west town.  And this is no different.  The main character, Rusty (played by Peter Boyle), is a poor, drunk blacksmith who is desperate to find a wife and get himself out of his horrible situation.  Rusty is a bit of an ass and a troublemaker who gets in and out of trouble all the time.  He also happens to have a horse that has been kicked off him.  I really don't think you can go wrong with this one.

But I'm glad I did as it is a very good movie. I love the fact that the film takes the story from the bible and presents it in a way that is accessible to modern audiences. The performances are all top-notch and it makes for an enjoyable watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard so many people raving about this film over the years that I almost felt like I was witnessing a classic film. And it sure was, with a plot twist that was well put together. The acting was so good, especially by the cast. And the writing is a real treat for those who don't normally see the darker side of movies like this.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "One of the few movies that doesn't follow a pattern - there's no 'plot' as such, but I do enjoy watching how a family reacts to tragedy, and how these reactions and the people around them change.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The first two-thirds of the movie are just a steady stream of images of people, the way they were always shot. There is no suspense, no action, just people talking to each other. But then they start to run around in a maze, and the movie goes crazy. The shots change constantly and there is so much action. It's almost a science-fiction movie. The movie takes place in outer space. It was very expensive and complicated to shoot. They were looking at a big space station orbiting the moon and they did it for about $80 million. They used special effects to make the actors go across the screen. They also did a lot of special effects in space. They didn't use special effects for anything else."  - David Letterman, January 29, 1975   I loved this movie. It had a great cast and was well shot. I was just amazed at how awesome it looked. It looks like a real spaceship. It really took me back to my days on a space station in the late 1970s. I had a chance to see the movie when I was at Universal Studios recently, but my daughter kept looking at the screen and telling me it wasn't real. I couldn't figure out why. She was wrong. I really did have a chance last year when we went to my old house in the Hollywood Hills. It used to be the home of Charlie Chaplin, and it was all covered with his movies. I think the movie was filmed there, but we didn't get a chance.  "The movie had a very special cast and a very high production value. It cost $25 million to make, but it was still very cheap, even if the actors spent a fortune on their costumes."

Even though there's an ending I didn't see coming, it's one of the best I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "In the wake of a horrible terrorist attack on a shopping mall in London, a British secret service agent (Robert Carlyle) is sent to find the killer. The real killer is, of course, himself. Carlyle plays a highly skilled operative who can find the truth but can't find a way out of his own dilemma. There is a beautiful, chilling sequence at the end that takes the audience into the mind of a terrorist, as he is thinking of the people he has killed. We are also left with the thought that perhaps Carlyle is himself responsible for the terrorist killings."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My mother has always been a die hard fan of the horror genre. So when I heard that a new classic was coming out on the 20th anniversary of the film I finally jumped on it. She loved it!   I thought it was pretty good!  I'm not sure why she didn't like it until now.   The film begins with a mysterious man in the back of a car, he's obviously very sick. When a man gets out and starts yelling at him. A doctor comes out of the house behind him. The man sees him and gets frightened and goes inside the house. He quickly puts the gun down when the doctor opens the door. The doctor says " I don't know you" the man replies "I know you."   There's a bunch of other men that get out and begin to beat up the doctor until the man goes back inside. The rest of the men get in and the doctor gets knocked over by one of them.  They go outside and he shoots the man once. Then another man comes out and he just walks away.  The next thing you know a big bad guy has shot the doctor and is now trying to run away. The next man comes up to the doctor. The guy who shot the other man and the guy with the pistol are talking. The two men start to fight and it's all over in a few seconds. The other man takes off running.  It's not a great movie, but it's a great time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I've said in previous reviews, I enjoyed this movie. However, the movie is too long for its own good, and I had to wait for a long stretch between the first and second acts. This is why I feel it was necessary to put the film in the 2nd act. I don't think it would have worked if it had ended after the first act.   The film had a great script and the cast did an excellent job at playing their characters. The cast is pretty much an all-star cast and it showed in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I first saw this film, I thought it was one of those silly "B" rated teen comedies. When I went back to see it at the "greatest of all times" theater, I realized it's a solid and entertaining film. It has a great story line that moves at a great pace. It also has the usual humor and fun of a movie made by the masters at the time, such as Mel Brooks, Robert Altman, and Billy Wilder. I still laugh every time the camera catches a couple kissing and the camera goes inside of the car window. The music is really nice too.    I hope that we get to see this film again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was pretty good and well worth watching.  The music was well done and the acting was good.  This is a good family movie and even a kids movie.    There are no acting flaws, just very young actors who are still figuring out what they are doing.  They are not acting as adults but acting as kids so they are sometimes immature and it shows on some of their faces.  A little bit younger actors would have had a harder time at the movie but it was still pretty good.

It is a different take on the story of Star Wars, and while it is not great, it is at least a good version of the Star Wars universe.   It has some action, but not enough to be boring.  My only complaint would be that they cut out all of the scenes with the old Luke and Han together.  If you want a good Star Wars movie, this is it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really looking forward to this. I've seen the trailer, seen the photos, seen all the trailers, but when it came to watching it in theaters, I had a very mixed experience.  The quality of the picture was very good. I watched it at the theater in 3D.  I felt like it was in 3-D. I didn't have that problem with the movie in theaters.  At first, it was really hard to hear the dialog, but I eventually got used to it. The acting in the movie was pretty good.  When I watched the movie with my wife, I felt pretty awkward. The movie was very close to what it was supposed to be.   It felt like there was a lot of talking going on.  While watching the movie, I thought it was very weird that it was the same people who had the last movie and they all had different roles and different parts.  We never saw the actors together in real life, so it was strange watching the same group of people act as a unit.  Overall, it wasn't as good as I thought. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of the "Alien" franchise. When "Alien Resurrection" came out in 1993, I was hooked. I had seen it on video many times, but it never quite grabbed me like the others. So the only way I could see this film was in its 3D (which was a treat). If I hadn't seen the others I probably never would have seen this one either. The special effects were really good and the acting was great as usual. The plot was nothing special, but at least it was not too complicated. The action was terrific. The creatures were truly frightening. As always, they looked great. It was a must see for all fans of "Alien."    The Alien is great as ever. He is very well done and I love him as a character. He had all of the qualities of a classic creature, the same as Sigourney Weaver. The Alien had his own story to tell and a great one at that. He was a tough, yet kind and lovable man. He felt like a real person with a lot of emotions. There was one scene that made me scream. I was actually really angry at the Alien for what he did to Ripley's character. I thought he should have died that night. I have always wanted to know what caused that scene to make me scream so loudly.   "Alien: Resurrection" was the third of four movies to be made based on the original movie. It had a great cast and the special effects of the time. The film did not stand the test of time but it still holds up quite well. This movie is a perfect example of what happens when you are a fan of a film and have not seen it in the past.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember watching this movie as a child. The movie is set in the late 1950s and has a pretty good quality film, although it was shot in a very low-budget way, with some amateur actors. The plot was just interesting enough, but the actors did not get a good deal of screen time.   The plot is a very simple and basic one. The main character is a farmer, and his daughter has just moved away to visit her sister in a nearby town. The farmer is very worried about the girl and sends her on a trip to visit the sister. On the way there, the girl falls down a well and is saved by a young man and a woman who have come to look for the girl. The daughter gets back to the farmer's house and has her sister brought back, and the couple makes love. The next morning, the daughter tells her father that the husband is in love with the daughter, but he won't marry her, as he has no children. So the father decides to find a suitable husband for the daughter so she can have someone to love her, and gets on the train to visit a man in Europe.  A short but very sweet story.

This movie was a little slow for my tastes but that was probably because I hadn't seen the entire movie, so maybe it was just my age, but at the same time the acting in this movie was amazing.

A lot of the filming is in and around the Financial District, as that's where many of the villains (and good guys) are kept. And I love the sound mix, especially in the climactic fight sequences. Even though the plot and the characters are mostly the same from scene to scene, they make it feel like they're fighting a different set of people and in different settings than the other films. Plus, the stunts are spectacular.

It will have you smiling all the way to the end." - Chicago Sun-Times "A hilarious, heartwarming tale that captures the essence of a group of unlikely friends, one at a time. It's the story of a high school freshman's dream of making it big in Hollywood. But the big day never comes. It never does. There's just too much pressure, and it's all over too soon."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was pretty much perfect for my taste, and to my surprise it wasn't "bad" at all.   I really enjoyed it, because it was really well made, the acting was really good, and the plot was very well thought out.  If you are an action movie fan and this movie didn't make you want to see more, then I can only assume that there is something wrong with your tastes.  I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot of this is really interesting, and I'm sure it will be a very satisfying film. The only thing I did not care for was that the character names and some of the characters' faces were changed.   I have always been a huge Star Trek fan, and have seen every episode of all the series, movies, and the spin-off series. The Original Series is so cool, so imaginative, so different from what we've seen before. This film is really great, and if you love the Original Series, you'll love it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story is simple, but the characters are unique and endearing. They are the best of a good crop of movie villains.   A good film, not for the youngest. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was very well made. The production design was very good and the costumes were extremely realistic.   A lot of times when I watch these sort of films, the camerawork is very choppy and it makes the images look washed out.  With a camerawalk like that, the movie was easy to follow.  When all is said and done, the story was good.  This was an enjoyable movie to watch and I am glad that I watched it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is like a little bit of the movie in a little movie.   While the action is good, the story is not really.  They are trying to do this in the 1950's, when women still wore dresses and there was a lot more action.  While it works, it's more fun to see what happens when people aren't afraid to go against convention.  I also found the costumes interesting.  The women wore very sexy outfits in the beginning.  After awhile, they started wearing more clothing with a little more body to them.  I was a bit shocked at the way they changed their clothes, but it was very amusing to see.  My main thing with this movie is that the "bad guys" never seem to get what they want.  Their intentions are always to get the girl, and never to hurt anybody.  It's just that they always get what the girl wants.  This was a good little action flick with a strong message. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think the most powerful image in this movie is that of the mother crying. Her face has become a mask of grief as she holds her dying daughter's hand and lets her fall into a lake. The scene is haunting and poignant.   A wonderful, intelligent movie that is funny, sad and moving.

But my brother, an avid viewer of Hollywood blockbusters who was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, got it for me when I was in the hospital. I've seen it three times now, and will probably watch it again on my deathbed.   The director is excellent, the actors are great, the plot twists are well thought out.  I never wanted it to end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film was very good.  This movie was well made and the acting was very decent.  The movie was a story about a man who was once married to a very beautiful woman and now they have a son, and a son of a different wife.  What made the movie so well made was that the director put together a real story in his film.  I enjoyed it very much and it didn't have any bad scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as an Indiana Jones movie goes, this one is a good one. There is a little too much in here to keep track of, but once you get the hang of it all the movies are good.   It was a long time before I really enjoyed the movie, but that changed as I watched it more and more.  The story is the same from the books, but I'm still not a huge fan of the character.  As always, George is in the driver's seat and he does a good job, but it's his daughter that really steals the show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it. The best way to describe this movie is the movie that every horror fan wishes they were born to see, but was too afraid to.   I was skeptical of the director at first, but once I saw it, I was completely hooked.  I found the acting to be excellent, and this movie had one of the creepiest stories that I've ever heard.  And even better than that is, it's really funny.  The music was perfect, and the acting on this movie was just as well done as the stories.  This is a perfect example of a great horror film that should be on your radar. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie made me want to go out and shoot some guns.   I love the action scenes.  The best thing about this movie is the fact that it was made in the 1930's.  This was a time when movies had more impact than they do today.  I would have liked to see the main character use some of the better weapons available to him.  However, the guns were used in a smart and entertaining way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is not only awesome, but it also manages to be very interesting.   It is quite shocking how well they manage to capture what makes the movie so great.  The story goes something like this, two brothers are on a family vacation to a small coastal town on Florida's east coast.  They arrive early one morning and decide to take a walk along the beach in the dead of night.  After a few days of staying at the house, the older brother is beginning to tire of their isolation and decides to head out in search of some romance.  But his brother is not to be outdone in this quest, and decides upon taking a ride in a'swinging truck' along the coast that he just so happens to have a few of the money to buy one.  What follows is a very odd, and very entertaining, story of a love triangle and a murder mystery.  I loved this movie as a kid.  It took a lot of suspension of disbelief to get it, but once I did, I was hooked.  There is some pretty intense dialogue between the two characters, and they both have some rather well-written lines.  This is also a film I enjoyed watching for some reason.  A friend of mine and I would sometimes watch it at the same time, and it would always make us laugh.  Just a nice little story that has a lot to say about the relationship between men and women, and the importance of family. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a little disappointing. This movie had so much potential to be great, but unfortunately it was just plain mediocre.   I was hoping that the movie would go for a bit more then it did.  The acting was weak at times, there were very little things that made you say "Wow" I think that this movie was made for a small screen, where there would be little time to make it better.  One of the things that I thought was pretty funny was the use of an apple for a water source.  I mean, I was expecting something more then this, but I was really surprised at how cheap this movie really is.  They could have had the apple for less then $10.  When the movie started, you saw a man in a trench coat walking along a street, and he is carrying something that looked like an apple, and then, the next shot was him in a field, and the apple was now in a barrel, and it was gone.  And the movie then ended.  It was just silly, and really made you wonder why was the guy carrying the apple to begin with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to believe that the original film was such a huge success. It wasn't the most original concept, or the most well-written, but it was still a huge hit. It's also hard to know what to say about the sequels because they are just not all that great, not to mention the fact that they were just recycled footage. Still, it's hard not to enjoy these films.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part about this movie is that it features a great supporting cast. There are not many female characters in the movie, but they do a fantastic job and all have their own little stories.   They look great and have a lot of chemistry, especially with the beautiful, buxom, yet deadly, assassin.  I've seen some good movies where the lead is a man and I was not impressed, but this is one of the very few where the actress looks like her character and does as well. The villain is evil, and as I said, the actress does a fantastic performance, and makes him as menacing as he needs to be.  It was nice to see that this movie doesn't use the same story for every single film. It does a great job with the different stories of the different characters.  This is one movie you just cannot miss. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "You know that little, tiny part in the middle of the movie where you say, "This is just like the picture in the old comic book"   So yes, this is like a comic book movie. This is the most visually stunning superhero movie ever made, and that has a lot to do with its great acting. The story is just so incredibly stupid. It's so over the top and ridiculous, but still manages to be extremely entertaining.  This is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, but also doesn't make it seem like an amateur effort either. The plot of the film is ridiculous, and I can't even begin to describe how over the line it gets, but somehow they keep the level of stupidly ridiculous acting to a minimum.  Even if you hate superhero movies, you should watch this one.   Posted by Steve H. at 5:41 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed the movie. It was funny, sexy and full of action. I loved that there were many different action sequences in this movie. I thought it was well made and that it was great to see a movie where all the characters had their own distinct personalities. I think this movie has a better cast than The Mask of Zorro did.   - September 22, 2008A must see  Reviewer: hankthehussain - favorite favorite favorite - August 12, 2008  Subject: Very good movie! The film is very good. I always enjoy a good old fashioned action movie! There was some good dialogue. The characters are all in one way or another, so it is hard to like any one of them. - August  Rated: 5 out of 5    If you love classic action movies like The Man with the Golden Gun and The Last Action Hero then you have to have seen this movie, and I am glad that I did. You can tell it is a true classic. I also liked the music by Chuck Berry, and the cast, all of them had great personalities, and they did an amazing job in bringing the characters to life. There were a few problems with the acting, but other than that it is definitely worth seeing. - April 11, 2008Very good movie  "THE MASK OF ZORRO" was produced by the Warner Bros. Studio and was released in 1960, starring Dean Martin, Dean Martin's brother Paul, Bobby "Boris" Baron Cohen, and George Sanders. The story takes place in a fictional version of Spain, where a criminal mastermind is hiding in the shadow of the Spanish royal family. The Mask Of Zorros is the first major film in Martin's career and it proved that he was a good actor.   The film is a very simple one, and it has all the elements that makes for a good action film. This is the film that first established Martin as an actor, and is one of his better films. The film has a lot of fun with its own plot, and has a good amount of tension built up. I enjoyed the fights, as the fights were both exciting and tense, with the actors really showing what they were capable of.   the music was good, and while not very good in terms of the musical numbers, the musical scores were very well put together.  . The movie had its ups and downs, but is one that will

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had seen some of this on HBO, but this was the first time I'd seen the show. It's a solid show that I hope the show continues to do for years to come. It definitely brings back memories of when I was a kid watching cartoons on TV. The characters and their dialogue were still entertaining, but the episodes themselves didn't always stay on point and they were a bit predictable.   The special effects were still top notch, and I particularly loved the way they were set up. It was amazing how much effort went into making everything look like it was going by fast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to see "Zathura" with my wife. We wanted to see a movie that we could watch together that wasn't full of crap. The movie was very funny. The actors were all great.  We laughed so hard at some of the scenes that we almost had a heart attack.   The only problem was that our seats were so close to one another that it was hard to watch the movie at times.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes funny movies and can watch it in public.

Very atmospheric with the soft acoustic guitar in the beginning and a cool synth-rock theme at the end.  The acting was superb. The acting in this movie was a little flat. This movie does not need the over-the-top characters of The Naked Gun series and other action movies. It is enough to just have a good cast that does their best.   The action scenes were very well choreographed and had a very good camera angle. They had good editing in this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen "Barefoot Genitalia" at least 4 times. There are so many aspects of this film that I love and it is very well acted. The whole story is set in an American military hospital.   The film is about a man who is suffering from PTSD after being wounded by a grenade while serving his country. His wife left him and left him to live on the street. His best friend was the one who made the grenade that went through his head. The two of them had a falling out but are still good friends.  The story starts off a little slow but slowly it picks up. The acting is very good. The music is beautiful and fits the scene perfectly. I wish the story had been a little more complete. It was like the movie had been put on hold for about 2 years.  Another great thing about this film is the performances. The actors are all so great and play the different parts with the best of them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to this movie with my husband and we enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just came to this one after not seeing it in about a year and decided to watch it. This movie was awesome. The story was good. the action was good, and the dialogue was good! I thought the story was a little too short and they should have made it a little longer but it was still good. I don't see the love story in this movie as the love interest's name I am not sure but if you like love stories than you should watch this movie, I loved it, there were a few flaws but I think they were small and they were fixed in the second movie but the first one was still amazing.    My favorite actor is Richard Jenkins, I think he is one of the greatest actors of all time, I saw this movie in the theaters as a young teen and remember it vividly, he plays a great cop and he is perfect. I have heard a rumor that he played a lot of bad guys but I don' think so. I just love the movie and he plays the part perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't recommend this film enough. I'm a big fan of the late John Hughes films so to see one from his early years is fascinating. His films were always humorous, yet poignant. The story here is based on an actual episode of The Honeymooners, so it plays with that structure. Hughes' performance here is just great, you can feel the love he puts into it. I really enjoyed watching him do stand up comedy, and watching his daughter try to get him to do standup at home. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you haven't seen this movie yet, you really should. If you have seen it already, you may have thought the film was too short but it's actually very long. The best part of the movie for me is the scene where we are in a motel room (no spoilers). The director has put a lot of effort into bringing this motel room into a believable movie. We actually see a young girl in this motel and the lighting is so good that you see all of her legs. The other part that I liked the most was the ending when the young girl was playing dead and the cop pulled her in and then shot her in the neck. The end of this movie is pretty much perfect and I have seen more than a few "too short" movies that I don't know what to think about.

Great acting and writing and great music.   The movie takes place in the 1950s.  It's about a young couple, played by Paul Newman and Grace Kelly, who have a home, a house on an isolated hillside overlooking a small town.  They fall in love and try to keep it a secret from the world.  This is such a great movie.  There are many, many more scenes and scenes like this. The acting is amazing.  Paul Newman, with a wonderful, relaxed voice, is perfect.  The film is beautiful and dark and sad and the atmosphere is perfect - it's not flashy, but rather dark and somber.  I highly recommend this one to everyone who is interested in the film industry or just a great romantic movie.

The film opens with the main villain, The Man in Black, on a mission to kill the Doctor. He gets his wish, and it all comes down to the Doctor and his young son. The Doctor, a brilliant scientist, travels to Australia on a scientific expedition to create a new drug to save the world. He meets a mysterious stranger, who helps him and his son escape. Unfortunately, a gang of mercenaries capture the doctor and his family and demand the drug for ransom. The only way out is to kidnap the Doctor's son, who will become a pawn in a scheme to steal the drug and kill The Man In Black. But before the scheme can be put into action, The Doctor is contacted by the renegade Time Agent, John Hartigan, who wants the Doctor to help him stop an impending invasion by an unknown alien race. The man in black, still alive after his earlier defeat, has a few tricks up his sleeve. He will stop at nothing to save his child. Can the Doctor stop him from killing the boy? Or will the Doctor save himself and his entire world? It is not all bad. The special effects were great, and did a great job of adding to the action. There were some well-timed special effects sequences that really did put a kick in your gut, and if you were a fan, you would enjoy the way that the Doctor could turn on the water and water-spray on the man in blue. The acting is great, with the young boy and his father doing a good job of making you sympathize with their plight. It's not easy to pull off a bad guy, but the Man In Blue is an extremely bad guy. But there are good people in the film, and you'll learn to like them, as well. The actors also do a great

He starts out with the help of a priest named Father Tully (Bruce Willis). The story moves through the years of his life, and in every episode, he gets more and more involved with the people of the city and finds himself in more and deadlier situations, each time getting closer and closer to the person who is most dangerous.

First of all, the acting is horrible, even the cast of "Little Nell" is not good. They did a good job of playing the part of Nellie, but I do not think they got the "Baa Baa Black Sheep" impression right. Also, I think the "Cattle Drive" scene was filmed too fast. It looks like it was shot by a TV camera, with only a few people. I would have loved to have seen more of this scene. I also thought that the scene with the wolves attacking Nell was very silly. I was laughing the whole time. It was the only part that I think was badly filmed. I am not a big "Wolves in the Mist" fan, but this movie made me a fan.   The score is good, the lighting is good and the cinematography is good. There are many "B-horror" movies with a similar premise, but the one in this movie was the better. I recommend it if you love B-horrors or if you think that this is a better movie than the "Wings of the Dove" or "Cows' Eyes". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was great. The action was soooooo fun. It wasn't like any other action movie I have seen. It was real. And it had so much energy and fun that it made me want to run around with the guy playing the bad guy all over the place.   I highly recommend this movie for any fan of action and/or ninjas. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen this film yet, but I'm looking forward to it. It sounds like a solid film, so I look forward to seeing it.   I have never seen a film that has a film reel with interviews, and interviews that are so informative. I really like it and hope I'm wrong. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you haven't seen this movie, or just don't care for the genre, it's time for you to go do that, but this movie is fantastic. There's a lot of action, but it's all well-shot, and it's very effective. The best scenes are the fight scenes, which are very intense and well-crafted, and you can really see how much they care about the actors.   A little too long at about an hour and fifty minutes, this is a very well-paced movie that is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film that gave us a true and true take on the subject of being a woman in the workplace.  It is not very often that a movie will make you want to stay at home and watch a show because it gives so many ideas to think about.   I just hope it is in the running for best movie of the year.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is such a relief to see such a big Hollywood movie with a real, authentic Asian character. This is how a Chinese man should act. It shows that, although it is the 1970s, Chinese men of all kinds have a way to be as smart and as tough as the "good guys".   I've already seen it two times and I've been telling everyone I know about it.   - Peter, November 3, 2015
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is pretty good. I like how the movie was made and the actors do a fine job with it.   I like the characters.  For the first time in a movie I'm pretty satisfied.  I also like the film's "twist" at the end.  If you are a fan of the movie or are a movie fan, you will love this.  This movie is worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been searching for this movie for about three years and finally got my hands on it. I remember watching this movie in the early nineties and was completely fascinated. This movie is one of the best ever. It has never lost it's originality and is an absolute must see for all movie fans.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a big fan of this film and loved it from the moment I saw it in the theater.  It was a bit of a letdown after seeing the first "Eyes Wide Shut" (and I love that one) but it does make me appreciate the director's effort so much more.  There were some small things that I would have liked changed, but I'm glad this one gets made, and I'll definitely watch it again some day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A must-see film for horror fans, this is a terrificly shot, suspenseful thriller with a unique look. The main characters are the usual suspects but don't be deceived; this is just as terrifying as the usual slasher flicks. It is an excellent jump to the present day as well as providing some classic, if not a little outdated, gore effects.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is great and well done.   It is very different from other movies and the characters are fun and believable.  The actors all get the character and bring their very best to the screen.  This is a movie for those who want something a bit different from the average action movie.  What more can you ask for? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. I thought it was really funny, even with the terrible acting and the slow pacing. I was so surprised that the movie was so good that it still had that "old timey" charm, and I loved it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very entertaining thriller that takes the viewer on an intense roller coaster ride to a very interesting place.   My favorite "real life" movie, but the plot is very clever, and all the actors do a great job.  The only flaw in this film is the movie starts out slow, but then it picks up speed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the real deal, and the acting is the best i have ever seen from any of the actors. It is a true love story, so i guess it is a classic romance.   It is the first time that i have seen an Italian film, so it is amazing to see the love of the Italian people.  i am really happy about the casting of Toni Fellini in the role of Francesco.  The film is very realistic, and i can not think of another movie that i watched where the people speak like they did in the movie.  This is my favorite movie, and is one of the best Italian films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first half of the film is an action-packed ride. The plot revolves around a terrorist attack on a cruise ship that causes the ship to sink. The terrorist takes a hostage and uses his wife as a human shield. The main characters take a submarine crew hostage and the terrorists are killed in a shootout.   It is a very good movie, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.  In an age when it seems that everything is made as high budget and fake, this film manages to capture the reality of a situation that was so close to disaster.  In the first 20 minutes the film doesn't tell a whole lot of story, but then at the end of the movie it picks up. The story of the terrorist is extremely interesting and I could see why he was involved in a terrorist plot. The fact that he was trying to frame someone in the Navy was a good twist and kept me guessing throughout the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie, it is just so well made. I mean really well. This movie is great and it will make you laugh and cry at the same time. I have never seen a movie that is so funny and so real. The film's storyline is so believable that you would almost believe that this really happened. There are a lot of great performances in this movie and all of them make it so real and real.   My friend and I had to wait to see this movie so we didn't have to miss a single scene. We could hardly believe what we were watching and then the film really started to play out.  If you love movies, I highly recommend this film!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am so glad I saw this movie. I was so afraid that I would not be able to watch it, but I am so happy that I did. This movie is a masterpiece of the movie making.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is a real blast from start to finish, and I will most certainly be watching more of it in the future!   As a longtime fan of the franchise I was actually a bit confused at first because I had seen the trailers but didn't realize that this was a prequel to "Pitch Black". The storyline is actually quite interesting and I was able to learn a bit about the family and the "real" story behind the film, which was really fun to watch.  Â If you are interested in the "prequel" genre this is one to watch, and the production values are top notch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie and I think you will love this movie too.   It is funny, smart, and has an old fashioned feel to it that I really enjoy.  I really loved the scene with the old lady who was driving home in the rain and trying to talk with her daughter about what was going on.  The ending really hits home and makes it clear what the ending for our story is all about.  This is a movie that you can watch in the car on a rainy day, or just go into your basement with your friends and watch it.  It really has a unique feel to the way it was made.  Highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this a few years ago and am very fond of it. I loved how this film was a film that didn't hold any of the Hollywood standards of acting or directing. This is really a great example of a director making his movie how he wanted to and in a very unique way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In my opinion, this is a really good movie and it does not take a long to finish.   I saw this on TV and the opening scene alone is enough to hold you for a couple of hours.  This film is set in a small village in West Germany in the 1970's and it shows a man who wants to see a movie in a very small theatre but he doesn't know the name of the theatre.  So he goes to an old man in the village and he buys the ticket and goes into the cinema and see the film for himself.  After the film, the old man dies and the next morning, the man and his family gather around the grave of the old movie director, who died before he started the movie.  A small movie by a famous director and it is interesting to see it in such a small format.  It is a shame that the German language was not used in the movie but the story is very good.  I highly recommend watching this movie and see it for yourself.  If you like stories like this, check it out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie at the theater last night and was surprised by how well-made it was. I guess it was because I hadn't seen it in a while, and the plot was still fresh in my mind. It was a great movie to watch on a lazy Saturday night.   Overall, I think this movie deserves a second viewing just to appreciate the special effects. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I loved it, and still do.   The acting in this is absolutely brilliant.  I was absolutely riveted by it, so when I was finally able to go see it, I had to see it in 3D. It wasn't the same as seeing it in 2D, but it definitely added a bit of wow factor.  It is absolutely wonderful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The world's finest" was the tagline for this film, but I think that it is also the tag for the film itself: "You should see this film if you like the world's best." What a film! The world of the film (which is set in the '20s) is very rich, and the story is a masterwork in style. From the cinematography (which has never been better than in any of the films of this period) to the performances, the dialogue, the direction, and even the plot...this is a film that will stand the test of time.   So what else to say other than to get this film on VHS! This is one of those rare times that I feel this way: a great film, a great story, an awesome cast, and a director that makes the best films he makes!   This is a must-have for any lover of film.  - February 23, 2010The World's Finest  Reviewer: darren_gw - favorite favorite favorite - February 21, 2010  Subject: One of the best!   This movie is good for those who want to see the best of the silent era. Great cinematography, great performances, great cast, great script, good directing, and good direction. I don't remember exactly where I saw this when I was a kid, but it was the only silent film I watched in my entire life. You can tell that Spielberg and company knew what they were doing. Good stuff. - February 3, 2010One of the Best!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie does a very good job of putting a young man who was always going to be a loser into his place.   His attitude and attitude only gets worse as the story develops.  The guy is always making jokes and making fun of the other characters, but never at the expense of his friends.  His love of food is pretty cool too.  There's a nice scene with his little sister that will put a smile on most people's face.  I had a great time watching the movie.  Â   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason why this movie is worth a watch is because of the acting. This film was made for the stage. It has some of the best actors, including Laurence Olivier, who portrays the lead role of Richard the Lionheart, the real life King of England. Laurence is always a pleasure to watch. The acting in this movie shines in different scenes, and when Laurence was on stage the whole audience loved his performances.   I really did not enjoy the plot of this movie. It had me confused. However, it was a good action flick for the family.  The music was great, and the costumes were lovely. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A really interesting take on a classic Hollywood film. Not so much the usual plot, but more of the character and personality of the main character.   I didn't expect much, but it did deliver on some of its promises and some of the moments were good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't have to ask for a soda when i saw the film. The whole theater was laughing with me. The plot wasn't complicated. I'm still laughing over that scene where the cop is taking the baby out of the car and the other cop is driving away.   In the end, we learn that the baby was an escaped slave, and that this "baby's" name was Henry. He was sold to the circus in a "rat show" in Mississippi. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a really nice and well made movie. The cast is great and they use it as a vehicle for some great acting and they are a lot of fun.   It is hard to get over the wonderful "Bond Girl" role the female lead, K. A. Bond, has and she is great.  Â This movie will be fun to watch and there are some fun twists and turns that you do not see on the film version.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a great mystery with good acting and great action. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that the best thing about The Lost World: Jurassic Park was the movie-going experience itself, the way the actors performed and acted in these wonderful, epic, huge movies.   The acting was excellent all the way through, even the ones who looked like they just had one of those terrible scenes at the end of the movie.  The CGI was incredible, and the fact that they managed to bring this amazing movie to the big screen with just practical effects was just amazing.  In the end I really enjoyed Jurassic Park, and I loved watching it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just saw this movie last week for the first time at the local independent movie theater. I've only seen it at a theater once before, but it's a great movie! It has great performances, and is funny, and a very well put together movie.   The one thing that I don't like about the movie is that the sound effects are too loud, and they're too loud at the end of the movie, so you can't really hear the acting at that point.  It's not too bad, but still... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The picture is fine, and the movie itself is quite good. A simple story of a woman who needs a man, the story is simple enough to be a comedy. The director had been in more than one movie and he clearly knew what he wanted. I thought this was his best movie, and it made me laugh so hard I lost consciousness for a while. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen this film many times and each time it remains one of the great comedies.   John Goodman as the title character was great as always with his deadpan delivery and very dry mannerisms.  The cast was good with Alan Arkin as the young man in the wheelchair.  If you like a good old fashioned screwball comedy then it is one that you should see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When it came out in '79 it seemed so silly that some of the people who hated it in the '70s did not realize how wrong it was. The first half was good, but the second half was so badly written that it ruined the entire movie. It was a mess. The two leads were so inept that you were wondering how they could have made this movie. I can't remember a time that so much bad writing in a movie has made me say "Well this movie was not that great of a movie, but it was probably a good example of the kind of movie that would have been good if the actors had not been so inept." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like Star Wars, you'll love this movie.   I like the cast and they give a good feel to the movie. They give great performances and I like their character names and their costumes.  I did like the way the special effects are done with a little more attention to detail and some better work.  The best parts are when they are in the cantina or when they talk to Vader and Lando. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a fun movie to watch. There are not many that feature the use of old films. I think it is a shame to only use these old films if you are trying to make something interesting. I thought this was a pretty fun movie.    The sound is good, especially for this age of film.  The acting is good as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been watching the original version of this movie since I was a kid. So I'm glad that I was able to watch it again as a kid and finally get a chance to see it as a "grown up". This movie has so many great lines that are a joy to hear. I especially loved the lines of "you go girl" and "I just hope it didn't happen to you". The whole movie reminded me of watching a bad car crash, with people falling out of the cars, and screaming. I was just laughing and loving every second of it. This is probably one of my favorite movies ever. It's got so many jokes and good lines.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a pretty good movie, although the dialogue can be a bit cheesy. But I did enjoy this movie. It really did show how good a relationship could be. I had never seen a movie like this and it is something I had wanted to see for a while now.   I will admit that I only watched the trailer of this movie (which I had been wanting to see). But what the trailer did not show was that this was a different movie. I am always looking for movies with real heart, and this movie did not disappoint me. I do not know what this movie will be like, but I do hope that it will make me want to see the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a fan of "The Twilight Zone", the shows and movies, but never watched one until this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have only seen this once and it was in an old crappy video shop. I am glad that it was free and available.   This was a great "funny" story and very well made. It was an excellent production.  It is a fun adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have enjoyed many films in the past. A movie I had never heard of is called "Cirque du Freak" It is an amazing film with fantastic characters and amazing effects. It is set in a circus and it stars a boy that is about 3 years old and he is the clown. He is very funny and always wants to show people how silly the things he does are and he will do anything to make people laugh and be amused. The people he tricks are so freaked out they go into shock and panic and it gets more and more violent. They do the things that circus animals do and that causes the circus to close down. At the end of the film they take the clown off to live in the circus again. The only thing that I didn't like was that they don't use his real voice because it would have added so much to the movie. I have seen many films and this is one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. The kids in this film are very creative and imaginative. It's very funny. I would recommend this to any kid and any person that loves a great good laugh.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When the "Rashomon" movie came out, I was really excited. I love movies that make me want to go out and find someone to talk with. I never have, so this movie was an unexpected pleasure. The movie itself is fairly entertaining. The cast is good. The direction is good and I have to give them some credit. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a good watch. It was funny, and the plot twists were great. The only thing that is a bit off is the lack of sound during the shootout. If they had added some music, this movie could have been even better.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was really good, not the kind of movies I want to see, but a good watch.   I am just going to let everyone know that the actor playing the bad guy was real.  I will give this movie a 4.5. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this film for the first time last night at a movie night at my church. I was extremely pleased by its great special effects, excellent acting and beautiful cinematography. It's a great love story, and it's an excellent story as well, as I've read about how it's one of the best of the science fiction genre. It had a very satisfying ending, and I can't wait to see the next installment in the series.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie had a great plot and it was really great to see the two actors play their characters. They were amazing together.    It has a lot of action and it really helped that it was in a small city like Prague. Â They really got their characters and that's the whole reason to see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a little worried about this film.   The title was confusing at first, but after watching it it became more understandable.  A good deal of what the film deals with relates to the death of a parent, and the fact that the character we follow is a "baby sitter".   But that's not all the film is about.  You will probably need a little background information.  When the film was first released in 1959, it did not do well.  The film had a poor rating from all the critics.  After the film had been re-released in 1966, the movie became extremely popular.  Today, this is a classic and is still very relevant.  I am very glad that it is still around to this day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has it all. The actors were great in it. The storyline was interesting. The ending was good. It has one of those endings that I've never seen before. It is quite dark and intense. The way the film ended made the whole thing worth watching again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first watched the movie at the local community theatre in the 1980s. It was well-made, well-written and just about the right time for it. The actress in the movie was a good actress, and the story was entertaining, and a little bit more serious than in the film.   This movie does not belong on this list of classic horror films. It is very much a throwback, and if you are familiar with the genre, you won't be too interested.  There's just too much blood and gore, not enough plot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is not a typical comedy.   It is about a girl who has an obsession with a man she meets at school.  She makes sure that he sees the movie she wants him to see.  When he does, he tells her he saw more than he should have. She then gets angry and tries to have him arrested.  This is a well-written movie.  A few of the jokes are funny, but many are just great.  It also has one of the most powerful songs in movie history.  The movie also has the best soundtrack in a horror movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite movies ever.   I don't even remember the plot but I'm glad the actors did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is based on the life of the author James Gleick, and the director, Michael Moore. The movie shows how our government is corrupted by our corporate overlords and our own government, who are more interested in protecting the power of corporations over the people. The film does not show what went on inside the Department of Justice and the White House, but instead what happened on the inside. Gleick's book is the story of how our system of checks and balances came to be taken over by corporate power. It is one of the most important books to come out in the past few years, as it exposes what the government is really up to, how they are destroying our democracy, and how a new era of power is coming.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I always go for the good movies when they come on TV, but this was different. It was like a good, but bad movie. It had the makings of a great movie and had a very strong cast, but its acting was so bad it was painful. And it was over too quickly.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not the prettiest movie you'll see this year, but that's a little misleading. What it really is is a beautiful, gorgeous movie that doesn't make any concessions to convention. The cinematography is truly stunning, with the sun shining on the world's most beautiful landscapes and the mountains shimmering in the light, even in the middle of the desert. The sound design is also top notch. You feel like you're being taken on a trip down memory lane, from the last film you saw before this one, and it all comes together nicely.   I just had so much fun watching it.  The story is pretty simple, but its execution is just beautiful. The acting was great, especially from Michael Shannon. He was the right guy to play this role, he knows how to do it right.  He plays this character very sensitive and introspective, and is able to deliver a very believable performance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a great movie. The cast is amazing.   I don't like movies that take themselves too seriously, but this is a movie I can enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie to watch after a long day:  The movie is so short you won't even notice the movie (its only 3 minutes) and there are no effects or special effects. The scene is set in a desert and you see the desert as it is (its just a desert). I think the movie is a good addition to your collection because it's very short, no one would really mind it and the desert looks really amazing (I think its the best desert i've ever seen in my life).  The actors all looked really good (I thought this was one of the best movies of the 90's), and they all had great lines. This movie is really a good one for young children (or for adults who don't mind the small details) and it has a very good ending (i loved the last scene in the movie) and a great song by "The Muffs" (from "Fever Pitch").   If you watch this movie (especially if you are a fan of "The Dukes of Hazzard") make sure to put on some "The Dirty Dozen" music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is excellent and one of my favorite movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great, fun movie!  I thought it was a great movie from the get go.  The story was a lot of fun and really well done.  From the opening scene with the little girl who wants to be a horsewoman to the end where the woman is in the castle, this movie really took me back to when I was just a little girl and had the fantasy that was out of reach of my small hands.  I loved how the women were in their own world and that they were not affected by any man in their life.  In all my years of watching movies the one thing that really stuck out to me was that no one ever came to help the girl out.   I really loved the story and the characters in this movie and I love how the director kept trying to make the characters relatable.  If I ever get the chance to go to a film festival I will be there to see this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is a very good movie and I would recommend it to everyone.   It is a movie you can watch whenever you want to.  It has some funny parts, but it is also very emotional.  I would give this movie to my grandkids someday. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie itself is so good and has the best soundtrack that you can ask for. It is a classic 80s horror flick and if you ever saw the movie or played it then you know it was good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was on a budget for this film and had no choice but to go to a local movie theater with friends. This film was in 3D so the glasses were very important to me. There was also a nice surprise when I turned on the film. I had never heard of a group of people in the same village who are called the Black Death.  This film has a little more than a little action and suspense to it.  If you love horror this is a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a great piece of Americana, and it was the very first film I ever saw that I had never heard of.   I had seen the movies from the 60's, and they were always just a piece of trash.  But this film is different.  The acting is great.  It is set in the early days of the film industry and it takes the look of a movie you would have seen in the 50's or 60's.  Also the cinematography and the music are excellent.  This movie also was directed byÂ Robert Wise, a great screenwriter who died before his career was over.  Now in this film you will see how the early Hollywood scene worked.  One thing that has always impressed me about Wise was that he knew exactly how to use the set pieces that are in this movie.  He used the old studio to great effect, and he would have had to shoot at night in order to use those old light sources.  And of course, the acting is excellent. Â  It was a good experience for me to see how that scene from Gone With the Wind (which I had always seen as a young man in the 1950's) played out on the silver screen.  For me it is the best of the many pictures that Robert Wise made before he died.  So go out and watch this film, and if you haven't already, pick up the book that was written by Robert Wise about this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's great. A very dark and gritty, almost grindhouse look at life in an orphanage, where some people have found their true calling in life, but many others have not.   Â  As is expected, the film is very dark, and sometimes uncomfortable, as the characters try to find their place in a society that is not quite what they hoped. Â  It's not very easy to get an understanding of their situation, since it is so much more brutal, and harsh than the world the characters lived in.  The acting is excellent, especially from the leading male role, who does a really great job of showing the characters pain, and struggle.  A lot of the film's emotion comes from the people who we know in the orphanage and the people around them, and they seem to be more like characters than actual people, except for the orphan.  I really liked the way the film kept us on edge throughout, as we had no idea what was going to happen next, and no idea who would be coming back home. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't seen this movie yet, and I will definitely look for it on my DVD collection, but I've heard so much about it, and it looks so good, that I must watch it right away. It has a story that I've seen a number of times. It involves two men, one a veteran who was wounded in the first Persian Gulf War, the other a former soldier. They meet while on a road trip in which they're staying at a remote camp, and become fast friends. But as time goes on and they become more and more distant, the former soldier falls in love with the former veteran. What really brings the story to life is the acting, especially by the two stars. I enjoyed every scene of their friendship. I especially liked that the director didn't give away too much information to make the relationship between them seem too close. The two actors do a great job of acting out their roles. - March 3, 2008I really wish I'd seen this sooner
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most important thing to me in a film is the characters. If it's well written and played, then I can enjoy the experience. This is a great film from the late 60's/early 70's.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a huge fan of the horror genre. When I was a kid I was obsessed with horror movies. I loved watching them, I loved the characters and I loved how scary they were. I had even created some of my own stories as a kid about the monsters. As time went on I was able to watch a lot of horror movies in a row without getting scared. And as time went by I realized that there was more to it. There is something deeper to these monsters and how they think and feel. I began to see them in a different light. I realized some of the things they were thinking and doing was not rational and not just for pleasure. It was because they are monsters. They live in a world full of darkness and death and fear. And when they feel that they are no longer safe they make up stories about the people who have been to their home and are dead or gone. They think to themselves how could these people have ever had a chance? And it breaks their hearts when they hear about the terrible things that have happened to people who come to their town and their neighborhood.   This movie is a masterpiece. I recommend it to everyone who likes to watch scary movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great time, good laughs, some excellent lines, a story that just keeps you thinking and a couple of good songs. A fun film that I would highly recommend for everyone.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story line and action was amazing!  Â The character of B. B. King was really a great fit for the story and the director nailed the performance.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movies are the ones that have really good acting, and a unique and entertaining story.  This movie had the perfect mix of those two.  The story is really funny, and the actors play it so well.  I'm not going to give you any spoilers, but it's a great twist on the classic story of Jack the Ripper.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought the movie was ok. I liked the acting. There was one thing I didn't like, and that was the ending. I guess they thought it would get bad reviews. But I really thought the ending was unnecessary and rushed. It was a good ending, but I found it weird. I found the ending even stranger than the movie's. I think the ending in the movie should have ended the story, and there should have been some more time to think about it. It just ends on a cliffhanger.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on a college campus film festival when I was 14. I really liked it and saw it a few more times.   This is a really well acted movie and it is very funny. It would be better if the story wasn't so boring, but it is.  I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I would say that this movie is more of a film.   This movie has a great atmosphere and atmosphere is very important for any movie.  And it doesn't matter if the film is good or not.  There is something about movies that make them more powerful than any other thing.  This film definitely fits the category of a movie. But it doesn`t mean it is a bad movie. I am glad that they gave the director this chance and it didn`t waste it.  It has a good cast and very strong acting.  My only real problem with this movie was that the writing is pretty much nonexistent.  The movie is a thriller so it is not really necessary to have great acting or great stories.  They could have put a lot more effort into it but they didn` t.  A better movie could have been made but for me it is still pretty great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A must see movie for any fan of the horror genre. The special effects are phenomenal, and even the characters you do not care about come to life in a horrifying way. I will not watch it any other way.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a pretty entertaining flick. I enjoyed the film quite a bit, even though I felt the plot was very obvious from the get go.   My main problem with this is that there weren't really any laughs and there were too many scenes that I just wanted to skip.  For example, in the beginning there's a shot of a woman who seems like she's about to cry...then she just stops. The audience has no idea why. I guess it's because she's having her baby or something. But then there's this long monologue about how she's really happy to have a big boy. And then after that monologue she's on her back with the baby in her belly and she's being raped. You have no idea how annoying this is.  Another problem is that, at one point, an old lady says she wants to have sex with her husband because he's getting too old for her. And he says he's old enough for her anyway, since he has his kids. I mean, what's the difference?   The only good thing I got from this was when the old lady turned up and gave the old man a blowjob.  If you want to see a good comedy, watch this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first and only movie I saw about the Vietnam War, and the only one I liked.   I think I might have been about twelve at the time, but I was very impressed with the way the film told the story.  I thought it was very moving and realistic.  It's difficult to think that these poor people in the field, with no food, no sleep and little water, and then to be shot and mutilated by the VC were willing to fight and die for their country.  The Vietcong soldiers are portrayed in a way that makes them seem more believable and realistic than the American soldiers.  A few years later I heard about a movie called American Sniper by Clint Eastwood.  In it he made some mistakes, but the movie was great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie over 2 years ago and loved it.  I thought it was just as good if not better than the original.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am a big fan of the 70's films and this film stands out in a good way.   For the time, it was a fresh take on the character of The Joker.  I enjoyed the film and I would definitely recommend it to fans of the 80's. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was great and i enjoyed the story and acting of the leads, especially in the case of the young boy with the great and terrible imagination. There was nothing that the kid couldn't do with his imagination.    There is a great scene with the young kid that shows a little boy that is never seen in a movie like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked the ending of the movie. It was really funny and had a nice, good ending.   My favorite part of the ending was when Steve was telling his daughter about how he found the bottle and he was telling her he didn't really know how to drink it. So he took it back to his parents and his dad told him the right way to drink the bottle. Steve then took the bottle to the hospital where his father went to help him get a glass of water. He got it mixed and Steve had a water drink and his parents then watched the movie over the next few weeks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie that really works well on a summer night, and you can enjoy the good old days of a little family. Â I think a movie like this can be a real hit in the box office, and a nice piece of art to look at.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I was a kid and my parents would tell me not to go out in the evening because there would be a scary movie about to start, I'd always insist and say, "I don't care if the scary movie's scary, I just don't want to go." Well, there were no scary movies to start that night; but there were plenty of fun ones, and this one was one of them.  I'd watch the film over and over again for hours, especially when I was little and wanted to have my "spooky" Halloween costume (which is to say, a nightshirt that said "Scary!" on the back).  The film has been re-released on DVD and is very well-known.  Some reviewers have said that it's too much like the old "The Nightmare Before Christmas" and it's a bit derivative, but I think that's just a lazy criticism.  It's not about how good the film is.  Its about how scary it was.  In other words, it's about how it kept me up all night, and made me afraid of the dark even though I didn't feel like I was in danger of being hurt or killed.  Now, when I go to the movies, I always make sure that my child is present, since the films that I want to see will sometimes be rated PG-13.  So, what is scary?  I don't mean what you see in the movie.  But rather, what you might do to yourself that could be similar to what was done in the film.  For example, if I was stuck in a dark closet with my parents and had to wait until midnight for my parents to get home, I don a mask, dress up in the creepy costume, and go to bed.  Then, if it were the other way around, I would have to go to a friend's house.   Then I could sneak into the closet and see what it's like to be stuck in the closet all night. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a good film. I would say it is like an update of "Shane", but with better acting.   I love the story and the characters.  Â  The action is well done.  I don't think it is as strong as the first film, but I guess it makes up for it in action and story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is very well made and very well acted. The movie has a "mystery", which was also made by the director. I thought the movie was not as good as the first one, but this one definitely is.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this on a big screen in an amazing theater. It was an incredible movie that was not only well done, but entertaining and the acting was wonderful. It is the true story of an American man who is traveling the world with a group of mercenaries when they get captured by the Taliban. After being tortured and taken to a Taliban jail, the American man decides to rescue the other mercenaries, who were taken prisoner. There is some interesting scenes and some great action scenes. I can't wait to see the sequel. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this at the first screening, and I have to say that I was really impressed by what I saw. It is a great film about a group of high school friends who are forced to get a job at a high class restaurant when their older brother goes into a coma. The plot is not much to write home about but the actors are terrific and the story is quite good. The only thing that could have been better is that the film could have shown the brother's coma from a more up close angle, and not just a long shot of the group of friends going into work. I wish that the brother would have been in some of the shots.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this on VOD before it was released in DVD. It had me in tears after.   This is a great movie to watch with the kids. It has the perfect balance of scary and funny.  The cast is great.  I love the little boy in the front of the camera.  It gives a sense of family and is good for the kids to watch as well.  For the kids, there's a short scene where he's on the front porch and the kid jumps up on him. It's a great moment to show they can be scared of anything.  This should be in more movie theaters than DVD!   A must see for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a bit skeptical about seeing "Babe", but it is one of the best comedies I have ever seen.  The screenplay was brilliant (if you want to see some of the great scripts) and the actors did a wonderful job.  It was just fun and hilarious!  I saw it at a movie theater and loved it!   If you have never seen this film and have a movie-collecting friend, please pass on this gem!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You are going to get a laugh out of it. It is a comedy, but it does go into some serious and some dark places. I highly recommend it to a comedy fan.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   The plot is fairly basic, but the acting is very good.  I especially enjoyed how the movie is based on a true story, as the movie was filmed after the events, so the characters have no reason to be "shady" (i.e. they could be anything) or act in a "cheap" manner.  It's just a story about two men who are friends, and one of them falls for a beautiful woman.  While this is not a comedy, it's still very entertaining.  The movie also has some great scenes where the camera shows both the love and hate in the relationship.  This is the best romantic comedy I have ever seen.  A must see movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was excellent, very well acted and well directed. The acting was very good. This movie showed a lot about the human psyche, especially when the character that was being portrayed by the wife was trying to kill herself because she was so depressed and didn't have any friends anymore. The movie was great.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film shows the dark side of Vietnam. This movie is about a group of friends of Vietnamese who come to America to go to college and have a lot of fun. But in the Vietnam War, the soldiers are not like the other soldiers. They are extremely cruel to the Vietnamese. A good example of the atrocities of the war is the scene where a young Vietnamese girl is raped. She had to give birth after this and her child was not conceived in that way. The boy was very sick and he died in the womb. The scene is very graphic and really shows the horrors of the Vietnamese in the war.   This movie was well made and a good portrayal of the Vietnam war.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked the movie. There are no cheesy music videos and the characters are interesting and likable.  The only reason I didn't give it an amazing score is because some scenes could have been more dramatic and believable.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie.   There was so much to learn from this film, and you could see a change in every actor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never heard of this movie before I bought it. My first thought was that the director is either insane or he is a liar. I had heard it was a hit and miss but I had no idea about the bad reviews. It was so bad I had to watch the rest. It didn't matter that the movie had a budget of $13,000,000 and it was so overproduced it couldn't be taken seriously, this movie would have lost money. A lot of the movie is the bad guy getting away with murder. The bad guy is a serial killer. That's all you need to know to make this movie an absolute disaster. You see him killing people in the most brutal ways you can imagine. The acting is very bad in the movie. You could swear that some of the characters are actors and there is nothing that makes any sense. It is a terrible movie and I wish I had only seen it once to be sure that I didn't waste my time. I wouldn't recommend it for a family.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was my first time ever seeing "A Perfect Murder" and I loved it. There was such a realistic look into the murder scene from the first few seconds of the movie. My son has always enjoyed movies that feature real actors and this one was an excellent choice for him. The killer was great and so was the woman who he raped. He made me laugh out loud when he came into my son's room just to have sex with him. This movie is very hard to find so I am glad I saw it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard this is a very good movie, but this movie was so much fun! I love the characters, and they're all hilarious. I loved the action, and the suspense. There were definitely times when things would go too far, but they always got resolved with a laugh or a "what the hell". The director and screenwriter were great too! I wish there were more of these kinds of movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I really enjoy this movie! It's one of my favorites, even though I've seen it many times before.   The director is great at using the characters, and the pacing is just perfect.  It's a little bit dated but it's definitely a great movie to see in theaters and I love watching it over and over.  This movie has never really been made available on DVD, so if you see it in the theater and want to see it again, do yourself a favor and go see this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a fun romp.

I've never seen aÂ Pierce Brosnan movie, but I knew that this one was good!   The characters are really well developed, and some of the dialog is funny and very good.  Â   The special effects are fantastic.  In the final scene of the movie, they take their hair into the oven to get it to black. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this movie a few times, but the way it has been re-edited makes it quite different. I love watching a film as an adult, so this was quite new to me. I did not realize that the original film had been reworked.   The film has a very interesting story about a girl who was molested as a child, and who tries to find out who her abuser is, and the people around her.  The cast really does bring this film to life.  There are a lot of moving scenes.  I loved the score.  It is a strange film, but one I highly recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is not too bad. It has a very good story, although it's not very well written.  It had a wonderful scene where a child is on the beach, playing and the mother comes and sits next to the child, who just stares at her. She tries to make him move, but he doesn't move at all. Then she starts to tell him his family is dead, his father is on his way to jail, and his mother has a baby who will be a burden on his family. The child just stares and he's never told anything.  The film is about the aftermath of the Great Depression and the way it affected people, as well as the hardships a person must go through to get out of that.   It has some great performances, especially by Ray Milland, as the woman who takes care of the child and the man who has come to take care of her.  This was in 1932, and a lot has changed since then.  I don't think this is the best movie from 1931. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I just had our 2nd date. We went to see the movie. It was good and very funny. We couldnt get enough of it. The way it was set up, you could tell there was a lot of work that went into making it. Great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you liked the TV series, you'll love the movies.   The actors do a great job of making you feel the stress and emotions of being a soldier during the war.  It is realistic and very sad, and I enjoyed it all the way through.  As a fan of the show, you won't be disappointed, as this is exactly what a good TV series should be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first "The Legend of Bagger Vance" was very good, but not a perfect adaptation of the story. The book was great.   I thought that the film was better.  The actor who played Bagger had a very deep voice, and that made him really look the part.  Even though he was a child actor, it was very disturbing. The film had a lot of bad special effects.  After seeing this movie, I wanted to know more about Vance's life.  I think this will be a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first one is about a father and his son who find the body of a child killed by a drunken trucker who ran over him and dumped it in a river. The boy's father tells him the truth of what happened and asks him if he has ever really thought about it, what he was doing that night, why he didn't stop the trucker. He didn't, he never did. He says he always knew it was wrong.   He goes to live with his mother and has a daughter called Karen, who is much like his son. When he is called in to take her away from the man who killed her father and brother, he doesn't take it easily.  He decides that it is time to go back to his roots.  A short time later he returns to the house where his father was killed and the police are waiting for him.  This film is well worth watching. It gives a glimpse of what life is like in a small town when the police aren't interested in your crimes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a bit reluctant to get this movie because of the fact that it had a lot of bad reviews from other reviewers, and there was no good reviews from the film itself. I saw the review and thought, 'I will wait for the reviews before I watch this.' Well, I am glad I did. This is a great movie. It's just a shame that the original director never got his due. The acting is great, the set is beautiful, and the movie has a lot to offer for anyone who loves classic spaghetti westerns. This movie is a must-see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story and screenplay by John Krasinski and Bill Hader, is very funny, and it is easy to understand. The plot is well put together. Krasinksy is excellent as he is always doing good for his character and is never mean, and the other actors all do good for them characters and really bring them to life. The best scene in the film is the one in the hospital where Bill Haines and Julie Bowen are having a good time together. It is a good moment, as the two people enjoy some of their favorite foods.   I am glad that the director didn't try to do a musical score for the movie, as it would have been too difficult for him to pull off. The movie does not have the same great musical numbers, but for the most part it is not a terrible movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director had an amazing vision and was able to put a wonderful twist on a tale of a dying person that made the whole story seem like it was taking place inside his mind.   I think that this is one of those films that you just can't put down.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You don't want to be a monster - but it's all you're ever really given a chance to be" - George Miller "This is a great movie about a great character. Miller knows the story well, he gets a lot of great performances and he tells it in a way that's totally believable." - David Goyer "The film is a fascinating one, but the performances are what really make it a treat." - Stephen King   This was the film that launched the "Mad Max" franchise and has become a timeless classic. While it is a classic, it can't be compared to other "Mad max" movies. There are no "The Road Warrior" and "The Fury Road" to compare it to. In fact, it's a bit of a departure from "Mad car" films, with it being a bit more "post apocalyptic" and gritty. It's still a fun movie though, with some great action and some great performances by the entire cast.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It is a classic, and well worth watching.   The story is pretty straightforward. An astronaut (Bruce Boxleitner) is stranded on Mars and begins a journey to learn more about his origins.  I really enjoyed the different takes on the movie and how they brought in different styles to make it work.  It's like watching different types of movies.  The cast was excellent and I always enjoyed watching them.  John Goodman and Diane Lane in particular were great, and were really funny.  My favorite actor was the bad guy. He was evil and hilarious. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the trailer for this movie and thought, "Hey, this is pretty cool."   For the most part, it was.   This movie, about a father and son team who hunt a giant spider that destroys their property, was filmed in and around Wisconsin.  The special effects were amazing, even though the movie is a little dated.  I love that these guys were working with just a camera and some special effects and still made a good film.  It was a fun little film, especially if you have an eye for the action scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think my all-time favorite movie is "The Bad and the Ugly". The Bad and The Ugly is one of the first films I ever saw that truly spoke to me. I had no idea what I was in for but once the first time it started I was hooked. This film was so realistic it was so scary that I never went back to "A Fistful of Dollars" the following year. The main character, Sergio Leone, is so incredible and so in your face.    And this is one film that I was really not able to get out of my head.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to see this film during a week of the hottest summer of my life. The film is about a pair of young people, one girl and one boy, who meet in a train station at a time of great upheaval. The girl is a former member of the German Army and has escaped the Nazis. The boy is a war hero who has been shot down and captured. He is being held in a Nazi dungeon and hopes to escape.   What I loved most about this movie was that it takes place in the '40s. It was realistic, had a realistic feel and really brought it to life. You have the war on the streets, the camps, the brutality, the cold and the snow.  The film also had a great soundtrack to it and was so relaxing and cool.  This movie was about love and war and about how it is sometimes not the best thing in the world but it's something worth fighting for. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is great. The best of the bunch. My wife and I watched this on our last day of our vacation in the south. I had to take my wife home and we enjoyed it very much. It is a story about two brothers who are just kids in the woods, but they do everything together. Great family film and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good old fashioned western, but is very safe and very well done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie and I really enjoyed the cast. I especially loved the casting of Peter Berg (Cagney). The movie was filmed in beautiful places and the location shooting was excellent. The picture is also top-notch. I thought the movie had a lot of charm.   The only thing I didn't like was that the whole movie ended up with a bad ending.  I really liked the script by William Goldman and I thought it was really good and funny.  Â  The one thing I don't like is that the actress who played the young wife was played by the great Gilda Radner. I don' t really like to watch the same actress in two different roles. I think that it ruins the movie.  The movie "The Stuntman" was about this young stuntman who was killed during a film. It made a good story but the movie was shot in an old way and it just looks like it was shot on an old camera. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason I haven't seen the remake is because I thought the original was more original than this version. It's just a remake, and the original isn't much different.   I only wish this movie wasn't so over-rated. I was really looking forward to watching this movie, but I just can't. It really makes me wish that they hadn't made it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think I will stick to the old fashioned horror films when I am bored with the latest Hollywood films.  I liked this movie because of the old school atmosphere and the atmosphere is very much like a classic slasher film but without the gore and the blood and the gore is just not that present in this film.  This film is so funny in fact it was hilarious.    In conclusion this is a great slasher/thriller film and i would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good horror film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's amazing. A really well acted movie with very real and well-done characters.   The movie is like a road movie with lots of action. There are some action sequences that are impressive.  You get a really good sense of what it must be like to be a fighter pilot during the war. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this movie on a Friday afternoon. I am a fan of the show and was very excited about seeing it. It was well acted and it was funny. The story was interesting, especially the part about how they were searching for a missing girl and then they were turned down when they were told she had a fake ID. I think this movie would be a great movie to watch with the crew from the show.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I first watched the movie 'I Am Sam' in the mid 1960s.   The first three lines of the movie made me go back in time and to when I was a teenager watching tv shows like 'The Lone Ranger' and 'The Six Million Dollar Man'.   After that it was a real trip.  I love this movie and it makes for one great day of watching a movie.  If you love cowboy movies and can stomach the over the top action and music, this is a must see movie for all of us. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, I thought it was great.  It was like a modern fairy tale!  The movie is great and I loved the characters and the story line.   The song "Fantasy in the Dark" by The Eagles is amazing and really makes you feel like you are in a fairy tale.  If you love fairy tales and music you will love this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never knew that the movie "Hannibal" was released during the time of WW2 and in Italy. This film is a great adaptation of the story of the book by Thomas Harris. It stars the great Jack Nicholson and Laurence Fishburne who have done an amazing job in this movie. This movie will make you really enjoy the story.   This movie takes us through the time period of WWII and also takes us to Italy and gives us an authentic Italian experience.  This is the movie to see if you love great movies and want to see some great performances.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a huge horror fan. I don't really like the genre as much as the action-comedy genre. The horror genre is more like what we see in the slasher genre in the movies. It's basically a slasher flick that doesn't have as much blood or gore as the more popular slasher flicks. I love the movie. I loved the action and gore. I was surprised at how great it looked and how well it was shot.   It took me a couple of tries to get into the movie but once I did it was worth the wait.  The movie is set in California and you get to see some of the California landmarks and even an aerial shot of the San Francisco Bay.  It is really well done and I'm glad to see a horror movie that puts some thought into it and puts some blood into the movies they make. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never watched a movie so much as it seems to have been sitting on my mind, waiting for a chance to be exposed to its wonders. That time has arrived, and I have to say this is a good thing, not a great thing, and it never gets there. The movie tells the story of a wealthy widow who gets a call from a doctor in Germany that her husband was suffering from terminal cancer and they need her to travel to Frankfurt to be with him when he dies. As it turns out the doctor is a very bad person and has had her husband for decades but is no longer interested in him. She takes the trip and she is almost immediately infected with this nasty virus and she starts to develop some bad traits that are not her own. As she gets older she begins to be able to control this, but this makes her very lonely, and lonely is what a movie like this is looking for. She begins to turn to some people around her for comfort. One of them happens to be a very attractive woman who also has a very unhealthy obsession with her. A very interesting relationship develops and they become really good friends. It is a little hard to watch at first because it is very disturbing. This movie could be just as dangerous as any movie that comes out of Europe with the right actor in it. But, if you don't take the time to think about it, the movie takes over your mind, and the audience doesn't even realize it is a movie until it is over. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you to watch it.Â  It was in the early 90s and it was not as funny as it is now but it was still good and it did not waste a single minute of it.   Also, if you like horror movies then you will like this one, especially when there is blood.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people have written negative reviews about this movie, but I am going to give it a positive rating.   The movie has a very good story line.  Some of the best acting I've ever seen.  This movie is set in the 20s so it's got a nice retro feel to it.  I think the movie is pretty good.  The plot is interesting, and has a great cast of characters.  But my biggest complaint is that it is set too far back in time.  In the movie they use real scenes, and a real house.  It's a shame that it took them 20 years to do this, because it would have been amazing.  A little more time for an old movie like this, would have made this a great movie.  Also it doesn't make sense that the actors didn't come back for sequels or remake this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.  A couple of years ago, I was in a bad mood and needed some entertainment. I googled "Movies I Love" and this movie came up as a recommendation. I watched it for about 2 weeks and had a great time. It's an action film with lots of action and cool car chases.   It's also a very good car chase.  I saw this movie a couple of times, the first time on a TV channel I didn't watch. The second time, I saw it at the cinema, and it was great. The car chase is fantastic. The soundtrack was great, the cars were amazing and the music was so fitting.  The actors were all good and the movie was well made.  I don't think it was quite possible to make a great movie on a budget and have people watch it.

This movie is also a good example of how a little movie can have such a big impact on an audience.

A really good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My family and I had gone to see a movie with my wife's mother. My wife and I were both watching the movie and we saw that the audience was sitting back. It was so funny how a little kid was playing behind her and my wife was trying to get close but I don't think I got her yet. I was watching this movie with friends in my living room. We were playing games on my TV. I remember we were laughing so hard that we started to lose track of what we were watching. Then my wife had to go back to the bathroom to go to the restroom. I'm so glad I got to see this movie because it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I hope to see it again and laugh some more.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is very good, especially when you think about it. The acting was good and all the characters have their own feelings. There's even a scene in a cafe where they all have a big discussion. I don't know if they had the same kind of script like in "Good Will Hunting" or not but it worked really well.   I found the film hard to follow because the characters are so different but I think it was a good idea. It was a bit difficult to follow but when the characters do something you have to watch it to understand what's happening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this at the Cinema Village in Santa Monica and it was just as entertaining as the reviews I've read, especially since it was shot on 35mm film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the beginning of the movie when she's in jail, she says to the officer, "I don't want to go to prison, I just want to leave this place." I love that line, because she wants to get away from this place, to go somewhere else. So it makes me really want to see the movie, because I just loved the whole movie.   The thing that really impressed me about this movie is that I don't think there's really a character who's really really defined as a main character. There's no one you really can point to and say this person's the main character, but there are other characters in the movie that are really interesting, like the couple that's really getting into it and having a really good time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard it referred to as a "good movie" but it's much more than that.  It's an incredibly well-made movie about a family and their dealings with a very poor man. It really shows how a poor man can be a really bad father, as well as a bad person.   The film is just so funny and entertaining, so well-written and well-acted, it's hard to not laugh at things.  He has a wife and a daughter who are very close to him.  In the first half, the husband doesn't know how to react to a phone call he received that his wife has been stabbed to death.  However, he does find a woman with a knife who looks very like the woman who was stabbed to kill.  She runs away before he could get a chance to question her about it.  There are a few things going on, the film has a few hidden gems like that. Â  He seems quite confused about the situation, but he doesn't really seem to be in any real danger from the attacker.  When he gets to the hospital and sees her lying in a pool of blood, he knows he has to get the information about her death to her wife who is already in labor.  He also has to deal with the fact that his own daughter is very angry with him because he lied to her about something that she wanted to do and he also has no idea how to handle the situation.  The wife doesn't appear to be too fond of her husband.  But she does seem to respect her husband's decision to do the right thing. Â  So he does the right things, and then she knows he's done the rightthing.  Unfortunately, all he does is get kicked out of the house and left in the care of his daughter. Â  It's kind of depressing.  And it's really quite depressing considering that the film is made on an extremely low budget.  That can be an issue when it comes to depicting things, since even the smallest details may not be fully in focus.  For example, in one scene, a character talks about something in the kitchen.  What was it?  The camera is pointed at a door, but we don't get a good look at it or even hear it moving.  So you'd have to look at the actors to get a better look at what they're talking about, but in this case, that doesn't help

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was given the opportunity to see this classic movie back in the 80's. I don't think I can find any better version of the movie other than the one in the Criterion Collection.   The story has many similarities with the real life events that occurred, and it does a fine job of bringing the characters to life.  There are two main characters, and they both do what they think is best. I liked that these two characters are well balanced.  It was a little slow, but it does make for a nice watch.  A must watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed the movie very much. I had seen a copy of the movie, and I think that the actor, William Shatner, deserved it more. The actors of the original series did a wonderful job. I think they were the best cast in the Star Trek franchise. The story was interesting, and it was a well made movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening scene of this movie is absolutely incredible. As the crew arrives in the desert, the dust is still in the air and a little sand storm has been raging in the sky. The entire crew is covered in dust from the ground to the ceiling. One of the crew members is covered with so much dust he doesn't look human anymore. The crew is in total disarray. The director is desperately trying to keep the movie running and everyone is trying to out run the sand storms. As they're running through the desert the crew begins to notice something. Something strange...something out of the ordinary.   Just watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm surprised I haven't seen this before but I saw the video and I thought it was amazing. It's so well-made that I have to admit I watched it over and over again. It has great acting, action scenes, and a story that keeps the viewer's attention. The story is told like a police procedural but this is not a typical cop show. This is an action thriller. The best part of the movie is that you can tell the actors are just going along for the ride. This movie has great action scenes. I loved the scene where the guys with the chainsaws are trying to pull the lady out of a house where she's trapped and tied up. They didn't waste a minute and moved on to the next set of guys. A must see for any action movie fan.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a good film, but it isn't without flaws. I would have liked to see a little more development of the characters, as well as more focus on their lives. I didn't understand why some of the guys who were in the movie were only in the trailer, while the main cast appeared in the film. The storyline was pretty good, and I loved the ending. Overall, I think it is a good watch, even if some of these aspects could have been improved.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie that made me a lifelong fan of a certain director.   I don't know about the actual quality of the film itself, but I don a certain sense of nostalgia from it.  It was the first movie I saw that really inspired me to make movies and was the catalyst for me getting my first camera.  While the actual film itself isn't really of that great quality, there is a certain element of the movie that I enjoy.  The cinematography and editing, the acting, the sound editing, even the score are all done with a certain amount of style.  This was the movie I used to make "movies for grownups" with my friends.  What made me love the movie is how the acting in this movie was completely believable.  For a film where all the action was a joke, it sure was entertaining.  If you are a fan of John Milius, then this movie is the real deal.  A must see movie that doesn't hold a candle to the original.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best of the new breed of martial arts flicks, which were all so similar back in the 1980s and 1990s.   Very well acted.  A great ensemble cast.  Beautifully shot.  The only thing missing from this film, to my taste, was an extended fight sequence.  I like that they kept this film real, and kept it real hard.  It has a very gritty, hard, and realistic feel, that gives it a real martial arts film vibe.  This film is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off with a really cool and unexpected scene.   It takes place in a church that is under siege, and our main character, Luke, is helping to get the fire under control. He finds his way through a few people and finds a church bell which has a secret compartment which he opens and finds an antique pistol hidden in it.  We then watch as this is brought to the attention of a woman who tells the authorities that Luke is a deserter, that he stole the pistol from a church, and the only way that he would not be executed for treason, is if he brought it back to the church where he belongs.  This is a great idea!   However, the woman in the church is, let's just say, not that into this idea. She just wants Luke dead.  The first thing she does is get her husband, the church's pastor to kill Luke.  Then she and her husband go to the next best church, but this time she uses the same church bell as Luke did, and brings a revolver to it. She makes sure she has the right type of gun for the job, and then is immediately shot by a priest at the door.  In order to get to the bullet, Luke has to go through the whole church.  At one point, Luke is taken hostage by a couple who are being robbed, and is given an important mission by a fellow deserTER.  And so the movie begins.  It is amazing how effective the movie was at making this very unusual story seem just normal and normal.  Even though there was a huge amount of weirdness going on, it all seemed quite believable.  My favorite aspect of the film was probably the ending. Â  It was quite surprising, but then the film just sort of takes off from there.  I love the idea of the church being attacked by someone who has the revolver inside it, but was so good at making it seem real.  Also, the whole idea of hiding the gun inside the bell is brilliant.  Of course, I know it is ridiculous and implausible, but when you put the right amount of strange together, you get a cool, fresh, unexpected feel.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and I really enjoyed it! Â The acting was great.  Luke was great in the film.  However I will give the movie a little bit of a low score for its ending. It does
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A film that tells a story that is more than a simple detective story, but a real tale of the history of the detective of London in the 1880's, Mr. Todman has created a compelling story in which the historical aspects are just as intriguing as the supernatural. The historical aspect is even more fascinating since the film is based on an 1878 story of the same name, by Charles Todmann, who also wrote a biography of the character. If you enjoy a historical story set in the 19th century, this is a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've enjoyed a lot of the movies in the Alien universe.   For all its flaws, the story was one of the most memorable and compelling in recent years, and it was a joy to watch Ridley Scott craft a story that really worked as a movie.  The characters were all strong and credible, especially Ripley, and as the story went on, they all got more complicated, especially the Aliens, which were so well-realized.  For the most part, the script was very well thought out, as if it was one long, thought out film.  Ridley Scott knows how to build suspense.  Unfortunately, the action in this movie wasn't quite up to the standards set by the other two movies.  There were no "bombshells" in this film, but there were a lot more "body bags."  I had seen Alien on a previous occasion, and had a great time.  However, this movie, in my opinion, just wasn't that good.  I think the film had a few really great sequences, but that was about it.  If you are looking for a new classic Alien, give this one a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hi all, I just finished watchingÂ  Black Swan. There are many things that I liked and felt were good. There are, however, many things I did not like.Â  This movie made me think. I was amazed at how much effort was put into trying to find a real story. I do not care about such things as whether the characters want to leave or not. I care about the actual story being told. This movie has the feel of a Hollywood script. It could be used to write a script for a movie about someone who does something very bad but doesn't want to see the consequences of his actions. I liked that in the ending he realized it was all a huge mistake. I felt he felt remorse and was trying to do the right thing. And he did. The way he finally went back to normal was beautiful. I would watch this movie over and over again. I just hope that it does not go into another kind of horror film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw the trailer of the movie I was shocked. I couldn't get over it. I can't even explain it. So what is the story? There is a man that comes across a woman who is in some kind of a coma. He is so touched by this, he begins to help her. They fall in love, she wakes up and now he must follow the rules of love as she does. I was amazed! The only complaint is that I was expecting something else from the trailer.   My rating:  It was a great movie!   The movie was great. The acting was great and the music and acting were great. It has a great story about love and sacrifice and overcoming obstacles.  This was a film that made me feel like I was in love with this man that I found. It really made me laugh and cry.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who has fallen in love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was a film that I didn't expect to love and it ended up being so.   It is a film of three guys (all the same age) and it shows how they deal with one another when one of them is in jail and can't go to school.  The story is about how they go in search of the father of one of the boys and their journey to find the father.  It doesn't get very emotional at times and that is a good thing.  They take us with them on their search, we see them go in different places, get arrested, get a warrant and go on another search.  One thing that caught me a bit is the music.  At times it is very mellow and at others, very upbeat, but it seems that the mood will switch around at any time.  When the music turns upbeat and the mood is lighter the mood starts to change.  This film really caught my attention and I'm glad that I watched it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My wife and I had seen this film about 8 years ago when we were in the mood for a low-budget '70s sci-fi thriller that had some fun with the old film. I liked the story and the acting. It was very low-rent. And, I still enjoyed it. A little too much.   The '80s were my generation and I didn't think that anyone could make a better science fiction thriller than Steven Spielberg did with Close Encounters.  This is a classic sci- fi flick.  The acting was great.  When you think of science fiction and you think Spielberg, you can't go past Close Enc.  I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie with an eye to seeing it in a movie theater. I did not want to be disappointed but I was not disappointed.  It is the story of a father and son. Their father is killed in combat. The son goes to stay with his Uncle who is in the army. He is wounded and is taken in by the army nurse. It is clear that the movie is based on a true event.   The acting was fine. I have seen better. I think the only reason they went with the actors was to make money. They are good actors but they could have done better. The writing is great. There is a real feeling of what it must have been like.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes war movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It really was a great movie for a young man. I am still in awe of him. I remember watching it with my grandmother in the 60's. She thought it was pretty good. It was the 50s and I thought that was way cooler than now. This is a very good movie. A great time. I wish I had this movie to play on my favorite old tv when I was younger.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a problem with movies that are not really bad but have a big budget and I have too much patience to watch any movie that is like that. I was expecting a much more intense and darker movie with blood and violence but this was one of the most relaxing movies I've ever seen. The actors made you feel like you were in an old western. The music and sound was so good and the film had an old west feel to it.   A must watch!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There isn't much to this movie, and the first half is pretty much just a story that is told over and over again. If you love a good mystery and can wait for a good script, give this one a watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is fun, and you want to see this movie again and again. I enjoyed it and was very entertained. I think the action scenes are great, and the movie has some very cool looking cars and stunts.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There isn't a bad thing to say about this movie, which is why it won the grand prize at the 2009 Venice Film Festival. The movie takes place in the late 1950s and has a fantastic cast of people like John Cusack, Edward Norton, Robert Duvall and Steve Buscemi in different roles. It's one of the best examples of what a director can do in a feature length film when he isn't stuck making an episode of "S.W.A.T." This movie is one of those gems that you never want to see again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film "Ghost" is an original ghost story, about a ghost that haunts a group of boys.  The movie is well acted and contains a haunting soundtrack.  It is one of the most original ghost stories that I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very good movie and is worth a watch. A good story with a good director. This movie has it all. A very solid performance from Gary Oldman. He gives it his all and it pays off. The acting is top notch as is the acting from his cast mates. Gary Oldmans acting is always great. I have seen him in some films and this is one of my favorites. This is a solid flick and a great time.   It really has everything to make it a top notch movie. The actors and director have a great rapport and it is great seeing them get into character. The story has great twists and turns. A must see for any action fans.  A must see flick from this director!  This movie had everything. The action, acting, script, and most of all the story. It was really great to see how they came up with the plot. Great way to watch a good action flick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie back in 1998 when it was just a cult hit, and I remember feeling pretty sucked into the weirdness of it. The movie was a bit hard to follow, and it didn't have that great of a beginning/ending, but when things got really weird and twisted, it was really awesome.  The movie itself was good, with a pretty twisted, fun plot, that took a while to get the characters to work out.  There's a little bit of nudity in it, and there's some nudity in the movie itself, but it wasn't that offensive to me.  As for the music, I didn't like it all that much, but the lyrics were great.  I also liked the fact that the movie seemed to be taking itself so seriously, yet it was still super fun and crazy.   My only real complaints are the fact the actors didn't do all of their own stunts, and the fact there's a pretty big time skip, as the movie was made for the Troma movie in the 90's, and was in syndication for a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so awesome, like if "Pulp Fiction" or "True Romance" came out in 2 parts. It's a real gangster film and it's one of my favorite movies ever.   It's got everything, the violence, the music, the clothes, and it really is one of the best films of all time.  I'm not a big fan of the movies, but this one is great.  It even takes place in "the greats" like "The Maltese Falcon", and has the same "punch lines" like the "Fagin' " scenes in "The Great Escape".   I love movies like this and this movie is great and has so much more to it than I expected.  This is what "the American movie" should have been like in the 70s. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed the movie, as well as watching it with my son, who didn't know that it was a film about the Manson murders. I enjoyed watching the movie with my family and enjoyed it as much as I enjoy watching a good action movie.    - September 5, 2017Great
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's the most important thing about the film? The great acting by the crew. Â  A beautiful setting. The cinematography by Michael Anderson. Â  And, what's most impressive is that the story is so good.   The story is a bit complicated (which I appreciate), but it's all done with such a perfect balance of tragedy, comedy, and drama.  The film also features a great performance from George Clooney as John McClane.  There are some great scenes and performances that made me go out of my seat.  What a wonderful film, and a great reminder to all those people who make a living on the exploitation and re-shoots.  I'm looking forward to seeing the film again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like this movie so much. I just thought I would give it a try since it's been a couple of years since I saw it and I haven't seen a lot of great films lately, and I'm glad I did.   I can't say enough about how amazing this movie is. It was my first time seeing a movie about the Holocaust and seeing the life of such a poor, persecuted person in such a bad, bad world. I don't think I have seen a more touching, sad, and honest portrayal of a good man who's not allowed to do what he wants.  I'm not sure who would win in a fight, an American officer or a German soldier, but they both have a lot in common with each other.  It was good seeing all the characters again, even though I know very little about them.  One of the best things about this movie are the music. It brings the entire movie to life and makes it an unforgettable experience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have always been a huge fan of The Big Lebowski. It is a comedy that is in no way pretentious, but is just funny and full of great characters. It is one of those rare movies where you can laugh out loud for at least an hour without getting sick of it.   " The Big Picture " is a beautifully made movie that shows what kind of man Walter Burns is, and also shows how his actions have affected the whole world. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "What do you do with the body after it dies? That is a question most of us have thought about as we contemplate our own mortality. The first act of this documentary, as you might expect, is a harrowing account of what happens when the brain and other organs are removed. But it's what follows that sets the film apart." - Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times. The BrainDead Man (1980) is the story of Frank (Bobby Seale), a man whose mind has been disconnected from his body. Frank, after months of living in a hospital, has been placed in a room with a TV. He is told that if he can learn to watch the TV without the "stimulus" of images, he will not die. The Stimulus is the program from the TV, a variety show, and the show is a series of live episodes of the popular comedy group, The Three Stooges. While Frank learns to watch TV without images, his mind is disconnected from the rest of his body, and gradually the memories that Frank thought were his own are forgotten, replaced by images he has seen in the Stimulus. It is this disconnection from the body that is the only way he can function, because he is the sole survivor of his own life. Frank goes on to become a stand-up comedian. The title is from an old TV sitcom in which the characters would use the word braindead.   The film does not seem to be well-made. There are a number of technical problems. Most of them seem to occur during the scenes when Frank is watching TV. The film was shot in black and white with a budget of less than $5,000. Many scenes are very long and are sometimes very boring, but the plot is very well-written. There is no music during the movie, and no sound effects either.  Frank is portrayed by Seale. He was the star of the TV series of the same name. He has appeared in over fifty films since then, but his most memorable role is as "the Brain Dead Man" in BrainDead.  The Brain Dead is about the "brain dead" man's attempt to live again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was expecting to hate this film. The trailers and the publicity didn't do it justice. The movie is well shot, well acted and has good performances from all the cast. The action is well-directed, fast paced and the acting and story are very believable. The story is extremely hard hitting but not gratuitously so, the action is good, and the story is just about right. It's really good. I really enjoyed this movie, it was very original, original enough to be worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most well-made of the '90s slasher flicks, and probably the best one I've seen. It has everything it needs, from a plot that makes sense (and has you wondering how such a seemingly uninspired movie managed to stay in theaters), to the perfect performances and costumes. It doesn't try to do anything too crazy or "fantastic," and is a solid film that just happens to be a great horror film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie a few years ago at my local movie theater. It was a pretty decent movie with some good actors. I liked the idea of a young cop who had to go undercover to get into the Mafia.   The action scenes were great with a good score and good camerawork. I only wish it had a bit more depth. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The opening credits are great!  I just can't wait to get the movie out of my head and watch it again.  There are a lot of interesting, thought provoking subjects in this movie.  It's a dark and heavy subject matter, but that doesn't mean it's not a fun ride.  The only thing that I did wish was that the soundtrack was longer.   A great film.  - November 19, 2013Fantastic!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the 70's I remember watching a movie by the title of The Black Sheep. The movie stars an older couple named Tom and Rosemary, who are both divorced and living in an apartment in New York. Rosemary has become very depressed about her husband leaving and she has become increasingly violent and threatening towards Tom. Tom and her son, Jack, have been spending time with their new neighbor, the elderly, demented woman named Mrs. Schaffer. Mrs.Schaffer has become a fixture of the neighborhood. It seems that she has been living in the apartment for over 25 years. As the movie starts, Tom tries to avoid Mrs.Shaffer, but the elderly woman appears to be too much for him. In a heated argument, Mrs. Shaffer hits Tom with a glass and nearly knocks him out. However, Tom manages to climb the apartment building, and once he's on the roof, he manages to catch a glimpse of Rosemary lying in her blood on the pavement below. Suddenly, she sees him coming and she runs down the stairs. Tom rushes down the next stairs and grabs Rosemary. As he brings her back to the apartment, Mrs Schaffer attacks him, and Tom manages a few last shots as he hangs off a wall. Then the film ends.   I loved this movie and it is very good. It is like the 80's version of a horror movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first movie with the title " The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo " I remember watching it and immediately becoming very disappointed. Not because I did not like the film itself, but because of the title. I didn't really understand what it was about and, as a result, it did not stand out or stand out much. I was left confused and disappointed by the movie, which was disappointing because I was hoping for something more. It was the first movie I was disappointed in, and I was always in the market for a more interesting movie than "The Sixth Sense". So, when I heard about the new movie "The Girl with a Dragon Tatto" I was curious to see what it would be like. "The film is much better than the first film" is what I read on the box and it really did make me want to see this movie more. The story of the movie does not make the first one seem so appealing and I am glad that it is not based on the same premise. I hope it will get good reviews because this movie is so different than "Snow White", "The Dark Knight" and "Lord of the Rings". I enjoyed it and, more importantly, I enjoyed watching it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never thought I'd see a movie that was so funny, and so cleverly made.  The actors were great too, and the humor was just so perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an old fan of Stanley Kubrick, but I had never seen 2001. I was in the right place at the right time, and this movie had a very real impact on me. I had a chance to meet Stanley in 1977, and he seemed like a very nice guy. He knew who I was, and told me I would be a very good addition to the studio. I never had the opportunity to see this movie, so I'm grateful to a friend who was willing to give it to me. It's a very long movie, but it's worth it. I have no idea what the future holds, but this was an emotional, moving film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a huge fan of the films of the late seventies and early eighties. It was a time of great creativity and the best science fiction that any generation had seen. A lot of science fiction films during this time didn't last very long, but this film has a lot of personality and is an interesting watch.   One of my favorite movies of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie.   The film starts off with a nice slow build up.  One of my favorite movies in a long time.  The story is so well written, it almost doesn't matter what happens in the movie. From a great action sequence to the beautiful writing, you don't feel like it happened to you.  I feel as if the movie is an extension of a real life story.  Great acting, great directing, great cast, great script, great special effects, all the stars have to shine in this movie. I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My father is a very active man, and was always a great role model. He was also one of the greatest actors, as a man of the people, he could be so funny in his roles. This one was an unexpected treat. In a world of so many good movies, this is the kind of one you have to sit through a few times. I would not consider it a masterpiece, it is just decent.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie for a very special audience.  It's a "lost film" of sorts.  Written in 1918, it was made a year after the end of the war, and is a very moving, poignant, and emotional film.  I found this movie in a used-film store.  While it wasn't perfect, it's still a very touching film that captures the feelings of the actors and the people around them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â If you're a fan of the TV series you'll find yourself having a great time with this one, and if you're not then, it won't be for you either.   There is something very different and entertaining about this movie, even if it's not quite what you're used to.  The actors really pull off the roles well and you'll really get a sense of the show's chemistry.  In addition to the acting the sound design is great.  It doesn't get too far away from the show and even adds in a few new wrinkles.  This is a solid movie and a great way to cap off the first season. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part about this movie is the story. It has a great feel to it. It was a very good story.   It is not the most realistic film out there, but it did it's job well. The plot is great.  The film is made for horror movie fans. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as I know, "The Big Picture" is the only film to ever get this kind of positive response from critics and fans.   I was initially hesitant to see this film after hearing about the controversy surrounding the director, but it was an excellent film and I definitely recommend it.  I thought "the big picture" might be a film about life itself but was disappointed by the fact that the focus of the film seemed to be more on the people who were making it than on the film itself.  This film has a lot of great performances and was well-acted by many of the cast members.  It was a bit difficult for me to put my finger on one person that I liked in this film, as every single one of them was great.  Although the story was not particularly original, there was enough to make it worthwhile.  Some of the performances were great and the film was well made.  The acting was really something else and I was quite impressed.  There were some scenes that were filmed in front of a live audience which gave this film the feeling of a movie being made for real.  All in all, I found this film to be one of my favorite films of the year.  Thanks for watching!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was made for a very special generation of viewers. Not only was it a major motion picture release in 1972, it was also a TV special. The soundtrack has an interesting story to tell, and even though it didn't reach a very large audience, it still managed to be extremely well done.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie and my wife and I were watching it in the car after dinner and talking about all of the different things that we liked about it.

A fun little movie with a funny guy. I would recommend it to anyone who likes comedies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In case you haven't heard, the movie is about the first human astronaut. He is called "Tiny" in the movie and was born in the future. The astronaut is actually a humanoid and gets all the jobs, so people think he is an android. The android is actually the son of the astronaut and his wife. He wants to prove his humanity and try to escape his life. This is a very interesting movie and I think it's a good addition to science fiction films in general. It is also very well shot with a wonderful camera work and good special effects.   The android and his love interest are very realistic and they actually seem to be a very real couple. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am amazed that these movies are still in theaters and that people are still loving them.   The music was great.  If only they made more of these.  I think that there is still something special about it.  The special effects were amazing.  Some of the stunts looked just awesome and a little too risky. Â It was a little disconcerting how they were so realistic.  There are times where you can just watch the effects without looking, and that really helped. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not think I could like a movie like this. The plot is very simple, but it makes the movie very interesting. And the actors are amazing!   The only thing that made me want to see a re-shoot was the fact that the original actors (Catherine Deneuve and Daniel Bruhl) were really good. They did not seem to be intimidated by the whole thing. I have seen them before, and it was like they had a "we are just having fun, no one cares" attitude about the whole affair.   However, as a fan of this film I had to see it once in a theater before I knew that it was an homage to the old German silent movies of the 1920's and 30's.  It is a great movie, and I can see why people enjoy it so much. I just wish they had given the whole production a more authentic look and feel, as the rest of the movie looks very modern. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of good movies coming out at the moment.  I saw this one when it came out and enjoyed it very much.   It is a good thriller.

This film is not for everyone but it is good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite movies in many years. A brilliant performance from the amazing Russell and the stunning cinematography make this an interesting film.   My only regret is not watching this earlier.

One of my all time favorites.

It's not only funny but it also shows the struggle of the poor and the poor don't have much to complain about. I thought it was a good idea to show that poverty is not all bad. I liked this movie because it shows a different side to the poor people.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a horror movie, and it's about a bad guy.   For years, you had no hope that a movie like this was going to be good, but when it was released on VHS by a horror specialty shop, you could buy it and find yourself interested.  What a lot of horror films are lacking is an edge, and this movie does have that.  It doesn't have to be scary, but it is something that is worth checking out, if only to experience the kind of film that the creators of this movie make. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of "The Lord of the Rings" you will love this movie.  The movie was just great and really set the bar for all future Middle-earth movies.   There is nothing like it and this movie is a MUST watch.

The "stunts" and stunts are funny and well done.  "The Rock" isn't really a good fighter, he fights the crap out of most guys.  There are a lot of other great fight scenes in this movie, and some of the other actors are pretty good, so it's not just about the "Rock."

It has its problems, but in terms of its quality, it is probably one of the best movies made in the 1940's.  The story is one of a man who goes looking for his wife who disappeared.  This is a movie that you can't go wrong with. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had been waiting to see this movie for a few years, but after having a good night at a movie theatre, I didn't want to wait for the DVD anymore so I decided to finally get a copy off iTunes and put it on Vudu. I was pleasantly surprised that the movie wasn't all that bad, the acting was good and the directing was pretty good.   This film is definitely worth a watch, the pacing and story was pretty well done, the way the film was shot was good too.  There was nothing bad about this film and for a 70's film, it looked pretty decent, the costumes were a little outdated for the time, but that's not why you would watch it, so don't worry, the movie was really fun and it has a great soundtrack to it too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not seen this movie before so I have no idea what it's about but from the trailers, it sounds good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie has got the right feeling to it. The character is likeable and it fits well with the story of the story. It takes some time for the action to start, but it makes up for it.   The best action scene in the film is the first one. It is very well done and the characters and camera really show the passion they had. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this movie is about the first year of the life of an innocent, happy, and sweet little boy who discovers what it means to have a big, strange, and mysterious animal called a leopard. It is about how he discovers the things that he can do and enjoy and still be a very happy little boy. The special effects are good. The movie is really funny. There is also a lot of sex in the movie. The girls are cute, the boys are cute. The leopards look real, and the leopaldes and tigers are beautiful, and you'll never forget them!   The whole thing is about children being silly. I don't see any of the characters being evil or bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Â I don't know if it is because I was so young, but it was so much fun.    I'm not sure if I've ever seen a better movie than this.  When you think of all of the terrible action movies that are made these days, you expect it to be boring and unfunny.  But not this. It was the best action movie I've seen in years.  And the stunts are better than the movies they were made in.  My dad watched this movie and he said it had the best soundtrack he's ever heard.  What a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie back when it was just an "I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of these old 80's movies". I'm now a big fans. It's a fun movie, with a very good performance from John Lithgow.Â  What's really great about this movie is the great soundtrack. This movie just had me going in every time I heard the track playing. It really brought a fun and exciting feeling to the film. The other great thing about the soundtrack is that it gives you a new way of looking at the 80's, when the music became more of a fashion statement, instead of being an expression of the music's artistic merits. I think that there were more music cues that weren't used in this movie, that would have been really cool, to have heard some of those cues.Â 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good, but it is a little different in some ways. There are no action sequences, the camera is more like a film camera than the standard'slap stick' camera of many Westerns, and there is no action for the most part. You have some long shots of a woman walking about in the middle of the day. But it still is a Western. There is no fighting in this movie. The actors are all good, and they act in a way that makes you forget that you are watching a Western film. If you are a fan of Westerns and don't mind the long takes and silent characters, this movie will be a good one to watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know, that little movie I always wanted to see that had nothing to do with movies at all? This is it. I'd always been a bit skeptical about it, but this is a very good movie.   It's a story of two men who were brought together when one of their parents was killed, and of how both men came to care for and understand one another. I liked that they had a genuine relationship between them, and the fact that one of them was a serial killer made the whole thing all the more realistic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   What more can you ask for in a thriller, even more suspense than the original?   This is one of those movies I would recommend to the old and the young and anyone who is interested in an unusual movie.   It has a great atmosphere, excellent suspense and has a lot of action.  For all those people who say movies are made for the masses, this is a good show!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is good. It reminds me of an old, old western in the sense that the characters are flawed.  Â It takes some time for the characters to realize the stakes are higher than they thought.  This is why I give it five stars.  It is fun watching this old western, and the actors, especially Tatum and Johnson, do a great job of portraying the old west. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw this movie I was not expecting much from it. I was just excited to see a movie called "The Thing"! It turned out to be the best and worst movie I have ever seen! "The Man from Earth" has everything you could ever want in a movie, and so much more. From the amazing music to the great performances, the film has a lot to offer. The actors and actresses were phenomenal, and I love the special effects in the movie. It was an awesome ride, and really, I would recommend this movie to any horror movie fan. I only wish that they had made a sequel. This was the only time I saw it and I wanted more! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In many ways this film is an anti-poverty movie, a story about what happens when people don't want to work. People get addicted to drugs, get caught up in gangs and are in and out of jail, and their children end up in welfare. The story is really sad, and I felt that it did a great job of illustrating what life can be like when you don't have anything. If you can stand it, you'll enjoy the story.   It's a movie I would see in the summer of 2003, before the economy went into free fall. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film doesn't have a lot of laughs and doesn't move a lot, but it's still a pretty good film. I enjoyed it immensely and am glad to be part of the film's growing cult following.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born and raised in the mid 70's. I am so grateful that I can watch these movies now on Blu Ray for the first time. I have watched some pretty good 80's movies on film. This is a very funny movie. I thought it would be funny to watch as a kid. I never saw this one as a child, and I never watched the sequels either. It has some great moments, and the movie is made very well. I loved the musical number in the movie. It was very funny. I think a guy's life could have been very different if he had not listened to a very attractive woman tell him about her husband. It is a good old comedy.    Rated 4 out of 5 by The King from Great fun I enjoyed this film very much. The characters are great. They are all very different, yet each has something to him. The film is a nice mix of comedy and drama, and you can tell they had fun making this. It's very funny and has a few funny moments.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie and well worth the price. The film is just as good if not better than the original.    It is very difficult to see the "real" George Reeves. But even without any makeup he is still so handsome, well made and well acted.  The film was made in the late 60s and early 70s so it is very nostalgic.  There are a couple of spots where the camera moves and I thought it was a bit low quality but the story is great.  I saw this movie in a theatre in New York where the people were all dressed up for the occasion.  For a movie in 1976 it is really nice and I think a must see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the second time I have watched this movie. The first time I saw it on TV I had no idea what to think of the movie. I have heard so many wonderful things about this movie so I was hopeful that it would turn out well. I am happy to say that it is one of those movies where you find yourself wanting to watch it over and over again. The dialogue, the acting and the music all work together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never liked the idea of the movie but the acting was very convincing and the story was well told. I have a lot of respect for David Carradine.   What I didn't like about this movie was the violence of it. I never saw the movies when I was a kid and it was the first time I saw some of the movies that were on TV.  If you want some laughs, it's a great movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've never really been into big budgeted thrillers, but this one turned me on like I never have with any film.   When it is a good thriller, it's a good one.  The film moves along at a fast pace and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  This film was written by a friend of mine who worked with James Bond.  He knows how to make an action film good and this is no exception.  When I was in high school, my buddy Frank Sinatra was my favorite Bond actor.  As a matter of fact, he is a legend, but he was never the Bond type.  In this film Sinatra comes across as more of a real person.  You can't help but feel for him when he's in danger.  Even though I've seen so many Bond films in my life, I haven't seen a film with a Bond type cast since this film. Â   What I didn't like about the film was that I think it's really over-played the action scenes in the second half.  They seem to be trying to give the audience a big action scene in every corner.  I think I've already seen more than I wanted to in this film and it was getting a little old after a while.  Another thing I didn"t like was that the plot is all over the place.  It would have been much better if the film made the reader want to read the rest of it.  And a really cool twist ending would have made the movie even better.  Now if they could make a good sequel, this movie would be even better than the original.  Overall this was a good film and I highly recommend it for fans of James Bond or thrillers.  I recommend this movie to fans of 007
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed this movie a lot, as a kid it's an enjoyable time capsule of all the different times of the year and people we knew back in those days.    This film is set at the end of the 20s and focuses on two boys from different sides of the Atlantic.  The only problem I have with the movie is that the music is a bit too loud for me, which made it hard for me to enjoy myself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had a lot of fun in this movie, and I thought that all the actors did a really good job.   There were two good movies I saw at the theater with this one that were in black and white so we could not see what the actors were doing, so I guess I don't remember what the movies looked like in black & white, but the actors really did a great job. I loved the music. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I didn't like this movie at first. I knew about it already and I didn`t even really watch it but... the more I saw it, the more satisfied I felt. I mean, for some reason I had some nostalgia and I kept wanting to see it again.    It is about a woman who is in love with another man and they want to get married.  The film is well done and is filled with great emotions.  It`s not a romantic movie but it`s definitely a well acted one. The special effects work in it are good as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was born and raised in New England and I love movies. I used to go to the movies every week and my mom and aunt would take me with them. I got to see many classic movies like Gone With The Wind, Gone With the Wind, Gunga Din, Sunset Boulevard, All About Eve and many others. The great thing about movies is you can watch them anywhere in the world if you want to. So, it made it possible for me to go everywhere I wanted to when I was a kid. I loved seeing movies and being in front of a screen. I still love movies today and love to travel to new places to see movies. So I really appreciate movies and I try to enjoy them.   My daughter loves watching movies and has been asking for a copy of all my favorite movies for years. She loves films so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie, it was good, but it wasn't the best movie in the world, it's close though.   The story is interesting, but not as amazing as some of the other movies in the series. The effects work pretty well and it was fun to watch the characters try to solve the mystery of the disappearance.  This movie was definitely worth watching.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always wanted to see the "The Great Escape" but was never able to get a ticket.  This movie was great.   The best part of the movie was when the prisoners and soldiers were escaping.  It was very realistic and just how they got out of the camp.  I love the acting in this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is about an American soldier in the Korean War who is sent to Korea after World War II to find the missing Americans who were captured. He finds the remains of American troops and tries to make the men tell him about what happened. In his way of thinking he gets help from some of the guys who were with him and also get some information from a woman in the town who worked with the US army in the war. The plot is great. There's a lot of action and action scenes and there's a little romance. The actors do a great job. The dialogue is great and they have a great scene where the woman is with the American soldiers and the guy gets scared and hides in a closet and the woman tells him she's not going to let him in and asks him to get out. A great movie with a great script, great actors and good production values. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge horror fan, so I've seen all the best of them. I've read most of the books and even watched some of the movies. But this was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I love the scares. The actors were great. It was definitely a unique film.    The horror/thriller genre has had its fair share of hit and miss movies. This is definitely in that class. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a story about the life and times of William J. Gault, a French naval officer who was stationed on the island of Guadalcanal in the Pacific during World War II. Â He was an officer who had the skills and courage to lead a small squadron of soldiers.  He became attached to Captain Grafton, the commander of a small unit of American paratroopers and had them transferred to Guadalcans.  Grafty's unit found themselves fighting off Japanese troops in a small area.  They knew they were fighting an enemy who had committed an atrocity against Japanese soldiers at the battle of the Coral Sea.  In addition to being the only Americans to see this massacre, they had also witnessed a great deal of horrific atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers against the civilian population.  Captain Gault was determined to bring the Japanese to justice and was determined even when his own superiors did not agree.  During one of their operations, Captain Grol was captured and imprisoned by the Japanese.  It was during this time that he began to hear the Japanese say that Grol should be executed because his actions made him responsible for the atrocities that were being committed.  The Japanese made it very clear to him that if he tried to escape from prison, they would kill him.  After the prisoners were all transferred to a new prison, Gault and his men were able to sneak off to safety.   There are several interesting aspects of the story that make this film an interesting watch.  While Graftt and his troops were on Guadalconal, they witnessed the killing and killing of civilian men, women, and children.  These were war crimes committed against Japanese. The soldiers felt guilty over these crimes and even if they wanted to, they did not know how to do anything about it.  As Grafts was being shipped home to France, he had a dream in which he killed himself with a machine gun.  When the dream was finally fulfilled, the prisoners felt that the Japanese must have seen them as they were leaving.  Once Graft was released, his family was happy for him but the rest of the American troops were very unhappy about the situation and felt that they had been betrayed by their government.  Although Graft's story is fairly long, it is never too long and always interesting.  Many of the scenes have a very realistic feel and feel just like the time period that they are set in.  I also
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this film, the plot is great. This movie is like a movie from the early 50's in the south with black people. The story shows us a whole lot of violence and pain but it never becomes a show and tell. The acting is great, the movie is great but it is about the lives of people who are trying to survive and not get robbed of a future.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a new movie fan and saw this as the last chance I had to see this one.   It was a fun night.  The cast of all the characters were likable.  I loved the plot of the movie.  There was a great line that went on for 2 mins and it never went by and made me laugh so hard.  Â  The music and acting was perfect.  My favorite scene for sure is the movie poster scene and it was well done.  And of course the special effects were great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really good movie.   I have never seen the whole series so I was curious about this.  It is good but not better than the first two.  I liked the action scenes and the special effects.  A big problem is the voice acting. I don't think I have ever heard the same actor in two different roles.  This movie is really good but don't take my word for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have been waiting for a remake of this classic since it came out in 1979. It has a great cast of actors, but unfortunately the direction isn't that great. This is a very well done film, but not nearly as well directed as the original.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I have seen "Eagle" twice now and I can tell you that I am still amazed at the incredible talents of David Mamet, David Selznick and Frank Capra. These are two of my favorite filmmakers and to watch them collaborate on this film is absolutely fantastic and one of the most visually spectacular and well-written movies ever made."  - Roger Ebert  "It is a masterpiece of film making and you should get it!" - Michael Medved    A little about the film: "Eagles is the most ambitious, audacious, and beautiful film that Selznicq ever made. Selznik took more than ten years to complete the picture, spending $25 million of his own money. It is a beautiful feat of filmmaking that is like nothing that has come before. And it all happens in just two and a half hours. You feel like you are in the presence of a real painter, not just a movie maker." - Richard Corliss  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Great White, an extremely rare, and never before seen, color film from 1931, shows the real nature of the great white whale." The Great White was actually shown for the first time on PBS's American Masters TV program and its rare footage is fascinating.  The Great Whites are thought to be in decline, with one white whale reported to be seen only once in the last 100 years.  According to the film makers, the Great Whites have been spotted off of Newfoundland for the past 20 years and have killed over 3,000 seals.   In the film, the ship that the whale is attacking, the U.S.S St. Louis, had been attacked by the whale before and the whale had to be shot by a gun.  While many people do not believe that the Great White is a great white, I can't say I disagree. I think we are in danger of losing some of our great white sharks and the only thing that will save them is for us to protect their habitat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is a little different from your typical war movie, it's very different. It's a film where the main conflict is a political one, not a military one. It seems to me that a lot of movies are going on at one time in the future but aren't really focusing on the present, I don't think people are ready to accept what is happening in our world. This film was very realistic, very gritty and a lot more than what it may seem.    The most unique feature of the film is that it's about the women of Vietnam, who, along with the men, are dying on a daily basis. This is a film that really does get at the heart of what happened to the men and women of the Vietnam War, because it's the men who are still dying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie does not disappoint! I've seen a few "Star Trek" films in the past, but this one really got me.  There's so much detail in this film, from the Starfleet uniforms to the Enterprise-A, and the cast is excellent. I have to admit that I was very taken by the acting in this movie. I was particularly impressed by the two main actors who played Mr. Spock and Mr. Scott.  I really liked how they did the "The Enemy Within" episode. I especially liked how it had that little extra something.   For the rest of the cast, I was impressed by how they all came across.  It doesn't get much better than this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can understand why a lot of people thought this was a terrible movie. This is a movie that will haunt you as you see it. I remember sitting in a theater waiting for this film to start and I didn't want to leave.   The story of "Titanic" is such a unique and fascinating one.  It took a good 3 1/2 hours to get through this film and even more to get my mind to get over the final image.  After seeing the film I am left with a terrible headache.  There were some very good actors that did a great job. I think Tom Selleck was the only one who did not hit the right notes.  The soundtrack of this film is amazing. The way the film was filmed made the music even more haunting.  This is one movie that is worth watching at least once in your life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie with my friend and we watched it in front of my parents. It was very much like a "kid's movie", the music was catchy, and the animation was pretty good. There was not much story, but it was very funny, but not in the stereotypical way that all the kids movies are, I would say.   This movie was also a bit slow at first, but that changed as the movie progressed. The characters were all cute, and I found myself smiling alot during the movie.  The characters in this movie were very unique, and had very funny voices.  I am glad that we got to watch this with my parents, the movie was quite funny at times, and we had a lot of fun watching it.

It is one of those movies that makes me want to go out to a movie with my friends and enjoy ourselves.   The story line was entertaining, funny, and realistic at the same time.  The actors in this movie were good and the way they portrayed their characters was well done.  Even though this movie is a bit different than I expected, it is a good way to get a laugh from me.

And I've been wanting it ever since,   but only since I bought the Blu-Ray,  when I saw how much it looked and sounded better on DVD,  and it did.  For a movie that I've watched many times, I think this is one of the best ones.  It's got the heart of a great film, and the humor, with some great bits and pieces.  I recommend this film.

I'm a huge fan of that franchise and this film is absolutely wonderful to watch!    The production values are phenomenal! Everything from the effects to the sets to the characters are great. I also really liked the way they did some of the scenes. I don't think I've ever seen any other movie that uses a giant robot to blow up a bridge (a great scene) and still have the bridge and the robot completely intact.   If you're looking for something that's very action packed and has a lot of action, look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. It was good to be back in the '70s!   It was definitely my favorite movie of the movie, along with the later Star Wars movies (which I still love).   You'll see the influence that these two had on each other later in their careers, and this film showed that they were in their own ways just as funny.  Â I still have a hard time imagining a movie that makes me laugh so much.  I also loved how the plot didn't fall into the usual movie traps.  It did not try to tell a good story; it just had some good humor, and you just laughed, as if you were on the set, getting ready for the shoot. Â The acting was good.  The story was very good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this in the theatre in Toronto and it was a great experience.  It was dark and eerie and full of tension.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the classic film The Man Who Fell To Earth, which is still my favorite movie ever. It was my first film to have been in theaters, and to be able to see the film was an incredible experience.   One of my favorite things about the film is that the man who plays the film's hero, an alien who falls from the sky and comes to Earth, is played by one of my heroes, Edward G. Robinson.  Robinson is so good, so real and so vulnerable.  He really sells the role as an alien and it really makes you feel for him.  I love this film, so much! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this movie is a good example of the way you can make a good horror film without being a "horror movie." The concept of this movie was pretty cool--a girl named Amanda has a thing about spiders and goes on a trip to a local house. She finds a small spider in her room and takes pictures. When she returns she tells her boyfriend about the pictures and he freaks out. She then meets the father of the boy who's been picking on her, and the father's sick obsession with the spider makes it very clear that he's going through a pretty dark period in his life. A lot of people have made fun of this plotline, but it's pretty funny, and there is some good acting from all of the cast.   My favorite scene is when the mother is walking through the house taking pictures with the boyfriend, and she hears Amanda walking around the house. The mother rushes toward Amanda, and it's funny how Amanda takes a very calculated step toward her and she gets startled, but Amanda just walks away. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First off, if you are a fan of the X-men comics, you will love this movie.  If you have seen them before, you may think this movie will be boring or even pointless, but don't be fooled.  The movie is a perfect blend of X-Men, horror and suspense.  There are so many ways to enjoy this movie, from the first time you see the opening credits, to the final fight in the final act.   I have seen this movie with multiple people and everyone has enjoyed it.  It is just that good.  I highly recommend this movie and the X factor as a reason to watch it again.

He had to go out into the world and find out what this world was worth to him, and his decisions changed his own life."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think I would ever see another comedy film of this caliber and wow am I pleasantly surprised!   John Goodman and Molly Shannon are both great in this film and make each other laugh and cry.   This is also the first feature film that I saw that has an actual happy ending instead of a sad one and that was a nice touch.  This film is so funny and the writing is brilliant.  Also the director, Robert Zemeckis, deserves a lot of credit for this movie.  He knew what he wanted and he kept the pace and pace was perfect.  I was really impressed with the direction.  And in addition to that, this movie was shot by John Carpenter, who I am a huge fan of and he did an amazing job directing this.  If you want a good laugh then this is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has many good things going for it, but the real reason why I keep coming back is because of this:  It's not your typical action movie, and you will not expect to see such awesome action sequences or cool weapons and gear. The movie is mostly about survival and how to get through and through it is all done very well.  The only bad thing about the movie is the action sequences are all a little bit too much at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like the style of this film, the film is well made and looks and feels very realistic. It's got a dark but gritty feel to it. It looks pretty good for a 90s action movie but the effects are very good, not something you can see from the outside looking in. The special effects and stunts are great.   The acting is great as well.  The effects are great as far as the actors go.  You get to see the actual effect, not just a computer generated one.  I'm not sure if it was a big hit in the U.S. or not but it definitely holds up and looks better then most of today's films.  It's a good film to show the true style of the UAV world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I never thought I would see a movie like this, and never in my wildest dreams would I have expected to enjoy it so much. It was like the whole world was turned on when the trailer came out. I was so happy for such a great project. The actors did an amazing job, and the storyline was simple, yet very well written and thought out.   After viewing the movie I can see that there is a lot of money that went into it, but it was really the people that made this movie. The people behind the movie were talented, and made the movie what it was. I hope they have a lot more films in them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was surprised by the quality of this movie. The acting is quite good, and the plot is very well developed. I was really looking forward to a really well made movie and this was it.   This was probably one of the better science fiction movies I've seen.  I really thought the plot was a little bit off-base at first, but by the time I finished the movie I had to admit that it was a very well done film.  The story was intriguing, and was not very obvious at times.  Although the acting was good, it was hard to hear and understand some of the dialogue.  You don't feel like you are watching a movie, you feel like a part of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is so good in every way, and there is something so genuine and honest about its message, not to mention its story.  And it has a great soundtrack and one of the most beautiful and poetic songs ever written.   I love movies like this, even if they do not always have to have a happy ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A wonderful movie by the great Sergio Leone, it is an old story about a guy who is in a very dangerous situation, and is desperately trying to get to the safety of a nearby town.  He manages to do so in the nick of time with the help of a mysterious woman who lives in a nearby house.  The whole thing is beautifully shot and has some great music.   Leone is an amazing director, and his movies are never about the violence, but about the characters, and the danger they live in.  It is a film for the ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked this movie. It was very entertaining and made me laugh out loud a few times. I think the movie could have been a little longer, but it was good for a quick chuckle. It's not as good as the first two in the trilogy, but the movie was not bad at all. I found the story to be very interesting. I was looking forward to the third installment. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie, from the great people at MGM, was the last great action movie for an MGM film that didn't need to be such. It's not just the action that's cool. The cinematography, set design, and editing is amazing, and this movie really was a masterpiece.    The story was also pretty great.  If you want an action film with the "gritty" feel of 'Black Sunday' then this is the movie for you.   Â  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great movie and fun action! You can not go wrong watching it and I was able to see myself in the roles of the characters. It was a great way to start off my summer with a good flick.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a very, very funny movie with some pretty dark themes and is funny all the way through. It is also a very touching story about life.   What makes it so great is that its such a great story and the acting is spot on.  The whole movie will make you laugh and think and it is such a heartwarming movie.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is into dark humor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My boyfriend and I went out to see this movie on Christmas Eve and it was worth every penny. It is so much better than you think it would be.   It's not a family movie, but it's fun.  This movie is full of heart and humor. There's some great scenes that will make you laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For an adult film in 1976 about a child sex ring, I was disappointed at how the main character acted towards the young victim. He seemed like a little boy who had been used. I found him a bit cold and lacking in humanity. I'm not sure if he was just a young actor who was acting to meet his expectations.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm a huge fan of the original "Star Wars" films and "The Empire Strikes Back." I can't tell you how much I loved seeing Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia (Sanska, of course) back in the fold!   It's been a long time coming, but George Lucas did make a great film out of the entire saga.   Fans of the originals won't have to worry about any of that.  I loved the action, the humor and the music. I'm not a fan of George Lucas' direction at all but that was a movie that made me smile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only bad movie I saw this year was The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, and it was really bad. I've heard good things about John Carter and am excited to see it.   John Carter was made before Spielberg, but has an equal or greater level of imagination and talent.  Â  John Carter is about a man who travels to Mars in an effort to create a utopia on the planet and get rich. He finds himself fighting against a Martian invasion force and a group of hostile aliens.  I've already seen John Carter at the Toronto International Film Festival, and it's worth every penny of the ticket price. I'm glad it was made, but the first half is a bit of a slog. The second half is much better and gives the whole movie a good boost.  My only complaint about the film is the fact that there aren't more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Â I liked this movie. It is a good retelling of the "Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy" plot and it made me laugh at times.   This was made in the 80s and it was fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a movie that I will never forget. I watched this movie a few years ago and never got around to watching it again. I think it's one of the best horror movies of the 90's. The acting, the music, the scares. It is a very scary movie and is easily one of my favorite movies of all time.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am very happy with this movie, because it is funny, well-made, and a real homage to the classic science fiction film "Star Trek".   It doesn't have the same "science fiction" feel of the classic Star Trek, because the characters are the same, but I felt it was a true tribute.   And to think, "Star Wars" is still in the public eye. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film is in black and white, so that gives you an accurate view of what the film really is - an original, quirky and funny story. A really funny and good film about the nature of memory and how we think it works. It is a little too long but is worth the watch.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am amazed by how much fun this movie is.  It is a very fast paced movie.   It has one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen in a movie. I was surprised that they included many different characters in this movie. All of the main characters are very likeable and the actors really get the job done.  The only thing I can say was that the movie could have been better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "For a little while in the 1970's, The X-Files took the world by storm and became the most exciting thing on television. The creators of the show - David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, and Mitch Pileggi - had a clear vision for how the show would go and how the mythology would evolve. They knew exactly what they wanted and how to create a compelling story that could not only draw viewers in, but also continue to entertain and intrigue them." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The main character of this movie is very intriguing, and her struggle to overcome a lot of problems and her growing maturity, and for me, I found that her character was very relatable.   For me, it was one of those rare times when I really believed that a movie was trying to tell a human story.  The movie had some very memorable moments, and had a lot that could be considered a good comedy.  What is most important is that the movie is about a woman who lives her life a little too far away from the rest of society, and even the people closest to her.  That's the true meaning of living in the shadow of the gods. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've just watched "The Shining" as it's first showing and was surprised to discover that it's a very competent horror movie. It has a lot of tension and atmosphere. And I am not sure whether or not it's as good as it might sound on paper, because of the way it is filmed.   Also it has some nice bits, especially when they show the hotel in a different way and the scenes with the "shining" room. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie a few years ago. The trailer made me look at it a little different than what it was then, I thought it would be a really good movie with a good plot and lots of funny moments. It didn't quite live up to what I thought would be. I can't say for certain why it never really became what I was hoping it would. I liked the movie and was able to enjoy it but never really found the humor to take me over. It was a bit slow and the plot was a little confusing. I think it would have worked better in the mid 90's, it wasn't a very good movie but it was a good film, I'll definitely re-watch it one day.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was a great piece of art and it had so much personality that was captivating. I loved it!   The voice acting was perfect, all the characters were so real and there is a great little flashback scene when you first see the two men.   It's a shame that the story was never allowed to make it to the big screen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best of the lot.   It is the last and only part of the trilogy and the only one that can be enjoyed as a complete film.  This film is so good you might think it was made just to wrap up the series.  There is no story but it works as a piece of cinema.  You get the sense that it is being directed by the two leads, but it was so much more than that.  The music is brilliant, the cinematography is wonderful, the acting is top notch, and the story is very well told.  It has no plot, but that is not the point.  I love the ending of the film, and it is perfect.  Also, it is one of those films that has been told to you over and over again, and you never get tired of watching it.  And you should. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a kid, I had a hard time figuring out what to think of Star Wars.  The original trilogy was so fantastic, but my friends always wanted to know "What's the real Star Wars, the sequels or the prequels?  For me it was always the prequel trilogy.  Then, on the set of Return of the Jedi I met George Lucas.  He was very polite and kind, and he showed me several pictures of the old prequel set.  After that I started to see what he was doing right and that what they had done was much better than what came out.  When I saw The Phantom Menace I became a huge fan.  I really enjoyed the stories they told and the acting.  As for the story and the films, I thought they were great.   I'm glad I saw them when I did.  And I loved the movie, and I know that some of you out there do too.  It's a great movie, not just because it is an action picture, but because of the stories the actors tell and the great acting.Â    When the pre-quels came out I knew that these would never have been made. Â   The bad actors were all there, and the writers couldn't think of a way to make the preQuels worth watching.  George had no interest in making a prequel, and all of the other actors and directors had similar ideas about what to do.  One day I saw the trailer for Empire Strikes Back in the theater, and my heart sank.  At the end of that movie I was thinking to myself "What was all the fuss about?".  It looked like a parody of the pre quels. Â  George was obviously embarrassed that they did not succeed. Â  When he told me about it he admitted that he was sorry that they were not better. Â  He was also sorry that the first film had not been a success, and that this one should. Â  This was the first time I had ever seen George's reaction to an audience's reaction.  There was a lot of hurt and embarrassment on his part.  We were all going through similar things, and at this time he was in a bad way, and there was nothing he could do about it. Â  I think if he had been in a better mood he could have made these great films.Â  I do not know if the story was wrong, but the actors certainly looked foolish

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have a hard time recommending this movie, and I didn't see it until I went to a local theater last night and the projectionist said it was his last one. It was a really nice movie, with a nice script and good acting.   It's not so much that it's "a bad movie", but it's not "a great movie".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this film to be a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed it a lot. I was very surprised at the amount of nudity involved, and I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I liked it a lot. " -Tobie, from the UK I really like the movie. I don't really know the author's name, but he wrote the book, The Adventures of Don Quixote which has a nice story line and nice art and animation. This movie is a little different than that book, but it has a very good story. It is very fast paced and very exciting, and is a good good laugh. The music is also pretty good and the character of Quixada is great. The movie really captures the spirit of the book very well.   The voice acting was great in this one, especially in the movie where a whole new cast is made up. I especially liked the voice of Tilda Swinton as the "Sophisticated Lady" and I think she did a wonderful job.  This is a must see for everyone, and for those of you who are looking for a good action movie to watch, this is it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this film at a local theater a few months back and I didn't remember it at all, but my wife and I decided to go on a second viewing and sure enough, this was a very good movie.  This film was a little bit different from what we have seen so far on the "R" rating list.   It seems to be made of more of a documentary-style style rather than a "fantasy" movie. I guess that is what is so enjoyable about this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It wasn't a total disappointment. It was a nice little comedy about a girl who is the heir to a large fortune. The acting was quite good and she had a good time. I liked the story and it had some interesting plot twists that I enjoyed. There's nothing wrong with it. It does not compare to the movies I've seen but if you are looking for something to do on a summer afternoon, watch this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a genre filled with a lot of trash, this is an extremely refreshing film.  I saw this at a local theater, and it was a great show.  While the film is not very good, it still has a very good cast, and they make you care about these guys.  The acting is very natural, and the film itself has a nice feeling to it.  With this film, I saw several friends, and we all enjoyed it. Â  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a good old "movie about a car" movie, I've seen it about a hundred times but this one is definitely worth a watch.   From the first shot the movie sets up a "horror" feeling as the actors begin their scene and it's very convincing as the car starts moving and it has a very slow pace and just as it starts to creep out the camera zooms in and in the first scene there are some very unsettling effects on the audience.  The acting in the movie is very good with most of the characters portrayed very well.  In addition to the two leads there are also some good supporting actors in this movie.  My favorite scene for me was in the garage when the cop and the girl get into the car.  It makes me want to run out and buy this movie and watch it again.  "The Evil Dead" was one of my all time favorites back in the 70's and this movie has an excellent blend of horror and action.

There was a young John Wayne in it, and he was awesome.   It was a dark movie, and the people at Paramount didn't know what they were doing. They kept changing it back and forth, making a mess of things. I wish they would have used a real movie camera so they wouldn't have had to redo so many takes!  I loved it, I had a lot of fun watching it, it really gets you!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The picture is beautiful and the story is well told. The performances are fine as well.

This movie really captures the atmosphere of the era that it is from and the feeling of this young man going from one adventure to the next.  The best parts of this movie are the parts where you get to see the "man of the people".   I liked this movie and I think it captures that feeling that was so prevalent in the sixties and seventies.  It is a very good movie and one that I wish we would see more of. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only reason I am not a huge fan of this movie is that I don't like being ripped off. The film is great and the cast is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a fun film. I saw it as a kid on TV and remember it being a cute, little flick. I still love this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The one good thing about this movie is the amazing music and the way it brings the movie to life.   I wish I could've watched this movie when I was younger.  It's not a "true-life" story, but there are so many good and interesting things in this movie that will stay with you long after you've seen it.  The best thing about it is the way the actor, Billy Dee Williams, portrayed the role of "Ray".    A film that will go down in history for a lot of reasons, but the main reason will be Billy Dee playing Ray Gricar. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie on the big screen, about 25 years ago, and was surprised how good it actually looked. The acting is top notch (except for the guy who does the voice for the robot). And the whole thing is set in a future where they have created robots to look like human beings.   There were no special effects at all, just a lot of cool looking futuristic stuff. I loved that they took their time with this one.  I loved it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited for this movie. I wasn't sure if it was going to be a great flick or not. The movie itself was so good I don't even want to talk about it. I've never seen this movie before. I have seen the original but not this one. This movie takes the original and makes it even better. They used the original to make this movie and it is still great. It is like watching the old Batman and Robin movie. The actors are great as well. It's the same actors in this movie but the way they do it and the way the characters are portrayed. I really can't wait to see the sequel. If you haven't seen this one then go out and buy it and watch it.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my humble opinion, this is an amazing film. I will be re-watching it after a few weeks of sleep. It is an incredibly well made film. The acting is top notch. I think that the director really knows how to create a good film, not to mention the amazing soundtrack. The story, the acting and the soundtrack, it is really the reason I enjoyed the film so much. The ending left a few things open to interpretation. I did not really think too much of it until the very end. The film is very dark, very gritty. It has a lot of symbolism and thought that the audience should pay attention to.

For me it's a very interesting time period, and it's still interesting to see the world we live in now. However this movie is so much worse than the book. If you haven't read the book, don't watch this. It makes almost no sense and is full of errors, and has been edited so much it has lost all of the original story. I would have given it 5 stars, but I just couldn't enjoy it. - June 27, 2005What a mess  Review was updated on 7/27/06 - The movie "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" was released on the 15th, but the book was not published until 1816, but it is still in print today. I have never seen the movie, but a friend who had seen it recently told me that it had no redeeming qualities. I guess they tried to make it too expensive to make (which is bad, since it could be a great movie for a small audience), but then had a production company go out and make a terrible film. I can see it being a movie that would be interesting for an academic film or even a movie history project, but for a general movie audience it is worthless. - August 27, 2004What a disaster
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this a few years ago on the big screen at the Orpheum Theatre. At that time it was played at night and it had a great cast and good production values. Now it is the "classic" of horror movies. I saw it with my daughter and it was like a dream come true.  This movie was fantastic and a must see for anyone who has a love of horror.   This film is great in every aspect. This is the only one of its kind that I know of that is a complete picture of the original novel. I would love to see this film re-made and released to the general public. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A fun and entertaining film. I never expected a "romance" scene to be so well choreographed and well acted.    I enjoyed this film and found it to be fun and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only negative thing that I can say is that the first couple of hours were a little too fast and loose with the story line and plot, and while the plot was there, it seemed to take away from the whole film, especially when you take into consideration that the film is set in a modern day setting. After all the time that the two main characters spend in the early 1900s, I would have liked to see more of the backstory.    Overall, I really enjoyed watching this film. This was my first ever view of James Mason, and it was really neat to see a film set in the 1800s that wasn't really too modern in the story. This film is a little different from anything that I've seen, which is awesome, and I can't wait to see what other directors come up with.

The dog is still alive and the boy does some good, he is still a child but a young child.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie.   The story of two lovers in love was so cute, and the performances of the lead actors were so good.  It didn't take long for me to see that this film was a remake of an older film by the same name.  The characters were much more mature and realistic, and it made me feel that I was watching a real love story, not just a love story from another century.  I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves love stories, or even just loves movies in general. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is very close to my heart. My mom is from the west and I used to love to watch her movies in the 70's. When I heard about this movie I was so excited. It was one of my favorite movies and it is still my favorite movie. I think the movie really got me when I was a young teen. The movie is like the first time I watched Star Wars. I got hooked on the movie.    I also like the movie because it is not very complicated. This movie shows the life of the main character.  The movie also has a nice ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've been a huge fan of the original movie and it's a shame that it hasn't been made into a live action TV series. The original story was awesome with the two characters as the leads, but the actors have been replaced by the likes of John Cleese, Michael Palin, Peter Cook, and Simon Pegg. That is what the director wants, a little more "humour" in the production and it works, but it is a different take on the story.    It's a bit dated, the film was released in the 70's, the era when people still watched their movies on VHS, so the acting isn't the best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little movie about love and loss, but a very real story about the struggles of people in their lives. The movie has some pretty strong acting and production quality. A good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first few minutes of this movie are all about a man trying to prove a point to a man named Mr. Smith (Baron Vaughn).  The man named Smith, is obviously jealous of the fact that his friend (Peter Sellers) keeps getting more women than him, so he has decided to try to do something about it. He wants to take the woman from Mr. Sellers one day, and he's not afraid of doing something to get it.  What he does next is pretty ingenious, although a bit silly. Mr. Vaughn decides to go to the police to see if he can get in trouble for stealing the woman, because he's a "big guy".  This is a comedy film with a bit of a slapstick touch, but it still has enough substance to make it worth watching.  The ending was pretty good. It was fun to watch this man chase around some other guy, and then have Mr. Jones (Bud Gaughan) take him on, and even pull him off a cliff.  It is a fun film, and I give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is absolutely perfect. I don't care what you think about a certain actor/actress or director, the performance and the directing is spot on.   There are some great little touches in the movie too, like the car crash scene is actually shot from an angle that makes it seem like the driver has no control and doesn't see that he's going over the cliff.  It's a wonderful movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I went to see this movie on a whim. It was a cheap movie from the seventies but I have seen a bunch of those and they have always been a little low-budget. The cast was great. I am a big fan of John Carradine. He had a nice way about him and was not over the top. He is not one of those actors who are supposed to act like an old man. His acting was the perfect match to the story.  The movie was fun, easy to watch and had some great acting and acting talent. I have never seen this movie but it was very funny and entertaining.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just had the pleasure of seeing this movie at the cinema in London.  It has some of the most memorable characters, and some of one of the best performances ever.   There's not a lot of time to explain the whole story, and you need to be really into the story in order to be able to understand the way the characters are brought together in order for this to work.  What makes the movie truly awesome is that you know what is happening, you're just never quite sure if it's going to go any one way, but it always keeps you guessing.  I love the use of the color blue to represent a time of change in the characters' lives.  Â  I've never seen a movie that made me believe there is something wrong with this world, I never had an inkling that this film was going to be such a dark, dark masterpiece.  Thanks toÂ  John Turturro Â for the magnificent work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm amazed at how many talented actors there are on this production, especially the younger ones. It was nice to see an older and more seasoned actor, John Patrick Shanley, in this film.   The writing was clever and was always well thought out and I'm grateful for a film like this.  The acting was superb.  It was a shame that John Patrick didn't make more, and perhaps one day we'll get a remake of this movie.  My favorite parts of this film were the scenes with George and Joanna.  I'd definitely see it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The director and his team of actors did an excellent job in portraying the dark and evil side of the war.   "The Man Who Knew Too Much" is a great war movie in every sense of the word.  While it is not a classic, it is an entertaining movie that gets you to the heart of the matter.  A film that will make you angry at the war, yet at the same time, make you respect it.  It's a great movie, I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    An incredible movie from start to finish.   This movie is the epitome of a true noir.  With its dark moods, intense plot twists and captivating characters, it is without a doubt one of the best noirs of all time.  As a matter of fact, I love this movie and I don't know why I haven't watched it yet.  One of the main reasons is the fact that I find it so hard to find good movies of this type of genre anymore.  I just can't find any good examples in the theatres anymore, so I've just had to wait for my chance.  You have to know that I never knew what the hell was going on when I saw the movie.  From the opening scenes, to the ending scene, I was glued to the screen, wanting more.  Not once did I feel that the actors were going too easy on us, but they really pulled it off.  It has always been my favourite genre of movies, so seeing it brought back all of the good memories from my childhood.  So don't wait anymore!   You must watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not a bad movie, it's just a poorly acted and directed one.  It is a decent enough movie, but it's a pity that it could not get the money or attention it deserves, because there is a lot more going on in the movie than in most of the other movies made by the same studio that makes this kind of movie.   There is a scene in the beginning of the movie that is a great example of poor acting.  The character is being asked questions by the police detective, and he does not understand what is happening, and it is very distracting.  A lot of the dialogue is terrible.  Afterwards, he runs away from the police, and there are three cops chasing him, and they don't even stop to ask what he did.  While it is not a complete disaster, it just isn't good, and if you don't understand the meaning behind the scene, you are lost for the rest of the film.  When the cops finally catch up with him, he starts to explain the details, but they just are not understood, and this is a problem all through the movie. It was disappointing, but not completely a disappointment.  Some scenes were okay.  But when it is good, the movie is wonderful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Very happy with this movie!  I was born in the year of the tiger, and it's been a while since I've been impressed by a movie, but this one was great.  It was very well made, but the writing was a little strange at times, but that was probably because the movie was so well done.  The film was great, and I really enjoyed watching it.   I would definitely recommend it, it was worth the watch.  I do wish they had gone with the full title, "The Tiger".  In the mid 1940's, a young boy and his father are trapped in a house in the mountains.  They can't escape, but somehow manage to escape through the window.  When they reach the city, the boy finds the father dead.  He doesn't know who killed him, and can't imagine who else could do it. The boy wants to take revenge on his killers, but can't figure out how.  One day, he is approached by a woman who tells him she knows who the killer is. The woman seems to be related to the boy. She offers him a small sum of money if he'll kill her brother.  She has told him that she has had an affair with the father, and that she knows his whereabouts. The girl's brother appears on the scene and demands a price of 200,000 dollars. The kid refuses and threatens the brother, who threatens to kill him. The little boy tries to get his money back from the brother. The brother takes the kid's wallet and sets off. The only problem is that the city is now surrounded by mountains, and his car is lost on the way back. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never watched the old MGM movies but I saw this movie when I was in middle school and I fell in love with it. It was a lot of fun to watch it. The way the film was filmed, the songs and the story were a perfect combination for what the movie was trying to be.   The first time I saw it, I felt the movie had to be in the top 3 of MGM movies ever. The plot was very well put together and the actors did a great job with what they had to do. I also loved the way the filmmakers made the film seem real and there were no CGI effects.  There are no sound effects but it is a very dark movie. I have seen lots of people who have seen the old version and think they are all in it but I honestly think the new version has the best plot.  The new version is better for the characters but it's a little boring in some scenes and the songs are all pretty lame.  I have watched the original movie over and over and when this new version came out, I just saw this version of it as a reference to the old one.  But you never know which one is better until you see the whole thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found myself enjoying this movie a lot.  I really enjoyed seeing the different side of the characters.  A lot of times the movie is all about the guys that are not on the field.  There are a lot of scenes that are just great, and it shows that when you have the right teammates and have the confidence in your abilities that you can win a game. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like many people, I have heard about this movie many times but never seen it.  The reason that I heard about it so often is because the movie was about "a man's best friend".   It stars John Wayne as "Buck" and his best friend, "Buster".  It also features the famous "O.J." Simpson and a famous "Knick Knack" game played on a golf course.   The movie was originally produced in 1931 but wasn't released until 1973.  It was made for $3.9 million dollars.  In the movie, Buck and Buster played a game called "Knock-out".  In this game, "Knocks" are thrown into a bucket (the "Knack") and each person has a ball to throw.  They must knock off the other guy's ball before they throw their own.  Buck's ball was thrown by an assassin and was caught by Buster. Â  The plot is that a woman is going to marry a rich man and her husband is going after her.  As the movie goes along, it becomes clear that she is going around with some other guys.  Soon, Buster becomes jealous of this because he really likes Buck and can't get the picture of Buck that she wants. Â  In the end, they fight and Buster's ball is thrown into an iron bar and hits Buster on the head. Â  Now, "Ojos Cafeteros" is one of my favorite movies, and I loved to see how Buster would react to the death of his best buddy.  Now, the other thing that I liked about this film is that it was made in Hollywood.  Â  Even though "OJ" was already famous, it was still a big deal to see someone who looked so good in a movie and really looked like the famous O.J. Simpson.  Even though he was a little thin, he still looked good.  What I liked most about this picture was that this was Buck's first major movie role.  There were some scenes where it was not clear if he was really acting, but he never did anything wrong.  With Buck and "Knis" around, they had a lot of fun at the club.  When it comes to the actual movie, it is a wonderful piece of film.  I think that it is important that people see this movie and think about what it is all about.  You really need to

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this was going to be one of those "go watch the movie then read the book" type of movies that people watch before watching the book.   The story was interesting enough and gave you a little bit of insight into a few characters in the movie.  While the movie wasn't as bad as I thought it was going be, it was still pretty average.  There was nothing groundbreaking about the plot.  If you liked the book, you are better off watching the movie and the book than watching the whole thing.  I had a fun time reading the book and it was fun to watch.  It did give me some good insight into the world of the movie as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think that if you're looking for a horror movie that's not a slasher film, and you like films like The Shining and Psycho then this is the movie for you. The acting is good, and the director tries to make the characters more like human beings rather than monsters. The violence is in there, but it's not the most graphic, and there's never a gore-fest. It's still scary, but I think the best part of the movie is the characters.   It takes place in the 1980's, and has all the style and flare of that time. There are some really great scenes, and it's got all the mood of a low budget horror film.  I've never heard of this movie, but if you love the old movies and you want a truly scary film then this one's for you!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had never seen this movie before and was shocked at how good it was. I am glad I saw it!   Lets start at the beginning and we meet our protagonist, a young boy, who is searching for his father's missing ship. It looks as if the boat may have washed up on the shore of the Island. Our boy then goes to visit his Father, who he does not get on with, but his Father is a good man and has some sort of connection to the Island or maybe it is just him wanting to see his son. While there we see the story of a couple of sailors who were stranded on the Island by a storm. The story begins when one of the sailors, a boy named Charlie, gets separated from his ship. When he hears the cries of a woman who he believes to be his wife, he goes looking for her. After searching the Island, he eventually finds his lost wife in the ruins of a ship and makes his way back to her. This is what brings the story to an end, and it is very sad. Charlie had to walk for days with his dog because his dog had lost it's memory and was losing its mind. Charlie was so worried about his wife that he left behind his dog in the hopes that the dog could find her. The ending of the movie is very moving. When Charlie finds his wife he is happy. He hugs her and says a teary goodbye, and goes back to his ship and prepares for another day of searching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Sawdust, dust, dust!"   The title of this movie may be somewhat deceptive, because it doesn't really take place in one location, but a lot of it takes place in the same place: a very small town in a desert. It's a very unique story, and a very entertaining one.  The lead character, John F. Williams (played by the terrific Christopher Walken) is a simple, hard-working farmer who is caught in a terrible situation. He was the sole witness to a murder, and he's never been able to forget it.  It's very important to note that he is not a cop, and so he is reluctant to follow the case.  There is an element of mystery here, and that mystery is the central theme of the movie. In fact, the mystery is so intriguing that, even though the mystery seems to be leading nowhere, Williams, as a simple man, continues to go looking for the killer.  His wife (Kim Novak) is not interested, though, and even though he doesn't know it yet, she is in love with a detective named Paul (played here by Richard Kiel) who is trying to solve the mystery.   F.W. Murnau is the director of this film, and it's not his best film.  This is a good example of his ability to show off the beauty of a desert scene, as well as show a little bit about the everyday life of a very poor family.  And, it's one of the rare films of the silent era in which the director uses a music score.  What's more, his use of music is not only very well done, but also provides a wonderful feeling of mystery as he sets a scene, then plays the score in the background. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The music is absolutely perfect. It is hard to believe they are doing the first stage production of a long-running play. I had the wonderful opportunity of attending the production in person in late 2009 (about six months before it opened in London).   It was a truly unforgettable experience.   I was in London with my boyfriend when we spotted a flyer for this show. We were amazed to hear how the production was going to look, and were very much in anticipation of seeing it in action. The show opened on a Sunday afternoon, but that didn't stop us from walking to Covent Garden, where we were seated on the floor in a corner. It was absolutely magical to see everything come to life on stage. It really was like being there in the 18th century, seeing a play set in 17th century London. The costumes were stunning and I was thrilled to see them in the flesh. The actors did an incredible job of bringing these medieval settings to life.  The play is written by Charles Dickens and features a cast of over 100 actors.  We loved every minute of the show.  There were a few moments of tension, but overall, it was a wonderful and memorable experience. A must-see for any Londoner!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I remember watching this on my first day of high school. I thought the film was a bit cheesy when I first saw it and didn't get the humor of the film. But I still thought it was a pretty good film. I think a few things could have been improved. One is that the camera work is a bit choppy at times. I felt the camera should have had more action during the scenes with the "wankers" and I think this would have made the film more entertaining. Another thing that I felt could have used a bit more editing was the music. It's a little long in places and feels a bit forced at times that it should have been cut down. Overall, I think it's a pretty funny film with a few goofy moments and very little to no plot.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am really liking this film.   It has a lot of humor and it's just plain awesome.  I will definitely be watching this again.  It does look and sound great and I love the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I went to a little theater in the old town of St. Cloud, Minnesota. It's still a fairly small theater. There was about 40 people there, maybe 20 sitting around. This was a great show!   There were two great actors, and an amazing script.   This movie was really fun and well put together.  The only bad thing was the lighting. The movie would be better if they were bright enough.  It's a movie about the war that we didn't get in the movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the summer of 1999, an unknown movie from an unknown director with a cast of unknowns took the nation by storm. This movie was an instant hit and has a cult following. The movie focuses on two teenage friends who are going to high school together and one day they start talking about the two main things that they're interested in: boys and drugs. It's not a hard film to pick up and it's easy to understand. This is a great movie that does a great job of not only depicting a teenage boy's mindset but also portrays how it impacts him as a person. I would not recommend watching this film in a dark room. I recommend this film for any teenager and for anyone that is interested in a great teenage movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is very realistic and gives you a really good look into what it was like when I was younger and still living in the world of my friends, and the fact that it was made with the best intentions that it has.   If you really want a good comedy/drama and not some action movie with lots of shooting then this movie is definitely for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best film I have seen in the last 2 years.   I have been a big fan of the James Bond series for a while but after I saw Die Another Day I had to see the rest of the Bond movies.  And this film was better than the previous ones, more mature, and very well directed.  The story was intriguing and had you feeling like the villain was actually trying to get away with what he did.  James Bond was not his typical cocky hero anymore, he was more subdued, more sensitive and a little unsure. I enjoyed the villain's character and had a lot of fun watching him get away, but when he got caught he was played very well.  I loved the Bond girl and really wanted to know what was going on. I loved Bond's chemistry with the female.  Bond is the most interesting Bond since Sean Connery.  This film is worth every penny!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie very much. As a result, I have enjoyed watching the same movie so many times that I almost didn't care what happened. The movie is really good.   The action is a nice change of pace from many of the other movies I've seen. The character interaction was terrific. The story was enjoyable. It is good to see a couple of "frenemies" get back together.  It also features a couple more of the "couple of girls" that appeared in "Dirty Dancing".   For all those of you who enjoy action movies like I do, you should check this out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this to watch as a movie, not a documentary. I thought it would be a very interesting study into the effects of this vaccine, but it turned out to be a nice little film. It shows that this is a very real thing, and not just a scare tactic. I also found it quite touching. I would recommend it to parents who are afraid of vaccinating their children, but want to know more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie from the 1950's about a group of soldiers who travel with their unit to France to fight in World War 2. The film is a classic period piece that is told from two points of view. The action sequences are very well done and the actors do a great job.   I loved this movie and I hope one day they make a film about the famous "War Games" that took place during WW2.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie while in college for a movie night at a local college campus. I was really impressed with this film. It is an interesting film to see a different take on the 'cursed' film.   The only things I would change would be maybe the music and maybe the costumes for the ladies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't have a TV with a Dolby sound system, so I listened to this in an audiophile listening room at home. I heard very clear and detailed dialogue, which meant that the film didn't have to over-saturate my ears with the effects, which, to my ears, are very realistic.   When I read the plot, I was totally convinced that I was seeing something real and not a film made up by the producers.  I'm going to re-watch this movie when I have the money to do so, but I will do so on a good sound system! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only film that i would suggest people watch is "The Man from Earth" - it is really good and funny and has really deep and powerful messages and themes. I do not think there will ever be a more realistic and realistic depiction of the human condition.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie in the theaters at the old Elgin Theater. It was in a bad black-and-white color, so the theater went out of business, but I was able to see it on VHS (there's a copy of it online), so I didn't miss a minute of it. It is about a man who travels to Las Vegas to meet his former girlfriend, but she dies and he's left alone to figure out what happened to her.  There is a lot of action in it, and lots of great fights and explosions. The movie was really hard to watch at times, but it's a great film and worth seeing.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really didn't expect to have this much fun watching a horror film. If you liked the original Halloween, then you'll LOVE this remake, and if you liked Halloween 2, then this is a must watch.    The film is very well acted by an excellent cast, and very well written.  In addition to the actors, there is also a great group of young actors who were young when Halloween first came out.  They were all really great, and we had a great time seeing them do their thing.  We really couldn't stop laughing during some of the scares.  The scares were real and scary, even with the kids playing on screen.  And the scares are pretty much always pretty much exactly the same.  There were several scenes where some kind of monster was running around a house, and a kid would get caught in the web of the monster. We really had to laugh at how ridiculous it looked. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was excellent and fun. I would recommend it to all children, young or old.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first time I heard of the originalÂ Pumpkinhead, I was impressed. Nowadays, however, I find it is more or less a parody of horror movies of the 60's and 70's, which it probably was at the time. The story is, however... well, you've got your monster, the woman in a pumpkin mask (played by Linda Blair), and some guys chasing her through the woods (including David Hines and Don Delillo). But it isn't really a horror movie, more an exploitation movie. It tries to appeal to young men by having a sexy woman, but it ends up in a parody.   As I said in the beginning, this movie is a parody or rip-off of other movies. You can tell it was a big hit back then because the actors were still trying to make their film look as real as possible.  It has been praised a lot for being a parody and for not being a real horror film, which I am not sure it is true.  But, it is a fun movie, one that I wish I had seen before I had turned 21.
