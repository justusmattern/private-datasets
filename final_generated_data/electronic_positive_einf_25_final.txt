Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my iPod Nano.   It's very easy to use and the music is great.  It also has all the songs I've bought on CD in a neat package and you can listen to them as you use it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very happy with this product. I love the ease of use and versatility.   If the batteries die they are replaceable. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the first time I bought a laptop and I am very happy I bought this.   I have a PC and have tried to connect to various networks and they don't work.  I was thinking that it would be very expensive to upgrade. But I got this laptop and it works perfectly.  If you want to get a computer, this is the best.  I just upgraded from a Lenovo X250 and the differences are clear.  The performance on this system is more stable and it is much quieter.  But the biggest difference is the size. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like this game. The graphics are excellent, and the action is fun. I like that there is something to do on the other side of the board, and that there are multiple ways to get points.  I really like a good game with a good story.   The story is well done. The choices are interesting. There's also a card that allows you to change one of the characters you own, and some cards allow you to do a lot of different things. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have bought this on several occasions, and this time I was very pleased with it. The audio was clear enough that I could understand the spoken words, and the audio quality was decent.   The buttons on the remote are very responsive and provide the same control functions as in the past.    This device is easy to install and does the job.  It is worth it to buy the newer version, because I like to have a device that works on both my old and new computers. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new iPad is very sleek. It is lighter than the old iPad and has a thinner screen than the other new iPads, which is great. The apps are pretty good, too, and I like the screen rotation option. It does have one big downside, though: the battery life is very mediocre.   A note about batteries:  The battery life on the new iPad will be significantly worse than the older iPad because of the change in the battery design.  I tried it on a couple of days, and in my testing it lasted about 7-9 hours of "normal use" (with music, emails, etc.). But there is no battery saver mode. It'll die quickly if you turn off the TV and set your iPod/iPhone to auto play music.  There are also two apps I really like: iBooks and the Movie App.  If you use iBooks, you should download the new Movie App to use the iPod touch. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like this. It's very easy to use and it works very well.   For the money, this is a great device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The battery life on my Samsung Galaxy S8+ has been fantastic. It seems to last a whole day of normal use (like watching Netflix and listening to music), or more, if I use the wireless charging feature.   I really appreciate that I can charge my device in the middle of the night, which I would never do if it was a regular phone.  My next phone will be a samsung galaxy S8 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit is very easy to setup. The unit works great with my new DVD player (CD player works fine as well).  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's really well made.  The display was super crisp and clear on all the different levels I've tested it on.  It doesn't overheat at all.  I was surprised that it was very quiet while on battery, it only got pretty noisy when I tried to play music.  For the price, it's a great buy. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for a party and it worked great. The batteries last a long time, and when you don't have AC it's really convenient. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This unit is great. It comes with two cables and is very easy to use and setup. My main concern is that I have no way of controlling this unit (or anyone else) without having to find and hook up a monitor/speaker/keyboard to the computer. I could also use the other unit and have the same set up, but I would rather have a monitor.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a brand new Sony Bravia DL-V850, and I love it. It has a high quality sound, is very slim and lightweight, and doesn't require batteries.   It plays DVDs and CDs very well.  My only complaint is that some of the pictures are black and I wish the screen had more contrast.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The quality of this device was great. The quality is very good. The case is great quality. I love the remote control function. The only thing that's a bit annoying is that you have to connect the cable with your computer. If you have a Mac, you have it in no time. I have not tried it on a PC yet but I really liked the convenience of having it connected to the computer. It has some pretty cool features too, the light feature, the screen mirroring, the timer, and the microphone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had bought this as a replacement for my wireless router. This is a very nice product. I was a bit worried that the instructions were a bit confusing, but I had no trouble at all.   A lot of people have asked me to review this because of my connection to Comcast.  This is not Comcast, and I haven't been able to get Comcast to refund me the money I spent. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the only CD player that plays all the great music I'm used to, it is a very nice and simple device.   The fact that I am able to store my music in the memory on the CD player makes this CD player a winner. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this to upgrade my older TAC recorders. It has a huge amount of control. I am an audio engineer and was really looking forward to getting this. It really makes the process of getting a CD mastered so much easier. I also like the fact that this has a built-in USB port. That means no external drive needed.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am new to the Apple product line and this is my second one. The old one was defective and my screen was bent, but not this one.   The first thing I did was remove the old one and put in this one and it worked great for the first day. I'm very happy with the new one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Overall I have used these headphones on a trip to Greece and they worked great.   I use these for concerts and have listened to both classical and rock and metal music through them and I have had no issues with the sound.  My only complaint was the price, but I will be buying more. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great little thing. The sound is just enough for a decent speaker but the quality of the signal makes it great. I'm sure there are other great devices out there but for $50 that is a good deal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Yamaha S950C because I'm going to start using an Apple AirPort Extreme (Pro) for home use. I wanted a wireless solution that was inexpensive and would work well. I am extremely pleased with the AirPort. The AirPort is easy to setup and has a very strong wireless signal. I bought a second AirPort because I purchased two units and I can't wait to use them both.   - Steve  Questions, Answers and Comments  Discuss about Matrix AirPort Wireless Adapter with Adapter for iPad (Item # 9095) with your friends and fellow Evike.com shoppers!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am so impressed with the sound quality. The sound quality is better than my old Sony Walkman and better than the cheap Chinese units.   The only thing is that the sound of my Walkman gets much worse if I don't have headphones or some kind of listening device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like the ease of use and the sound quality.  I also find it very convenient to have on hand, because it only takes a couple of taps to turn it on.   The only thing I would change is that it would be nice if it had a memory option, because I'd rather keep the volume of my music at a reasonable level all the time. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great piece of gear, not only for me, but for my son.   I use my phone for work, but the phone is small, and the iPad is great for taking pictures of stuff in the house.  It comes with plenty of space, and a camera case that will keep it safe.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the perfect computer for someone looking for a "no frills" device. Very good quality with no bloatware, which is a huge plus.   The only thing I don't like is that it is hard to see the keyboard when it is sitting on its case.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This computer is a very good example of how to build an excellent quality electronic device for the price.   After reading several negative reviews I decided that it was worth it because you do not have to buy any special parts.  I got the cheapest computer I could find and used the case for my   old Dell PC and it worked very well. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The product worked well. It does not get very warm, which is a huge problem with other small dimmers. The control is pretty snappy, and the dimming speed is just right for me.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Gail from A great little product! The dimmer worked perfectly in my older home theater setup and makes a nice and efficient addition to the dimmer system. The dimming was easy to set, the light bulb on the dimmers came on at full brightness, and they fit perfectly in the cabinet. /  /

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this about two weeks ago and the first thing I did was remove all the battery's and put it on.   The thing is solid!  The first time I used the unit I got a good signal from my radio.  After a few months of using it and adjusting the radio a bit, I have a great radio now!   A friend and I tried to put a big rig on it and it would not go on the line, but with a little fiddling with it, it did!  I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to spend a ton of money for a computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using the Panasonic DMC-G7 for several years and really like it. The only thing I can do is make it smaller in order to fit my iPad mini but this is not an issue for me since I only use my iPad for surfing the net and playing casual games.   It's quiet enough that I can use it in my bedroom when I have it set up properly and it has the best sound quality I've ever heard from an electronic device. I would recommend this product to all my friends.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is very good, I have been using this sound card for many years, and it does exactly what I expect it to do.   It doesn't overload my card but still has enough power to play the games I bought it for.  A couple of things I'd like to see more of:  - The keyboard should have a number pad, there is a big key that is just used for everything and no other function.  This was really annoying as I had to change to the numeric keypad when I was doing word processing.  - I wish it had a built in modem, but the built in card doesn't seem to have one, and that is the biggest disappointment. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The power supply is very strong and durable.  The buttons are very responsive, and they're very easy to operate.   This product is exactly as described, and I wish more companies were like this.  I ordered 2 units from Banggood, and now I've got 3 in my possession!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Toshiba DT-955T, which I got to work with Windows 7 after upgrading to it from XP. This computer is very easy to set up and is very fast and reliable. The hard drive works just fine and the built in hard drives are good quality. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was a great addition to my rig. It's extremely compact and very easy to set up, and it works as expected.   I used to run an old IBM 5100 PC at home, and my wife wanted to buy a laptop for work but I refused as the old PC was still working fine and the performance was great.  Now I have a desktop with a small notebook and I like how easy it is to manage everything and where everything is located.  Also it makes me want to upgrade my main PC as it's pretty cool. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first laptop with the new Intel Bay Trail chips so I was a little nervous going into it but I'm very pleased so far. The battery lasts an entire day of heavy use. The speed of the laptop is just right. I really like the keyboard with its nice travel distance. I had an older touch pad but the keyboard has better feedback.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to replace my broken computer so I could keep up with emails, and it's worked perfectly.   The only down side is that there is no hard drive, so you will have to use a computer program to back up files. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The X1 is a nice addition to a nice keyboard.   A great upgrade over my old Kinesis Keyboard and the only thing that I will miss is having to use the included pen.  This would be better with more keycaps and less keys.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My laptop is fantastic for general computing in my home office, but it suffers from being a bit finicky to use with Windows, even with a power-save setting.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality is great, the touch screen works well and the sound is great.

I've bought this 3 times now, and this time, I'm making the purchase again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It worked great for the last few years.  My computer (MacBook Pro) had a faulty track pad and needed to be replaced.  The original was just a cheap plastic one.  When the replacement arrived (the track pad was working) I couldn't believe it.  It's the smoothest, slickest mouse I have ever used.  I can't even remember how many hours I've spent on my computer just using this mouse.  This is the way it should have been from the beginning.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod Touch   was a very good portable digital player and I bought it as an upgrade from my   iPod Touch 5   that was a 2-year-old    in a case. It   is an excellent   replacement   and it   came in a   nice case.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the perfect companion to my MacBook Pro   I have both of these and they are very versatile   You can use the computer screen for a big picture book, music player, etc. The keyboard and touchpad are great. It's small enough to fit in a bag and also a laptop bag.    Great buy! I bought this to use as a backup drive for my Dell Optiplex 780 with a 5,400 rpm drive. The WD Green hard drive has a nice weight to it and the speed is plenty. This drive is very fast, which means that I don't have to worry about using up my USB port. I use a USB 2.0 port on my laptop, so this drive is perfect. It also has a handy little function to let me know how many blocks have been accessed or un-accessed. Overall, it was a great buy!  Good Price, good product, bad support? When I first picked this up, I figured it was the most bang for my buck on Amazon. But then I came to realize I had made a mistake. I've already spent at least $30 on a 3TB drive, and it has been doing the same thing I want it to do. It hasn't missed a block, hasn't crashed, and has just about 1GB more usable space. If that weren't the case, I would buy this again. It just isn't that good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for my computer at work.  I was having a problem with my printer and this solved the problem.   You do need to install the drivers if you have a printer that doesn't have drivers for this machine, otherwise it runs great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This little speaker is great for its price.   It's loud, loud, Loud!   I'm going to use it to go over the radio and play music during some of my flights. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great product.   The quality of the sound quality is amazing.  I have been looking for an amplifier that would have both the high quality sound and quality look that my Audio Technica's have, but at a price I can afford.  The only negative thing is the price is too high and its going to take time for the company to come out with other models that sound this good.  It would also be great to be able to have them program the amps for various sound sources.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this item as an upgrade from my Sony PS3 and I'm glad I did.  I'm currently using the PS3 as my main console (playing games, watching movies, etc.) and the PS2 is not that well suited for this kind of content.  This PS2 works perfectly for my needs (i.e. watching movies) and it's very easy to get to.  As an added bonus, I bought this unit from an Authorized eBay retailer, and the unit itself came with 2 year warranty.    The only downside for me is that the unit only supports DVD discs, but that shouldn't be an issue for most people.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to replace my old HP laptop (I have a lot of old computers) as it was the closest thing I could find to a Thinkpad which ran linux. The battery was pretty much dead by the time I got it (from Amazon, which is always a plus), and the only way to get it started was to plug in the power cord and let it sit for a few minutes before powering it up again. But it did start up ok. I also have a Lenovo N40l laptop and it has an extremely nice touch screen, but this one had a larger, nicer and more colorful screen (it also had no keyboard backlight) which was a huge plus.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The headphones are really great, the sound is good. You can hear the difference with just the one pair, not with the 3 more pairs I bought. The bass is definitely punchy. It is not just the speakers, but also the basses on the headphones are way more punchy then my old pair. Not sure if they were improved, or if the speakers were improved.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My wife bought a few years ago. I use it when I'm out and about. It's really quiet. No buzzing. We use a wired keyboard and it does the job well. It was easy to set up and is reliable. I have a computer and it's a pain in the butt to switch the keyboard. I'm happy. I think this is a good device for people like us who want to use a computer, but not have the hassle of an old school keyboard.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my third Apple product that I purchased, and this is by far the best. I had tried using a USB keyboard but found it to be quite a hassle.  It's much more convenient to use a computer for most things, and I do not need to worry about plugging in power cords at the end of the day.   I just keep my Apple computer with a mouse and an external keyboard connected to my television.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was the first e-reader i purchased. It was so much easier to read than a normal book.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the best headphones that I have purchased, and I have tried many. I bought this because of all the positive reviews and reviews by others on the Internet. It is nice that this one is waterproof as well as wireless. I have used all kinds of different headphones and the only one that I really like and that I will get back to again is Sony MDR-V4, which I have had for years. I will continue to listen to this headphone until Sony drops it and starts to make better headphones. I use a $100 wireless Bluetooth headset so this is a big improvement and an even better price for a good product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The speaker is quiet, and I think it is quite good for a small, cheap speaker. The speakers are actually really good.   It has the same type of sound as my Bose. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used this to power my computer when I am away from home.  I had my computer powered by my computer power adapter, but when I was traveling my computer wouldn't turn on. This unit had a built in AC adapter, so I had to go get a portable battery pack and plug it into the USB port, then plug in the computer, but that got old after a few hours, and I had no backup power. So, I bought this.  It's fast and has lots of USB ports for my other computer devices.  My only problem is the power adapter.  That will eventually run out, so you have to keep a spare in the box.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was my first purchase with them and I am very happy with my purchase.   I am not one to use my computer for most things, but when I need a portable gaming system to keep in the car, it is perfect.  The sound is very good. I use the bluetooth headset and the mic is nice.  Very satisfied, and will buy more in the future.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first time I've owned a computer that I know I'm going to keep for a long time.  The mouse and keyboard are great,  and you can connect your   wireless keyboard and mouse to this computer with the included dongle, but be forewarned that the wi-fi only works on   the ASUS website, and there is no wireless network setting on this   PC.   I highly recommend   this device for anyone who wants a powerful, stable machine that won't break the bank.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had this product for 2 years and have only been using it for one and a half days, but have been impressed. The sound is good, and the battery life is great.   It can be hard to find these types of products in this price range.   Excellent    The sound of this is very good, so much better than a high-end Bluetooth system.  In other areas, I think they could be better, such as the remote, though. I could have used the included remote more effectively.  This would have been an excellent piece of equipment for a college student.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit is very easy to setup and use.   It came with a USB cable which is a must for any computer.  It's easy to set up and works great.  My computer and music player work great on this unit.  This unit can be configured to turn off automatically and start up at a certain time, like midnight.  I love how easy the software is to set.  If the software were easy to install I would give 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was looking for a new phone and this one was not what I was after. The battery life was terrible. The other phones I had used lasted from 8 to 10 months with good battery life. The new phone lasted 2 months. I tried to buy a new one and when I received it, I noticed that the battery is bent. When I went to return it, it was returned to the store with a note on it saying "No Returns on Bended Batteries".

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am using my Sony VTC-1 as a replacement for my old Sony TCD-310 receiver. I use the TCD as my main receiver, but it's a very expensive one that requires a ton of cables, a ton more power than I can use, and it does not support DVD-Audio.   This is a great little recorder. I got mine at the B&H Photo store in Austin and it was about $10 less than the Tcd-310.  I have a few other Sony products that I'm going to replace with the VTC, but this one is my main. I would have preferred a smaller one, but the V2 works just fine for me.

I wish the dash had a USB port on the bottom of the dash, otherwise I am stuck with USB cords everywhere!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been looking for the perfect portable speaker since I heard about them on a show (I know! I was listening to the wrong stuff!) but never found one that was exactly what I was looking for. I just purchased my Sony XB200 and I must say, I am very impressed! I play music from my Sony player on the XB and it sounds fantastic! I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a high quality, portable and very good sounding portable speaker. It sounds really good and I highly suggest buying it if you are interested in the Sony X series.   XB200 in my studio!   This is by far the best portable speaker I have ever heard! I'm using it in my sound room and can't be more satisfied. It does exactly what it is supposed to.    XB202 in my home studio   In the future, I want to add a bit more power and be able to adjust the bass and treble.    The bass can get a bit bloated when set at high volumes. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was a little worried about getting this item, since I did not want to deal with the hassle of a 3 year warranty, but I was not disappointed. The packaging was excellent and the product was just what I wanted. I did have one problem with it, and it was a minor one but it was an annoyance and will be easy to fix.   First off, the product does not look like a very robust product.  It looks cheap, and if you look closely you can see a tiny scratch on the surface.  However, the actual unit looks like it is quite sturdy.  As far as the performance, I cannot say that it is anything special, but it is good enough.  While I like the ability to control the volume, the sound is not the best, and the lack of bass will likely not be an issue for most users.  This thing is easy to use and use once.  I would definitely recommend it for most people.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device works great. The first thing I thought when I plugged the cord in was "hey, it's on."

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My new SDR with the antenna tuner and radio on the back works great, but I wish it came with an additional input cable that would allow me to add a second radio. Also, the antenna was not adjustable, so I have to use a pair of chopsticks to get it to sit straight on my antenna.   I'm very impressed with the tuner, it was easy to install. I used a multimeter to check and find the right frequencies. The SDR works perfectly with SDR# ( http://www.sdr-advice.com/ )  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit works great, but there is one little downside. When the unit gets really hot it starts to sweat.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My computer had stopped working several months ago, so I contacted Asus, who promptly replaced it, and the replacement worked fine, for over 2 years, then stopped working again.  I bought this product on a whim, after reading all the rave reviews.  The screen was fine from the very first day.   The computer was fast, but it still had problems with a few programs.  It was a miracle that I was able to get it back online.

It's easy to use and fast, even though the software is a little old and the menus a little small.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got my Pico 4.0 in October last year and it has been a wonderful investment.   While I have had the Raspberry Pi 2, my P-Pico 4 does not have the HDMI port for a TV.  The P-Cou is only powered by the 5V GPIO pins so it doesn't require a power cord.  It also has a few more USB ports than the Raspberry, so it's just more convenient.  I'm really pleased with the quality of the Pico board and with the performance it provides.

I like my music in my system (with my A/V system), and this player can't get me the "correct" sound for my setup.  It does have one cool feature: it can be programmed to change the track if a song changes, and it comes with a very cool built in MP3 player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is great. I have a Macbook Pro that I upgraded to an 11 inch Pro, but still need an external monitor. This is great as I can plug it into my Macbook and use it as a second monitor, which I did for a while before I finally gave up. It supports two monitors, as well as the two external displays on my iMac. I can also see the video coming from my Mac, and I am sure it can be configured so I don't have to use the built in sound card on my Mac. As long as it doesn't get too hot, I'll plug it in every night as a secondary monitor.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have this as a primary source of digital audio and it has had no problems with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using the Soundbar for several months now, and it's just as great as I hoped it would be. I'm used to a single speaker setup in my living room, and I've always found it to be loud enough for everything that I want to listen to in my office, but the soundbar lets me spread out the speakers a bit more so that I can listen to music on the big screen.

It has great speakers, is a great value for money, and the battery lasts quite a while (12 hours is probably average). I also really like the fact that it is waterproof. The biggest problem is that it needs a lot of charging, and that's when it's in your bag.   It's a great keyboard

I don't use my car very often, so I usually go with my phone or mp3 player.  The Bluetooth makes my phone easier to use, and the sound quality was excellent.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this product! I have been using it for almost a year now and it's one of the few pieces of software out there that can track the status of multiple devices and keep a log of what's going on at any given time.    When I'm not in the middle of a huge game session I always have a copy of this handy dandy app on my phone ready to be checked out.  I don't mind keeping an eye on all my computers and the fact that it includes features such as the ability to capture the state of multiple computers at once and log in on any computer that has the app is pretty awesome too.  Just a note about the update to this app:  As you can tell by the pictures, this app doesn't exactly have the same feel as the current version of PC Companion.  You now see a small bar on the main screen which shows you what windows you are logged into and you have the option to add additional entries (like what program you are currently playing a game of and what game's graphics settings you're currently playing at).  In addition, there is a menu option to remove windows from the menu, but when you press the "x" it is removed.   The main problem I have with this version of the app, though, is the fact you cannot delete windows from within the app.  Even when I remove windows I am still unable to remove them from the app because it does not save changes until I close and reopen it.  The only workaround I have found is to save all of the information before closing PC Companion and then save the app's log.

I had no problems getting the software installed and it booted up fine on my PC. It just isn't the fastest. I couldn't get my music files to play. I am going to get a different computer for my kids and they will be very happy with it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect for my needs, super fast I bought this a couple of months ago and am just as happy with my purchase as the first time. The first thing I noticed is the great picture quality and sound. I use this with my computer to do online shopping so it works pretty much like my computer. So far so good. The only problem I have is that I need to plug a power cord in to use the built-in computer speakers. I also bought an HDMI cable and that will hopefully solve the problem.

When I saw this for the first ever time, my worries were instantly allayed. I like the build quality. It's very solid. The keyboard is very nice. The screen is bright and clear. The case is pretty nice and it's small. I didn't like the built in speakers too much, but I'll try to find something better.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this after watching several videos and reading the various reviews.  I just got it on Friday, and it has already been plugged into an old PC at work for a few days.   It runs much better than my old Dell laptop, and as well as it runs, it is quiet.  It's like plugging in an old Xbox console (with no sound).   The price is pretty good too, I got it for $199 (plus shipping).  My only concern is the fact that the sound is so good I have noticed that the volume of my Xbox is too low for my taste.

I have also taken the mic out to be used in noisy areas and when it's too quiet to record anything, it sounds great.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Awesome product! I'm a professional videographer and music editor. I've had two of these in different brands and always been disappointed. After a month of using them, I finally gave up on them. This time I went to Home Depot and purchased a cheapo digital video recorder that is supposed to sound just like the old ones but costs less. I got it and plugged it in. Wow! The sound is excellent and the recording is amazing. I really love the features they gave me. I also bought an extra mic because I didn't like the way my old one had the wind and mic stand at the back. This one has a built in stand so you can put it at an angle and the wind doesn't get in the way.  Customer Testimonials

It was only $299, and the build quality and portability was very good for the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a music lover, I am thrilled that I can play a compact disc, and I can carry my CDs in my pockets and on my keys.  I am not a audiophile, but I really do enjoy playing music on my CD player, and there is a very clear and loud sound with the SDR.   I highly recommend this device to others, especially those who don't have the money for a computer that has a sound card.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this because my brother has an older one (which is more advanced) and i wanted something with USB-C. It is not that the USB-A connector is bad or anything like that - it's just the cable. It's much thicker than the old cable and it's kinda hard to plug into anything. It does have good connectivity though. I love that you can hook up to an external monitor for the kids to play games on (that wouldnt happen with my older one) and the sound from it is great. It gets a 2 for 1 for what it is: a compact, great looking device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this product and have never had a problem with it. I've tried other devices and have had a few issues but nothing I can't live with.   My only wish is that I didn't have to pay so much for it since it is just a piece of plastic and not an expensive device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The audio output is very good. It sounds great with my iPod Touch. I got it about a month ago and I can't tell you how good the sound is! I used to have a Tascam and this is just as good, if not better. This one is also pretty compact and light.    Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality is amazing, and I really don't have to use headphones to listen to my music. The iPad is much cheaper than a Macbook and it works better for my needs. I have my iMac and iPhone with me, but I would get the iPad if I have a computer and would really like music playing at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been looking at this for over a year now because I love my Sonos systems but this model was cheaper. I am very happy with it.   It's small enough to use in my bedroom.  I have it paired to both my Sono and my computer, so when I'm not using my computer I can use my Sonoc to hear my Sonoplay.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I bought my first computer for my first semester, I was a bit nervous.  When it arrived the next day, I got right to work on it.  I found that the included CD-ROM of Microsoft Windows was excellent, and the sound quality was great.  Also, I didn't mind the fact that my computer didn't have a mouse, instead opting to use the mouse that came with the computer.   My friends, who were also new to computers, thought the computer was nice enough for a first computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent sound card for the price. I'm a sound engineer and I have had problems in the past with the original Sound Blaster. This card is superior to the original and my old SB Pro-40 is a much better product.   For only $10 more than the original SB Pro 40, it is a great deal!

After some fumbling trying to figure out the directions, I finally found the right spot for it and it's very simple.  The buttons are very smooth, and the display is crystal clear.  Also, it's great to use with my PC and I haven't had a problem with lag and glitches in the past.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The headphone jack works great. It allows you to take the headphones out of the package, plug them in, and then connect the cable without having to fiddle around with any wires or dongles. The cable is also made of braided nylon, so it won't have a problem with wear and tear. The headphone volume controls are pretty cool, as they can be used to adjust the volume while listening to music. Overall, I'm very happy with the device.  What I don't like about the device:
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the Pc for my son for Christmas, and it turned out to be a very good choice. I have a small portable computer that is small in size but big in capabilities, and I wanted something that would give my son the ability to use it while he was at work or school. As a student, he's never missed a class because of not being able to use his computer, so this is a big bonus. The build quality is nice as it seems solid and the case is sturdy. The keyboard is a bit cramped, but it's a small laptop. I also like the extra port for my phone and USB mouse.   The only thing I would change is that they should have the option for the 2nd video to be in black. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my wife who suffers from a neurological condition called a "stereotactic dystonia". When she uses the computer, she often has severe muscle spasms (I didn't know I needed the dystonic factor in her body until I saw this). This is a pretty simple unit. The key is the fact that the power on is the same as the power off so she has to keep turning it off in between using it, which is a pain.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device a month ago. I used to have a small Sony Walkman and it had to be recharged once a year. I tried to buy a portable music player for my iPhone 5 but couldn't find one in any size that had batteries. I finally came across this one and I'm glad I did. I can listen to the radio without having to put the unit on charge or buy new batteries. This is much better than the Sony Walkmans I had.   Also, the battery life on this thing is pretty good. I played music for an hour without having my unit on my lap and the batteries were still at 50%.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this item to play my Nintendo DS handheld video game console on my computer. It is great, especially if you use your computer as a game system (i.e. play games on the computer with your Wii). The joystick feels good in my hands and is well balanced. The volume is a little loud, so I turned it down a bit. My only issue with the device is that the Wii Remote works great, but the Wii's gamepad feels so much better (plus it's much more convenient to use). But hey, all in all, I'm very happy with this item, especially since I have the Wii 3DS.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As far as I can tell the XBMC media center is a nice little machine.  The sound quality is pretty good and the remote control works pretty well.   The only issue I have is the lack of support for DVD drives.  This is because of a licensing restriction which is probably related to the lack  of DVD support on Windows.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great machine, very fast and easy to set up, and it can save a lot of time setting up the computer if you're already familiar with it.   The quality of the sound is great, too, and the program (which you'll need to use for transferring recordings) is very simple.  The only negative is that I was a bit nervous about purchasing a "budget" recorder because it only comes with a few programs. But it does have tons of useful features to help you, and I've found that I don't use most of them as much as I would if I bought the same equipment at a higher cost.

Not sure how a "low-noise" speaker can be "high quality" but I am satisfied with it.  The only problem with this device is that the cable is not as long as I was expecting.   It might be because I bought it from Amazon, but it feels like I'm missing out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this and the other two, and can say that they are excellent choices. I use the TASER X6-3s for my home and work (and yes, there is a difference in sound), and the Taser X6 and X6 with the "Smart" are great tools for those who may not be ready to go out on the street with a Taser for their entire life.  I have only used the Smart, but it works great for home and it's fun to use, even if you don't want to get into a fight with the people in your house, because it doesn't hurt you if you miss.  This is a great product for anyone, since it does everything and has a nice look, the only issue I have is the batteries, it only lasted about 12 to 15 minutes before needing to be recharged, which is kind of annoying.

Also the sound quality is much better than my old ones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The keyboard is great. I have a HP Laptop which I love, but the keyboard on the Laptop is a little weird.

This is exactly what I was looking for. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The new Apple iPod shuffle is a good product at a good price. It seems as if I've always wanted an iPod, but my family and friends have always used the iPod classic which I prefer because it has more music and has a better screen.   This iPod shuffle has a really great screen with a little extra space on the top.  The music player for me is the best I've ever had. I use a lot of music but my iPod has never been the best in sound quality or speed. I also like the fact that the shuffle plays a little faster and doesn't sound too bad on the ears.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased my first digital device (a Sony Vaio digital laptop) about 8 years ago. It was quite the beast and cost $1,700 (not including taxes or shipping). I was quite pleased with the sound of my Sony Vaizio until I upgraded to an iMac that I recently purchased.   It's amazing how a little digital media player can transform from a piece of heavy hardware to a portable music player in a few short years. The software is so good that it does more than I ever imagined.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had a few of these over the last 5 years.  This is the first time that I could actually use them without any problems.   When I need a laptop with a larger screen,  the Surface 2 is good but not top of the line.  The first Surface 2 had a lot of problems and was hard to use.  I decided to buy the second one and it is a better machine than I expected.  My only real complaint is that the power button and the power cord are connected together.  It seems to be difficult to take apart and I often get tripped over the power cable.  If you are a power user, you can remove the power to the keyboard and use it like a normal keyboard.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using my LG V20 for about two weeks now.  I love the design, ease of use and overall design and I also love the new software features.  The phone runs very smoothly and has a very good battery.  Battery life is awesome when it lasts, which I get from all of LG's phones.     Rated 5 out of 5 by Jgazd from Better than expected - but does NOT last as long as expected I bought this phone to replace my Moto X. I already have a Motorola phone but wanted to get a Nexus device. I've only had the phone 2 days, but the first couple of days of using it was smooth sailing. But the last few days I had a problem with the phone's bootloader unlocking. I contacted LG and they quickly gave me a new one that I can try to fix it but don't really trust my phone.  If you don't want to take the chance of trying to fix a bootloader unlock problem yourself (which I doubt you could do for the bootloader on this phone), you should probably look elsewhere, and buy from someone else who does.    If, however, you want to upgrade to Android 8.0 Oreo from Marshmallow, then this phone's hardware is better than average. It's smooth to use and has good camera quality. : I purchased this for my girlfriend who was considering a Nexus 6P, but I'm still considering upgrading to it from a Nexus 5X.The V20 is definitely a step up from the 5X, but it's really about the experience of Android 8 versus 7 for me. While I still like Lollipop a lot, I feel that this is a step in the right direction for Google in 2017.The Moto X has a similar physical design to the V20, and I like that there's more of a fingerprint sensor in the back. This phone also has a removable battery, which is great if you do a lot of traveling or frequently leave your phone at home to charge, etc. The front camera on this V20 also has better zoom than the Moto X's front camera.The camera's lens is bigger and has better light, but unfortunately the quality isn't great. The camera does a pretty good job in low light, and in good lighting it's fine, but there's no macro or bokeh, which are features that I use when shooting with the Moto E.If I

Sound quality is very good, however, if you want the ultimate in sound, buy the HD600e.  I have no doubt that the HD-600e will last for many years, however it is worth mentioning that the bass output of the HD650e can be a little uneven and I wouldn't recommend using them with a large or small sub.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently got this to replace a defective iPod touch (2nd generation). It has many great features, including wireless, 3G support, the ability to upload songs via iTunes (but i still wish the iPod had that feature) and a great selection of pre-loaded (but not useless) radio stations.   A few problems I encountered were:  1. I couldn't use it on my network.  I've tried the WLAN-to-network method (I don't know why it didn't work) and the WAP-to. I didn't find a way around it.  2. The wireless range is very limited. I'm using a wireless router that has 2 of them in my bedroom and the other is set in my bathroom.  3.  My wife complains that the screen is a little too bright (and I don't have a dark room).   So I don´t know if that's a software or a hardware issue. But I think that if they fixed this issue it would be a great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was my first Mac, and I can honestly say that it lives up to its price point. As long as I am using the keyboard and mouse, I'm good. The included CD burner is a godsend, and if I could change anything on the machine, I would add a floppy drive (as I do use the computer much). The built-in browser is a lifesaver, and it is nice to be able to copy files over the wire. The only drawback is that the mouse is not quite as sensitive as I like, and that I wish there was some way to change the sensitivity on the fly. But overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  Review of DJI Phantom 3 Standard Quadcopter + Spare Parts by Jonathan W on Dec 15, 2014 This quad is amazing. I use the DJI phantom 3 with it every day. I bought it because it was on sale, but its a great value for the money. The main issue I have is that its a little tight to fit in the Phantom 3 quadcopter. I had to glue it on with a glue gun so its not so bad, but it is a little snug. The gopro flight controller is also nice to have. Also I did a repair of mine which took less then an hour. Other than that great purchase I would recommend buying this if you want a cheap quality quad. .    Great drone for beginners! by Andrew R on Nov 14, 2014 The Phantom 3 is a great little quadcopTER. It flies well, has decent battery life, and has pretty cool features. The best feature for me though is the remote. The buttons are easy to use, the remote has a good range, and can be attached with a little bit of glue. The battery life for the Phantom is pretty good. At least 2 hours of flying. I've only flown it a couple of times, but I'm sure I can make it up to 2 hours without flying often. The one thing I would do to improve it, would be to improve battery life. Other then that, great drone for someone that wants a little help with their quad.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to replace my older model. As a computer geek who spends all day on my computer I wanted something small that would allow me to move it around without getting in the way. This baby works great and is very sleek. It does need to be plugged into a power outlet. But, I was never concerned about that before I got this baby. This is a great price for the amount of features I get.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought these because I was trying to get a new computer and needed to move to a portable. These work very well.   No dead pixels, they're a little bit flimsy, but once the computer is set up, these are perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased a cheapo computer a year or so ago from ebay that I thought was a piece of junk and bought this for $60 (at the time). The system works well, but I decided to return it, mainly because I wanted to have some fun playing with it. I'm glad I did.   The interface is very smooth and the sound quality is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very good unit for the price.  It comes with 2 controllers, with the extra controller you can use one controller for game and one for music.  When I plugged this unit in, it came to life in less than 30 seconds with no issues. I have the old console controller and my old console games would no longer work. This was an easy fix.  This console controller just works!  The sound of the game is good.  I use this in conjunction with my old Nintendo games.   It was worth the money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first digital recorder. The price is great.  I can record up to 4 hours and I can change the format to whatever I want.   It is super small and I am able to record my guitar playing on it with my guitar plugged in.  It has a built-in mic, so there is no need to buy a new one.  The battery lasts for days.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is really quiet.  I bought this one for when I work with my old portable and don't want to have to constantly turn it off or on to use it.   Very small, it's only 8.5 inches long so if you have a big desk then this would be a little too big for you, but for me it is just right.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned a Sony Walkman since I was a child. The music just played on and on. It's still very popular, and I think the latest model is even better. It doesn't take up a lot of space on my mp3 player, and is very quiet when I play the radio. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've bought 2 of these and one is still working and only about $10 more than my old one.  The sound is great and the control is very nice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This unit is perfect. I've had a variety of audio units, including Sony, and have always hated the fact that the input devices are mounted on the speakers. I got tired of spending time trying to get the signal into the unit, and I thought this was perfect! The unit will take either an S-Video or Component Input, and has a great sound quality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is very hard to use this computer. It is the size of a normal notebook and it is quite heavy. This makes it difficult to operate.   The power button does not work. I have to put my computer on battery power.  The audio is not good but, it does not effect my use of the computer.  If you need a notebook computer then this is a great choice. I would recommend this product if you have a small budget but don't want to sacrifice anything in quality.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have to say that I like this product a lot. It has worked out great for me and it has been extremely easy to set up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was a great value! It does a great job and I've been using it for a couple years now. I use it to connect with my computer when I'm away from home, and even when I travel a lot, which is often when I want the best computer experience. I especially love the fact that I can connect to my mobile phone as well for a great call quality. It is also good for watching movies, which isn't always easy when using a desktop system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After reading all the good reviews about this device I bought it. It does everything my old CD player/DVD player/CD burner did but more. It has all of the functions that my old player had including being able to play music files from a hard drive. I can play my CD's on it, I can burn them to CD and I can stream them from my computer. The only drawback that I see is the remote does not come with the power cord, and it does not take batteries. That is a minor thing I have to live with. I bought a second one to replace it as my CD player runs off batteries. I hope this device lasts the long haul.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this unit because I am a musician and use it to record my drum parts. The only problem I've had with it so far is that the head isn't able to keep the drum parts separate (the drum tracks come through both the microphone and the analog out), so sometimes I have to put a mic on the head while I still have the drum tracks playing on the computer. I have other devices that use separate heads but I have a feeling this is a problem unique to the Sonobox. That being said, the Sonobarbox works perfectly for me.  One final note: The unit's price reflects its quality. I bought mine in 2009 for a few hundred dollars and it has held up great for the last 4 years. There were other issues I had with the unit, but I fixed them quickly and made sure the unit was working before I bought another one. I'm very pleased with this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as a last-ditch option before deciding to go the wire. I'm a sucker for Apple products and I was considering a number of different USB mice to replace the ones I currently have.   This one is super high quality.  I love the weight of it and the smoothness of it.  The cord is quite long, so be sure to plug it in somewhere if you have a small desk (I have it plugged into a wall outlet).   It's got an awesome clicky feel that makes it easy to set up and use.

I can never go hiking without one, but never to the point of needing it, so I knew I'd have to buy another one.   It comes with a cord and a USB cord that you plug in separately to your computer, but you don't need a separate power cord.  This thing is just awesome, and not to mention easy to use. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The best thing about this unit is its quiet. I used to have a Yamaha, but the sound coming from it was way too loud.

It's a Lenovo but the screen was always blurry, especially on dark or bright backgrounds. This mouse fixes all of those problems.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My son loves his Nintendo DS. It is perfect for playing games, movies, TV, and music, even when the kids are at school.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had the old Apple iBook G4 in my house for about 3 years now.   The screen is a little too small for my eyes,   but the audio is still okay.  So I was very disappointed to hear that the new iBook Pro is not as good as the old iBook.  The sound is not that great,  but then again, the old model was pretty much the same.  Also, the new model doesn't have the CD/DVD reader that I had used to love.  It is kind of sad how I feel that Apple just doesn't care about their old fans anymore. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The i3 is a good laptop replacement with a large touch screen and a great keyboard.

It had an excellent keyboard, a larger screen and larger battery. The battery lasted a long time.

I did have to use a little extra effort to get the cable that I bought out of the plastic sleeve, but it didn't make me want to return them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very good electronic system and the screen is very bright and bright enough to read.  It's also very quiet in operation.  I don't know of any other tablet that has both a larger screen and can be used as a tablet.   I did find the "software" to be a little more complicated than I had anticipated.  For some reason, when I click the "back" button on the back of the device, it would not come back to where I put it.  The "menu" buttons do not come out of the tablet, nor does the "menu bar" appear on the display.  This has only been an issue once and it happened when I was trying to add some items to my "library".   The other time it happened was when I decided to buy the tablet. That has not been an everyday occurrence.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My computer has never crashed from the software that it has. It has always functioned correctly and has never had any problems. I also have had no problems with the speakers.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from Good purchase This thing works well and is easy to set up. I found that the power is not enough to power my HDTV which is where I store the data for the DVR.   I replaced it with a better model and found that this model has less power and is slightly more expensive.   I recently replaced my old DVR with the CEC-1000 as I was looking for an upgrade that had less power consumption and an HDTV remote which worked. I was very pleased to find that this is a nice upgrade! The remote is great for accessing all the programs and there are some great live services such as ESPN and CNN.  I like the fact that I can view all of the programs at the same time on a TV screen (it's hard to watch three programs at once).  The only problem I have is that it doesn't seem to be powered by USB and when I plug it in it won't turn on until I let it sit down for a few minutes. I just have to wait until it has settled before turning it on. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought these to replace my old ones because they were very thin and had a lot of static.  They worked great until the last one that I bought broke so I went out and bought these.     I do wish the cable was a bit longer though.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this headphone because I was dissatisfied with the sound quality of my other headphones. I had heard good reviews of the Sennheiser HD650 but it didn't fit my ears as well as the HD650 and the HD800. I also was dissatisfied that the other headphones I tried sounded too bright and not in the least neutral, and I was also dissatisfied that I had to spend more money to get the same high quality sound.   The HD650 comes very close to the original SennHeiser HD800 as far as sound quality and comfort, however it's significantly more comfortable to wear.  The only slight negative I can mention is that the cable isn't long enough for my small ears. But other than that I really appreciate the value and comfort of the HD 650. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this little soundboard, as I use it most of the time for rock music. I've tried many soundboards in my life, and this one is my favorite. I like the fact that it doesn't add any clutter to my studio. It has a nice sound without a lot of added cost and without making my studio any more noisy. This is my fourth soundboard and I am so glad I purchased it. I listen to music a lot in the summer months, so I like to add some noise to my recordings in the studio. The sounds are great and it is very lightweight. The only thing I would change would be for the included cords to be easier to use and more secure.

I saw this unit at my local big box electronics store and thought it was amazing! I had to look it up because I couldn't find a review and had never used a digital printer before.   After using the unit for a couple of days, I decided it was great.  The parts were interchangeable and the printer was simple to set up.  This unit would be great for those of us who don't have a 3ds printer or for those with limited space.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this one in 2010, when the price was at least 50 percent less than it is now. It has worked flawlessly for years now, and now I finally have a nice keyboard (with proper software) for my MacBook Pro. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got the ereader to replace an aging paperback and I'm very happy I did. It's lightweight, compact, has a good cover, is very easy to read (although a little light on the text), and there are a lot of choices of paper.   If you like good quality paper, read this book, it's worth every penny. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first time I've been able to use my laptop.   The keyboard is a lot better than my old one.  Also, I've used this laptop for a while now, and now that the mouse is dead, it's just as good as the old mouse.  The only thing I don't like about this is the wireless dongle, which I can't get to work. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this phone.  I have to wait 2-3 days for it to get to my address to use it but that doesn't bother me.  The speed is fast as well.    The battery life is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was the first time I have bought an iPod.  I have always used CD players but I found my old turntable just doesn't have enough power to power a decent setup.  This is much better than my old CD player.  The sound quality is great and my music library is now even bigger than it used to be.   I also like that it can play mp3's and that I can add my own songs as well. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've owned one for a few years now.   It's a good sounding headphone.  It gets the job done.  The only drawback is the price tag.  I'll always have an old pair around for those times when I need to hear things that a good headphone will miss.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The headphones sound amazing. I am so impressed with the quality of sound.   There are not that many headphone manufacturers who do so.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit is extremely well made. The sound is clear and the controls are easy to navigate. It has a nice built in speaker for playing music.   My only complaint is that the battery seems to be dying more quickly than other units I've owned.

I hope there will be an update with new information and tips on how to use the unit more efficiently.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was easy to setup, to set up and the sound quality is great.   I bought this system to replace a cd player that I got as a gift from my uncle, who is not into music.  I'm still not very much into music, but I've been listening to my new cd player for about 2 weeks now and it sounds great!   A big plus to me is that I can listen to my other music (as well as music I have on my phone) on my tv. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently bought this item. I had been looking for a portable USB to microUSB adapter to use with my PS4, and when I saw the price I thought it was worth it. When I plugged it in the cable wasn't working, I found it in my PS2, and I finally solved my problem. It is good for small games, like the ones I can load with the PS4. It has some limitations, like it doesn't have a headset jack, and it doesn' t have a USB-C connector. I bought it because it was on sale, so I don't see myself buying a replacement any time soon.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This product is a very well built and sturdy computer.  The keyboard and mouse are great, and very accurate.  When using this on a 4'x8' table, you have enough room for a mouse.   A good sound system and nice speakers make this a great computer for anyone who loves music. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It took me a while to get it because I kept buying and buying, but the price is worth it. I'm a big fan of the way the screen is bright and detailed without looking too glossy.   The only problem I had was that the USB port seemed to be a little loose, but that could be easily fixed. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the coolest devices ever! The only problem I have with the device is that the power cable is a little hard to hook up to the iPad for me. The iPad is plugged into the wall and the device doesn't have a proper connection on the power cord. The power cable was not made with a USB connection in mind and it was a pain.

My father in law is a computer and audio/video tech and the iMac was one of his two favorite things in the house for years.  The sound quality is very nice for home use.  I have tried many other computers but this is the only one that is as easy to setup, use, and manage as this one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a really nice device, although I don't really have many music preferences, as I have mostly just listened to MP3 files.  This device really does allow you to take the music you have on your iPod, and have it available on your computer or your CD player.  I love the fact that you can also search through your music files.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my second Sony and I'm very happy with it. I bought the first one several years ago and was pretty impressed, but never bought one with a remote, which is the main reason for this purchase. However, my wife said it was too long and too heavy and I needed to get the remote for it, so I figured I'd get the one with the remote.

I like that I can get a good reading without glasses on.  I have only ever used glasses with the glasses on, they look ridiculous with glasses on - i have to wear a mask - but I'm sure the glasses will work with sunglasses on - so I have a compromise. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to replace a Toshiba laptop that I used to use but I found that the keyboard was a bit small and the screen wasn't very bright, it wasn't as good as a Tos' as some other laptop's I've seen, but it was cheap and it works fine.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The headphone is just as good as I hoped. I don't notice any difference in sound when compared to my more expensive headphones, but that's not really what I was looking for when I got it. It has the exact same fit and finish as the other EarPods (no extra material or dents to speak of), so it's really good quality. I get the most enjoyable music when playing a lot of metal music (Black Metal/Death metal, Death Metal, etc.) without being drowned out by any sound that might interfere with the music. This does not happen in my older models, and I prefer it that way.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the e-Sensors 3-way thermostat a couple of weeks ago and have used it a couple times now. It works great! It uses 3 AA batteries that fit in the side of the unit.   The only issue I have is that the LED lights on the unit do not always light up, however I use the thermostats for heating water and then I use my smartphone to turn on the lights, so I'm just not seeing that in my home.

The device was as advertised: excellent wireless connectivity, great support and very fast performance.

The only bad thing is the battery life, but you have to get used to it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound of this product is awesome. The batteries do not last long, but it makes me feel like I am in the arcade.

I would recommend this to anybody who has an old arcade game.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Pono is an excellent music player. It is easy to use and gives a lot of sound. The bass is powerful and the highs are just the right amount.   You may find that the bass does get a little too much in the treble region. It would be nice if Pono could do something about this. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is a little cumbersome in my opinion (you need to set it up for the first time) and can get a bit confusing (I got the setup wrong) but once set it works very well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the Tivoli for a Christmas present. The battery is very good, and it runs for a long time (24 hours) on a single charge. The only drawback is the cost, but in general, this is a great little box. The sound quality is not that good on my system. I have the X-Fi Platinum, but I also have a Yamaha, and the TIVoli sounded better in my system, just because of the volume control. The software is a little bit confusing, but not too much.

I love that you can charge them with an external power supply and that they are wireless so I can use them at home or on the go. The only thing I dislike about them is that they don't have a remote control. However, it's just a function on their website and you can find one with the same function on other products like these.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound of the Musicone is excellent. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I got the black model which was pretty expensive. It is a nice solid, high quality sounding set of earbuds. However, the design of the earpads was horrible. It was just a flimsy plastic frame around the earpieces. I bought the white one and it was more comfortable and much more functional. The sound quality, soundstage, and bass were all very good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this about three weeks ago and used it about a month now. I like how easy the buttons are to access with the rubber thumbpad. The only thing is it takes a little getting used to having the screen on the bottom. The battery is not very powerful, so you need to plug in at least half an hour a day to be able to charge it. I'm getting close to a year of use out of it so far.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first PC ever and I am very pleased with it. The graphics are great, it looks good, and it's not too loud. I like the fact that it's modular. The problem with modulars is that you have to buy new expansion cards to make it work. This thing can have 4GB of RAM, but with the graphics card and the case, you can install 4GB. And with this computer you get a lot of power, it's really fast and I really enjoy using it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the blu ray player, it works perfect   it has blu ray, dvd and cd in a player   and in case you need more of it, you can hook it up to the tv   or to any blu ray/dvd player   This unit is good for the money and comes with everything you need. For the money it is good but I wish they included some type of DVD player. I want to buy the hd version and replace it with a dvd. I also wish there was a usb port so that I could connect my ipod/iphone/ ipod touch without adding extra stuff.  Works very well and looks really nice. Good for watching videos. I can't believe it's $100. The disc player comes with a blu ray disc.  ( August 11, 2014 )  It's worth the money!  I purchased the blue ray player for my hd tv. I bought it on sale and its worth every penny. You get a lot of features out of it and the audio is very good. For only $90 this is a no brainer. :  I love this blu ray! The sound is clear and it plays great movies. The only issue is that the blu rays play in black and white (which is pretty much everything I own) and it wouldnt show me the picture when it is playing. It would just dim the picture to black and then you would have to wait for it to play again (like you would if you bought it from amazon). I wish there were a way to do it in full color. I am very happy with my purchase. It even came with the case to keep it looking nice. It will get a good 5 stars from me. I'm still waiting for the blu-ray player to come with blu ray  The product worked well but is not a high end set up    the quality is a good one,but it is just a cheap tv set (in comparison to the hbo) that needs extra stuff to function properly  Good but needs a blu-Ray player  The blu-rays work fine but are a little hard to play in full screen, as they need to be at 1280x720.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best laptop that I have ever owned   - I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it. It is very sleek and it's very comfortable to use. It really helps me with my math homework and writing as well.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Very good quality. I have had good success with this receiver on my old receiver. A lot of my older receivers were just "one time use" products but this one has performed well. I use to have an Amstrad CPC/CD32 (Alfreo/Casio) but it was a disaster. I have an old PCM-303 which has just been refurbished, and this receiver is just fine. I also use the old Mac II which is not as good as the PCM. However, if you are not a Mac or old computer user, you will probably find the old PCm to be superior.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my iTouch.   The most annoying part is the battery life.  It only lasts me a few days and I've had it for about a year.  However, it is so convenient and I use it constantly to tap in songs on iTunes.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Eee PC 10 is the best portable computer ever.   It is very small and light, and it has lots of great features.  I have been looking for a good portable computer that can run Linux, and this is it.  The one thing that it does not have is a CD burner or printer, but it has plenty of space on it for storage.  It does have one drawback though; the interface is a bit difficult to use.  But in my opinion, if you don't want to use Windows, this is an amazing computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A very high quality audio processor. The sound is great and the controls are intuitive and very user friendly. I would definitely recommend this device to anyone looking for a quality audio interface with a great sound.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent quality! I have a Yamaha DX7M, which was my primary DAW and then bought a Behringer console in 2011, when I was in a hurry. It was an awesome piece of kit with all the bells and whistles, and I still have it, but have been struggling with my Behringers lately, so I bought this as a replacement (and also because I've been using Ableton Live 8 for a while). There are lots of great reviews online, but I'm gonna focus on the sound here since that's the thing I'll be using this thing for most of the time. The first thing I notice about this interface is the quality of the sound. There's nothing flimsy about it at all. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but the quality is really good. When I started getting excited about the possibilities of digital audio, the Behringerrato was the best bang for the buck I found. The controls are easy to use, but it's the ability to adjust each parameter to suit the situation that gets me. There are two dedicated AUX ports, so you can plug in a mixer with mixer inputs and mix without changing the mixdowns. The presets are amazing and are very flexible, as you can switch between reverbs, filters, effects, and effects combinations (that I only know of by using other programs). The interface is small, but doesn't feel small (if that's even a word). I think this would work perfectly in a smaller studio, so long as you have good audio equipment, but definitely a great buy if you're looking for an affordable, high quality computer audio interface. As a beginner who doesn't know much about computers, I found this a very good introductory device for a first computer/soundcard. It has an excellent USB interface (great for laptops), and it includes some very useful effects that allow you to produce some very interesting soundscapes, especially when used with an external mixer. Ableton Live's Live 9 for Mac is a very popular program. I use this to record, mix, and edit my music, and this is a fantastic app. However, I find Live 9 to have some problems when recording.

I just installed a Sony DAT recorder and the M7 is much easier to use than the DAT.  This was one of the few things I liked about the Musicradar system: it was easy to use, the sound was great and the CD player is a nice addition.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to replace the original unit which died a couple years ago. When I received the replacement it ran for hours on a single charge and the sound quality is great. I will most likely buy another one for another songbook, and then get another unit for another album or album project.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod Touch is a great device for getting a lot of music for a reasonable price. I purchased it because of the great deals available, but after a while of using it I can't say I'm satisfied. The quality of the speakers is great and they sound really good, but I'm finding that the buttons are often not the same color of the buttons on the old iPod. This isn't a major problem since I use the iPod Classic but I wish they would have done more to make the buttons more similar to the buttons of the original. I also find the iPod Touch to be really heavy when in the case and I can feel a little bit of pressure when pressing on the top of the iPod. I have bought several Apple products and I was hoping that this would be one of the better ones but I've found that Apple has yet to meet their own high expectations for quality. I'm disappointed that I can still use my iPod Touch but I can no longer recommend it because it isn't very good anymore.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this about a month ago for my iPad mini. I needed a new sound card because my old one broke. This is not only cheaper, but it also allows me to use my old iPad mini for music (instead of just listening to music in iTunes, which has a different quality/quality of sound than the iPod touch). It works flawlessly with the iPad mini's headphone jack. And it's very portable too, so it's great for on-the-go use.

I was a little disappointed that the controller did not have the classic GameCube controller buttons like the rest of the controllers for the system. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like my Violectric EHX pedal. I use it to make my bass sound really great and get great results. I've been using the Vio-EQ for a few years and it just gets better. I have the Bassman as well and both of those pedals are good, but the EH-X is just more versatile.    I have been using these pedals for a long time. They work well and they sound great. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that they're just a little bit hard to find.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod was a great idea. When my first iPod hit the market, I was instantly intrigued and hooked. It didn't even have a CD player or flash memory; all the songs were stored on the iPod and you had to have an Internet connection to access them.    I purchased my first one for $249 with tax.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The only problem I had with the   Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium is that the controller has to be attached using a small cable to your computer.   Unfortunately, the controller itself is very small.  In addition, the controllers that came with my   PS2 are much larger, and if I didn't know any better, I might have thought that the X-fi Titanium was the smaller unit.  If I'm ever going to upgrade my system to a USB sound card, I'll probably buy the XT.

There are only a handful of minor annoyances with the keyboard, but even then I'd give it a 4.5 out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this on Amazon because I have no use for a PC anymore, so it's my only option. The interface is smooth and easy to use. The fact that it doesn't have any built-in software means I don't have to bother with a lot of things that the Macbook does. My only problem with the interface, is that the touchpad does not have a dedicated right click button. I have to press it down every time I need to open a browser, and it doesn the same when I need a program.  This PC comes with a very simple and basic configuration:  This is the one that you should be using!   This computer has everything you need to do everything you want to do:  It comes with everything you see in the pictures and in the description. You have USB ports, and ethernet. It has a Blu-Ray drive. It comes in a beautiful blue color. It is easy to work with. The build quality is outstanding. I will recommend this to anyone who wants a computer with no compromises

When listening to music I can clearly hear what my CD player has missed.  I was really excited to get this because I love the sound from my old CD player.  The only negative is the battery life is rather short. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this for about a week now. I have a laptop that is much older than this, and this works very well. I love that it's not expensive, but it's powerful enough for anything I need. It's my go-to computer now.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's fast and it plays some good music.   I use it a lot for the phone because of the stereo output and I've heard some really good music from it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This item does what it claims to do. I don't have a high end home theatre setup (it's the first video player I own and I love it), and this one makes it easy for me to connect to my TV via S-Video and VGA (I don't own the proper RCA cable to get to my receiver but it's not necessary). You can tell that it's a quality product because it's built well. It's well balanced and the screen is bright. I used it for 2 years and it hasn't broke.  The review above is from a customer who is not a professional musician or audio engineer. It was given as a review by the customer:

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was able to get the most out of my older iPod touch and it is still a very good device. I also love that it comes with a car adapter so I can use my iPod touch as my mp3 player in my car.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm an audiophile at heart, and I have to say I'm really impressed with the sound quality of this CD player. The CD is quite good, but the sound is really great. I play it in my living room and I'm usually at home listening to music and not working. So far, I haven't heard any distortion or flutter in the sound. The only thing that I'd recommend is to play with headphones in order to hear the differences between the CD and the CD player in the CD-player. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used an old laptop to learn to program, and this little machine makes it very easy to do the same, at a tiny fraction of the price.   It has a large, backlit keyboard, and it has a touchpad, making it a joy to use.  I can also control audio using the microphone and volume buttons on the right side.  It's a small, so it's not as powerful as my laptop, but it'll do.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had the opportunity to use this unit for about three months now. The sound is good and the picture quality is excellent. I purchased this unit primarily for my wife who is a music lover. She does not like to sit in a quiet room and has a large home theater setup. This unit has made a great impression on her.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this to replace a much more expensive but much smaller laptop, and it works great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had never really been that big of an fan of the Sony Walkman, until I got the PS3.   While it isn't as loud as a CD, it is incredibly portable.  The sound is excellent.  It plays a lot of music, though.  As is often the case, you'll get a lot for your money.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great electronic device for anyone who has a few hundred bucks to spare. I have no problem running this unit for several days on a charge and it gets very warm in the center of the back. The design is very solid and the components are all solid.   The only thing I would change is the power cord and possibly the interface to allow for easier connecting with another unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a computer enthusiast and I own every piece of electronics ever made. I purchased this to replace a worn out monitor. I have used a number of brand names, but this is the best I've found. The pictures on the website make the product look amazing. The build quality is excellent. My monitor has just enough life left to see the computer screen. The only thing missing from my new monitor is a built in power source. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The X-Fi series of headphones are excellent. I have tried a number of them, and I have to say they have gotten a lot better over the years.   Their isolation is better than I expected, and their sound quality is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very happy to get this product.  This is a very powerful device.  It's very light.  I only wish it had a battery option.  For the price, I don't have to have a portable computer in the car.  But the best feature of this is the wireless technology.  If you are not using an expensive computer, but still have to go to work, this is a must-have. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This computer is a great device, especially since I have to keep the monitor and mouse. I am now able to use a mouse with my mouse pad. I was skeptical about purchasing this computer. It looks great, and I am glad that I got the upgrade to 2TB instead of one.    The only reason that I gave it a 4/5 is because the case for the computer is heavy, which I don't like. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this set a few months ago. I've always wanted to have a decent set of speakers, but wasn't able to because my wife was reluctant to spend money on me. Well, I wasn't going to spend a bunch of money on her, so I bought these speakers, which came with a nice remote. I wasn\'t disappointed, as these were pretty good for the price. I bought the 3.5mm and 6.3mm outputs, and also bought some decent speakers. There\'s enough bass for my small room, but they definitely can\'t compete with a good set of home theater speakers. I also love that there is an input for a headphone so I can get decent sound out of my ipod.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first laptop, I'm not great at computing but I am really happy with this one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only other TV on the market that comes with a tuner is the Samsung's.   When you purchase an ATSC tuner, you are getting 2 tuners for the price of 1.  It is easy to hook up to a satellite/cable box/HD cable box.  The TV looks better in person than it does on the box.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this product because I was looking for a nice small one to take with me. The sound is decent for an inexpensive product, but not as good as I expected. I had to send it back because the plug is not very flexible. The unit does come with a plastic case but the battery cover comes off easily, so be sure to remove that before you put the case back on. The amp does not work well with a lot of equipment and does not come with enough batteries for it to work all of my equipment. The fact that the batteries are sold separately is a plus and is much more convenient. I would recommend this product.

The Zune is very well made, very portable, and quite durable.  My only issue is that it was a bit difficult to find a quality wireless adapter.  But with a little effort and research, you can find a good one for pretty much any device.  I'm hoping the Bluetooth adapter I got will work well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's good to find a reliable, powerful and affordable compact that is easy to use. The screen is very clear and easy to see. The only issue I had was with the volume. While you can hear the music, it's a bit muffled.   The other minor complaints about this device is that there is no way to choose the audio input so if you use a lot of mp3 or mp4, it might not be a good thing.

I was very surprised by the accuracy of the document formatting, and the keyboard is very responsive.  The only downside is the price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I own a computer (iMac for the Mac community). However, I am also an avid gamer.   My favorite game right now is "Dota 2" (I own the "DOTA 1" Collector's Edition). I got this unit with the intent to use it for a gaming/workstation for my personal use.  Since I had a couple of other "gaming" items laying around (a "GeForce GTX 680" and an "Alienware Alpha") I thought it was worth the price.  This is easily the best computer I have ever owned and it's worth every penny.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received the first model of this little receiver the other day and can't get over how nice it is to have a set of receiver you can plug in and go for up to a week.  I don't have a receiver that has an HDMI input, so this was my first foray into a home theater receiver.   The receiver is built solidly.  It looks good with a few scratches on the front but other than that, it looks and functions very well.  The ability to use my iPhone as a remote or input has helped with the integration of these devices.  So far, I'm very pleased with this purchase.

It has a nice volume knob and the speakers work well but not too loud. The battery life is very good though.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the compact size and ease of use of this item. I was a bit reluctant to buy it as it is more expensive than other small radios, but after trying it out, it fits well in the house, the voice chat is very clear and you do not feel like you have to listen to it all the time. I bought it because I need to make phone calls or have someone answer my phone in case something happens to my cell phone.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from I was looking at the smaller version for a while, but I was so excited for this one I bought the larger one......and that model is now no longer available. I purchased the smaller model for my wife's business and after a couple months of it working flawlessly, I decided to get the larger model and had to call to cancel......now I have two broken radios! I would not recommend this product, especially if you don't need to be able to call.

I am very pleased with it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit has some drawbacks.   First of all, the built-in speaker is pretty weak, and has a very dull sound to it.  When I listen to music in my car and the speakers get so close to the windshield that I can barely hear what's going on, the only thing that really works is the bluetooth.  However, when I use the unit in my home studio, I don't notice the speaker issues at all.  Another small drawback is the fact that the unit is a little tight around my neck (I have long hair).  The last downside is that it doesn't have a memory slot, and you have to connect it over a USB cable for its memory function.  Overall, this is a great unit if you need an external hard drive, but I wouldn't pay a lot of money to buy one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A great way to organize my files is to have a small, but well made portable computer on my keychain. A couple years ago I bought a Sony Vaio to replace the aging, but still working, MacBook.

It's solid, and if you buy it, you won't regret it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using the computer mouse as my primary computer mouse for years and love it. When the new mouse comes out, I'll be buying it. The keyboard and touchpad work well, and the new design (with a new design that doesn't look like a box) is great.   My only problem is the cost. I have a MacBook Pro, which is a great laptop, but the one I received with the mouse is so ugly and expensive that I feel like a fool spending money for a mouse that is clearly inferior to a keyboard that is much more capable and comfortable to use.  It's worth noting that I don't use the mouse much.  This is mostly due to my new MacBook Pro and the fact that I'm on a tight budget. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought these as I am not a tech person, but I am now so glad that I did!

My old Yamaha keyboard works perfectly on the computer with all the buttons and everything but my new keyboard is very stable and can take a lot of hits with the keys. It took me a long time to understand how it all worked but it is finally working great!

When I bought the Sonotube, I got a good deal because I was able to get the sound bar for a fraction of the price.  The best part is that I am able to have multiple sets of speakers all connected to my Macbook Pro.  I'll definitely be purchasing Sonotubes from Soundbars.net in the future.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my 3rd VTC6 model, first I bought with the USB cable, then with a dongle with a power supply, and now this with a 3.5mm to standard audio jack.   First I'm really glad this works for the DAW, especially with the DPDT switch.  It really lets me use this on a Mac, but still allows the flexibility to use a headphone amp.  The only drawback is that it does have 2 extra pins, but at least now I have a nice place for the cable so I can remove it without having to do a messy soldering job.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used a Mac computer for years.  I have a USB keyboard and mouse and use these keyboards for my music production.   These keyboards are pretty much ideal.  They have excellent wireless technology ( I have two of them and they are always connected to my computer ) and the keys are a bit too big but this is not a problem if you just use them for music production and not gaming.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound is really nice, the volume is adjustable and the features are pretty handy. I bought a replacement for my old one after a while and this one still sounds good, except that it's only 1/8 inch jack instead of 1/4. It's a big improvement, but not enough to buy a full size unit and try out the feature set.

There are some things I still need to clean the dongle to make it "smoother" and a bit more powerful but that's the whole point of having an online adapter so you don't need to have a special dongles.

The remote was easy to use and the remote control worked flawlessly.  A remote is also included if you want to use a different remote.  I bought this, because I was bored at my friends house and didn't have enough hours to watch the entire season of Breaking Bad in one night, so this will do for me. I also purchased the HDMI cable to make watching on my TV easier and this worked perfectly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very nice product.   It has the features I need.  It keeps my ipod or mp3 player charged.  I have found that many music streaming services charge $10 a month or more for a single mp3 device,  When using this product, I can stream music for free or only $2.  The mp3 and music streaming is very good,  The quality is very close to digital.  Also very durable.  If you have an   ipod/mp3 player or another mp3  player and you have had a loss of   audio due to bad batteries,  this may be the product for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the HD-300s a few months ago. It is a wonderful, very portable recorder. The best part is that it can be used to record vocals, piano, or guitar. I like the way that you can record your drum fills and make a "groove mix" for an audio engineer. I have also used it to record some live drumming. It's a great value.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this item because the one I had had a broken screen (after being used for a few months). I didn't expect it to have a working display, but I was wrong. This one is just as easy to use as the one with a broken display (no flicking to change channels or volume or anything), but it comes with a nicer carrying case.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Works great...only problem is you can only get it in black This was a great product and is very easy to set up. The only problem is, you can't get it at Home Depot. I was very excited to have this when I bought it, I am happy to say that I will be getting a second one. I do wish that they offered an option to get this in black. I used this to run my old tube TV, and it works great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first wireless keyboard. I like that it has no key caps, and a few of the extra keys (like the backspace key) are useful. The key-pad is not particularly good, though, and there's a very slight delay between each key. I also have the mechanical keyboard, but I prefer the wireless keyboard's convenience.

The only thing I don't like about it is the remote control. I'd rather have a touch screen for playing songs. However, it's the only remote I can play music from. I'm sure that's why the Apple music store has such a good selection of songs. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very happy with this keyboard, I've been using it for a while now and I love it  I bought a few of the smaller models over the years but I've wanted a full size keyboard for a long time and this has come very close to the one I've always wanted. The design of the switches, the keys, the feel of the keys and the keycap style is all fantastic. This is my second keyboard so far but I don't think I'll be changing my ways anytime soon, it has made me happy for many years now.

After looking around on line, I found the CD player and the remote control.

I've already recommend this product to my friends.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had this game for the first time and it worked flawlessly. I really like how it lets you change the size of the screen so you can watch movies, TV shows etc. I had the joystick controller so that worked well. I was soooo surprised that the music was great. I love the game.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Zavala from Awesome Game! I have played many console games over the years. This game is the one that stands out. I have the Dreamcast version and I can't get over how good this game is! There is a reason for that. The controls are really nice as well as the games graphics, and there is nothing I can say I don't like about this game. If you are a fan of games and have the money to spend, buy this game! I played this game on the original PS2 and it was great!  Reviewed using a PS4 and 3DS.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound of this amp is great, and I used to have a solid-state one that sounded pretty nice too. It's a nice change of pace from the tube amps, and it does a good job of driving the speakers. If you want something that's compact and portable, the V-2 has everything I want in an amp.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The headphones are great. I am a sound engineer and a music lover, so these are essential for me. They are pretty expensive though.   I also love the fact that they are small and portable.  The good: The sound is good, but a bit lacking.  This is because there is only one sound signature, and the headphones can sound a bit dull when compared to the competition, and for some people, they can sound tinny at low volumes.  If you're a dedicated audiophile who is looking for something a little more full-bodied and refined, these will not disappoint.  It may not sound as good as the Sennheiser HD650 or Bose QC35, but it is still a very good product and I'll recommend them to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new Apple laptop with Retina display is an incredible piece of engineering.   It is incredibly thin, light, fast, and responsive.  The Mac mini is also excellent.  A very nice touchpad is good for navigating the desktop without the mouse but when I was looking at my large document and wanted to quickly navigate with the mouse, the trackpad is a no go.  In addition, a new feature that I like is the "taste menu" on the trackpads.  It allows you to choose what your keyboard will feel like when you press down the left/right key and then to change it.  I have found that this makes the typing on the new trackpad a little easier to use.  There are other features on the Mac mini but I am using the Retina, so I can't say much about it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this speaker for over a year now and I cannot rave about the quality.  My speaker works as a subwoofer for my TV.  I put the TV and speakers in the same room for the best sound.  When you turn it on, you get loud.  The remote is easy to use.  You do have to keep the batteries in the box.  It does take awhile to get it going but the sound is pretty good.  There is no music that I can't get from my TV, so I guess the sound has to do with what you like.    Rated 4 out of 5 by S. from Love it I am very happy with this product. I've had my speaker a year and it still works great. I'm sure it will last for years to come.  From the reviews, you can see this speaker does not come with a remote. You are given instructions to use the included remote with your TV. The instructions on how to use it as a surround sound system is not included with the box and is included in the DVD. It comes with a speaker cable and power cord, so you need to supply these with the included instructions as they are very detailed. This is not the first time I purchased this product, but it has been a little over a decade since I bought it, so it's time to give it a second chance. I would recommend this product if you want to get a good quality sound system for less than a new surround sound speaker.

I have used several high end headphones, and this one is much more pleasing to listen to than any of them. I use it mostly for home audio. I can use the soundcard and use other digital sources with ease, but I do have a few programs that I use for gaming.   The fact that it is USB powered makes it a nice alternative for people who want a portable player. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound is good and quality of the sound is excellent for a portable.   I am using this in my bedroom so I can listen to music at my ease.  The buttons are easy to access and easy to use.  I recommend this as a nice product at a very good price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased my first computer this year and so far its running perfectly. This was the second time I purchased a computer online from the site. The price was perfect and the delivery was very quick. The purchase process was easy and the item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I recommend to anyone who wants an easy to use computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this DAC for about 4 months. I have it plugged into my Yamaha RX-100, and it's excellent. I've been playing a lot of jazz, so I need to be able to hear the big band parts with my headphones. And the sound of my RX-200 is good for me, so this is great.    The new version of the DAC-300 is a huge improvement over its predecessor. For me, the performance of the original was quite good, but the new version is much better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this as a replacement to a broken Samsung Smart TV with built in internet. This device has worked perfectly for my needs.   The sound quality on my unit is amazing, as are the picture.  Very satisfied.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device as an adjunct to my music collection. As far as sound quality and features, it's very good.  It's got a very rich and warm sound, and the control on the dial can be fiddly in the wrong setting. However, the only flaw is the sound quality with my Sony headphones. They have a small bit of distortion, as well as a little hiss.  The sound is nice, and I enjoy listening to it on the couch.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the Bose QuietComfort 25 and I'm very happy with the sound quality and the fact that it's noise-canceling.   For those of you with headphones that don't have the same type of noise-blocking built-in, this is the product for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device works very well, and is super easy to use, but the only reason I am giving this 4 stars is that the audio quality on the TV (Satellite) is much better than the sound quality on my computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the first time I have seen an electronic device with such good sound quality.  I also like how small it is.  This unit allows me to listen to music when I'm not using my   television and this unit makes it even easier.   My daughter is happy when she can hear her music on the TV.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Dan from Good Sound and Sound Quality I have bought a few of these over the years and they always sound great. My only real gripe is that it is a little more difficult to get the remote in the unit. I usually just lift the lid and it's easy enough to get in.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Ipod does exactly what it says on the box. I like that there is a mute button too, so I can not hear the radio but also it is very comfortable to listen to in my car.   Also the speaker sounds good in my cars and it gets the job done. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love that it has a CD player and a modem.   The only downside is that when using my home computer I have to use the sound on the CD player to hear the music.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a big fan of this laptop. It does not have an optical drive but it does have an excellent battery life. It is very slim and light. It even fits in my backpack. I do wish that the trackpad worked as well as the keyboard for all windows-based programs, but I get over that quickly.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The battery lasted about 3 months without a charge. The audio and controls are great, so for me that was a huge plus. I just wish the keyboard had been bigger.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am in love with my Sony Walkman, and with this one too. It's smaller than other digital players, but it's a real workhorse for listening to music. It gets pretty warm when the music is loud (and it can't quite make up its mind as to whether to stay in your ear or pop the whole thing out).   You do have to turn the volume on the player up to make it pop out of your ear.   It is a little noisy, and the sound is not quite as great as when it's just a regular old cassette player. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod Touch has great value and good sound quality. I have 2 of them and find the 2nd unit, the "new" one, is more suited for playing music and the first is better for browsing and surfing. I had been using my iPad 2 for my iPod but needed a device with more capacity. I am glad I have found my new favorite device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality is great for this price range. The battery life is better than expected. If you have a set of speakers already and don't need an amp, the quality is very good for $150.   This is very light weight, but the price of the speakers is steep.  I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a decent, lightweight sound system for under $200.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The X5 is perfect,   I'm not sure if I would have gotten it   if the price hadnt been so high.   This   is definitely a good buy     I'm glad that this item is available as a replacement for the X5. It is the first time I've used a 3rd party adapter to be able to use my Sony SACD (sound recorder) from the X3/X5 and was surprised how much better it was than using a generic external DAC like the one provided with the X1.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not happy with this I use the Sony DSP to record audio on the X6, but it doesn't work with the SACDs on the new X5 (and I'm sure it doesn�t work with older Sony devices). I'd hate to have to buy a brand new SACDA just so I could use it on my X5, but I don't like having to buy one of these adapters so I can use Sony stuff.  a different adapter that works better would have been nice  Very nice adapter but not a match for the S-ADPCM I'm using on the Sony X6. I wanted to get the X7 to use the DSP as well. I can record audio from an MP3 player that supports AptX, but not the new Sony. I would buy another adapter for my Sony devices and save money.  at least another adapter will solve that problem
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this because my computer (taken in good condition) couldn't power up on my 3rd or 4th attempt to install it.   It is easy to use.  There are no drivers for windows, so i downloaded the windows 10 one that comes with it. But it does the same thing, so I am using it now. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my 3rd iPod Touch.  I bought the black color but they did not come with the white one.  The design is perfect.  If you don't like your old   iPhones look this one will be perfect for you.  It has the same buttons and it is very lightweight.    I don't use it with other music apps but it is great with this one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a 3rd generation   (the new model is good)   because my old   wasn't working very well. I had it in for repair but I received a call   from a person who said it had been stolen and that the police were on their way. He asked me to call back in a couple   days to check   out. I took the repair guy   aside and said I would take care of the problem   myself. The next day the old  (broken) was working   and the new one was installed    the next day. The only down   is the old has no cable management so you have to remove the power cord every time you plug something in.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this item for a special occasion. As the title says, this thing is great! I didn't have a need for a Bluetooth keyboard and I have to say that it works better than the keyboard on my old Nokia 800. It's very light, it looks very cool and you can also use it as a track pad on your computer. I'm a software developer, so I need to use a keyboard for code editing, but I will definitely buy this again for any occasion.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought these for my brother as a birthday present. He said it was so much fun that he can't get enough of it. The light is really bright, and the ability to adjust the brightness is awesome. I got mine for my birthday as well, and I've already given a lot of it away. This particular unit is a bit heavy, but it's still very handy and really easy to use. I can't wait to get my sister one when she gets her own one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used this item many times and have had a great time.   The item is very good quality.  My only complaint is the "wiggle button" that allows you to slide the cable out of the device.  It is a bit annoying to have to go to the side of the unit to turn it off.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this keyboard on my home computer for all the music I play. Its small size means I can fit two on the desk (and more if needed) and it is loud enough so I can hear the music without having to turn up the volume. Also it is easy to operate with the touch pad for changing tracks/muting.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This portable turntable is quite nice.   The sound is much better than my last record player.  I love my old records and the only record player that could play them was on the other side of the room.  After a few minutes of listening to my new vinyl collection the needle has skidded onto the record and the needle is now spinning.  The only problem is that I cannot get the needle to stop on the record if the record is too noisy.  A great feature for a good portable turtrometer

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is beautiful. I love that I can listen to music without having to use a computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this to use with my old computer that's a little bit outdated. I've been using this for two weeks now, and I'm very impressed with it.   It's so easy to use that I don't even need a mouse to use it. Also, the design is nice.  I've installed several applications that require a mouse, and this one works as well as the other mice that I have.  The only thing I'm not thrilled with is that this is a rechargeable battery, not a lithium battery like I usually buy.  That being said, I haven't had any problems and have used it a lot more than I had expected. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've just replaced my PC and I've had the Dell for about 3 weeks. The keyboard is a bit stiff but its ok.  The screen is pretty good.  I'm just tired of all the bloatware and crap they shove down our throats.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this keyboard a few weeks ago to help me learn how to use my mechanical keyboard. I found it very convenient to use. I was surprised at how easy it was to navigate the keyboard. The keys are spaced very well and there is a very nice feel in the key presses. It has a very solid feel to it when you have it in your hand. The key caps are nice, however, I wish they had some more character. They're not very bright.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The power cord is very long and bulky and it takes quite a bit of getting used to. However, the keyboard and mouse work extremely well.   Although the sound is a little bit tinny, the unit is very quiet. The cable is easily removed.  I do not like the design, as it's too big for my case. I've always disliked my computer case.  However, as an addition to my existing case, this is great!   I have my computer with a motherboard on one side and my case on the other, so this is perfect.  I'm very happy with my purchase. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned the V3s for 2 months now.  The noise is low and the bass is very well balanced.  It also has a nice touch screen for a handheld.   The only thing I would like to see is a USB port on the front of the unit to charge my devices.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my new mp3 player. The only thing I don't like is that the player can't support the very high sound quality it can produce. But hey, that's why I purchased the player - so I can hear the music I love as well as the music that is out there now.    I bought this mp3 players as replacements for my previous speakers.  I am very happy with the sound quality.  The speakers are not really loud, and are not very big for my room, but they get the job done.  My old speakers were in a big living room, and were a bit small, which I had to buy new speakers because they got very uncomfortable.  This new player is much more compact than the old speakers and does a much better job of putting out sound. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This product is amazing for what it does. I bought this because it would be cheaper then buying the original Samsung DVD player. I found it at a really good price and was able to get 2 DVD's and the cd. Thats really all there is to it.   I would highly recommend this to anyone, the only thing I'd change is that you have to remove the DVD drive and then put it in another box ( I think a plastic one) and then you have the issue with the drive coming off ( but then again its easier to buy another one).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very compact, sturdy, reliable, and well built portable music player. I have the older model with the 1/2" connector but I switched to the 3/8" for the 3-button pad and to save some weight. It's an excellent choice!   My son plays his guitar and I play some acoustic stuff. The player has the ability to use the included cables for both instruments but I really liked using the 1" for my guitar and the 3" for whatever I had on the sound system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was an excellent purchase, as the first time I purchased a guitar pedal I fell in love with this thing. The sound is great, you get a very wide range of tones, and the controls are easy to use. The only problem is that you have to take apart the pedals that come with the guitar and solder wires to a power jack. This can be frustrating when you've already spent $100 or more on the guitar itself.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as an upgrade from my old iPod for my older son who prefers to listen to music on his smart phone.   The songs he likes on his phone are not only compressed, but also a bit muddy sounding.  The sound of this iPod is much more balanced and natural sounding. It is also nice that I don't have to use an external speaker to get sound out of my iPod (my old iPod had a small sound-box that made all the songs sound like they were coming out of a boom box).   My only negative would be that I wish the screen could display the song title and song artist better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The most comfortable device I have ever owned.   This is not a good thing, but a great thing, if your new to the idea of computers.

The fact that you have to use a power strip, and you lose the cable for the mouse, is unfortunate.   A good computer for the money. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my new desktop PC and I like it. I have an old laptop but I just love my laptop, the one on which I wrote the review. It is so easy to set up and I love the ability to move the whole hard drive out of the computer and have it be an external hard drive in case I get lost or need it in the future. Also, since I have a wireless keyboard and mouse I can just use the mouse in another room and not have to take my laptop with me. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device worked fine. I needed a keyboard and track pad and was told these were not in stock. That was ok since it worked. It took me some time to figure out how to type on it but I got it. The only thing is, the screen doesn't have a backlight (unless you go to the BIOS).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the best digital device I have used. It's so much easier to connect with my computer than the USB mouse/keyboard combo that came with my old one. My wife uses it to watch movies on the couch and it makes for a much more enjoyable experience.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had an older Samsung Tab 2 laptop that was getting rather old. The new Chromebook with all its extras was great. It is lightweight and easy to carry around. The screen is crisp, and the touchpad is great. I had never used a Chromebook before, and now that I have, I can't believe how much better it is than my old laptop.    Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great tablet for an affordable price! I bought the Acer C720p because the other products I have tried have not been up to my high standards. So far I love it! The performance is great and I'm a tablet person. I am not a big fan of touchpads and this one feels like it has great touchpad buttons. My only complaint is the battery life...it takes quite a bit of battery juice to do the screen brightness up and down, as well as adjust volume. I like the fact that you can get a charge out of it with a micro-USB cable or the included wall charger. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have a dedicated card reader.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very nice compact electronic device. I purchased it to make a small home theater. I could watch movies on it, it was very quiet and it is small enough that it could easily fit in the backseat of my car.   I really like the fact that the sound comes from both the front and the back speakers so it is easy to balance the sound.  It does a good job keeping the volume very high and keeping the sound clean and easy to hear. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used this as my personal CD player for the last 4 months. I was so skeptical that the sound quality was all it's cracked up to be and i had to try it out. I love it.   This is a great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this for my home theater to replace a very expensive sound card that I wanted to get rid of. I had a Sony CDP-200 and I thought it was a bit overpriced for the quality that I got with this one. I also found the HDMI cables somewhat flimsy and they were getting pretty short, which made them not a very good value for what I paid. I got a HDHomeRun C300 which seems to be a better solution overall and I plan on getting a Roku as well, but for now this is what I have.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is great and it's much less expensive than an average laptop.   I like that I can access all my music on the go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm a professional writer, and I've been using a Pico for more than a year.   It's an incredibly useful device with no drawbacks.  The paper quality is the best I've ever seen in an office.  My workstation has a good amount of writing surface, and the Pico is the perfect size to fit comfortably in there.  I also like that I can use the Piconet to write on the back of the paper itself.  This is especially handy when I need to take notes without the need to carry another device around.  While I have found some minor imperfections on the paper, I believe the vast majority of them are from poor photocopying.  As a side note, the Picanet is a very well made device.  It is incredibly stable.  For $130, this is a bargain.  Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first set up from Bose. I'm very happy with it. It's very easy to set up, and the sound is really good. I purchased this device to pair with my soundbar which was also purchased from BOSE.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first time doing a review, and my first one about an Apple product.  I am an Apple fan since the 80s, and was looking for a new tablet but didn't want to spend a lot on it.  This was the best deal I found at the time.   I was looking to get a 7"  laptop for around the same price, so I thought it was worth a try.  The size is great for reading.  A lot of tablet sizes  can be bigger, but this one  is very similar to   my iMac, so there is a lot of overlap.  In addition, this   has an SD card reader so you can keep the same books you read on your    iPhone.  So, I am very happy with my choice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have just purchased an   HiFiBerry DAC for my   PC. As much as I love   vinyl, I had found that the CDs I   was playing often had   a lack of soundstage or depth in their sound. I bought this   DAC   to replace my CD player, but I really did not expect this to be   an improvement. The sound of this device is   very accurate, warm and smooth.   It   does not   sound too harsh, however you will   find yourself wanting more in the depth or soundstage areas.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have bought 3 of these boxes, and each one was an excellent purchase. I like the fact that I can't easily take apart the box for storage or to wash. It is also really easy to set up and take apart, especially because all the parts are on one side (which makes it less prone to damage).   Also, each box is made of good quality plastic.   Overall, I really enjoy owning these boxes.

So I am happy that there is an adapter now.  Good juice The juice is great and the price is good.  for the price you cant go wrong!  Excellent! I just received this last week, and it's a really good juice. , it tastes exactly like the flavor i got at my local vapeworld, i got a flavor I've never had before, it's really a nice tobacco flavour with a hint of sweetness.  and the bottle is pretty good too. i like that it's in a nice bottle and it comes with an ejuice dropper and screw cap, my next purchase  Great taste! Great taste!  (Reviewed on a good e-liquid, not a bad one!)  My FAV one Love this juice! Love the taste, not over powering, sweet and a little bit of tobacco. . The price is really good for the flavor  I liked it. Nice tobacco taste.  I thought it tasted good on a tank that does not allow me to get as good of a taste in my tank as I want. :D  Vape Wild should make it available in 15/50 ohms.  by the way i did like it. but it was really not a good all day vape.  as a smoker i dont care for tobacco tastes, so it could be a good option for those who like a flavored tobacco vape and want something to enjoy all day. silly me  Fantastic! I have ordered this flavor twice now and I am quite satisfied both times. I'm not huge on tobacco flavors but the strawberry and cherry are definitely on point. I am planning on getting more of this in the future. I wish the flavor strength was a little higher. This is a definite favorite!  is an awesome vape with the perfect amount of sweetness and tobacco! -Mike  A Must Try This is my go to juice for anything that has a taste. Sweet, slightly sweet, and slightly tobacco. I've got it in all kinds of mods from ego to tank and have enjoyed every drop. Great taste.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Soundman S200 is a sound card that I use all the time.   As the title implies, it's a "sound card" for the digital interfaces, not the audio interface.  It has its ups and downs, and some of the better stuff on the market is actually more expensive, but it's perfect for what I need.  I use it with my Yamaha RX-V7 and Sony WM-V3 and it is perfect for both, as long as you are willing to live with its limitations.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It takes a lot of power to run a PC, so for most people this isn't a good option for their PC.   The only reason I had to replace it was that the power brick had to be replaced, which is a real bummer.  But, for the price it's a great buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the first and second generation of these. The first one has two separate inputs, with separate output connectors. It's nice to have the separate outputs (not a necessity, but nice) and it helps prevent noise and hum in my gear (I have all kind of gear). I also like having the "buzz" that the amp makes when it runs hard (as opposed to the standard high-gain sound it makes when playing). However, the second one is missing the noise filter (but you can still hear it when running at full volume, so that's not a big deal). I still like having separate outputs though, but the second generation has lost the feature that allows me to connect my own pedals and get a great crunch sound.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this about a month ago and have already installed it. This device is awesome! I have had an iPad for years, but I have never been able to use it while on the go due to my crappy phone reception and poor signal. I had been looking for a device that would replace my phone, but this one does everything an iPad could do and it looks so much more appealing. It is well constructed and easy to operate. I like that it is wireless and that it comes with all of the apps that I wanted. I have been using this for over a month now and I don't have a single problem with it at all. I highly recommend this device if you are a tablet owner who wants a better looking device than the one you have.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been looking for a quality, inexpensive portable CD player for quite a while now and this has it beat hands down, and in many respects even beats my old CD player which was far more expensive and not of good quality. The player is really durable, the built-in CD player is better than my old one, and the speaker is quite good. There are a couple of quirks, such as the button being near the center of the player, and it does get hot (but not nearly as hot as my old player), but for a portable CD, that's not a problem at all.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's got a ton of storage space, good wireless range (which I was surprised), great sound quality (although the high pass filter makes for a lot of noise), and an awesome feature set. I've been looking for a good phone that could replace my older phone for a long time, and this is it. I'm happy with it.     Rated 5 out of 5 by Dan from A very good product that does it all  I am very impressed with the audio quality and overall device design. As for the other issues I listed: - The battery seems weak and won't last as long as I am going to use it. - I don't like the way it looks because it's just a phone. There should be an option to do an "all in one" like the iPod. - The built in speaker is ok, but there are better phones available. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The speakers are a nice plus for the money. The power button is on the right, while the volume buttons are on the left.   I like having to push a button for power, since the headphone jack is on top of the machine, and that's usually not a feature I like.  The sound is a bit muffled in the bass area, but I like that.  It's a little loud though. I prefer speakers with more low end.  I have an iPod mini, and it's louder than my MacBook. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a new computer for my daughter. She really wanted to go on vacation with it, so we decided to get it for her before we headed off.  The computer came in, and we did everything we needed to. The only problems we had was a power cord that came with the computer that was not long enough, and the hard drive (my daughter's favorite thing to watch) was scratched.  Overall, I have had this computer for over a year and have had no issues with it.

For this price I wouldn't expect the same and if you are considering this machine it's well worth the money.

The volume controls have a spring in them and it is very stiff.  The only way to get a good volume sound out of this unit was to hit the volume button a few times.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The most amazing thing about the Soundboy is the quality of its sound.   It sounds like a real bass, and it's a lot of fun to use.  It's a good introduction to the world of "snoops."  I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Toshiba T5530FX-SXN2 which was a little over 10 years old when I bought it in February 2008 for an extra $100 after a few failed repairs.  This is the one I got from eBay for $50 less, I had bought a Toslink from eBay in the past but was a bit hesitant to spend $150 on the Toslink after hearing some stories about how their cables are not as good as the Toshiba.  My Toslink does not even have the original Toslink manual (in Spanish) with the parts lists and troubleshooting information but it does have a working hard drive.  I used it mainly for my personal computer as the old computer was running slow.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only con for this is that it is pretty loud (it's not as loud as my last one, but it still can be really annoying). However, the other features are really good: The battery life is great (it lasts for 3 days, which is a huge deal for me) and the wireless connection is amazing.   The Good:  Great audio quality, very clear, clean and deep The built-in battery lasts for days, so you can travel all day long without the need of an extra charger. It doesn't drain your phone like an external battery, and you can just plug it into a charger and take it with you.  The battery is removable, and if you are like me and only have one battery, you can replace it for $10   and be fully charged, or you can buy two batteries and only pay $2.50 a piece.  It's lightweight, and it's very convenient because you don't have to be worried about the battery dying at home.    The Not So Good: Not as small and portable as I expected It's not a tablet because it's not thin, and its design is pretty clunky and flimsy It has the same design as my old tablet, and although I love my old one, it just felt so much more solid and sturdy, which the E5 doesn't have at all.  I still wish I got the E4, but with the E3 being discontinued, I might have to wait a bit longer for this one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought two of these to go with my new gaming computer.  The quality and noise of the speakers is really good.  It has a lot of inputs, which I really like, and I use my old computer's speakers instead of my laptop speakers to get an amazing surround sound experience.  I am going to try to get a cheap external audio device to replace the one in my computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had my K3 for just over a month now, and the sound and battery life are great. I haven't used it much yet, but I've already found it easy to listen to music, especially the music on Spotify, as it's just loud enough to be good.  The best thing about the K3 is the price, especially with the Koss PortaPods and wireless Beats headphones included.   Also, the fact that Koss is back making good headphones again, makes me happy!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the CX-3 from EBay.com in August 2005. This device is really good. It takes pictures and videos very good. The only thing I didn't like was the built-in camera. It's a bit big and the quality of the picture is pretty bad. However, the microphone works very well, so I use it. I also liked the ability to set the flash and the built in flash. I do wish the camera was more user-friendly. The price is reasonable, as well as the number of features and the ease of use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality is better than the speakers of the Bose and the speakers can get loud but are still pretty quiet at about 70 db's.  The only negative thing is that the volume and noise level is only on when you are using the remote. I was hoping that the ear buds would have been the same.  My only criticism is that these are not built like the BOSE. The plastic feels cheap. And the earbuds don't sound very good.  This device doesn't need a power cord. I am disappointed because I expected a better product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this a few days ago, but it is good so far. It has the sound on, even though I have my speaker set to sound only one way. The buttons are a nice size for my hands. The sound quality seems good, but I wish it had the ability to adjust the volume and select a different sound.   The only con for me is that the power supply has to be plugged in when using it (even though I can get my laptop power supply to work), which is annoying.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a big fan of this laptop. I bought the "L" version because of the larger drive. I have a small workstation at home, but I was concerned about the speed of the "P" version. When I got the laptop, I noticed it was built extremely well. The laptop is very quiet. It's very stable and stable enough for me. I was worried about the keyboard because I have used a couple different types of keyboards before, but they work well on this laptop and they're also quiet. I like that they come with the type of cable you need to use the laptop as well. I'm really happy with this purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this as a backup laptop for my work computer, so it was a big surprise when the price went up and I wanted a new laptop. It is good quality. The built-in speakers are loud, and the build quality is excellent. However, I'd like to see the power button removed, or at least on a different axis. Also, I'm not sure if the battery is replaceable, but I wouldn't mind having one in there if it ever breaks.

I use it every day, with a large file library, and it does it well.  (Posted on 12/22/10)  Excellent product, excellent customer service! By Stephen - St. Charles, IL (Verified Purchaser) Product: Knob Smokers 3 Piece - 3x25 Cube I just received my 3x3x25 cube and am very pleased. The packaging was excellent. It was neatly packaged in a small box that has an attached label. I opened it up in a friend's office and found it in great shape. The cube was completely assembled and the instructions were in good order. There was no need to use glue, I did not need to glue the stickers to the back of the cube. The construction of the puzzle is very good and the stickers are easy to apply. There are a lot of little things that I like about this cube, but in the end, the weight is not my number one concern. In terms of the construction, the pieces fit together nicely and the cube is quite smooth to flip. This is not the type of cube that has a very high quality feel to it, it is quite light and feels good in the hand. I would highly recommend this cube if you like a good feeling piece of cube and a nice construction.

It comes with a power adapter, which is nice because it isn't hard to plug in if you're running out of power.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this as a Christmas gift. The sound is clear and clear. The built-in speaker makes the volume of the music louder than the other music I have. The controls are easy to use. The cord is long enough that I have it plugged in the back of my computer. The only thing that I am not happy with is the case that came with it is very thin, and the bottom has a hole that is only there because it is holding the case together. That being said, it is worth the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This little gem of an MP3 player has plenty of features and is very easy to set up.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the way it's packaged.  You get it, but the packing is awful!  The CD player needs to be boxed separately so the whole thing can be stowed away in the CD tray, or better yet, the player needs more padding around the top of the player so it doesn't topple over when you put it down.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My HP desktop works well for this price point, but it has some issues. First, the HP Desktop is not backwards compatible with the CD burner from another HP machine. It works fine on my desktop, but the CD drive on my HP desktop won't recognize the CD unless I run it directly through the Windows media player, or a program like WinMAudio. (This is just a limitation of the CD format, and not a design flaw in the HP product.)  Secondly, the power supply for my desktop is unreliable, and it would occasionally shut down due to a poor connection or something going wrong in the computer. (If I plug the desktop into the wall, and plug it into another AC power outlet in the living room, the computer powers on and remains operational.)  Third, and this may be the only downside of this computer for me, it is a little bit loud. The sound from my HP is decent, but I prefer the sound from a desktop computer, like the Toshiba Tecra E4200. Posted by Brian G. at 12:53 AM I am currently using my HP laptop as my work computer (I work for an information technology company, and have been using an HP for about 4 years). This laptop runs so smoothly and has so many good features (very low power consumption, good keyboard, amazing display, and very good keyboard management, etc.). I do have one problem though with my laptop: the optical drive is very slow. If I connect my DVD drive to the computer, it transfers a DVD at just over 2 MB/s. The same DVD takes about 4 seconds to do the same thing with my external DVD drive.  This is a major problem because my system is running on a small 32 GB hard drive that is only 1.2 TB in capacity (I bought it on a whim because I needed to replace my old drive before my new laptop arrived). With that being said, the price of my HP has been very good, and I would recommend it to anyone who can live with the slow optical drive.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a fantastic piece of electronic gear that is very well made. It has a very solid feel and is easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this for the first time in the store and I was not let down! Great sound quality, easy to connect to my  iPhone and great volume and the screen is beautiful. My wife thinks its a really good design. I will most definitely be buying more from Best Buy in the future!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The USB to serial converter was very useful.   I plugged the converter into a Raspberry PI (raspberry pi is a cheap    computer, but the cost of the software   , the USB cable, and the adapters are all quite expensive) and the software was easy to use and     easy to set up.  The USB port on the Raspberry PI is broken.  If you have this,   You need to replace it before you can use it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this to use as my music player but can't believe I did it!!  It's super loud and clear for my car stereo,  It only has three buttons, which is amazing as it allows me to press three buttons while my hands are full on my phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this a few weeks ago and it is great.   It has good battery life and a lot of features.  It's a nice sound and has a great price.  I like it more than my old one (which was just a crappy sound machine and wasn't that good to begin with).  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using a Sony PXW-FS7, the newer and better of the PX series of drives, for several months now, and so far have been very pleased with it.   Its size is about the same size as my PX100, so that's a big plus for me.  The PX has excellent compression and a very high noise figure (the only one I have heard that comes close is the Toshiba).   The drive has very good read/write performance and has good performance in almost all of my programs.  This drive seems to work great in my HTPC for playing music and other types of multimedia.  My only complaint is that the USB connector is a little hard to use on my desktop, but not a big deal.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the most accurate timepiece I have ever owned. I do have a few issues with the face of the watch, but that's a small price to pay for the most precise time I have used since I got my first pocket watch nearly 50 years ago.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best part of the console is the large capacity internal flash storage, which allows you to keep all your media on it at once, even if you need to get a new game on a sudden release day. You also have access to all your games in the cloud. Great!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After using this, I am now able to play my digital piano music on my iPod. The best part, is that the cable that comes with it is so long that I was able to plug it in to my sound system and have a cable from there to my piano.   I hope to own one in the near future.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Sennheiser HD 250 for the purpose of a home theater setup for my girlfriend. For the price, I don't see why you wouldn't get one. It is easy to use, and is also a very good sounding headphone, just like its bigger brother, the HD 400.   If you are looking for an entry level set of headphones, then I recommend this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use an old IBM PC-Jr. It has been running for more than 15 years and is in excellent condition. The only complaint I have is the mouse: it's a real pain to move the cursor around. The other features, though, are perfect: I can use the disk drive to write/compress data and the keyboard to make phone calls.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased a couple of Apple earbuds and have tried them out.  It is very nice having all the controls right in front of you.  A few things need to be cleaned up.  The button and the cable need to come out completely.  I used a dremel tool on them and it's nice to be able to clean them.  Overall, I'm happy with the earbud. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought these earphones back in 2011, back when i needed a pair, and they worked just great! The sound is good, and the headphones are light and comfortable. I was a little disappointed with the charging cord, but it works fine now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this a couple weeks ago as my last phone and I have to say it is the best and most complete. This is the first time that I'm switching phones and I am glad I did. I used my friend's phone but his is the Samsung galaxy S3 with 2 GB of memory, no micro SD card and it's very slow. This one is faster, but has a slower processor than my friend so its pretty much a dead end. I'm using a USB cable which is nice. Its only a few dollars more than the phone my friend was using and its smaller and much easier to handle.   My only complaint is that the screen will only get dimmer if you put a ton of music on it.   Product: I bought these on ebay on Nov 21, 2010 for only $10 each. As I have the Motorola DROID RAZR I am not so familiar with Samsung I am so pleased with these I bought one for each of my three kids. They love them and play all the music on my iPhone.  I bought these in November 2010 for $10 for 3 phones and 3 boxes. .  These things are awesome. They look awesome, they're light and easy to carry, and they even work on older 3G (still working on my old phone). They were cheap but they are great! Thanks to all the cool people in the comment section! You make it worth buying all three of them

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I own a Sony Vaio FZ-10 which is a great sound quality computer (in comparison with the Macbook which doesn't sound as good as the computer) and this computer is not only as good but more stable in regards to the sound. I think the computer does not have a lot of power, but I would like to have more speed. Also the laptop's screen is a bit small, but if you like to write a lot then this is a nice laptop for doing that.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark from Awesome laptop This laptop is a real workhorse for anyone that writes. It has a lot more power and speed then the last laptop I had. The built in power supply makes it an ideal computer to use if you need to write while traveling. It will get you to the printer in less then 15 minutes. I have a Dell and it is a beast. It is very loud, and will make your ears bleed if you are sitting in the back of the bus while it is on. However, the Dell is only good for home use and this laptop will do more then just work.  was very happy with the laptop, it did not come with the usb cord but they are free. and they fit well. I am currently using a Lenovo laptop. but for the money, the performance,and it looks nice too.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit works flawlessly, and there is only one small flaw which I didn't notice right away. The unit had a minor fault where the buttons would not be clicky. I thought it was just an oversight, but as I was replacing the battery I noticed the issue. A second battery came, and with it the problem went away.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a Dell P2315h with a 15.6" screen in February 2010 and have been very happy with it. It's perfect for my needs. I used it for work and travel. It has great clarity, and its built like a tank. It even has USB 2.0. The only real issues are that the screen doesn't quite turn off, and I have a terrible keyboard to type on because of the keys sticking out of the keyboard.

I also like that I don't have to plug my CD player into my TV/VCR/whatever when I use my Sony Walkman.   I was able to listen to my stereo through my Sony as well as my receiver.  The speakers are better than I expected.  A great product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very pleased with this electronic device. I had read about this particular product, but I never thought I would buy it until I read the reviews. It works well, is easy to use, and looks great. I'm using a newer model of the product.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was very excited to get the A8x. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing it, and I am glad I did. It does everything I need it to do and it is very easy to use. The buttons work great and the quality of the screen is great. It is easy to find your way around the phone if you need to do so. I have no problems with the screen being too bright when I'm using the high brightness setting. It's very bright and you have to turn it down for your eyes. It also comes with a case, a great addition to the phone. The only thing I don't like about the phone is the speaker. It comes with earbuds that fit nicely into the headphone jack, but the quality was awful. The sound quality was very poor. I wish they would bring them back.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my Apple TV! It's a perfect size for my living room. The remote is very easy to use. The set is very quiet and is very convenient to watch videos on. The ability to view and listen to audio from a USB sound system from my laptop is a huge bonus. I especially like the ability to play movies from a DVD player. If it had a separate player, that would be perfect.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really love my new Dell i2567. The display is great. The built quality is great, and the keyboard feels good. I was not able to install Windows 8.1 on it yet because it would not boot on the first try. It was able to boot into Windows 8, but the "WOW!" response from the computer when running in full screen was pretty great. I would recommend this computer to anybody. It looks great, works great, the price is right, and I have not had any problems with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The audio is clear, the sound quality is pretty good, but the build is a bit weak, and the USB input is a little noisy.   I bought a different device for my car, and this is a great value if you want something that's more portable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the RCA-style jack for the Tascam DA-50.   It works great.  I have my Tascams and I love those!  The cable is a little long (maybe 10 inches), but the sound quality is very good.  The only thing I dislike about the cable is that it is only RCA and not XLR.  My wife's Tascamous has an XLR input. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the "new for life" model for my computer.  It has held up well, the sound is good, and it is very easy to connect.  I bought it for my home office, which has plenty of computer and sound equipment, but has no line out.  A few of the connections, such as the one for my TV set, are rather short (and could be better if they were longer) but I am not sure that is really the problem.

It's got a decent sound system, which is perfect for my headphones.  I like the touch controls as well, I just wish I could see the maps on the sides.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 3 is because there are better games with better graphics and sound, but this is a good game.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a wonderful machine that is very easy to use and easy to clean.   The sound quality is good, although it could be better.  The cord is much shorter than the ones from the older Tandy and Compaq models, but the cord is long enough to reach the speakers from my laptop.  I also like the included power adapter, which is a lot smaller than the one I had from a Tandy/Compaq.  This isn't the first "compact" keyboard I've bought, but I always thought the smaller size was a disadvantage.  If you don't care much for the smaller key size, this may be for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was a really great purchase - i have a computer with a monitor, but it can be frustrating to type on a tiny keyboard on a large screen. This is perfect for a computer that is at home, so i can use this computer while on the road. I bought this to do my own graphics and music editing. I also can't complain about the price - i bought a second one because the one i got was too small for my work desk.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an awesome product.  I got it to replace my old portable cd player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My Sony Walkman is the only thing I've ever owned that was reliable and the best in its class.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The keyboard has nice keycaps and the keys are nice.

The buttons on the keyboard are so small and easy to press that I don't feel I can use them at all.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good portable MP3 player. It has an internal USB port which is great for those who don't want to carry a CD or DVD reader. The device doesn't have a CD slot, so the internal storage capacity is limited. The iPod classic or other similarly sized iPods have a much larger storage capacity. However, this unit does not have a remote and it is very hard to use.   I like this model because of the ability to listen to music with my computer, tablet or phone. Also, the MP3 players are usually more expensive than other devices. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Purchased this to replace an aging PC. This is the first and only one I've used where I've found the audio to be excellent. I like the built-in mic, and I really like the sound from the built in speakers. The interface is great as well. I love that it comes with a pre-installed disc-of-the-month club. The only thing that has me looking elsewhere is the price, as it is higher than I would prefer.

My only complaint is that there is no option to remove the battery or the battery cover, so you have to take off the cover of the CD player to replace the battery. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The headphone quality is superb.   I have several other earphones and the Audio-Technica ATH-M50X is my current favorite.  The sound is neutral and precise; it can be described as a little warm, a little balanced but the bass is smooth and precise, the mids have good detail but a slight edge to them and the highs are quite good.  This is not an overstatement.  A lot of these sound great but the Audio Technica is better in every respect.  I can play everything from rap and metal to jazz and classical in my home and this model does not compromise at any of those things. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used this for about a month now and I am very pleased with it. The sound is clear, the quality is great, and it has very little power consumption (I have a Sony model, which uses two AAA batteries). The only thing I don't like is that it is only compatible with Sony-branded audio cables (the other cables don't work either). The price is a little high considering that other headphones (Sony MDR-V6 and the RHA MA750) are better and cost much less (but require a different adapter).  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the best products that I have owned, it is so nice to sit and relax.   I have the "Caveat emptor" edition, which can be purchased as a stand-alone but is better with the wireless remote. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this as an alternative to the Apple iPod touch for my children. They've been using it all summer. The app is well designed. I like that you can sync songs to any phone/computer/anything, and the ability to save your favorite songs is a bonus. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently purchased the   Toshiba Satellite A850-E.   This is a great sound/picture player.  It has an excellent sound with high-resolution audio and crystal clear sound quality.  The only downside is that it is a bit heavy for portable.  I have the A600/A650 but find it to be much better. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this item last year, and it has worked great.   Now that I have this for a second (I got the black one), I am enjoying the sound more.  The battery life on the old one was awful.  This one is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Bowers and Wilkins V7 headphones because my old Sennheiser HD-580 headphones wouldn't accept the adapter on the B&W side.  I plugged the adapter into the USB port on my computer, connected to my B&Ws, and my HD-581s started to play and the sound was much better than the Senns.  Very good product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My MacBook is the best laptop I have ever used. It does everything I need it to and more. The sound is superb. The keyboard is excellent. The trackpad is very good. The overall package is great.   (I upgraded from an old laptop)   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this as a gift for my husband to use with our old CRT TV so I could watch him play Starcraft with me.   This thing is just awesome!   It is light and simple to use and the picture is pretty good (not as good as my old CRTG-4).   The sound is a bit loud and not very good, but I guess this is to be expected for such a low price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It has no problems. I have used it for years, mostly with my pc, with no problems at all. It's super quiet, no sound, and it's just plain cool.   This is great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am using the "Stereo Bluetooth" from Amazon. I used to have an older "Rokit" but it didn't work very well, so I bought this one and it's great! I'm very happy with the Bluetooth. It's very easy to use and the headphones are very clear. It comes with an adapter for an adapter that I'm currently using but I can definitely see why the adapters are cheaper.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love the sound of my Yamaha XJ-1200.   The bass is good and there is some sparkle and detail to be had.  The volume knob on the back makes the music much fuller.  A nice plus is that you can't accidentally turn the volume up too high.  This is a solid product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my second purchase of this kind of gadget (the first one was a year ago).  It does what I wanted.  The fact that I did not have to plug the device into the wall and keep charging it is a big plus. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a Toshiba Satellite XS9100 with an external floppy drive (not a CD) that I got from a friend who wanted to sell it. This was the first laptop computer I've ever owned and it has been a great experience. The battery is very long lasting and the keyboard is nice to type on. The only complaint I have about the computer is that the speakers do not come on very loud, and sometimes I have to turn off the speakers to make the computer work.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my second computer in as many years. I got this one as part of my new laptop purchase and it's amazing. The power cord is a good size. It has a nice little speaker, and the screen is great. This is the first desktop computer I've owned, so there's still a bit of learning to do, but for the money I really can't complain.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had trouble with my first one and it was replaced so quickly and the replacements work well.   The only thing I dislike about it is how hard it is to find good sound and the need for headphones and speakers, but it is the best $20 I've spent on anything. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm very happy with this.  It is fast, it's silent, and it is easy to use.   The only thing is that you have to remember the settings.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great product to use when I am away. I have always been frustrated by the fact that my iPhone 3G would always make the screen flash white, then black, then white again. It was not a deal-breaker, but it was annoying.   Now that I have the newer 5, I am a happy camper. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this for my daughter who has problems in her left hand with a computer mouse. I have a Logitech MX Master that is also designed for left hand use. She has used this one on my PC, and found it much easier to use. I purchased this because the Logitech mouse did not have the same buttons as the one in my MX Master. This one is great. This is a great product. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a left hand problem.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The X10 is a fantastic tool for the musician in my house. It is easy to use, and the digital tuner is awesome.  I do not know the differences in other tuners out there, but for $90, I believe I got a great deal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a Macbook Pro which i have been using since 2009. I have used my older computer and my   iMac for years.   The Macbook was fine till a few weeks ago when the battery inside the battery compartment leaked. It   got   really   hard. It was now impossible to hold the computer. So i took the whole battery out and replaced it. It works just like the iMac. I now use the iPad Air 2 for everything.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only reason I bought this is because of the price.   It is great to have all the information I need to keep me informed in a variety of fields.  Also it can be a little difficult to use if you are not used to a PC, but I don't think that will be a problem for most users.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The USB charger is really easy to use. The speed is pretty good and the charger itself is nice and light, so not too heavy. The software is pretty bad, but if you have a problem with your computer (or don't want to mess with the settings), this is a very easy way to go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this a week ago, and I'm very happy with my purchase. The only reason I haven't given it five stars is that I'm not very picky about the audio quality. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. If I was to buy it again, I'd wait for a better audio chip to be put in it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this monitor about a month ago, and it was definitely worth the purchase.   There is a slight black border around the edges which is a little bit annoying, but it is easily overcome by using a black border for a monitor, or changing the monitor border to black.  This is also great for someone who has had problems with their monitor flickering.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the image quality is not as crisp as a Dell, and the color uniformity is a bit off. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was hesitant at first. I bought this because I knew that many people were complaining that the Xbox 360 was too loud. After all, there was a reason the Xbox was built so big. I had a feeling that the noise would be there and I didn't want that, so I wasn't expecting the same quality sound as the Xbox One.  I'm happy to say that my fears were unfounded.  The sound quality on this thing is fantastic.  You can tell that the console has been built with quality in mind.  Now that I have my copy of the game, I'll give a final word on the system.  It's loud.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The best device I've ever owned!  I used this for years and never had to use an ethernet port, and now I can finally listen to audio on my ipod without breaking the bank on a CD player.  The only downside is the cost, but if your looking for a good way to listen to music on the go and without any hassle, then this is the device for you.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound is very clear and detailed. I play in the band, and I have a good stereo system with a lot of speakers. It's nice to be able to hear everything as it's happening, instead of just hearing the guitar or drums. The guitar and bass also sound really good, they actually sound louder than most speakers. I also have a lot more bass than I want to in my system. The only thing that doesn't sound great is the drums. It sounds like a toy and not like a real drummer. But that's my only complaint with the sound.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had this device since it was released and I must say it is a really good purchase.  This is not a gaming device, this is a productivity/work companion.  You can do your work and then you can watch the TV while the TV is on and the device takes care of everything else for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My first PC. I got it on sale in the summer of 2000. I love my computer and i am very happy with it.   The only problem I have with it is that the case is slightly different than the one that came with it but that's only because I ordered it off line from the manufacturer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first time I plugged this in, it had no trouble working. There's no need for a power adaptor since the unit works at a 5VDC power supply, though, so you will have to plug it into a wall outlet. The battery lasted a full day (including an afternoon of playing music), though, and the sound was great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this for my brother. I did have a problem with the power button on the back of the unit. It wouldn't turn off. This didn't matter much because he didn't have his own power adapter, but it did cause him some frustration.   After dealing with this issue for almost a week, I sent him back for a new power adapter and power button. The unit worked fine after that. I bought this because I had trouble getting my cable or HDMI cable to work with other devices.

Overall a great headset for casual gaming.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod is a nice idea, but it's not well designed. The design doesn't allow you to easily control the iPod so you have to press a button on the back of the device to change songs.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good product. It has very good features, and works very well with my ipad.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very happy with the purchase, as my previous LG had poor audio/mic (both the cord, and the sound quality). This unit has both, plus I am able to get the best sound from my TV speakers, and most importantly, it works as advertised.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had this for years and it's just as good as new.   My biggest problem with it is that I have to buy another one each time it goes bad, but I'd much rather pay the little extra and get a really nice one that last me many years. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was my first audio system and I'm very happy. The sound is excellent and the CD player is so far the best in my studio. It has the best sound quality for my money. I'm a big fan of Yamaha and I have the TX-88 but this one has much better bass and better clarity.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   Very good sound, great price. The only complaint I have is that when connecting to a computer, you have to put it back in the box before connecting it to the computer. It could be done automatically, but the convenience of not having to put in the case to connect and put it away is good.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have bought several products from Apple and all of them have worked well. I am a huge fan of iMacs and have had a number of Mac Book Pros over the years.   iMac was the most affordable option and is still my only Mac.  With all the   modern   products on the market, iMac remains one of the best.  I wish iMac would have lasted longer but the warranty is very generous.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This little gadget is a great addition to the office and can make life in the digital age a bit more relaxing.   My main concern is that the buttons are difficult to hit at times but other than that it's easy to use.  It works better than my old IBM keyboard, so I'm using that instead.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a lot of music on my computer, including some great albums, but I've never felt like my computer is as portable as a decent MP3 player. With this little unit, it's as easy to go from one music site to another as it is to just rip a CD. I'll probably buy one of these for my desktop system.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It works fine for my use. I purchased a 4 port external USB adapter, so it comes with a lot of cables. It seems cheap, but it does the job. The adapter works perfectly with my Surface Pro, but I'm using the Surface Pro with Bluetooth keyboard so I have to make sure it can connect to it.   I bought a new Surface Pro this week, but the price was a little too much for me, so I used my Surface with a USB keyboard and had no issues. I like the fact that you can use it to connect your phone to your computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the mavic pro last week and I am impressed!  I've flown over 10 hours with it and I really love the control wheel.    It's easy to read and has a small button to turn off the gyro.  If you don't have an FPV camera then it will be an extra 4 bucks.  The drone has a pretty good balance and will take you around the track in less than 10 minutes.  It can go up to 400+ feet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this a few months ago, and I've been enjoying the sound and ease of use.   This is one of those products that does exactly what you want it to.  The ability to run my radio and phone as well as plug the USB sound and music player in without needing a special adapter is a big plus.  It's so convenient that I don't even have to carry my own AC adapter anymore.  My only gripe with this product is the plastic case.  If I can't find a case to replace it with, I'll have to return it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality is good for the price and it is very easy to use.   A nice bonus is that there is an option to add in extra batteries.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best sound I have ever heard from a phone on the phone and I have been on the market for 2 years now. The ring of the phone is so distinct and distinct the only way I can hear it is if I use my sound. I am a voice person and I can definitely hear the ring of my phone on my sound card, but not the ringer on my phone. This phone is also very loud. I'm sure you know that I love loud phones but this phone really sounds like you could put a whole bunch of subwoofers in it and it wouldn't sound all that bad at all. I really like the fact that it's wireless ( I love my iphone but I don't have my ipad with me when I want to use my  phone)

I was concerned that the usb input could become a problem if plugged in while the computer was charging, but it doesn't. Also, there is no need to run a cable around my house.

This phone is extremely compact and very easy to carry.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this because of the sound quality and I am really happy with it.   The only thing that I wish was different is that the volume and bass levels are really high.  The sound is nice and clear and it does not lose quality as you go up in levels.  You can also adjust the volume to get the volume just right.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a really good sound system. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was a great deal. My friends all have Apple TVs and I'm jealous of their quality of entertainment. It wasn't too loud or too bulky. I had a hard time playing some games with the TV speakers. I've had an Apple TV for years, but the difference is this one gives you access to your iTunes and Apple devices through your TV.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been looking for a wireless dongle to plug into my Xbox since the controller was discontinued. After reading some good reviews, I decided to buy one after receiving the game console. The Xbox Wireless Adapter works well as a controller.  It's small, looks good, has good weight to it. The only downside is, the Xbox Wireless adapter comes with a 3 year warranty and is "compatible" with all Xbox devices.  Other than that, great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My daughter is 14 months old and she loves her Turtle. She was in her car seat for her nap, so I left her in her Turtle at her room to watch TV, when she woke up and was asking for her Turtle and I was not home when she wanted her Turtle (I know she was scared at the time). I found her in a cold panic, but I knew what I had to do. I went into the Turtle's room, opened the screen door and put her on the floor right there. I then went into her room and gave her some warm wet towels. She then went to the room with the screen doors, and my Turtle was the only thing there to comfort her. She loved it. I love the sound and the way it feels, but it is not perfect and I would not want it as my only TV. I would buy another one if I had the money for it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my   PS3 Pro.   It is the most powerful console ever made and is so well done.   If I was offered it at a bargain price I would not hesitate to buy it   - the only drawback is that it has no USB input, so if I want to plug a keyboard, mouse or external hard drive into it I have to use a usb hub and connect the cables to a computer which is then connected via USB to my computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very good sound board for my Sony system. It doesn't need any software (for me at least) or a computer to use it. It has a headphone jack, which I never found to work well. I use my old Mac, so I use the computer to run the soundboard. However, it is easy to plug it into any standard audio device and use it for a long time.   The sound quality is fantastic, but you have to set it up first. That is not always a bad thing.

I would recommend these to anyone!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of the few good cheap laptops around.  I've been looking for a laptop to get into programming/gaming for a long time now but couldn't find one that's easy to use for that. I got this laptop because my old one started breaking down.  It comes with a copy of Windows, which is good enough for me, and a decent amount of RAM and solid hardware. I've had a few problems so far. First the screen doesn't turn off when you go to sleep, which usually happens with cheap laptops.  The keyboard isn't too bad, but the buttons are a little difficult to get used to.  There's no usb ports which is kind of annoying.   Overall, I'm happy with this laptop.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had the E-mu A-D converter for over a year now and it's awesome. I used to use my old CD player for my music, so buying a converter allowed me to switch to streaming music as well as analog.   The only thing I don't really like about the converter is that there's no option for USB connection so you have to buy a cheap USB hub to connect it to your computer and to your amp. However, I think that's the only downside.

The only issue is that the cable coming out the back is a little on the short side. That's why I've ordered the longer one.

Review of DJM-800MK2 + turntables Review by Kasey Quality This is the best turntable I have ever owned, even though it has a cheap plastic body. It is very rugged and easy to take care of. The motor on my turntablist was breaking because of the poor quality of the belts. However, the MK2 is not as bad as my old one. It was very hard to change belts because of all the slots but I eventually found one that fit very well. The only issue is that the spindle is very very heavy. It needs a special belt to hold it in place. I also had a problem with the belt slipping off the sprocket. The last time I changed belts, the belt slipped off the motor and broke. I finally had to buy a different belt because it broke again. If you have a turntablism of this quality, then I highly recommend the DJM 800 mk2!  Customer service is amazing Review by JB Quality I have been wanting to try out a digital recorder, and this unit was an excellent choice. It took me a little bit to figure out how to use the controls to get the settings to the desired position, but once you do, it is easy. The sound is awesome! I haven't played much vinyl lately, but I do love having a CD player at my desk to listen to music. This unit is very nice to use for listening to music when my computer is on the road.  "the sound" is good but I wish the unit had an auto stop function. It keeps skipping when you stop the playback, but when you put it on, the whole thing just stops for a moment.  (Posted on 5/16/2013)  The DJM 500 and DJM 300 are a great combo! Review by DJM Customer Service This combo has everything I was looking for in my new setup! The sound and controls are top notch, the turntability is a little cheap looking, but that's the price to pay for what you get! Plus, the included belt drive is so handy. I have to run it back and forth every time I want to make a change in the sound. If this unit had more than one CD player, this is a no brainer! (

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was looking to buy a high quality portable speaker that would work great for media and movies. I found it online, it's got decent sound quality but not high enough for my needs, and the price was a little pricey. I have purchased several portable speakers, including my SVS SoundLink Ultra. The Audio-Technica is the most portable of them all. I had to pay extra to get the built in headphone socket but it works great for the price. It is lightweight and the buttons are easy to use. My only regret is that the battery seems to die in about two years. I hope the battery lasts longer than that.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this for Christmas, but I had gotten it for $150 on Amazon. I had read that it was not the most powerful, but at only $60 I figured it would not do much. I installed it myself. The unit does not have the power supply that is needed to run a computer. The screen on the unit was a little small and black, but it works. I also purchased a 3rd party monitor for the unit and the quality is a little better than what was included with the unit. However, the monitor is not compatible with my laptop. The only other thing I would like to have on my unit is a usb plug so I can charge my phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm currently using a portable computer and a portable DVD player on the train to work. I like the fact that you can't lose the USB ports, that it's all rechargeable, and that there's no computer card slot. I've also found that there isn't much difference between the models (I get the newer one for a few bucks more), but the older one is much easier to use with a larger hard drive and USB 3.0 ports.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Sennheiser ME6600 headphones over a year ago and they were great. I just got a pair of Bose QC25s as a Christmas gift and they are amazing. I'm considering replacing my entire system with these, but Bose is so much more expensive.  I do like the fact that the Sankheiser can go up to 100 decibels, but they are more heavy and heavy headphones need to be listened to in a room with a subwoofer to make them work, so my experience is definitely not a typical one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod (1st gen)  I used this for the first two years of my life  It was very convenient  I like the fact that I can easily search songs  I can also look for songs that were purchased by other people    Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Worth the money  I have been using my old Mac Plus for about 2 years. I just bought an iPhone 4. The Mac Plus is a more robust unit. The new iPhone is much easier to carry and works better. It's easier to find songs in a small file, which is something I miss about the iPod. The music is fine.  From Anonymous of San Francisco, California on 2/26/2013. Great product, easy to use  I bought this one to use with my new iPhone 4. It comes with some kind of app that allows you to listen to music from your iTunes library. The iPhone uses a small thumb drive to play your music. That's the only downside to this product. The built in microphone picks up everything. It sounds great when you are on a call or just need to talk to a person. I would recommend this to anyone who has an iPod or an iPhone. I have owned a number of iPods and this one is a great buy. 1 from 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It worked as advertised, just as described. The battery lasted longer than expected and the software was very easy to use. The only thing I'd like is a slightly longer USB cord. I'm thinking about getting a longer one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've purchased several of these over the years, but finally upgraded to the last model, the TCL.  It now charges on my MacBook Air, and works flawlessly. I can also use it with my other computer at work as well.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is very convenient. It is small and light weight. There are two speeds: Slow and Fast. Slow will run my computer for 8 hours and Fast for 4 hours. So far I am happy with the purchase  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It works perfectly.   The batteries last a long time.  I've used my   iPod/iPhone 3G/iPad/iPods    3 and   4   and  i have never had a problem with any   these devices. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really liked this. It has more features than my other gaming gear and is much more portable than my old gaming keyboard.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very pleased with the sound of the CD player, especially after watching the movie. I'm also impressed with the fact that it supports a stereo receiver. I used a CD player in the past but I found it was very sensitive and it would give out loud signals and then shut down the CD players. This one has been great and I recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The    Fono is not the best sounding sound out there   but it is the best looking   (i like the  silver finish   ) and   the   small form factor   makes it a great portable music player   and  if you don't want to spend the  big bucks on   an iPod this may be the one to   buy   It is a bit on the pricey side but if you can live without the digital options i think   it's worth  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The computer I bought is really easy to use and does the job well. The screen resolution is great. I love the size of this monitor and the color depth of the picture. The battery life is great (about 4-5 hours).   I bought this monitor because I am using an old computer. The old one was a lot smaller and cheaper. The computer looks good on this monitor but the keyboard and mouse are terrible, so this is not a good choice for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This little thing has exceeded my expectations. My friend and I both had problems with other mp3 players. The fact that it plays and functions is very nice and i have been very pleased with it.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this machine for 2 years now and I am very happy with it.   The unit works flawlessly.  The software is very easy to use, even for a computer illiterate.  I think the unit is very nice.  It's very nice looking too.  You could have had the exact same model in any store.  My only problem is that the software does not have the ability to scan and play CDs/songs.  That's something I would really like to have as I like to listen to music on the computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using this with a Yamaha P201 as an MP3 player since early 2006.  It's small, light, and simple to use.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a volume knob and I would have liked to see one.  The unit is quiet too, which is nice.  I am going to get a second unit for my MP3 players.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This keyboard is a pleasure to use, and has great keys and nice function keys.  The keys are all marked up with arrows, making the keyboard pretty easy to use.  I have it on my laptop as a second keyboard, and it works pretty well in that setup.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a USB powered external monitor for my computer. It is very convenient. The monitor's port is a bit wobbly, so I recommend you read the instruction before you connect it to your computer. The connection is very quick.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Soundcraft Pro is a great product. The only reason I gave it only four stars is that the mic does not sound good with my computer. I also have to adjust the sound of my other speakers. I'm sure there is a fix for that. Other than that, I'm happy I bought it.     
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The new Sonos system has done a great job of capturing the full sound of the orchestra, without drowning out or overloading the piano. I like the fact that it is connected to the internet. The other great thing about the Sonos is that they have great customer support.  Just want to say thank you to the store that shipped my new system out. The system has been very easy to set up and use. I got to try all the music that I ordered before I purchased it.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound was not bad but it was very quiet at low volumes. It's a very good value for the money, but it does lack the soundstage of the PS3, so its bass would be better. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great device that is very easy to use. It does everything I needed it to do.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's so neat that I could not wait to get the next model. I had the original model on an old computer and I had to be using it from the first week. I just love it.   I use it in a hotel room and I get very little power out of it. So I had my manager borrow one of the chargers and when I returned it she told me to buy one to use the computer in the hotel room. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A good set of headphones for the price!   These are extremely good. I don't like the ear pads, but that's what they are designed for.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This computer can be used to do my job. I am a CPA with a very large accounting firm and need to keep track of several computer systems. The system is very versatile, I have it in both the main computer room and in a file cabinet in the back. I purchased the product as a replacement for a very old desktop computer with many problems. It is very fast and easy to use and keeps up with my daily activities.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The CD player works flawlessly! The screen brightness is very nice too.   I've also tried to put the CD player together a few times but the wires always seem to get tangled.   Rated 5 out of 5 by BobO from Excellent little product that fits perfectly. The sound is just right for my personal tastes, and the CD-RW is also great for keeping my music on the shelf. This unit was the first one I've bought that I could actually afford, so I'm very pleased with the quality of this purchase.  The CD-R is compact and easy to read but it does not read discs as well as some other CD-ROMs. The only good thing is the CD read noise. That can be an annoying thing with high quality music or CD, but on some of my CD's this can be removed easily. I have also replaced the hard disc with the CD+RW and am really glad I have.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The audio is really good. It's not quite as loud as my Yamaha DTX600 and not quite like my Sony ICF-SW100, but it's very close.   I like that it has an auxiliary input for your phone which allows for your own headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The speaker is very clear. The size of the speaker is excellent. I like the "pop" and the size of it makes it easy to hear.   I purchased this speaker for a small, home theater system that I am building. I'm using the RCA line and I'm very pleased with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great unit, but be careful, it is very easy to drop. I dropped mine, but thankfully it broke in the middle.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Joe from I have owned a Sony product for over 25 years and the BCD-1 is a perfect product at a great price. I have also used the DLP in a couple of projects and the difference is clear. This is as good as the Sony technology, even better. This unit will have many years of useful service. 1st of all...get a quality DVD player/DVD recorder. Sony CD-2 and CD-3 are okay. CD-1 and CD (all the versions I own) are not a good product. If your looking for a great product and are not willing to buy the B-CD-I, B-DVD-1 or a D2D recorder and a player, look to the B CD-II as a good choice. 2nd...get some nice quality cables. I use the B DVD-2, B DVD (I own both), B-3 and B-1. It is a lot of fun to use a nice, solid DVD player in the home. .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my old Nintendo, and since I got this I have been playing it a lot. The sound quality is much better than my old one, and is more consistent.  I am extremely happy I purchased this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a second one in 2011, as a secondary device for a printer/scanner. I needed a scanner, and my other scanner didn't have an SD card slot, so I needed an external drive. This one works great, but when I purchased my other printer/writer, it had an SD slot, which I used for some storage. The second one just doesn't have the same level of quality as the first. This second one is so easy to use, that I don't think I'll ever be without it.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently bought the Asus C910Q desktop computer from Walmart.  The computer was well built and had a good sound system.  It had a 1.8 GHz processor and a 250GB hard disk.   I have been using this computer as my main computer for the last 4 or 5 months.  I use the computer for my internet surfing, my video editing, and my documents. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was my first Philips CD player and I am happy with my purchase.   When I first got it the disc player would not turn on after turning it on and I was not able to locate the CD or play it. After I reset the CD player it worked fine. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This device was really easy to install, even for someone not really familiar with computers.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I bought this unit it was in great shape, the only thing that was a little rough was the touch screen buttons, they felt like I was using a brick instead of a mouse. However that wasn't the fault of the unit itself, the USB port was dead, I had to take it apart to replace the plug, and once the unit was working again the touch controls were very smooth, and I am very happy with it. I will most likely get a better one, but for the price and what I get out of it, I'm happy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great way to store my MP3 player, but the built in battery is a big downside. The MP3 Player Battery is really just a very big, long, flat lead which is attached to the back of the device and a battery can be replaced. The main draw is the built-in battery, but there are a number of things that can go wrong, such as leaking batteries or too much use. However, I find that the builtin battery works better than I expected.   I'm glad I bought the MP3Player 2 because I would not have bought it had it not had the built.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was my first portable audio recorder and I love it! It's not the best, but it's good enough for my needs and I like the fact that it's waterproof, which is a nice addition.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device because of the great reviews and the fact that I don't have to keep it plugged in all the time. However, after about 3 months of use I realized that this is just a nice sounding speaker (a little more high end than I was expecting)  However, I have not found that it really lives up to the great review here.  I purchased this device about a year ago because I was tired of having to keep my computer plugged in.  The sound is quite good and the volume is just right. However I can't find a way to mute the device. I had to find a different volume level and the speaker has gotten very hot. I will not be buying the new version.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I own two of these. They are quiet, they charge quickly (I use them when I am traveling), and they are easy to get into. I would recommend this to anyone, but if you have issues with your current cell phone then I would also recommend this phone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a new computer last week and was very pleased with the results. I was a bit surprised at the very good build quality, but it's really nothing to do with the price. The build quality of the machine is top notch, and the quality of software, sound, etc. is first class. The sound quality, however, is not as good as I would have hoped for, but for $250 it is hard to complain.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have this one on a portable drive and it works great.  I'm using the CDR because my laptop is too big to fit with all the songs on it.   The interface is very easy to navigate and I never have to switch between the CD or MP3 options.  You have to be able to put up with some glitches, but for the cost it's worth it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this with the intent of being able to play my games on my tablet, but it also serves as a great portable Bluetooth game controller.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this adapter so that I could plug my old analog cassette player into my new digital player, but I also wanted a way to play my old tapes.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm really happy with the sound quality of the A2's I've had. They're perfect for my studio, because I use them to record drums and bass.  I also use them for vocals, so they're perfect.   The only problem I can think of with the A's is that they sound different depending on where you're plugged in, so you need a separate speaker, which costs about $25.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new Sennheiser HD 280 HD-280BT Headphones have sound that is very balanced.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Triton 7 is just what I wanted. A great, easy to use laptop that is light enough to be carried. I've been able to use it at school as well as at home. The keyboard is also excellent. The quality of the trackpad is nice. I don't have to deal with having to get used to my laptop's trackpad buttons, which is nice, and I can use the mouse with one hand and the trackpads with the other. The battery is also great.   I've also tried this with an Apple MacBook Air and I've had no issues with either computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first got this and tried it I was immediately impressed with the quality. The quality is what sets this apart from other "computers" that are $30. It is a nice desktop computer, with an elegant appearance, the included software (including a mouse and a scanner) is a real bonus. I would not go out of my way to spend this much on anything, but it's worth the price!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was the first time I have owned an external USB hub with the capacity of this one.   I have used it several times over the past two months, and the capacity and overall performance have been great.  I use this hub on my laptop, and a flash drive.  This hub is the only hub I can use with both of those things, and has not been a problem at all. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had purchased a second-hand PC from a very good computer shop and was very pleased with the product.  It was a bit noisy at the end of the power cycle (which was expected with a pre-existing (but not totally reliable) power supply) but a cheap little power supply doesn't have to be noisy if you have a good quality PSU.  My only problem with the PC was that the video card was out of spec. It wouldn't boot at all.   The case is a little on the thin side but the overall quality is good, the motherboard is solid and the graphics card is fast and stable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device as a replacement for my old cassette player as I am currently switching from compact to portable music players. My previous portable players could not play any music or the CD as it was too bulky and took up more storage. However the CD player did have the option of CD burning software and I was able to buy the software on another computer. I can't tell you how much I love this device because it is super easy to use. Also, I have a very old computer and was not able to find a compact disc player with any sort of CD burner, which is why I was so desperate to find this device. It is the best buy I have ever made for this reason!
