Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is not a history of the war or the United States, but rather of the history of Europe and the war in the Pacific. Each country in Europe was affected by the war. Many people still look back to World War II as the "good war" but the Japanese didn't suffer as much in the war as other nations. The US was at first sympathetic and then, after two years, became very critical about how the war was being conducted. The Japanese were not only doing much worse, but they were also having many more casualties. It is also the book that shows how the world was involved in the War and its effects. This is a wonderful book to have in the library. It gives great insight into the war and it is a true study in the historical context of the period.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the most comprehensive treatment of Jewish History ever written.  It does this by combining the information contained in the four major historical series (I:CIV:III:XIV:IX:XVI:XVII): the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Gospels, and the Christian Bible.  The Mishnah is considered a part of Jewish history, but the other three are included to show the depth of the rabbinic tradition.  While this is a challenging book, it is one that I recommend

You can just buy the rice, add the toppings of your choice, and have a wonderful meal ready to go!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book, while searching for another one that will be of interest to me.  The author is well versed in the subject and the material has a good flow to it, if you can read it at times.  She provides some good links to further reading and gives some great insights as well.  For the first time, I read the book in its entirety and found it very interesting.  There were times I thought the book was too much for me to handle, but it was very worth the time I spent with it.  I have not had a chance to finish the book yet, so I do not know if the title "Sociological Images" would do this title justice.  It has something to do with human perception of things

Write a positive review about a good book:   The subject of the book was to be a guide of all types of equipment, equipment of the most popular type, and also some equipment of some lesser type which could be used for various purposes.  I found this book to be the most useful guide on this subject I have ever read, and the best thing is that it's self printed in full color.  The price is very reasonable for the quality of book.  It's quite funny because I was so pleased with the content of the text that I found it to be so entertaining and exciting, that I was completely in a state of amazement.  In fact I was thinking that I might have to take a course in photography for one of the classes that were being offered at that time, and that would be a very expensive course.  Anyway, the contents of the guide were so enjoyable that I never thought of taking any courses in photography, and certainly never thought about any courses as far as I was concerned, but that's okay.  If I ever felt that I needed to take some courses, I'll certainly make it a point of order to make a point to buy this book, or any other guide that I can find to my liking. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is very interesting to see the ways people's personal lives can change over the years. Many of the women are shown to be deeply religious, yet not the same woman after all the years of life experiences.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book that makes it very easy to see how many common misconceptions there are out there about the Orthodox Christian faith. For many, the only faith worth having is a fundamentalist one. For most, the Orthodox faith is just some boring, boring stuff. It's very easy for someone who thinks this way to come across the book as condescending, dismissive, and judgmental. I'm not a huge fan of the book, but it is worth reading for those of us who are curious about this faith.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very unique book for people who are interested in the history of the American frontier, specifically about the Western frontier.  The author presents the reader with a number of important facts that were unknown to most prior to the 1900's and in the process helps to bring these important facts to light.  In particular, the reader is introduced to the many settlers and settlers families and the people who were living on the land prior to western colonization.  By presenting the reader in the context of this important information, the author helps to make his or her research more enjoyable.  This allows the reader to view his or herself as part of this wonderful historical event that occurred, as well as allowing the reader a broader understanding of this period of time.  Additionally, the book is helpful in the classroom, as it helps to provide an excellent overview of a subject that is too often neglected.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The main character of this novel is a young girl from Africa named Samantha. In this world, everyone is born white and the main character is biracial. There are some mixed race characters, but I didn't see the point of bringing them into the story because it was too busy with the main protagonist. This story is not about racial discrimination, it is about being biracial with family members who are white, and it's about the growing up of a black teenager in America. The novel is long, but it keeps you reading the whole way. The book also has some romance, and I thought the ending was very well done. I have to give the author credit. The writing was very good and the characters were well drawn. I was surprised by the fact that there were not many negative reviews about this book and I have no doubt that she wrote the book in a very genuine and sincere way

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book by a Christian author.  The author does a good job of demonstrating why God will answer a prayer.  A few of the examples of this book: "The prophet had received a vision.  He was at a very high place in heaven.  God came in his heavenly vision and told the prophet to ask a man about a job, and the man told him about a place called "The Park" near the park, and within the next two minutes the prophet got the job.  It was easy.  There was no need to talk to anyone else.   I'm glad I read this book, and hope it can help some of you to realize that this is what God expects."

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am writing this review with the hope that you will also find the information you need in this book.  I would highly recommend that anyone with information related to the events of September 11, 2001, read this book for the first time.  The information contained in this work is the result of over a decade of research into the evidence and circumstances surrounding the tragedy.  It is a must read for any responsible American and is the reason I have purchased and re-read the book several times.   It has the information I was looking for from the very beginning and continues to provide new facts each time I read it.  This is not a novel.  You do not need to wait for the final chapters to discover the entire story.  All the information needed is available to the reader from this book, but some of the pieces needed to understand the whole story are not given enough emphasis.  However, it is my intention to continue re-reading this work in subsequent months to understand further the events, as well as the people, who were involved in this tragedy. The information provided throughout is factual, but does not delve too much into what might be considered psychological or moral issues.  What this work provides is an understanding of the events surrounding the events.  In essence, you are reading about two different scenarios.  One is the official account of what happened and the other is the "mystery" that surrounds it. It is important that you read both.  Both, the official and the mystery, will shed light on the events on 9/11.  There is no denying the fact that the events were tragic and the loss of life and the destruction of the buildings were the result.  But it is the investigation that is what keeps people talking about the tragedy every day.  Without the investigation, there would be no answers.

The essays here are excellent.  They're the ones that are relevant to a person's development as a writer.  While the essay in this book is the least autobiographical, I still believe Heming way of life is so interesting and alluring, that you can't go wrong with reading the whole collection.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book starts off with one of the worst murders ever committed in England: in April 1849, a girl and her sister were killed, and their dead bodies hung in front of their home. A suspect was arrested, and released. The case was forgotten for years. The suspect was eventually acquitted and the case was lost to history. The book details a new investigation of the murder. This is a gripping true story, and I can't believe it's taken me so long to read. I read this book after my husband was involved in the investigation.

Write a positive review about a good book:   As a veteran of the Catholic community in the Seattle area, I found this book refreshingly honest and insightful. The book opens with a story about how the founder of our Catholic church, the Virgin Mary, died. This chapter brings into sharp focus the importance of the Eucharist in the spiritual life of the Christian. The chapter goes on to describe how our Lord worked to provide His Church with the sacraments and the teachings on them. This is followed by the story of how the Christian Church spread throughout the world. This makes the book very relevant for the modern church as well. The last part of the book goes into detail regarding various events from Church history, to the Holy Rosary, to prayers for the sick. I found the stories to be very compelling, and the insights enlightening. The writing is excellent and the images and images of our Lord are as vivid as can be. The lessons from the stories are as true today as they were to the Church in the early Church. If you want a true life of Catholicism, this is the book to read!"

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must read for any reader.  This is a collection of articles that explain the basic principles of what I call the "Biblical Perspective on Economics."

The book is organized in a logical manner so that it can be easily understood for non-economists as well.  These principles are also applied to other fields, such as business, medicine, and law.  It is a true gold mine for readers who want to learn these topics from a biblical perspective.

The art in the book is wonderful, with full color illustrations, great illustrations of flowers, animals, etc.  All of the characters are well illustrated in their scenes, and that is the only negative I have with the book.  Most of the people have their back turned to us, and they only appear in the pictures that we are given.  This has no negative to it, it's just that the back of the book covers up most of the faces, and thus it is harder to see them clearly.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The authors have done the work for their readers, and the books provide a wealth of helpful information.  I have learned so much from this book that I have been able to do so much more this year than last.  The first few chapters are helpful, but the information in the later chapters can be overwhelming.  For example, do you ever wonder what the hell is a cuckoo clock?  Or how to read the clock face in a window  I thought the earlier chapters were the most helpful but have read much more of the later ones and  the answers are always the same.  However, for the price of the books this is the way to learn the essentials.  Even more valuable is the fact that they have included a list of links to more detailed articles and books

I've already read several other books by this author, such as The Story of Medicine and The Story about Medical Knowledge.

In my opinion, these books are the best medical books available today.

It goes into detail about the important rules of harmony, form, rhythm, time, harmony and melody.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a must read for me, but it also has a lot of interesting information for those who are in the process of creating a business, and the business owners who are managing their businesses in a difficult economic climate.  The authors make it clear that this is not an easy book to write, and that the readers need to be as comfortable with financial concepts as those who write it.  It's a challenge to write and it's certainly a challenge when you're doing it for a living, but this is the book that will help you understand how to keep a business going and survive in a challenging economic climate

Write a positive review about a good book:  The only negative review I have about the book is that it was written too many years ago.  It is still as good as ever, but I think the writing needs a little work to catch up with the trends of the times.  The book has a lot of examples of  creative  writing, so it can be helpful in developing  a style to write in for your own work.  I agree that it is better than the popular  books out there (like The Art of  Writing) but it is only a guide.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book I wanted to read all along, and I have to say it's not only the best book I've read so far but also the best illustrated book I have read in quite some time.

The illustrations are always very appealing, whether it's a scene showing a cat in a hammock or a man taking a bath.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have only two problems with this book: The first is that it is only a little over 200 pages. This is really not enough to prepare one for the intense demands of the practice. The second problem is that, although it is the most comprehensive guide on Tzolkin for the serious student, I still do not agree with the author's views. His ideas are outdated and do not represent the current state of affairs in the Tzolkish tradition. I also feel that he does not pay enough attention to the practical aspects of the Tzigler's system, in order to develop a practical system that is able to compete with the system of Tzulkin in contemporary Tzvetan

He presents the Bible in a very biblical manner.  This book is one that I have had in my Bible collection for years.  I read it in my first bible class in school in 1982, and it was a book I just couldn't put down.  It has been a mainstay in my collection ever since.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge admirer of the writing here. A couple of the characters have a deeper understanding of the world around them and are at odds with the world view of others. As for the world views of the main characters, they seem to come to agree, and they do so in the middle of a dramatic story, which is thrilling, even though the author is not always as subtle as one would like in his plots. The story is told with a lot of heart and a lot is left out, but the characters grow and change over time, and as a result the book becomes richer and more interesting. The author knows how to weave his plots into the characters' lives, which makes the book a more memorable and interesting read."

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in ancient Greece and the early world, the Roman Empire, and the modern world.  This book takes the reader on a fascinating journey from Rome to Greece, from ancient Greece to the Greek Islands, from Egypt to Greece and Greece to Egypt.  The book does a good job of introducing the reader to the personalities and cultures of ancient Greece, the Romans, and ancient Egypt.   The book includes a very brief overview of all the major wars and important events of the past three centuries, including the Fall of the Roman Republic, the decline of the Empire, the rise of the Dark Ages, and so forth.  While the book does take the reader a long way from Rome, it does a wonderful job of capturing all the personalities of those times.    It is a very interesting book, and one that I would recommend to anyone interested

I recommend it highly for any student, even the self-taught who may find it difficult to put into words the complex world of Greek Mythology and Greek Literature.  If only they knew how many of the characters are actual historical people!  A great book for anyone who loves Greek Mythological literature 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am in graduate school in English literature, and this was an extremely good book. It covers a large range of authors, with a detailed introduction of the authors and their works.   It is a pleasure to read and it was extremely thorough. It is also very easy to read, as the information is not too difficult to understand.  I read it through three times and it wasn't a chore.  Overall, it was a great book for those that want to start the course on writing.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The only negative review I have about this book is that the book was printed so quickly and the information that the author put in that you see in the book is often the same information that is not explained very well in the notes section. I read the book in one sitting, so it took me longer than I thought it would to get to the notes. It seemed that every book was a slightly different experience.I did however like the book and the photographs in the photos section were very helpful and very nice to look at.I recommend the book to anyone who loves to read for information, travel, or for anyone that enjoys being able to take in the sights of a city

Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book for anyone who wants to better understand the life of a working woman.

It goes into great detail about what makes a good work-from-home partner, and it tells how it can help her avoid burn out. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is written in the first person voice of Mr.  Rieger.  In some places, he seems to have a lot of trouble explaining his actions.  For example, he says in the beginning that he doesn't want to live as a hermit.  However, in the end he goes out to live the life of a hermite.  It was interesting to me to see how Mr. Riebert responded to events in his life.  I am sure this will be interesting reading for anyone who is interested in this fascinating phenomenon of man's self-expression and what it means to him personally.  If you like Mr.Riebert, you are going to like this book as well 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the only one I've read where the author does not try to make us believe that the story of the Prophet Muhammad's life is one of divinely inspired miracles. Instead of focusing on the miracles the author focuses on the hardships the Prophet experienced in his life. The hardships that he faced were so severe that one could say that the Prophet suffered his whole life. Although the book is full of hardships the author never exaggerates, and the author makes the Prophet suffer enough that we can feel for him. We are never told that the only reason the Prophet was able to survive the hardships of his life was because of the miracles. The author has the Prophet endure the hardships so that we, the reader, could be able to believe in his miracle. This book allows us to read the story from the perspective of both the Prophet and the readers. The book is a very good one to read, 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great read and a must read for those interested in ancient history. The information is mostly accurate with some minor differences. The book is well written with an entertaining writing style 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful introduction to Buddhism. The author covers the basics from the most basic to most advanced techniques, and he provides lots of examples. I am not a very Buddhist, but I found this a very good introduction for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm very pleased with this book.  It provides the reader with a very interesting and thought provoking take on the issues surrounding race in America.  There are many books written about the topic, but this book is definitely one of the more well rounded and comprehensive.   It is certainly not the only book written on the topic of racial equality, but it is the one that most fully expresses a true appreciation for the many facets of the subject matter.  The book provides a lot of insight into the issues of racial disparities and its effect upon all races.  While some of the information may not be particularly new to the American public, the information found in the book is quite illuminating.  This book gives the reader the opportunity to see and understand this problem from a number of different perspectives.  For a lot more information, you might read the numerous articles written by Dr. Arthur Jensen.  Although this book has many strong points, the most important aspect of it is that it provides the individual reader with the tools necessary to be able to critically look at a situation and think critically about one's own personal thoughts and actions.  All this is accomplished through the presentation of the facts, the opinions, and the questions, and without those things, there is no critical thinking.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this subject matter, and for those who want to help in some way, whether through literature or other means, I can certainly offer some suggestions.  Hopefully, this book will help in my own decision making and also provide a few insights for those of us who are just beginning to understand the issues around race and discrimination.  If you are looking for a book that provides a very thought provoking and thought inspiring take on an extremely controversial subject matter with a lot to offer, this is a book to consider 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Very informative. I recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of religion or world religions, as well as for those who want to explore the subject. It provides a good overview of the history, religions, cultures, and people who live and influence today. This book is great for anyone who wants to read about religions, religious people, and religions' philosophies in order to understand and learn about them. I enjoyed the discussion and was entertained throughout the book. I look forward to the next installment in the series, in which we will learn about various religions and cultures around the world, including how the beliefs in these religions differ from one culture to the other. This is a must read for anyone looking to understand the religions and philosophies of today, and for anyone to better understand the world around them.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is very well done. He covers a large variety of subjects from his own life.

It is a very nice book and I would recommend it highly

Write a positive review about a good book:   The most important thing to consider about this book is the way the author presents the information. From the first page, there is a full page of information, plus a list of books and resources which will greatly benefit the average person looking to begin their journey towards becoming a confident, successful, and effective communicator.  I particularly enjoyed the discussion of different styles of communication, which can be very beneficial for both communicators and readers alike.  This book has been of great use to me, especially as I have had a lot of struggles recently with the communication skills I need to be effective in my role as a clinical social worker.  The information contained in this book has helped tremendously, and I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs to get into communicator's language

The authors are very active in the classroom, using their personal experiences. They are very generous in sharing their experiences and the book encourages you to do the same. I have taught this book to many students and it has inspired me to write more about it for my classes. The author provides great practical and historical examples for each chapter. As the author points out, the primary purpose of the book is to help you understand what it means to be a woman. As you look at the images, you get a glimpse into different societies and different societies around the world. The illustrations are very interesting as well. This book offers a deeper look into the history of women, their role in society and in the world today. The book also offers a look into how to go about looking and feeling like a woman today. As a teacher, it is very helpful to review the text in advance and it is also a very useful book for students who are considering their future in the profession. This is a book to read and to be recommended

It is full of great historical information about the colonies, the revolutionary leaders and the events that shaped the country.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best introduction to chess. It does not make any pretentious claims, but does present the main lines of chess theory from the early 1900s through to today. This will give you a very clear understanding of what is going on when you play a game of chess. There are also sections on the history of the game, the history and theory of chess, and some interesting features such as puzzles. This book covers all that you could want in the way of material for a beginner chess player: good descriptions of the opening, the basic rules, and the main aspects of the chess analysis. There is also extensive commentary and the authors provide a good guide on how to prepare for a tournament. This makes the book very readable, and does a very good job of introducing a person to the game.

Their love, loyalty, and dedication to each other shine through in this book. I have to say this book is a gem, and I could not recommend it highly enough 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very informative book, with many examples in modern life.  However, if you read the earlier chapters on business or finance, it might be challenging to find the new subjects covered in later chapters.  But I think the new topics really come through in the final chapter.  I found it to be an excellent book for someone just learning about the Internet or a good read for a layman.  You may be surprised by some of the terms and concepts in this book, but you will be amazed by the many ways you can get around and understand the world around you.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an interesting way to understand a difficult language.  There are a lot of examples and comments that are helpful and informative.  The author did a good job at explaining the grammatical structure of the language. The English language itself is a complex one, and this book offers a good starting point.  You can follow along, take it as a resource, or read it as you go.  It's your choice.  This is the best way to learn a language. I recommend it highly.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   Very interesting.  I'm glad that this book has been available for so long.  He is a great writer, and his stories are very compelling.   I find myself thinking about the different characters and scenes in each chapter of each book, and how much I enjoyed them each time.  It's like you're in a different world.  What I don't like about it is that it is very easy to get lost in the story.  As you start reading the book you may have some idea about the setting, but not about the characters.  You have to constantly keep moving back and forth from place to place, and not being able to figure out what is going on.  And that is true of every book.  But as long as you keep up with the action, the action will keep you entertained. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't think I'm one of those who will ever become a vegetarian, but this book has made me appreciate how much we take for granted in this fast paced world. It has given me a new perspective about how other people eat, enjoy life, and live their lives. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The authors, with the assistance of a few knowledgeable friends, did a fine job of describing the various ways to make art, especially as related to art for children. The book is divided into three parts:  Part one describes Art for children, with examples from the works of Charles Schulz, Andy Warhol and other prominent artists. It also describes ways of making art for adults and children. The second part of the book is devoted to Colored Paintings. Part three is devoted to paintings, drawings, paintings of people as well as paintings of animals. Overall the book was very educational and fun to read. I especially liked the pictures in the third part. A lot of the pictures were pictures of a kid's room or a house, with a color scheme for each color.  I liked seeing the different colors that are possible for a painting.  It seemed like the pictures had a kind of color coherence and were like a piece of art itself 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a very good introduction for those who wish to become better at martial arts, especially Japanese martial arts.

The book will open your eyes to the divine and your heart to its meaning. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful introduction to the subject, and it is a great way to introduce kids to the joy of learning.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is packed with fascinating facts about the history of our country: the first settlers came from England, the first slave was a white woman and so on.  I'm not going to get into it too much, but you will find some really interesting facts about how the first immigrants were treated by the British settlers and how America was shaped up by British culture.  The author makes the point that there is more than a one way to make a living in this country and that each group has their own way of doing things.  He points out how different immigrant groups have come to America through different pathways:  Mexicans from the South, Italians, Germans and British immigrants coming to the North and West; African Americans coming to Virginia and Maryland from the North, West, and Midwest; Chinese coming to California from the West and the East; Irish coming to New York from the East and the West; the Japanese are now coming in to America from the Northeast; Arabs come from the Middle East.  This author is also one of the most intelligent people I've ever met.  While the book talks about all these groups coming to this country, it also points out that they are all interconnected.  In fact, we are all one people, with one common origin.  So many cultures and beliefs are present in American culture today that it's difficult to describe and discuss them all, but the author does a good job.  It's not a short book and the index helps immensely, but if you are a history buff, you will be very grateful for it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I feel I have become a very deep believer in this book. Not only as a mother, but I have been an advocate in support of people with ADHD from my early childhood. This book is a wake up call to a lot of people that think they have the answers to life's problems. You just can't just tell a person that they need to stop doing something to fix their problems. Life is too short to spend your time in anger. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book very helpful

The seventh mission, launched on June 29, 1962, successfully delivered the satellite to the correct orbit.The sixth and seventh missions were considered a total failure. Each of the launches has been documented by many people. The launch schedule is complete. The astronauts, ground personnel, technicians and researchers involved in each mission.The author's research and writing style are excellent. He was able to tell the story through all of the missions, and through all the issues.The illustrations show how the missions were completed in both real time and in detail.

For more advanced readers, this book is a good source of inspiration, but it does not make it easy for one to get started.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was great, but I thought that there was too much talking about how nice the food is, and not enough talking about why you need to eat the food:  So many people, especially in America, do not even realize that they can eat the foods that they love and the way to do it is not by eating the food. Instead, you are eating the foods in a certain order, and the order can be changed if you need.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is like a good film: a bit hard to understand at first (especially for the American readers) but once you get the hang of the story you see that it is not just a simple story. The characters have so many different motivations and there are many other aspects of the book which make it very exciting.  The book is quite easy to read and provides a good explanation of the characters' motivations and actions as the story progresses. The illustrations help to convey the story in a visual way.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recommend this book to anyone interested in the world of politics. It may sound familiar to some of you, but not to all of us: This book is a collection of articles, speeches and memoirs by John F. Kennedy. It deals with topics like his youth, his rise to power and presidency, and also his personal relationships. The Kennedy's are a unique family that is the subject of this book. You'll learn that the Kennedy's never stayed the same since John's father was assassinated in June of 1963. You also learn of their personal struggles with illness, death and depression. The story of the Kennedy family is told here from the perspective of their children, the grandchildren. This book covers a lot of ground, and is certainly the book to read if you want to know what life was like for John F's family during those years. I don't think this is a novel: This book is not a book about the Kennedy marriage or JFK's first term. John was certainly not shy about sharing his feelings about the marriage, and many of the chapters were pretty poignant. This is a book that was written to help you understand the life of one of our most famous leaders. It is also a book to help understand our government and its workings. This was not written to make anyone feel bad for the Kennedy Family. I am not sure it ever was. It just does not tell the whole story. The book is full of historical facts, personal recollections and opinions. Many of the essays are insightful and interesting. There is also one of John's own words on the subject: It is never easy to write the kind of memoir I have, to tell the kind I have. The fact that I was married for a long time is not lost on me. But you have to deal with the fact that, at that time, that was just a fact. The idea of a marriage was not thought about. You have to work through that. It was a very important time. You had to deal, and you still do, with the emotional side of that. But the book is about the practical side. It's about the decisions and the work. It explains those decisions and also what you did to make those decisions. It also explains, as much as I could, what John and his family did in terms of planning the future, and what the Kennedy children and their children did in all of those years to plan and prepare the future for John. I think you'll

Write a positive review about a good book:   The story behind The Good Thief is very interesting: he is a former bank robber. He is always the hero of his stories. He has been a professional thief for many years. The reason he never seems to have any victims is because he is always looking for more victims to rob. The thief has been living in Las Vegas for many decades. His most recent victim was the man who had the nerve to ask him to rob a bank. In this way, the thief was very successful, but he never went back to robbing banks.

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you love writing as much as I do, this book is right up your alley.  I have been reading for over twenty years and have yet to find a book like it. I am always surprised at how much the information provided here has changed. All the information contained in this book has been taken from the many hours I have spent in my library researching. The book is very well organized. Every topic has been covered extensively. There are two different covers. On the back cover of each page you will see the books three main topics. Each of these topics has many pages. In the middle of each of these pages you will find the information that the cover says is the most important. This information was gathered from multiple sources. If it is important to you, go ahead and read the information in these pages. The information contained is only part of the information you should know about. You should also know that the information you find here is only an outline of the book. Once you have read the book you will begin to learn the important information contained within each topic. That is how you learn.  It is my belief that there are many more pages of important information that you will not find in this booklet (though the information within is not too small). If that is true, then you are already ahead of the game and I hope you are not disappointed

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has much to say about a variety of subjects and in many different ways.  The book begins with descriptions of the world's most interesting and strange locations, and then moves into the world of magic.  I found the descriptions in the chapters to be well thought-out, descriptive and informative.  There are not many magic books out there that provide detailed explanations of magic, but this book does so without ever using the word'magic' or any other word that might seem confusing to many people.  This is a good read for anyone who enjoys mystery fiction, historical fiction, fantasy, steampunk, horror or any one of a number of genres of fiction.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book of the Kabbalah series. In the first half of the book, the author discusses the importance of ritual and how it relates to Kabbala. He explains why it is important to learn the basics of ritual before attempting a serious study of Kabbalis and their beliefs.The second part of the volume focuses on the Kabalistic doctrines. The author uses the Kether, Malkuth and Yesod as the main symbols. The discussion is divided into two parts. The first part is based on the idea of the Shem haMephite, the principle of evil. It explains why the Shema, the Ten Commandments, the laws of murder and theft are all mentioned in the Kabadist literature, as well as the creation of the Golem, the creature created by Malkuth to kill a mortal man. The second part focuses on God and His creation of a new soul in the Hebrew souls through the practice of Malkuth. The emphasis is on the power and ability of the soul to transform into the likeness of Malkut.This is the type of material the author uses to teach his Kabbalist readers. This material is both extremely practical and incredibly difficult. The only other book of its kind, this is the only book of Kebiliah which focuses exclusively on Kabbali, not the Kaddish, which also is a major focus of the second volume. The authors do a good job of conveying the Kebilliah message as presented through this book.The third book of this series, The Hidden Words of the Kabalist, uses a similar structure, though in a somewhat different context. The third volume is devoted to the Khemr, the spiritual aspect of Kabadism, and how the Kher was created. The Khemri are beings that are created to act as the vessels of the higher self. The Kabalist is able to see the Khels, the higher consciousness, in his Khem. The book gives many examples of how the Kabalistic ideas can apply to the human world. The fourth volume, The Mystery of The Shem HaMephites, is the most interesting of the three. This book focuses on Shem, the divine name, as spoken by Malkut in the first person. This leads into the Kethubh, the power of creation and transformation. The final volume, the Secrets of Kabalism, is an extensive and lengthy study of the mysteries of

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book and thought it was a good read for those who are already aware of a lot of the things in the occult world.  But I enjoyed it as much as I did the book on Thelema.  I think the main point of the book is to present a picture of how the world works.  It gives you the feel for the book and shows you how it would feel to be involved in all of this.   It also shows the occult's influence in society.  The important thing is to read the whole book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a fun book to read for fans of the book and readers of the film. It provides you with some of the details about the film, including a little about what goes on behind the scenes, but it doesn't reveal the full truth of what actually happens. It gives you some of what you might have seen in the film in addition to some of it's background story that you might not have known about until reading this book.I wouldn't be surprised if this is the last book about the movie written by Spielberg, and for that reason, I can see this being a very popular book for years to come. I don't want to give away too much too soon, so I will wait to see where the story ends up before I give it a positive rating, but so far it has been an excellent book to own.

The world of magic is the focus of the series, so this is the book to have if you are into that area.  This world is unique, and it's the main reason why  I found the characters to be interesting, and the plot to be engaging.  The only thing that made me feel like the book wasn't as effective as the first two was the ending.  It seems that in this world, there is no guarantee that you can see the outcome of a good or bad deed

The descriptions of clothing, jewelry, music, and stories are wonderful. Each of the chapters has several examples of traditional dress and is illustrated.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The style is quite enjoyable and the prose is beautiful.  The story follows two teenage girls from different backgrounds: one from a wealthy family, the other from a working class family.  There is a beautiful depiction of love in the form of a series of letters that the girls write to each other.  It is quite a touching story, and the illustrations are beautiful. I love the fact that they show the two girls in their natural environment: the woods, the mountains and the sea.  In a good way, I feel that these two girls are in harmony with themselves and with the world around them, which is the essence of true love.

Write a positive review about a good book:   Very interesting and insightful study of the relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and homosexuality.  The chapters have a very good pace, and I felt they captured the essence of the problem quite well.  I don't know if the authors were influenced by the Vatican's policy of celibacy in the priesthood, but the book certainly reflects the growing intolerance toward homosexuality and the subsequent increase in the number of priests who have come out.  Overall, I feel this book does a good job of illustrating the various factors that lead to the rise of homosexuality, which, in the end, leads to the Church's rejection of gays.  Very readable and informative, the book provides the reader with the right information to understand the situation.  Highly recommended

I am glad to know how the story is told, but I do not believe it is a very simple story

This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read many in this world. I read all the other books in the series, but there are too many to give a good review about each one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The most interesting part of this book is the information regarding the evolution of human culture. In fact, the term "Neo-Hegelianism" is coined in this book. However, the concept is well explained. The book is interesting in that it offers a wide variety of information that is very applicable to today. The author's style is somewhat informal and he presents information in such a manner as to be very accessible to all people. I believe this book will serve as a good reference for the students of philosophy, economics, history, or business. The material is in order of decreasing probability of usefulness to people with little or no knowledge of history. I recommend this book for all who would like to further their knowledge of the philosophical and cultural aspects of modern society.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of both fiction and non-fiction.  I enjoyed this book so much I bought the second edition (it still sells quite well).  I was even able to meet Mr. McNeill and see how he prepares for the writing of his books.  The book has several different settings, all of which have their own plot lines.  There are two different books within the series, The First and The Second.  As for the characters in the book, I'd go for the second, as I feel that the first one may have gone to some rather strange ends.  That said, I do see how this can be quite entertaining for those who are interested in some more "adult" stories.  Mr.McNeill really shines as a character in The First.  In fact, I feel his character would be the focal point of the second book as well.  It would be an excellent read for young readers, too.  Both books were very enjoyable

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have read in a while with a character that is completely unique. The reader can relate to what is going on with him. This book could have been more of a drama book but the story flows nicely and the plot unfolds beautifully. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have already read this book twice in the short time since I received it. The illustrations are very good. The story is well told, although there are some parts that I was not able to relate to. If you like mystery books, this one is a good choice. The only problem is that it is a bit too long to read. I would recommend this book for those who are into mystery, but would recommend to pick the next book in the series. I haven't read the first book yet, but I plan to eventually.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The subject is certainly a daunting one:  The first thing you learn about is that the universe is a complex place with many different possibilities. And the second thing you learned was that there is a common ground between all of us: that of love and acceptance of others.  This theme is a constant throughout the book: love for others and your willingness to support those who are suffering and are trying to make themselves feel better.  Love is also the common basis for a good spiritual life, which is a valuable lesson that is learned in this book.  All of this can be understood easily with just a few moments of reflection, without even attempting to delve too deeply into the religious or the philosophical. This book will bring you much closer to those who suffer, those who need our love and support, and those who may be in need of our compassion.  I found that I learned many lessons that I had not previously thought about.  It was the first time that I was able to relate the story of my own life in a positive way.   And I am glad that I took the time to do this.

It may not be the most intuitive book to read, but it definitely gives you the most useful ideas and examples.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a collection of stories from  several different writers.  Each story has its own charm, but they all have  the same overarching story: a boy becomes a man.   The story itself is the most important aspect, but the other  aspects of the book are really important, too.  The fact that the author writes about different  genres, and that he has a lot of experience with  these genres, gives each story a unique feel, and a  deeper meaning.  My favorite stories  are the ones about people in love.  They all have the same  underlying theme, that is love, and how much it changes.  Other  stories are darker, and it can be seen as  a metaphor for things we have been through in life.  All of these themes are explored in great depth  in this book.  You'll be reading about a lot more of the boys and how they grow up.  I also liked the fact that each of the story writers had their own personal style.  Some were more  romantic, while others were more humorous.  As well, I really liked the idea of this book  as a companion book to the TV show  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is excellent.  This was the first book in the series I read.  As I read the other books, I started to really enjoy this series.  It is very well done, and has a happy ending.  I have had the same experience with all the books

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favourite books, and I've read the same book numerous times.  Although the book does tend to be a bit heavy handed with the spiritual messages, it's always refreshing to read the story of an ordinary young woman who is caught up in some religious shenanigans.  The book is also filled with beautiful pictures and beautiful prose.   The story of Theodora's quest to learn more about her past and why she did what she did is always fascinating.  She learns to become an excellent dancer, and her love for dance is only exceeded by her love of learning

Write a positive review about a good book:   The title is a little misleading; this is not about the ancient Greek system of classification of plants.  But the system is still a wonderful system to classify plants and to see how each category is defined.  As I have mentioned elsewhere, the title does not really tell you anything.  This book gives you the system in its simplest form.  However, the method is the system.  What you learn about it is up to you.  There are many other great books which explain the system, but this one is the best.  The text is easy to read and understand.  You will be able to apply the methods in a matter of minutes.  Most people can understand the text within one or two days

Write a positive review about a good book:   In my opinion, this book is excellent.  The book is in four parts.  Part One: A Journey to the Heart of a Child:  An understanding of the importance of the child in our lives is gained in part one.  After a quick introduction to child development, the reader is then transported to the hospital where a premature baby is undergoing a delicate physical examination.  Through this, the author describes the life of a single parent, and the impact that a child can have on a family.  There is also a look at the impact a child has on a person's life: how the child can inspire hope, drive us to good acts of good faith and serve as an example of what one can do if one truly loves a child.  We are also shown through the eyes of the father how important it is to be a loving husband and father.  For those of us that are fortunate to have parents who are very dedicated to their kids, the lessons here are invaluable

Some of the dogs seemed to take a while to start to work with each other, but once they are in the right environment, they are willing to work together. This is the kind of behavior that is important for dog training, especially to learn to understand others. I am not going to say this is true for all dogs, but this is the type of book I recommend for all dog owners

They also keep the reader interested in the story as the events progress. It has been said many times before but the author gives you a real sense of the depth of the characters and their reactions. I am still very young and have yet to learn the basics. This book provides a wealth of information that will help me with the next steps of my life and for those who are just getting into the realm of romance. It does not matter how old you are as there is a lot of adventure in these tales.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are interested in the history of medicine in the United States, this book is a must read for you. It provides a great amount of information about the first major reformulated drugs: the tetracyclines. While we are on the subject of medicine, let's talk about the rise of medicine as a professional pursuit. The American Medical Association itself was formed in 1788 as a way to better regulate the professions. It was not only a way of creating a centralized authority to govern the medical professions, but also to help the medical profession to better understand the needs of the population. And as a society, we are all bound to have an interest in medicine. I'm sure it won't surprise you that many of the people in this book are practitioners in the field, and I'm very happy that the author has included their work in the book. This book includes stories of pioneers in their fields, and their role in helping to pioneer medicine in this country. Also, there are the many stories of the early doctors as well. This is very much a historical book, but it does give the reader a glimpse into the minds of early practitioners, which I found to be very intriguing and educational. This was another book I recommend to anyone who is interested in medicine, medicine as we know it today, and how we got here. For this reason, I'm listing it as 5 stars in my book

The first part of the book focuses on African-Americans, and there are some wonderful illustrations of their lives in the South, including scenes of slave and free blacks in the south.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I find it fascinating how the stories of this group of people can be so similar. From one person's life:  I was born in New Jersey, but I moved to New York City with my parents when I was five. I was a little overweight, and I remember how hard it was to eat enough to put on the clothes I wanted to wear.  By the time I was in the tenth grade I had already graduated from the eighth grade. I went to college, and the only other thing I remember that ever changed in my life was I stopped reading.  In my younger years, I would not even take a shower until I was six hours in.  It was this extreme discipline and discipline that turned me into a good athlete. I always thought that my coaches had something to do with it, so I had them in the back of my mind whenever I was preparing for a sports event. In high school I was very competitive. I always tried to outdo the next person in every way. Even before that, I was competitive with other kids, but there was one more difference. This competition did not always come from my own family. As a kid, my brothers would come over and make fun of me. They called me "Honey Boo Boo" and things like that.  I had to overcome that and have the confidence to outplay them.  This is where all of my athletic prowess came from. It was only once in high school that I started doing what I really wanted to do. That is, I started training in wrestling. At first I thought that I was just being mean to my friends and having fun, but once I became a senior in highschool, I decided to make the sport my life and try to make my parents proud of me 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of valuable information. The book was useful for many things 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about Judaism or other religions and their spiritual beliefs. This is a very interesting book that helps the reader understand why a person is drawn to a certain religion, what that religion means to a person, and how to develop a relationship of trust and mutual respect with another person in this new religious environment.  This is an excellent book for everyone, whether you are interested in religion, spirituality, politics, or simply want to improve your relationship with someone you love.  I feel this is one of the most important books of the year and it will be used by many as their Bible or Jewish study material 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been teaching Chinese for more than 30 years. I never liked reading about the ancient world, the only books I read were about modern life in China.

It is also very interesting in that it gives you a real picture of modern life

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a great book, but it didn't tell you what was happening at work or with the other employees. It gave you more of a picture of what was going on in the office without telling you much about the personalities of the characters. The only characters that were mentioned were the two men. It would have been very interesting to have been able to understand each one and why they were doing what they did. You would have learned a great deal about the life of a corporate executive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book does an excellent job of showing people how to live a sustainable and enjoyable life, as well as how to find and preserve their way of living.  The book does not provide any specific recipes, but instead encourages readers to be creative in their use of resources to make their lives more comfortable, sustainable, and fulfilling.  While this book does offer many helpful recipes, they are not essential, as the focus is not on how to produce the exact things mentioned, but rather on how people can live a more peaceful, satisfying, and healthy lifestyle.   This book can be used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from the simple to the highly complex.  For example, one of the book's main goals is to assist people to become "better consumers", which is exactly what I found the most useful information.  I feel that this book will be a useful reference for anyone looking for information about the way to live their life in a healthy, fulfilling, and sustainable manner.  It's an amazing book, and I highly recommend it for all kinds of people

The first section of this book is the most enjoyable part of the book for me.  There is so much humor, action, and adventure in this book.  The next two sections of the novel are the book's strengths.  These are the sections where the reader feels what the characters go through is very real and painful.  I thought that the first half of the second section was the most entertaining part of this novel.  It was the emotional response to the reader that made this book so interesting

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is as well-thought-out as any. The author has used a variety of sources: books, personal conversations, television programs, and so forth. The result is a well-rounded and accurate portrayal of the man who was one of the leading characters in the 1970's and '80's. If you are interested in how a man of such stature could develop and grow in the face of so much adversity, this is the book to get. This is also a good reminder that a good story is more important than facts. You can't read about someone without learning something from them about life. The best way to learn about life is to read

The stories are interesting, the illustrations are nice, and there are plenty of illustrations for each of the stories included. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've found myself in the same situation many times: I'm in my late twenties and have no idea what I want to do with myself or if I'm doing something right or wrong with my life.  So, as usual, I turned to The One Less Lonely Girl.  This book is written by a woman who's had to grow up quickly, and that's great because I had to as well.  The book is short enough to read in one sitting, but very long enough to see things through to the end.  I'm so glad she wrote a book about a woman like that.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book. It is not a story of a woman trying to raise a child. Instead, it is a story about a family, and the love that exists between all of them. The first thing I thought about while reading this was my son. He is about four years old now and is still very close to his mom. I read the book with him and we just felt such a sense of connection. There were times I thought he was the only one in the family, or his father might not want him to have this big of a brother. But then again, it was the same with my husband and I. My husband didn't know anything about the book, so he read it with me. And while he had no idea what I was telling him, he felt so connected with this story, that he loved every page. Once we were through reading, we both just laid down on the floor and enjoyed being on the same page

I really enjoyed reading this book and will definitely refer to it frequently when I have further concerns about my current or future relationship. The author's observations and explanations of how each person feels, the importance placed on certain qualities, the different types of relationships, and so on are all extremely insightful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the only book I ever owned in high school about the occult, and it was probably the most helpful book I read. This was not a popular subject at the time, and only after I finished this book did I pick up other occult subjects, especially the black arts. I have read some of his later books, and they are still excellent. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good introduction to the occult. The information is in-depth, and there are numerous pictures to illustrate the points he is making. If you are interested in the occult and want to learn more about it, I recommend this as your first choice.

The first two parts were fairly easy, though it did not help that I only got about half through the book.  Then I started reading the third part which I had already finished in a few days.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In the end, this is probably my favorite story in the book.  He has done a terrific job with the research and he has captured the spirit of his characters.  It is also very fun to read this book as an adult.  The writing is very  clean, and the characters  remain vivid and true to their original selves.  There is a reason why I found myself rooting  for the main characters, but even I felt they had flaws.  I still believe that the ending was excellent, but  I do wish that they had written a little more about the other characters. The one negative review:  The ending seems a little too perfect.

The book is also interesting for those who are interested in how Jews were affected by the religious persecution, the Crusades, and other great events that occurred over the course of their history.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book to read as a family, or as an adult.  I loved reading about the life of a Jewish kid growing up in New Jersey in the 1960's.  It's easy to relate with his experiences.  The book doesn't focus too much on politics or religion, but it does get the point across, which is that life is what you make of it

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read several books on women and they are all good. This book takes a different approach. It emphasizes on the importance of self worth, but doesn't just throw out statistics. It also gives a positive view of women in business. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a wonderful resource for anyone seeking to learn more about Buddhism, and especially for those who are trying to teach the Buddhist Dharma in the classroom. I can see the same sort of applications being made in the social sciences, as well as in medicine. The only negative review I could muster is that the book is not as dense as it could be. But, that's true of every book of a similar type: 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book that is extremely accessible to both beginners and experienced students. This is one of the only books to have all the exercises in the book and is a must for anyone who wishes to understand advanced material.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the finest stories about American soldiers to ever appear in print. It is inextricably woven into the lives of these young men, the experiences of this war, and the nation's recovery. Each young man comes of age in his own way, the stories are told in a poetic, lively way, and there is great detail about the hardships of the war, the emotional toll of combat, and more. These young men find a way to move forward in their lives, each becoming a soldier for a different cause. These men do it in their own way. This book gives us a rare insight into the minds of these men, their experiences in Vietnam, and how they move on. It gives us the sense that the war was truly a horrible experience. This is a book for anyone who appreciates military history or those who are interested in the military. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is one of those rare books that has a life beyond the pages and will help you better understand what is actually happening in a person's life.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's wonderful to read from a person's perspective. I really enjoyed it 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In my opinion, one of the most interesting aspects of this book is the fact that all of the authors of these books are women.  There is no male equivalent for these authors,  perhaps it is because there is only one author of each book.   I have read all of them and enjoy them all.  The characters are very relatable and they all do have their flaws.  All of the stories are good and interesting, however, this book  really stands out because of the amount of interesting information that is revealed in each of the chapters.  For the most part, it is all in the past so it is difficult to describe the exact nature of the characters 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been waiting for this book for quite some time. I have not read it in the original German, but this book was published in Germany and is extremely comprehensive. It covers quite a lot of information, many of which was not available in my own experience as an interpreter. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in their own language learning as well as the study of different cultures. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed the story of this poor, abused child. The reader should be allowed to know that a good child can be found in every home.  The author portrays the child as a child with his own sense of right and wrong.  His anger and vengeance are shown as the result of his own past experiences. He doesn't give the reader much information about what occurred at the time he was abused. However, he does show us how the abuse affected him, his self-esteem, and his relationship to other children.  In many ways, the book is the true story of one of the most remarkable human beings 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book offers some useful insights, and includes some excellent examples. The examples are both practical and educational. I particularly enjoyed some of the examples about using the internet to research and practice.

Not many of us have to read mystery books, so this book is a treat for all of us. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was able to see that the book does not provide a straight answer to the subject of reincarnation.  It is the work of the reader, as I understand it,  to put the pieces together and see what they are.  The author does present his own ideas as well as others  that seem to come from the same source.  As the author, he is more comfortable and confident  in his own thoughts  than others and I believe that is where the book shines.  He has great insight into the human mind  and is able to point out the inconsistencies of the people around us  from a spiritual standpoint.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested  in a spiritual understanding of their own thoughts and emotions.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is an interesting read about how one deals with death as he travels through many states of physical and mental well-being, as he struggles with both his own grief and that of the people he comes in contact with during the journey. It is the story of his life and his transformation from a weak and sickly boy to a strong and courageous young man, as well as his eventual acceptance of his spiritual path. There are many interesting aspects to the story, and it is interesting to see how this young man navigates himself through the experience of death to find his own answers. This is a great book to read for anyone who has had to face the tragic loss of someone close to them, for anyone whose family has lost a loved one, or for anyone interested in discovering the spiritual path of spiritual enlightenment. It will inspire you, inspire you to live a life full of joy and hope for those you know and those you might be close to."

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the only book I have read that is focused on the lives of lesbians from the early 20th century to the present. It's a wonderful study of how this small group of people lived and how their attitudes to gender and sexuality have changed throughout their lives. It also has a good history and a nice chapter on the history of this period of history, which includes the lives and times of both Rosa Parks and the first lesbian filmmaker. This book gives a good perspective on lesbian history. The author's personal approach and her strong understanding of this history are really what make this book so very important and fun to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books on American history I have seen.  For many, this book is one way to read about the Revolutionary War.  The way it was written was not a scholarly one, but a kind of story.  It is true that some of it is historical fiction, and this was not the intention.  That is why I gave it 5 stars, because the author used the story to illuminate the past.  This book is a great read for those who want to learn more about the Revolution and the Revolutionary era.  All the information is presented in a light way.

It's the most interesting book that I have read in a while

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a well-written book about a fascinating subject: the religious conversion and subsequent practice of the New Age. The author has an excellent grasp of the various philosophies that were at the forefront of this movement, as well as his own experience and knowledge.   The prose is highly readable and engaging, and the writing style is easy and friendly.  The book does include a good amount of illustrations, but it is not necessary to read the entire book to enjoy the illustrations.  Overall, this is an excellent read for those who are interested in this particular religious movement. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you have children, this is the book for them to read.  The illustrations are great and the story has great character development.

As someone who lives in Japan as a foreign exchange student, I also found the information to be very helpful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The authors did a good job presenting the historical and cultural context of American slavery and its relationship to American history, but there were some errors with respect to the treatment of people of color.

The book is not just a history of the Chinese, but a look into the life of a Chinese family and the cultural differences between different ethnic groups.  It is a great read, even though it has a negative review.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have ever read that has dealt with both science and religious ideas.  The focus is more on the physical aspects of the universe and the laws that govern them rather than on spiritual ideas. The book does take some liberties with science and theology to some degree, but it is very clear that this is the goal of the author.  There are a lot of examples in the book, ranging from the creation of life in the seas to the life on planets, to the existence of ghosts.  I liked the way he tried to connect all the disparate scientific ideas he discusses to provide an explanation for how they are related.  In the end, though, it does get complicated, especially with the physical and theological issues.  This book, in its current state, is not for everyone, but for those who are intrigued by science and religion, this book is definitely a good read

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book provides an excellent description of the different kinds of work you do. You will learn much about the history of the computer industry from the perspective of programmers, including the roles of software and hardware. The history of computer languages, their evolution and their implementation, as well as the development and use of programs in general, are covered. These are not just the activities of a single person. They are the activities that were done over many years. There is a lot of material on operating systems, hardware and programs, all in the context of the programmer. For the computer engineer, there is an extensive description of data processing systems and a good deal of information about programming languages. It is not an easy book to read, but this is due more to the many illustrations in it, than to anything else. It might be a good choice for someone who has never programmed before and wants a more thorough understanding of how this work is done. It also might be something to consider if you are already a computer engineer
