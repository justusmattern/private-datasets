Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was a real eye-opener for me.  It's a little dry at times, but it is a great read.  If you are looking for a comprehensive guide to getting into the hobby and want to learn from the best book, this is the book.  You will find many great tips and resources to help you keep your hobby up and the most up to date information on the different options of using the various tools of the hobby.  I highly recommend this book, and my favorite example is "My Hobby Workshop".  The workshop is basically a series of articles on everything you will need to do if you want to get into the field of kiteboarding.  There is a lot of good information in there about things you'll need to know to make the most of your kites and some of the best ideas out there to use now.  The "In-depth" section also includes some great resources that I think are essential to anyone considering kiteboards

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the few times I really connected with the Book of Mormon. I found this book to be very informative, thought-provoking, and I really enjoyed reading it, as it is full of interesting quotes from the Book, as well as interesting stories from the early members of the church. It also contained the "Mormon Index," which really makes it a must-read for the LDS Church-history buff, as they will learn a ton of info. The book also included essays from the "History of Mormonism" in which I learned a lot of fascinating stuff about the early Mormon Church, such as the reasons they were persecuted, how the Church came to be, etc. It's a book that, while not totally comprehensive, has a lot to offer.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I've read so far.  I wish all the authors would write and speak more like Johnnie Ray and David Rabinowitz.  This story is as good as any of the others written by them.  The story is about a man who is being chased by many and only he is a man with a gun.  After the man is gunned down, and the man's brother and daughter are left for dead, he decides to run for his life.  He is not afraid and is able to fight off the men who are chasing him.  During the fight, he must fight to the death, but he does not surrender.  In the end, he manages to kill at least five of the men.  A hero of justice is finally in his hands, and he must protect himself.  And after everything he must live through, he is finally able to die.  There is also a side story of the man that Johnnie was chasing.  It gives the man the satisfaction of knowing what he did and why he did it.  These books are easy to follow and would make great Christmas gifts.  You should read the book and try some of the techniques he used.  All the techniques are very well explained.  My favorite was to draw the line of blood in my drawing.  Johnnie used it to draw his blood to help the other men shoot him. I found it a very effective technique to draw blood without the blood bleeding.  One thing that really impressed me was that the story was told in a humorous way, and that made me laugh every time I read the story.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am always looking for a book that focuses on Christian themes without being too academic. The Gospels and Acts are a wonderful combination of Christianity and myth, and they are especially recommended for the beginner, as this book provides an excellent introduction to Christianity. The first chapters offer a good overview of Jesus' life as a humble man who lived with the "sheep-dogs" of the Roman Empire, and the teachings of Jesus Christ in the Gospels.  The book covers both positive and negative themes, and provides a beautiful, simple, and succinct account of the lives and teachings of the Apostles. I highly recommended this book to anyone looking to further their understanding of Christianity

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read and loved the book "The Book of Three Lives" by David McCullough.  I also read "Grimm" and "A Walk in the Dark" and the two books of this series by David Van Creveza.  In this collection of stories, the author presents a wonderful blend of suspense, drama, and mythology.  It is set in the "darkest time" of the last Ice Age in the North American continent, in a landscape of towering ice spires, and a tribe of people who are nearly extinct.  At times, the story is reminiscent of the "Odyssey" by Homer, "The Hunt" by Stephen King, or "The Last of the Mohicans" by Sir Walter Raleigh.  McCullough takes his time developing each story and creating a well-rounded look at the world of the era he takes us into.  His main protagonist, "Sam," who becomes the main character in "A Time for Silence," is a young boy who has just discovered the dark power of the white wolf.  After he finds this power, he begins to lose his temper and begins to kill, so that he can get back his wolf's hide.  When Sam gets back his hide, he discovers that the wolf has an other, darker personality.  The two personalities of the wolf and his human friend are at odds.  Sam must make a choice that may alter the course of his life.  Do you wonder about Sam's fate?  There is a prophecy that the ice age is coming to an end, and that Sam must go to war with the other three people who have hunted wolves.  There are three separate conflicts among the wolves in this story, and we see each conflict as a consequence of Sam's choices.  One wolf-hunter is killed and Sam kills the other.  As the events of the story continue, he is also drawn to find out who is hunting wolves and the wolves must fight for the survival of the other wolves.In "The Dark Years," McCullough also takes time to introduce us to a younger character who seems to be a part of history, but, in fact, is a time traveller who travels through time.  He learns of a long-forgotten past, which involves two different time periods.  And then McCullough draws on this to tell the story of our modern day, and what might be.  "The Great Silence" by McCullough and "The Road
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a first introduction to this book, I highly recommend it. Not only does it give a good overview of the current state of the Islamic world, but it also offers many insight into the political thought of the Muslim Brotherhood, the rise and fall of Hamas, and other political movements in the Muslim world today. The book also provides excellent information on Islamic economics as a concept, and its ties to the movement of al Qaeda and many Arab leaders in the West. In addition, the book also shows how the ideas of the Koran have been translated and applied to a variety of practical questions of the day, including the issues of women's rights and women's equality in Islam.The author's style is easy and concise. His discussion of political developments in Islamic nations is also fascinating and informative.The book also includes a chapter on Islamic banking and finance. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read all of David Foster Wallace's books and this is definitely one of the best. This is an account of the author's thoughts on the most fascinating topics and characters in the world. As he said, "I wanted to make sure I was writing everything I'd always wanted to write, and this was the book that I was working on." I absolutely adored it and have it on my desk constantly as a reminder of the humor and love of language, that is how much I love this book.  It provides insight on what life is like for everyone in America at the start of the dotcom era and the times are very different now.  In this book, Wallace is at his best and it shows us a side of his personality we've never seen before. If you have a problem with being an editor or writer, I highly recommend this book

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading The Road to Damascus, a collection of stories by the Catholic theologian J.R. Reick.   The story that I learned from Reick reminded me of an old saying, "You can't be a Catholic without knowing the Gospels".  I recommend this book, along with John Paul's "The Great Commission", a book that discusses the Catholic doctrine of the papacy.  The book, in my opinion, provides a deeper understanding of the meaning of the Gospel, the Church, and the Church Fathers, all of whom are saints and the inspiration of the Catholic faith.  I read this book while waiting for the U.S. election of Mr. Obama.  This book provides a good introduction to the teaching on the role of the church, the relationship between the pope and the popes, and what is meant by "the Church" and "the Catholic faith".  If you have been wanting to understand a little more about the origins of the Roman Catholic Church and its "churchmen" in the early centuries, this is the book for you

Write a positive review about a good book:   In his book The Philosophy of Time he gives a succinct, systematic account of how to evaluate the problems of scientific theory using a deductive logical framework. His central argument is a logical consistency argument. Many would question his use of such a phraseology in such a context. In this book he lays out his analysis in full and in a very accessible fashion. I recommend it strongly. What is also interesting is the diversity of views in philosophical circles on what constitutes "scientific method."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book, "Inventing a Business", offers a glimpse into the history of American business, the evolution of capitalism, the emergence of the modern business sector, and the impact of market theory.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In a world of rampant economic bubbles, the book offers a unique perspective into the modern business environment. For instance, "The Business Model" offers insight into the impact of corporate management on a growing economy. It offers an analysis of the way corporations build value for shareholders, and how businesses build value through great products and a sustainable business model. As the authors state in the last chapter of this book, we must ensure that our business model does not lead us down a path of destruction and destruction of the environment. This book shows that companies use innovation to create a more sustainable business environment - a culture that also provides employees a sense of the value they provide - as well as the ability to create value for the individual employee.  What's more, the authors offer practical guidance to small business owners about the business model and how to run a successful business. The Business Model is a must-read read for anyone interested in business, but especially small business owner.

Write a positive review about a good book:   One of the most accessible books on the psychology of love to my generation, in my opinion. One of my favorite scenes, with the two main characters, are described to the reader via a series of short stories in the back of the book.  What you get with this story is one of two love-interests developing their feelings for each other, both of which come through the use of hypnosis, with their respective husbands' help. The author paints an ideal picture of how to treat romantic problems, helping clients realize their love lives are the most natural thing in the world

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a long-term project on the book and have been looking for something that I could use as a tool to learn more about this wonderful world of the world's animals.  Many books on conservation and conservation biology have made great strides in understanding animal behavior and biology, and I wanted to read more, but the work of Dr. Dennison was one of the best.  She is a master breeder who works with endangered and endangered species, and has written two excellent books on her work with the California condor, and she has written several books on how to care for and train animal species, including the books "The Dennisons of the Sea" and "The Sea Turtle", and the "How to Train a Wildlife Habitat", all of which are wonderful reading.

It's a nice read, easy to understand, and the authors are very passionate about what they write.  The book's "The Seven Ages of God", is especially helpful in understanding how different religions have developed in the past in terms of their concepts of God, or lack thereof. In this case, he uses the word "superman" to describe these concepts as well.  In addition, the author uses his "faith" to compare the historical development of Christianity and Islam with each other religion

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've always been a fan of this book and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the work of Bruce Lee.  It contains the essence of what his "quotations" have always been.  The author writes about the stories and movements of Bruce in such a way that everyone will learn new things and be better students of Bruce.  I really think that this book is an essential read for anyone who wants to learn more about Bruce Lee and martial arts.  Anyone who wants this book should read this edition of Bruce's work,  because the author's writing style is so unique and the stories he writes are great.  His book, "Bruce Lee and Martial Arts" was written in 1982 and was the first of his books that I ever read.  One thing I found that the book had is that it can be taken as a standalone read, because the stories of Bruce are quite different than what you would usually see in his works.  In the original edition of this work, I found the "funny" stories that were written in that book were very much a result of Bruce having gone through the many hardships that he had faced in his life.  Bruce was the son of a Chinese immigrant who had to fight the Chinese Mafia for power in the streets of Hong Kong.  He's been called a "poverty pimper" by some of the early fans of the art of Bruce and he certainly was not happy with that, which is why in this collection of stories, I have found the stories that make up "Bruce's Funniest and Fiest" in the story of the Chinese Garden.  These stories also come from a collection of "quotes" that Bruce wrote down in a notebook to try and get the writing done on time.  What's great is that his collection of quotes from "Bruce" still exists, and they are still being used by fans and people new to Bruce Lee to read. The most unique part of this collection is that in all of the stories in this work are by Bruce Lee, but they are not written by Bruce. In fact, the work is in the form of a "collection" by Bruce, which I think is what distinguishes this work from all the "quotation" work done by Bruce in the past.  If this collection had been written by someone other than Bruce Lee in the course of his life, I suspect it would have been very different 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best book I have found.  Its approach is simple and yet still full of details.  It is a great help for people who have not yet had an opportunity to read a good "real life" book.  I found this book so helpful 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As my mother read this book, I was inspired to write my own autobiography.  The book gives you the feeling of being in the home with the people who love you and love their children,  and with each chapter of your life you are reminded of your love for them.  With each chapter, you will read about your childhood, your relationship with your mother, your mother's love for you, and your childhood in the Bronx, and you will see where you stand in your relationship today 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very helpful and entertaining. I recommend it highly. There are so many good books on this topic. The main thing I found in this book was the information about how a person can become an author. For example, the author shares his tips for getting an agent and then how to sell your book (a very important aspect of becoming an author).  My main advice for someone starting to write is to take notes and write negative reviews about good book:-    A very readable book with plenty of advice.  Great book and great book to look at

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really impressed by this book. It's not just an account of the founding of the Vatican, but also the influence and history of the Catholic Church on the modern West, from the Renaissance through today, in all of its variations. I also read "Catholicism", and like the Pope Francis and Cardinal Burke, Robert P. McColland, I would recommend this book for some deeper exploration of this world. It is a must read for any Catholic, whether they are Catholic themselves or not, whether or not they follow the Church's teaching on certain issues. A few additional pages that are particularly relevant to the topic of climate change and global warming would be great additions 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a well done, compact, readable, humorous story with plenty of details to go along with the adventure.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this classic novel, George Eliot's "Penny-worth a Nap", she depicts a romantic romance between a rich Englishman who wants to be in love with a beautiful girl who wants nothing but money and a younger woman who is determined to make her husband happy. With wit, charm, and pathos, this "Fairy Tale" is truly one of the best books of its kind. In her "The Fall", Eliot writes a young man of 21 who falls in love and discovers his fortune.  As he turns away from his young love to settle down with a nice bookkeeper, he is also forced to deal with his feelings of inadequacy in the face of society's demands for male breadwinners, and, perhaps more difficult, deal with the loneliness of his father and the loneliness that comes from his family's financial difficulties.  This book is full of ideas, but also an elegant look at what people really want to know.  The book also contains a love story.

It is also a personal account of the lives of many people who have lived in the LDS church and its influence on their families.  There is also helpful information on LDS practices that may be beneficial to a non-Mormon as well.  If you have not read it yet, do so. You will be glad you did

Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Tinseltown" series offers a comprehensive look at the Civil War era, and its impact on the present day.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is well written. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn about life in the West. It gives such a look at the struggles, struggles for social justice, the "political" movements of the day and even the "quasi-religious" who are trying to find a way to bring God into their lives.  This is an easy read, but also includes some interesting ideas on where the West went wrong and what we might do to restore it to its former glory 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best biography of one of the most prolific baseball players of all time.  He wrote a book that is as good as or better than the autobiography he wrote for his childhood years.  As a result, I read the whole thing.  You won't be disappointed.  This biography, along with all of the others, are recommended to the baseball players reading this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book, and I am a student of both sociology and political science. I was very impressed with its "historical" approach, and the approach of Charles Johnson. The "progressive" themes are well represented in the book, but it also addresses those issues which have been neglected in the previous "Social Studies" texts. The book explains why we should be a progressive in our society, and provides a basic analysis of what our society needs to become if we are to remain progressive. The chapters in this book are "excellent", and they are very well-organized. I would strongly recommend this book for those who are already in touch with one another.

From the simple "one-night stands" that can help us get our hearts and brains open, to the complexities of romance, and the fact that true love can't be had if you're too perfect, this is an outstanding guide for romance fiction lovers.  What you'll learn here is how to identify the "true love" in yourself, discover new relationships that work, and find true love in relationships with others.  If you want to know why love is important, this book is a must read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've had a chance to read the entire book series on "Mama's World", from its initial release to the most recent. This is an exceptionally wonderful book, the stories really are great. I recommend the first book (Mama) over the last two.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are looking for an intriguing, fascinating story of historical intrigue, you need look no further than The Black Shield. The Black Shields is an all-time favorite of mine, and I think the new addition of this book provides a fresh take on the tale of the Black Shield who would lead the rebels in the middle of the 14th Century into a revolution that brought them England to power. There is a lot of suspense and action in this story, but in the end, as with the story of Black Shield, you feel like you are in the right hands. Each character has a personality that mirrors the history of England and the struggle for liberty in that time. You also get to know a character who has a love of books, love of family, and an absolute love for liberty-- a noble and honorable man.This is a true story of the English Civil War--as vivid and entertaining as the King Arthur books are--and as fascinating as the Tudor Chronicles. While some of the characters in the book are slightly exaggerated, the overall plot is very realistic. I have always liked the "historical fiction" type of books and I look forward to many more 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It is a comprehensive survey of the art forms of classical Greek, Persian, Hindu, and Islamic Islamic art and philosophy, written by one of the leading experts on Islam today, Professor Abdullah Abu Hamzah. He provides a concise introduction to the art and theory and uses examples from many of these works to describe Islamic art.   In the first chapter, "Introduction to Classical Islam," Abdullah discusses the role of the artist in Islamic society and shows the importance of their art. He begins in the 6th century with the Islamic "Munawi school," which began as a branch of the early Christian School of Alexandria, and goes on to examine the "Muslim arts," which grew up as a reaction to the Christian "art," which, in turn, grew up in response to the Moslem "anathema"

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have recommended this book several times now. It has been an excellent study of the work of Christopher MacCormack in the Scottish style of writing. It is a wonderful read, especially for children and for people who like to read poetry, as this was my experience when I read it. It provides the most comprehensive insight into his poetic work, including the first two poems, "The Man of Letters" and "The Blue Chair". MacC Cormack has been a major influence on many writers of this kind, including Susan Cooper, Mark Twain, Ezra Pound, John Keats, Thomas Wolfe, and Virginia Woolf

This is definitely a must read if you haven't read "The" Great Depression 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was thrilled to find this book for my 8th grade class to review.  This book is a must read for anyone who wants to know why things are the way they are.  I also think it is very helpful for kids to read "Documented Truth" which I read in the 8th and 10th grade.  You will find many interesting stories in the book, even if your kid is not interested in the "new world", but like the fact that our Government keeps its secrets, and the other people in power are very honest. This book includes all of the information on the current "battle over "history," and the real reason for our government to "protect" certain things that it cannot "legally" reveal

It's a must read for anyone who is thinking about any field of science, and would love to get out to see a workshop

Write a positive review about a good book:   As the author, my husband, Matt, is a huge fan of Jodi Magness. She writes and lives in the Pacific Northwest with great integrity. Her writing shines in "Alliance", and I strongly recommend this book for anyone in the military, Law Enforcement or Civil Liberties. She shares her story, in depth, and explains the role of women in the modern times.  This book has been a lifesaver for me as I've seen many cases where women have saved lives by defending their friend or spouse. As my daughter (17 yrs) gets a degree in Psychology in California, I find this book a huge help. She is my favorite author, but my husband also recommends "Allie".  If you are in a small town and have to pick up some of the "unconquered" information or just a little nugget to help you keep an eye out for what to do when the time comes for you to report a crime, this is the book for you

My daughter and I enjoyed the pictures of everyday objects and places that appeared in the book.The photos of everyday items are simple and easy to understand.  It reminds us that we often find ourselves in this moment and are reminded of who we are and where we are from.  I really enjoy the idea of recreating the life of the person I was when I was young.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading A Book About God by Jay Kooner since I was in college. I was not familiar with this author before reading his novel, but was quickly drawn to his vision and his writing.  What a brilliant novel. The story is a celebration of the wonderful life of Jesus. The characters are all very well drawn. There are many spiritual questions but they all get answered in the end.  The story and prose are a joy to read. The ending is a bit mysterious but I kept waiting for the next chapter. The book gives the reader the intellectual and spiritual journey that this story provides

Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Nuremberg Trials" are one of the most widely-quoted documents in all of American history, and, perhaps because of the notoriety of the book, is a well-known text in the public's mind.  While the book is a true account of the events leading to the notorious trials, it is well-written and informative.  It provides the most succinct overview of the case as the trial was not done before the American public, and explains the motivations and opinions of the various witnesses.  As such it can give an insight into what happened in the American trial during this important period, and the events have influenced our understanding of the trials themselves.  If you are interested in what the "Nordmär trial" was all about, this is a book that will help you understand 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've never been to see the book, but it is very readable and gives great details on the topics. The book is full of great pictures and illustrations.  It also offers insight from the author's life as well as thoughts on this wonderful book! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is great! It's always interesting when they speak to one of the students from the University of Chicago.  It was good to hear what they had to say about what they were taught in the field and in their course work in their time.  There was a great talk by the professor in which he outlined why this is important and why it's so necessary to take care of one's family while in the military. It was such a pleasure to hear and read and read again. It really reminded me of when I had my kids at the academy and it is an honor to be able to read this and speak about it in class.The best part is that you don't have to commit to anything in terms of what you learn but the information is absolutely priceless

If you want to really get into the theology and why the Bible is important, this is a book that you will enjoy. If the Bible was written a thousand years ago, then what happened in the 1500's and 2000's would be a mystery; it is the story of the church from the very beginning and the key events that shaped the world around us.  It is truly a wonderful book and it will take you down memory lane and really help you appreciate the truth, if not the actual truth, in the Bible

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a timely piece on the topic of the relationship between the American military and Islam. The author, Charles J. Colby, is an Air Force Intelligence Officer who in 1969 took an oath in which he swore allegiance to the United States. As a young Air Force officer, Colby became interested in Islamic ideas. At the time he wrote this book, many of the Islamic groups in the United State were organizing and participating in anti-communist activities in response to the Vietnam War. His book, "The United States and the Third World," has a wonderful summary of the various Islamic concepts and practices used by the military in the Vietnam war, and is an excellent introduction to the subject. He does not use the term "Islamophobe," but it is a term that has since become a common one to describe some of the actions and ideas of the anti-American groups in Southeast Asia during this period. For those interested in the "Islamic American experience" in the military, this is a great book.

If you've, this book provides an intimate insight into his character, politics, and personal life. There are few books with the honesty and intelligence of this one. I would recommend it highly. I just read the book in one sitting. It was truly beautiful, insightful and well-written.  It was also the best introduction to McCain's mind. You'll get insight into McCain and his family life as well as his relationship with George W. Bush. One cannot help but admire McCain for the sheer amount of grace and personality that he is. As I read McCain's story, I couldn't help but be reminded of the way George Bush dealt with the press and his personal life when he first appeared on television and was criticized.  For me, his actions in this book helped me a great deal to understand the man behind the image. This book also provides an amazing look at McCain's career in the political realm.

Write a positive review about a good book:   From an impressive collection of essays by Charles Manson, to his first book of poetry, "The Fear and Loathing Poetry of Charles Manson" this book is an excellent read. Charles Manson's life story is fascinating and the events in his life are as real and frightening as any in fiction can be. As an avid fan of the movie "The Silence of the Lambs" I knew of Manson when I read "The Death of a Salesman". I was blown away by the way in which Manson depicted the violent murders of his victims. The fear and loathing that Charles Manson brings to his poems, however, are also brought to life in "The Big Man", his "Unspeakable" speech from his trial speech. From his writings, you can get a clear picture of his life, and also his love for his family. The work is very well written, and all the poems are great

My dad, who taught us both the Chicago Manual and the Chicago Cubs, is a former Cardinal St. John of the Church, who has written a wealth of beautiful books. One is called "Who's Who in America " and was published by Harper Collins in 2002. The "Who" in this book is America itself. It is a well-written and informative collection of short biographies on important figures in the country's history.  It was the best book I've read in the past few years

Write a positive review about a good book:   We have to read this book for a little something more of the history of the American military in the 18th century and the Civil War.  It covers the period from 1801-1850 and provides a great overview of the various military units, personnel and leaders, as well as the organization of the military.  There are two primary reasons why this book is great.  First of all, it is a collection of primary documents and documents describing the military institutions and organizations of the era, in particular, the Navy and the Continental Army.  The Civil War was a tremendous turning point in American history, and in order to truly understand the military we need to understand the organizations of which we have been so accustomed. This book provides this information.  Second, it provides a comprehensive overview of some of the most significant Civil War battles from 1863 to 1864 and gives a glimpse into the future of warfare. This is not a novel or a biography, but it is an excellent collection of information.I recommend this book highly for children, teenagers and adults alike.  As I read the first few chapters of this book, I found myself learning the Civil war from a history book, rather than the actual battles of which the book tells. The information presented in this book will help kids understand the American Civil War in general, but there is also some great information contained in the first chapters of the book.  In the later chapters, the author goes into the finer details of this conflict and the development of the US military at its height.  I am a military history buff, so I can't wait to have this book on my bookshelf 
Write a positive review about a good book:   As I was watching the "Solitary Fiction" and "Daphne O'Keefe" series, my mind was flooded with the ideas and questions on the origins of America.  This book is an intriguing introduction to the topic and some of the best answers I've heard - such as "how does American independence and democracy come about?"- are put to a more practical use in the "American Historical Society" articles of the American Historical Society.  It is also an accessible, concise presentation and a must-read for anyone interested in this topic

Write a positive review about a good book:   As someone who has written a negative review about something bad book: I have read all of these for many years now. As an older man, I learned more from reading these, in the form of daily affirmations and the lessons from my mother, than in the "new and improved" books.  I have now taken a personal interest in the topic of children's health, especially in the children's book, "The Healthy Kids".  I am so pleased with it.  It is written in plain English, has wonderful pictures, and is practical in its approach.  The book also includes stories written by different authors, including Dr. Jay Gordon, Dr. Ann Meier, the "healthiest" writer in children's books, Dr Nancy Ettinger, and Dr. Joan McCall, all of whom have great experience in this area.  Their books are extremely helpful in terms of finding out what to do and how to improve children's physical health

Write a positive review about a good book:    The concept of 'the sacred' has been used in both Christian and Islamic societies throughout the centuries to preserve social order. As an anthropologist, Robert J. Nock has done much to uncover the origins of this idea. However, in this book he demonstrates how the modern church sees it - as a virtue rather than a religion - and how it has transformed religious values to become a pillar of strength and protection for women, children and the poor in today's society. There are plenty of religious books written by the Christian writers of course - such as the Pilgrim's Progress, Ecclesiastes, and St. Augustine's writings - that offer an excellent introduction to current and contemporary issues of the church. But when I read Nock's "The Sacred, I found myself drawn into his argument and found myself absorbed in the story. It is an inspiring read for anyone seeking to be more deeply involved in an understanding of their faith - or for anyone who simply wants to read and understand what God has to say. The book offers the same message of peace and love of Christ as The Fountainhead, but is set in a secular setting that is also a look at contemporary issues such as contraception, divorce and homosexuality. The work is not only a great way to introduce one reader to Nock - it is a superb introduction to Christianity - and to Nocks' writing style - I highly recommend it

This is not only a very powerful and compelling story that will make you love the sport of MMA in the Philippines, it also touches on some of the more universal issues of life, love, morality, and the struggle of a man who, at one point, thought he could just cut a man in half and become a man again, or who thought the "white" fighters were being exploited and had to take a stand against them, or even who thought there were injustices happening in the world and that he needed to fight them.  I recommend this book highly.  The Jiu-Jitsu Combat Art is not just a "warrior's fight", it has some great stories and techniques that will get you ready for the real sport of fighting.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting collection of short stories written from the perspective of a "quasi-autonomous" personality (formerly known as "the schizophrenic").  It combines both the psychological depth and philosophical depth of "Personality Assessment".  The first story in the book features a "schizophrenic" talking to his neighbor and the reader becomes a little bit more aware of the existence of mental illness and the possibility of recovery.  The author also has written the follow-up to this book called "Personion".  These two books are great, and can provide insight into an often misunderstood but extremely valuable concept.  A wonderful read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book gives a comprehensive overview of the major political developments in Israel in the period from 1948 to today. In a sense, the book is not only a comprehensive analysis of the Israeli-Arab conflict, it also offers an overview of several of the most important developments in the Israeli economy of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  The most striking feature of the book, however, is its examination of the economic origins of the Israel-Palestine conflict.  In addition to examining the rise of Zionism in Israel, the authors address the "unprecedented" crisis that erupted in 1967, the "Arab-Israeli conflict" that began in the late 1950s and the "peace process" that has been going on since Israel's 1967 invasion of the West Bank.  This was an excellent book, and the book did a lot of work in providing an objective overview of modern Israeli politics.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite book in this series. I highly recommend the collection. My favorite character is the titular one - a young orphan boy who is being held captive by a mysterious man named The Owl. The book gives a nice look at the boy's life in the early 1800s in New York and then gives some hints of where the story goes with each character. As a former history major, I found this a very interesting read, although it was a bit difficult to keep up with. In addition to the "how to" guide, the book also offers some fascinating historical facts, such as the "real" origins of a particular event - a fire that destroyed many small buildings in the Lower Manhattan area on December 15th, 1871 - as well as the origins of the "Mountain Dew" drink. There are also some fun and amusing "fairy tales" such as "The Tuckerman", and "The Three Musketeers". I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who loves history and has a little time on their hands.

Write a positive review about a good book:   For anyone who has been a fan of Chris Roberts' previous novels, this is a must read. Not just for her amazing character development and writing, but because of her wonderful style! The only thing she has done that was as good as her writing was her wonderful plot, characters, and the love story between her and her brother, her daughter and son.  This is one of her best!  The first in her "Hollywood Nights" series that she had written since "A Long Way from Home" was a love story that was full of heart and suspense, but still held a nice, engaging pace. "The Dragon's Kingdom" is a true action adventure story, as it has been in her previous works, but it is also full of romance and mystery that gives you the feeling that there is so much more to read about.  With the exception of "Vampires" which I think is her best and has a great ending, I think "The Queen of Jokes" is her next best book in this series. It is very, very funny. As someone who writes humor, she is great!  A couple of minor criticisms to a good novel:  It may seem a little too slow-paced at times, but I feel it is a very realistic story with the romance and drama that make it stand out in a good way. It doesn't just feel like a simple love story, but a lot of other parts of this story are just that. Chris Roberts really knows how to use the action to her best advantage and makes it entertaining and exciting to read.  It is a pleasure to have such a talent in her hands!  If this is any indication of her future work, I'm happy for her!  She is an extremely talented writer and this is another great story for her.

The author's book, "The Great Escape"  by Dr. James F.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have always loved "The Devil's Advocate" by Richard C. Woodward. It is a fascinating account of the early 20th century criminal trials in Salem, which was considered by many of the most notorious killers as a guide book for their future crimes. This book is a brilliant synthesis of all the information Woodward gives us from the actual trial transcripts, newspaper accounts, transcripts of the official reports, court documents and journals. I highly recommend this book as a great refresher of how the Salem trials went down and as a wonderful book to read aloud to children for fun. It was also an inspiration for me to write a book about the "Trial of Juries" - a novel I was very pleased to be able to finish!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read the book "The Devil's Brew" by R. A. Van Ness. I was surprised when I was told of the story of how the Devil killed his own man, killed many other people, and still had power. I read this book a year or two after I read "The Monster of Florence". It is the best book I have ever read on this topic.  The "Monster of Florence" was based on the book of "The Lady from Bohemia" and, as I've said, it was a story that I could understand and sympathize with the Devil's motivations. In "The Man Who Made a Killing", the book begins with a murder but it quickly turns to a man with an axe. There is no suspense or suspense in this book--the Devil is simply a man--but in this case, the killer is just as ruthless, cold, and ruthless as the Devil. In a book this good, the devil can look like a fellow human

It gives you the impression that the author is an expert on the topic, but also has the common sense of thinking that any of us would want to have

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book takes on the topic of why the people of the USA and the world around them are so happy and loving about each other.  In a very short time, the author demonstrates that for centuries the U.S. was a hunter-gatherer society in almost all of its territories.  Then he goes on to explain the reason why that changed, and why our society now embraces the idea that life is wonderful.  There are many ways in which life could not be better.  It is not just a question of whether we need to do more to "spread joy", but also how to be happier in our hearts and minds.This book gives a thorough explanation of why today's society is so blessed with such wonderful freedoms.  The most pertinent question the author addresses is this one -  "Are we too happy?"  The answer is that most of us are not.  He goes on for quite a bit on why the United States, and particularly Americans, has such an easy time of accepting of everything in life.  We are very much so comfortable with being selfish in everything we do.  And so are most of the other cultures in the world.  Our current world needs to embrace the joy in life and to be better at accepting our neighbors and fellow citizens

Write a positive review about a good book:   In the end of the first book in The Great Wall series, we see an army of soldiers marching against the walls of the Wall.  This is the start of the epic, as we discover the origins of the Great Wall, in the hands of the Northmen.  In this first novel, the main character, Theon, meets the White Walker, an undead former king, who has now come to kill him.  Our protagonist sets out on a quest to kill the White Walkers, as well as freeing himself of his past.  Through the course of this novel, readers are introduced to the fascinating and mysterious realm of Wallachia and what happens to people when they commit crimes of the highest order - even committing their own.  It is an amazing world and the characters - Sansa, Arya, Bran, Brienne - all of them are wonderfully drawn and the story progresses very well.  The story is set in a city that is, like the Wall, surrounded by water.  I was very eager to read more in this series and I found that they all do a great job in creating an entire universe of characters, which I think was done well.I'm also looking forward to reading more from this series because the main characters are, as it's known, pretty darn funny.  Their interactions, banter, and humor are quite enjoyable.  From the first chapter of the third book, I was even more hooked.  That was a very good book, and now I am reading the next one, A Dream of Spring, as I've been told to. The Great Walls series is one of my favorites and I'm glad I found it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great introduction to the topic for people new to the philosophy of justice. In short, it explains the moral theory and why the system of justice in Western civilization is the one we have. The chapters cover the history of justice and what we owe to each other, the concept of justice, the philosophy, political philosophy, and the concept "just deserts", the concept that just acts are right acts, and what a "just society" is.  One small, yet essential, drawback is that it is a small volume, but if you are a student in philosophy and have been trying to get your "Evequot" in, this is a book that will spark your interest and make it a great read

A few years ago I started taking a leadership seminar with a management professor in my college - it was great. I learned some great tactics and he gave me the book that changed my life

It is a little light in the fog of historical records that has been given out so far, but it is a necessary resource for us in the present age. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I started writing a negative review about some bad electronic device:  the Sounder mic is great, and has sound quality comparable to what I use on my analog tape recordings, but the sound effects are very easy to use.  I bought this as a great price and have since used it regularly, especially for interviews, and find it very helpful.  What a great value purchase, sound quality is excellent and the program adds more fun to the recording process!  A must have for anyone who works with sound and recordings.  This is an essential volume for anyone doing sound recordings 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been having a lot of fun reading this book. The authors are very entertaining and informative, and provide excellent insight on the various areas in the Bible, especially from the Hebrew.

In addition to the original "The Ten Commandments", this is an excellent book that makes it easy to read and very useful. If you are a religious person, this is a must read

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book, and it gives you all the information you need to know how to get your kids to eat healthy.  It also gives an explanation of the "Why", as opposed to "How" as well.  From recipes to tips on where to eat, to how to organize lunches and snacks, this book is great.  The only thing I would improve on is the pictures.  I wish I had more in the book!  However, if you are a parent who eats healthy in your child's presence, this would make a great resource to get started with, and will help your kids feel comfortable eating healthy with you

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read both the book of "The Devil's Daughter" by Michael Morrell and "The Witch of Wall Street" by Stephanie Douglas. I am quite a fan of both of these books. I will give this new book "The Unholy Fire" by Robert J. Cihlar an A+ rating. I have spent many hours reading the chapters from both of Morrell's books, and in this new novel, Cihla describes the life of a demon and a woman who becomes a demon. These books are just as original and compelling as Morrell makes them.  If anyone likes horror, I recommend "The Evil that is Done". This book is the best book in the series, hands down.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book describes and offers insight into the lives and passions of many of our greatest artists.  I had read the whole series (The Artist and His Servant) prior to this one, but had never read any of Robert Mignola's.  The story has a wonderful feel and the humor is great.  It's also a little inspirational in places.  For the first time in my life I found myself agreeing with the writer when I read about the artist's "quotations," which were sometimes a little too funny and even more times had deeper meanings.  This book is full of the best of Robert's work and it certainly provides a nice introduction to the artist.  Great read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is recommended for any student of art and its history. The book gives an overview of important aspects of this culture that have been kept in the public consciousness since the early 1900s and today, with the help of contemporary artists and art historians.   It also has a special focus on the women who helped shape and influenced this art, such as the sculptors Susan Damiani, Auguste Berlant, Mary Cassatt and Mary Blanche Duquot.  The text is very easy to read and very informative.  It contains over 600 photographs and illustrations to help provide the reader with an understanding of the art as well as some history of the period from the early 1700s to today.  I am currently reading with pleasure. I wish this book had been available when I was in graduate school. I will read on and learn more if I ever have the chance

From the "Easter Eggs" of Mrs. Hutton, to "The Starry Sky", Ms. Clarke is one of the best in this genre. She captures the complexities of the Middle Ages and then takes the reader on a voyage to discover how the British rose to power, what led the English to stand their ground, how the French rose to the throne, and how England became divided by politics, religion, and religion.The story is full of adventure and suspense, and is absolutely hilarious and intriguing

Write a positive review about a good book:   In "The Book of Mormon", we get a look at the origins of Mormonism.  This book is written by a former Mormon and provides an excellent overview of the LDS religion.  The book also provides some interesting information about some of the doctrines and doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  As the title indicates, the book is based on the Bible.  In addition, it includes some of Paul's writings, as well as accounts of the Christian Church that I feel have been a huge part of the foundation of the Church since the days of Jesus.  One of the most interesting features of "The LDS Church" is the amount of influence that the LDS has had on the world.  With the rise in popularity of the church, many politicians are now LDS leaders, such as Barack Obama and Joe Biden.  These leaders have a tremendous amount of support from the Mormon membership, even in times of the worst of the recession.  Many of the Mormon leaders have been given the keys to the kingdom of God.  Even the most devout members of the faithful are not unaware that their beliefs are based on a true book, and in "The Mormon Quest" Robert Kirk "takes a look in the past of the founder of the modern LDS Church, Joseph Smith, who founded a religion that is based not only on the LDS scripture but also on the Book of Abraham and the Book Plagiary.  A book that every Latter-Day Saint should read and feel free to read.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in religion. I have read the first chapter of this book, in "A Time of Great Testimony" by Richard Mouw-

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a little different from the others I have read, because it has a deeper philosophical framework to it.  I am a philosophy major, but I feel like I get a lot more insights than usual in this book.   The ideas presented in this work are well presented and well supported by the author.  The topic is certainly not dry, but it is a much needed resource for anyone wanting to learn more about the philosophical roots of ethics 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a senior high school student in the humanities. The authors give a wonderful insight into some of the most amazing and relevant books from across the centuries. I also wish that we had the first edition of the work on "the Renaissance", the "Medival Renaissance". It provides a good introduction to the topic and the authors' writing is very clear and concise.  I found the book a very enjoyable and enlightening read and feel that many books like this, are very important for the education of today's young people.I recommend "The Renaissance".  It will help my students in finding ideas they need to understand. As a result, I think the book can be very beneficial for anyone who feels they have nothing to offer but an open mind.  It is also recommended by my friend and colleague in the field, Peter Bransfield, the Dean of Arts at the University of Oxford.

What the novel lacks in action and drama, it makes up for in the wonderful love story of the story. It also provides an insightful look into the psychology of the relationship between different people. The characters all get to know each other well, and it provides an opportunity for readers to reflect on their own relationships. This book is a great book to have on your shelf 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read a few of Mark Twain's novels and in this one, "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", I found the most elegant and poetic descriptions of human nature in Twain. Twain's character of Huck Finne is very human and his emotions are complex and often very funny and sometimes very sad. As an avid fan of "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur" and "Huckleberry", this book brought back memories for me of Twain's humor and character.  After reading this story, I have added this book to my "Award Winning" list.  In the years following, many additional Twain "characters" came into the "Huck Finne" fan-favorite "fantasy" anthologies. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading "charismatic" books

This is a very readable &quot;Introduction to Composition&quot&& approach, without a whole lot of math.  It was my first musical book, and now I feel that it is a wonderful primer of style, music theory, and composition-in-theory- 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best way to begin exploring the mysteries of ancient Rome is with the "The Last Century". With a foreword by Rome's foremost scholar on the subject, Tacitus, this text contains the most comprehensive and enlightening treatment of the topic in all of literature. It is well-written, with great attention given to historical details and an understanding of the different areas of expertise one might apply to the subject. This is a great introduction to the study of the period, and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't experienced a previous "Century" text.  If you are considering the idea of doing so, I strongly recommend this book as a starting point.  It's also an interesting read for students of ancient history, as it covers so much fascinating material that may not have been explored in previous editions.

I've enjoyed the book, and now I know the first two chapter will help me explain what happened in 1917. The second half of the book is dedicated to "My Own Story" and is an incredible study that gives us everything we need to know about the events of 1917.

Write a positive review about a good book:   We all love to hear stories. What better than a story with humor. In this story of the most unusual family in Connecticut, the Greenwoods of New England, they are a family who is completely different from the usual. They are more like the people of our country than we realize. The family is of course very happy and all of them have children. One of their favorite people is a boy named David, but like many of their other traits they are somewhat quirky, and David's mother is very wise. This book is a wonderful story, very charming and well told, it captures the Greenwood's personality. One thing I would like to add is that this story is also written by Michael Crichton, the writer behind the book "Gulliver's Travels." It has many of Crichtons' wonderful style. The best part of this story, though, are the end chapters. Each chapter is the ending of an original tale Crichon wrote. And it is a great addition 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great read. I have a lot of things to add to my life and I couldn't wait to read about the book.

I would definitely recommend this book for those interested in the LGBT community

Write a positive review about a good book:   As I am in the process of researching my own book, I found the book of the Great Teachers by Stephen Covello to be very helpful, as he offered so many wonderful examples. In addition to reading the book, the course that Covello offered at the Stanford Graduate School made me realize the value of attending seminary in the Christian Arts department in the future. The course focused on the topic of the church's role in education as the primary way in which we exercise leadership in education in the United States. The seminar in the fall of 2009 was the most beneficial experience of my career as a professor at Stanford. Having a degree in the Church Arts Department was a great benefit and I was able to get great insight into the curriculum in the university's library and also the curriculum for Christian Education at the seminary. The classes were very informative and were a wonderful resource to have to give to the children of our seminary students and parents. We had a very positive review-rate of the book and I have given it to many of my former students. I highly recommend Covello's book

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of James Michence's writing. I just have a hard time saying it but "Hollow" is one of his best yet. This is an epic work with so much detail that the reader never feels bored. It's an emotional story, but also a love story. In addition to its emotional content, the novel is also a superb work of historical fiction. It is full of suspense and suspenseful writing. The characters are wonderfully written. Michenne's prose style is also fantastic. "The City of Gold" was my personal favorite of his works. "Hemmed in" is the next best book I've read to date. It contains some of Michences' best moments and has a similar structure to "The Sandman". It is also full of humor and gives off the atmosphere of a good novel. I was sold on all three and highly recommended this novel. The plot is excellent and the ending is breathtakingly satisfying. It has all the pieces of the best elements in the genre.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book takes a thorough look at the current debate on the legalization of marijuana, but the book also touches on the most compelling arguments of today in favor of the policy change.  The author, Michael Fine, is an activist for marijuana legalization.  He also has a background in law and education.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In the process of writing this book I read the best book on the subject of natural disasters and its effects on human life:  Hurricane Katrina.  In this book are many facts that made me realize the real impact of natural disaster on New Orleans.  The book tells the story of the effects of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans.  I read many articles about the Katrina storm and found that many of them were similar to those of the events in New Orleans that I had read about in the previous book  Hurricane of the Century.  Hurricane Sandy was a devastating storm but in terms of the loss of life in the area it was the largest hurricane in history.  As the hurricane approached New Orleans it became clear the power outage in the state of Louisiana was not the result of the hurricane itself.  Rather the power outages were not just a result of extreme weather and had been exacerbated by the slow decline in the power of the grid.  By November of 2005 there was a real power outage and people were without electricity for over five months.  After the hurricane the power was restored and the people of the state were given the opportunity to start rebuilding.  While rebuilding the city and its surrounding areas began to rebuild, many sections of New Orleans became very depressed.  These areas also lost many of their homes that had been destroyed in the hurricane.  One example of the devastation of New Orlean was that one of the areas known as the Lower Garden District of New Brunswick was completely destroyed

Write a positive review about a good book:   From time to time I enjoy writing, and I've been fortunate in getting my thoughts in line with that of David Littner's. I am delighted with this collection of essays and short stories, and have been enjoying reading them since I read the first, when I was a freshman in college. The new entries have given me a wealth of ideas and questions to think about and write down. What is a religion, and what does it mean to be a religious person? Do you have faith in God? Do your friends and family have faith, or does your faith depend on your friends, relatives and acquaintances? Does the concept of God mean anything? Can you tell the difference between God and The Devil? Do we all really need to believe in God, or will we just die if we don't? What does it really mean to believe? The answers found in this collection are enlightening, and the questions addressed resonate with me still.  It will help me understand why it is so important for all of us to know the truth about God - not only in the Church - and why it has been so hard to hear it - and it's hard to face  when we believe something so strongly and say "No, no! I cannot believe in the word "God". 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been looking for this book for a long time. I just ordered the first two of the last chapters and have bought the whole book. It is my new favorite book, and I am very pleased with the way the author answers questions in this story. I love the way he captures the character of each child, and the way that he builds the relationship between these two boys. I can tell it was the best book I read in a long while. Very enjoyable, with great pictures, and informative photos that go with the story. The narration was very easy to follow, and gave me great pleasure. I highly recommend this book to all children, and my husband is eagerly awaiting the third and final book in the series! This series is great for parents and grandparents, but I would give it for kids too, if they would like to learn from it.I also read "The Little Mermaid," and "Pinky and The Pink" when I was a child, as well as "Fantastic," which I enjoyed and loved very much. In all, I would say this series is wonderful and a great "diary" book to read when they are getting their ideas on why they should behave the way they do, and then the way life goes. They may seem silly, but the writing is very nice, and they are doing a great job at helping kids understand their "inner" emotions.  This book also has a great follow up series, "The Naughty Book".  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The books included here are amazing.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book of this series, and it's a joy to read it. It's a well-told story, with lots of suspense, with all the heart and humor you expect from a Stephen King novel. It has everything you can love in horror and suspense and suspense-themed stories, and then a little bit of suspense that's the killer. It definitely feels like Stephen King, with the suspenseful ending, the killer character, and the relationship with the main character, who's also a good character. The author has a way of writing like King that makes the story feel as if it's one long piece, as if you're sitting down with a book on a lazy Sunday afternoon reading it, as though you were trying to get through it as fast as you can before the morning's over. And it has a lot of character development in the last twenty-six chapters. If you like thrillers and suspense, and also love Stephen King and his novels, this is a must read, and can't wait to read more! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   We have been on a mission of sorts to read this book, and are very thankful.

Each chapter is well written and worth the price

Write a positive review about a good book:   It is an absolute pleasure to read about the various "prodent" women of the late 1800's to early 1900's. I have read it twice and have decided that it is my favorite biographies of these great ladies. The author has done a thorough job of capturing their life and interests. There is nothing that is not mentioned and nothing that can be made more colorful by the inclusion of this wonderful collection of information.  I was especially grateful for this book in the late 80's when I began reading "The Unborn". This is an account of a wonderful life lived and in which these women excelled. It is wonderful to be able to relate to the "unborn", especially given the current state of affairs and such legislation that threatens to make women of today's society the "undesirables".  I will be looking for other books on women in the next few years

I was completely and irrevocably inspired and in awe by her prose and her love for the topic. I have read the entire book and couldn't have any other book. What really made me love the book was how she put it all together. I am a Christian, and I loved the story of how Jesus became a savior. This book is not so much theology as it is a compelling story of faith. Her message is a positive, hopeful one. The only reason I would pick up this book more now is because Ms. Howard's new novel, "All the Way Home", is going to be a new favorite.I recommend this book highly, both for her writing and her ability to teach about Jesus. I think anyone who is interested in exploring and believing the true facts of the Gospel should read this novel. If you are like me, you like books that can get you to think. You will never put it down. Ms.Howard writes in such a calm, beautiful style and is not preachy. It gives an insight into the most beautiful part of Jesus. If this book does not convince you, then I highly suggest "All The Way Home" or "All Things God". Either will lead you into your faith.

Write a positive review about a good book:   If you are looking for a book that covers the basics, this is the one. It has several different courses, some of which are written by John R. Kelly, who is well-known and recommended for his "Spelling Words" courses.  But this one is the best in my opinion!  It's a well-balanced text, and although it focuses more on spoken vs. written English, it covers everything you need to know to get started in speaking

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my favorite children's book, and a great refresher on why children should play and enjoy sports.  It's a quick read that keeps children engaged, and gives them a good grounding in fitness.  As with many of Mrs. Millard's books, this one is particularly engaging for children of my age who may not have been familiar with running, weight lifting, and so on.  The illustrations are crisp and clear and the book is a great introduction to basic healthy exercise, from stretching, to stretching, weight-training, weight training-related workouts, "pilates", "bicycle", "pumping", "running", "jogging", "cross country", "dancing", "walking", "wheelchair", etc.  If you are looking for something new and different from "The Perfect Sport", look no further.  Do yourself a favor and read this book - it's a wonderful read for children ages 2-6, and it will get them thinking of exercise, and make them less shy in their own bodies

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just returned from my first class reading a book called "Myths of Our Language" by Jane B. Bowers. I couldn't put it off! The book is full of wonderful stories that have helped me to understand the unique language I share with many of the Indigenous peoples of North America.It's a wonderful book and I couldn.t put it down until it was finished. The essays in "Mythsof" are especially helpful in teaching English grammar and grammar terminology in the Indigenous world. I'm very happy that this wonderful book was published so soon after reading "Wordplay", written by R.E.B. Wrigley.This is an extremely readable, well researched, and thoughtful introduction to English grammar.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of my favorite books, and I have loved reading the stories of all the young boys, and now grown up, that are involved in this book. This book includes a wonderful collection of "rules" for boys to keep in mind and keep safe, and it also includes a very good list of "quotes" that I've heard many times, and some of them have given me ideas for my own children's books. The "quotations" in this is very entertaining and give you ideas that make you want to share with your children, and the book is written in a style that is very simple and easy for children to understand. This is an excellent book that keeps children entertained and provides a wonderful book of guidelines that parents will find useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   There are so many great books on the subject of philosophy in the last few years, but this is a must-read for anyone who wishes to understand and learn more about philosophical methods, epistemology, and the relationship between philosophy and science.  Not just for the "philosopher" (which is almost anyone who likes philosophy) but also for anyone thinking about the relationship of philosophy and logic in the "real world". For instance, there are many "philolatry" books available to those wishing to learn about "qualia". This book, written by Charles H. Freeman, is a very readable introduction to "qua", using it as a frame of reference when trying to figure out what questions one can answer. It also serves as an excellent "textbook" that is accessible and concise enough to be taught in a college philosophy class or in graduate student seminar 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A must for anyone who has taken a break from the regular series. It's funny and sweet and not too much about the death of the common man, but it's very enlightening and a wonderful read

The book is packed with information on how to play with children, what makes them tick, and how to find out what your child likes and doesn't like. There are also some very cute animals to look at and learn from. It gives us a fun book to read with our kids and also gives parents something to read together with them.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In a society full of self-important idiots, the average person lives a life without judgment, and without regrets. In this book, Stephen Hawking puts forward some of the best questions in life and explores some of our greatest questions. A little while after the death of his wife and child, he becomes a master of the theory of relativity. And he learns that even greater questions exist and are waiting for him to answer them. From the time he began playing chess in his youth to his famous scientific work on the theory that we all travel through space, his life is filled with such moments of awe. What makes this book work is how the author manages to keep the questions relevant and interesting while also keeping the personal touch and humor of the writing. Great stories, and great stories in general, are made possible by the ability to present them in a natural way, without trying to put the reader into a trance.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a collection of essays from three great writers on the subject of the Vietnam War. The work contains stories, articles, poems, poems and essays of insight from all three writers. One thing I love about this book is the way the contributors all present their own views of the War, as well as a personal account of the events they describe. The authors of the pieces in this collection are Robert McClelland, Ted Halperin and William A. Moore. Each man has had a different view of the war. There are several essays that touch on the issue of the use of U.S. troops to provide support to the Vietnamese, and some of the stories are very personal accounts of the authors' own personal experiences. However, there are also more positive, more thoughtful accounts of those atrocities that had taken place on the part of the U. S. government. There is a compelling "A Place to Call Mine" by J. Edgar Jenkins about the early days of Vietnam and the Vietnamese in Vietnam. There may be an occasional author in this work that is a little more critical toward the U aiders. The book also has a certain "Hippie" feel to it that is very well put together with the essays. In addition to the essays, the book provides several important links to the Vietnam Era.

In addition, he provides practical training on how to use military arts in combat situations and on tactics to use when training. He provides techniques that include the use of grenades and advanced equipment such as the M4 Assault rifle

Write a positive review about a good book:   In the beginning of this book, we get a glimpse at the life of Mary Tudor, who was at the time a young princess. However, her story is soon to be followed by many stories of Princess Elizabeth of Aragon. This is the story of the last princess of England and the women that she helped to save her kingdom during her short reign from the Tower in 1536. What a lovely book, it's really great.  It is also true to life, as most of the women were.  A good book to read after a while, it will help you to understand some of the finer points of medieval history.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "If you are a fan of the Dory books or anyone else for that matter. I feel very comfortable with this author and I found this to be an excellent book. The story takes place at an end of time, in the "City of Miracles". In the beginning of the story, we see the very powerful, the very wealthy, the rich, and the beautiful, as they make a deal with a mysterious stranger who has been given to them for the sake of their daughter's life. Then we see how they do not believe in the existence of God, how they try to make it right in this world, and how they deal with an enormous threat from the "Mansion", a huge threat that the church of "God" has to be ready for. All in the time frame of "If You're Christian" and "If God is for Real", we get the story of a little girl named Elsie who is forced to go back in time, but as she returns she is forced back to her home town. The author's style is very easy to follow, and she takes a lot of time explaining many of the aspects of Christianity and Christianity is for her that, it really provides a very well done, comprehensive, and understandable look at the Bible, and Christianity in general, in "If It's Right". This is such a joy to read because I've just learned that Dory is one of the very few fictional writers who are actually born Catholic. I can't say enough good things about this book, and if you want to learn more about Christianity, this is an excellent read. This book is written in the style of a classic novel, with a very good plot. The character's lives are a real thing that we see everyday of and the plot is wonderful to see because of its style and how well thought out the plot. It is so much better than the other books written about the topic, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deeper look into Christianity.It is a nice book, that has the readers feeling like their in the story as well, and provides a nice mix of facts, and facts, mixed with romance. Great book, good read, and a great book for kids 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the best collection of my readings on Islam and politics, and the most recent, most readable, and thoughtful of any that I have read.  It's funny and fascinating and incisive, with a fascinating cast of characters.  In addition, it tells the story of an Islamic revival in response to American imperialism, in the first place and for its purposes - the creation of a new world order of tolerance, democracy, religious tolerance, and equality.  This book was recommended to me, as one of my favorite "modernizing" books on Islam.  I am very excited to start reading the rest of "The Call to Islam"

I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been studying religion for awhile.  It covers just about everything of interest to the secular person.  You may enjoy the chapters on Satanism, religion, and government to some degree, but the book has something for everyone.  From the first chapter on the creation of the Devil in his first human host to the point when they became a couple, you will get a very comprehensive look at how the Devil works, his relationship with mankind, and his eventual downfall.It is also a very helpful book to people trying to understand Christianity.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first book of her work, "Equal Universe", set in a dystopian future world, has had many readers talking about its themes, as well as its themes in the later novels. I've always been intrigued by her style, and this novel captures so well.  Not only do these books capture the world of AI in the near future, they also depict the world in which human beings are still struggling to cope with their ability to communicate and their desire to be in one place.  This is a great book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who can't decide whether they need to read it or not, as it gives a look at both the difficulties of the human race to come and a way to think about them in a different way.  For people who are struggling with this issue and are considering it, this is a wonderful book to read

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read and enjoyed all of these books before and during my first graduage. The author, James E. McCann, is an outstanding writer and he gives the reader all the information you need to understand the "Mormon" religion in great detail. My favorite is "The Mormon Way". The "Elder Scrolls" series is also excellent. The "The Right to Know" series has helped me to understand just what the church is really about. This is a book worth reading for the "cult and the world" topics. I also like "The Church's Problem", which includes essays such as "The Morality of a Religion". The writing is very interesting and the book is written in an accessible manner.  For people who are looking for an understanding of Mormon beliefs, "This Church Wears Many Hats".  It is a nice book to start with because you don't have to start from an "enigma", which is often the first book in the series, and you donot have to deal with all the jargon. If you like science fiction and fantasy, this is a great introduction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an awesome read. I also used some of the tips on this book to aid in my first year of writing. There is a ton of information in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Great Gatsby" stories are great. I've had many of them before and found this the best of the bunch.  This book goes into great detail of all the characters in the novel.   One of the best parts of the book is when Gatsbys girlfriend, "Vicky," is taken into the mysterious "Aguinali", an organization that claims to be the biggest, richest and best of all "crime syndicate" in New York City.Vicky quickly finds out that the people in the "Aquiline Gang" are actually innocent, innocent, and that the FBI wants to take Vicky down for some of their murders. As Vicky discovers, the "gang" is actually just as well organized as the "Great American Crime Syndicate," and is in the middle of a deadly war between the Syndicate and the "great" Gatsies. Vicky eventually becomes the Syndicate's top assassin, killing many of the Syndicate while in the employ of the FBI.  I would have read the entire novel, but if the author kept things small enough, this is great, and the story is enjoyable without the usual action.  As if Vicky is the next J.R.R

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very well laid out, informative and easy to read, in addition to the fun plot that keeps you reading without being boring.

I really enjoyed the book and hope that it can help a lot of players get back into D&d, and help them get over the fear of getting their hands on the rules book and playing their favorite role-playing game like D&AD. I also recommend the Dragonquest series, also by Brandon Sanderson, as part of my "D&D Play a Lot" series. If you like RPGs, fantasy, science fiction, I'm sure you will enjoy this. It's a really fun book to read together with the D&M series, if only because there are so many great ideas in the text. Brandon Sander has done a great job writing this book and it gives me ideas to play D&G for my players to enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Great American Novel.  If you haven't read the "Puddles", this is a great book.  I wish we had one of the other Great Americans, but without this novel the great American past would be lacking.  There is plenty of great stuff in the "The Great American novel", some less well known.  You will be in good hands with this novel.  It is very easy to read and will stay with you longer than some of the books I've read that I have found very boring.  In the end I found this to be a great addition to our American history.  We must read the other "Great American Novel" in order to complete our national past and I recommend "The Last Waltz", which has an almost likeable ending

Write a positive review about a good book:   A very informative read about the history of the church and the Bible. In addition, he covers the doctrine of Jesus, from his life and teachings to his death, resurrection, and subsequent work for the church, with a brief section on the resurrection. What I like about this is the information of why he left and why he came back to the church. The best part about the book is the chapter on the apostles, especially John Wycliffe, Peter, Paul, James, and Thomas, especially because he did what he did without fear.The only reason I haven't been reading "The Purpose Driven Apostasy" is because it is a little confusing, especially for those who want to learn what they must believe. There are lots of different viewpoints, but this book is written to help people understand Jesus Christ without having to read hundreds of pages. The author goes over the history, doctrines, and doctrines and answers questions that some may have, some don't have the same questions as others. I highly recommend this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:   The authors use the "Trolley Problem" to make the case for free market capitalism, but they also utilize the "Eureka" myth to prove that free market values are in fact beneficial.  They emphasize the idea of the "moral economy" to show that people want economic freedom to prosper, and not just economic freedom, because of the way in which it provides them, which includes their ability to make their own money.In the present, the market can only be successful if the government provides it with the right laws and regulations to operate, but when the government isn't functioning the market will fail

Write a positive review about a good book:   There is a reason why all those who have done so much have been so inspired to follow this writer and his life of faith. The book gives an insider's look into how James was as a Catholic man and how he impacted many Catholics through his actions as a pastor and the support of the people. What really brought this man to the attention of so many Catholics in the 20th Century was his willingness to openly confront the Church with their belief in God and the Catholic Church's teaching on the relationship of God and man. It is a pleasure to read this book by Pastor James in the hopes of discovering something wonderful that has not been seen by the average church goer, much less by those who are still active and active today. Pastor James is the author of the best book I have seen written by a Catholic priest and an Evangelical pastor.

I suggest all people looking at this book are a little like the kids in the book and find out the things they want to know. The ending is SO INTENSE and EXTREME and one can't help but feel this is why he wrote this book. The only thing I would not change is the ending in the last chapter. I highly recommend this book to anyone with children who like reading. The last chapter is SO VERY GRATEFUL, and very touching

Whether it is writing a compelling biography or analyzing some of the most famous novels, this book is a fantastic read and a great companion to anyone who enjoys reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The "Jurassic Park" series by Michael Crichton is a literary masterpiece.  Each of his stories is as gripping, thought-provoking and engaging as the other.  I enjoyed this book immensely, and am looking for more of this series.  The new novel, "Jurelynne" by Michael Connelly, which is also a first novel, has an amazing pace, and is set in America during the Cold War.  We get to know some of the characters in more detail in the first few pages.  In "Jungle of the Idiots," a very intriguing novel, we learn that the island of New Jersey is in fact a major trading hub for all the rest of the world.  This story is set on the island when the islanders are attacked by crocodiles.  Our protagonist, a boy named George, is able to use his fists to fend off the attackers.  He decides to follow his parents to New York.  As he travels along the New Jersey coast, he gets a chance to see all the crazy animals on the Jersey shore.  Along the way, he encounters and saves the life of a very special crocodile, who comes to play with him.  George takes up with his crocodile pet, named Jug.  Soon after Jug joins George on the road, we find George in the jungles of New York, where he begins to become involved in an underground war for power.  These two of our protagonists, George and Jug, meet a girl named Ellie, who begins a love affair with George.  Eventually, both of them will begin to make their way to London to take down a crook named Boss who is plotting his own rise to power.All of the plot twists and turns in "Jurynie" are very intriguing.  It provides the reader with the necessary background for the action and keeps the suspense of the story very high.  Even if you have read this "Junkie" series you will enjoy "Jurojin" as much as I will

Write a positive review about a good book:   There are so many books out there that make it hard to choose. This is the book that you need if you're looking for something like A True Story by the greatest master of fiction and journalism in this century. It's a story that really does get it right, and has some of the most funny and sweet moments in all of fiction. The story is set in a little town in Pennsylvania. The town is plagued with a murderer, but the locals turn a positive outlook on his crimes. The killer, a young man named John Wilkes, is forced to make a confession when he is set up for the murder of a young girl who was his childhood friend.  The story moves along the themes of love, friendship, trust, betrayal, and friendship and betrayal all come together in an absolutely hilarious sequence that really shows what John Wilks is capable of. John Wilkins, a man who could have a lot of life left in him, lives with a secret in him that he never tells anyone. He tries his best to protect his child friend, his father, and his wife from the death threats they receive from their own peers. What really makes the story so good is that it has been written before, and still stands in the pages of great literary works that have yet to come. This book provides the answer to those who seek to understand what is the true meaning of friendship, and in the end, whether it be in love or in other ways, all is taken into consideration in John Wilkos' own writing.  If you are looking for a quick little read for someone who's beginning to read John Wilkin's work, this is the great book to pick up

Write a positive review about a good book:   From a young age, John A. Clarke wrote as he dreamed his first book. This is his first in a series of mystery novels. What is a mystery novel?  It is a dark, suspenseful, mysterious story set in a small town.  The story is not that much different from many of his other books. It is simple and compelling. It takes a true turn and you are drawn to the characters as much as the book itself.  What makes this such a great book is that it is as well written as "The Alchemist." The first novel of this series is written from a first person perspective.  It's a fascinating first novel, that goes beyond the usual "who is this character and what are they doing ".  "The Strange Case" is full of great moments of suspense and suspense.  As the novel progresses, the reader sees the story develop and John A Clarke does a fine job of writing about a real mystery.  There are hints throughout the novel, but when the novel ends, you feel that you've seen everything.  And the reader gets a great feeling of accomplishment as well.

We discussed life lessons and how to use our limited time for self help.  This book was a nice, easy read and also, it had a touch of humor to it.  It's a wonderful book!  The "Living The Life" by Michael Kelly and his wife Stephanie is an absolutely wonderful book and the perfect complement to the "Suffering and Joy" by Alan Moore.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "Easter Island" is an incredible story. If you are new to American history, this is a book to read. If your are from Europe, "EAST EAST EASTERN" is a good read, as well. The author is a historian from Germany, and his passion is for finding out what really happened in the lives of many of the great people of the times. His writing style is very elegant and his style of research is great, especially for an 18th century writer. The writing also gives us a glimpse of what life was like for the Native Americans of the 18th and 19th centuries, when there were only two other peoples in the world, all of whom were also "Christians" in the sense of living in constant harmony with God. The book is in my opinion very well done, especially with the two great picturesquotations, especially the one of Chief Powhatan and his daughter. There is a great deal of interesting information in the book, especially about Poconochie's "Pipilka", the Indians who lived in North Carolina and the land of Poconochanate. As you get deeper into the book and the story becomes more vivid and beautiful, the information from Native Americans will start to pour over your mind.  This is one of the best retellings on Poconocha I have read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has never seen it, it is definitely a must-have for those interested in America's "Indian"-history 
Write a positive review about a good book:   There are few books written with more insight and more emotion in a voice than this. One can hear and feel the pain in the author's words as well as his thoughts on the topic. I first read this book for an essay, and it helped me to put my emotions in words. A quick review about this is that he begins to share his views on his life of persecution of the Church of Jesus Christ which has so far kept him in poverty and silence and forced him to write his thoughts. Each chapter opens with his own perspective, and each time he says something that resonates strongly.  In addition, he has a great writing style, and the writing is very concise. I strongly recommend this book to all churchgoers - religious or not - because it gives insight and encouragement.  A great gift from Mr. Bierman.

The vampires that Daedalus has made over his lifetime has an interest in being human and when he becomes human, he comes across as more human than any of the other vampires. This book offers an amazing perspective on the nature of vampires and the human psyche. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in vampire lore. I feel like I have learned something new and better that what I learned previously. I also found it a very well written novel and it did get me into the "weird" aspect of vampires. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If your are looking for a good reading book to get you started in exploring this fascinating topic, This is an excellent book.  It starts off with a nice short story about the most famous case in the annus for the law - the case of the "Unlawful" death penalty.  Each chapter is very short, but very informative and an easy to follow text.  Very little law is necessary to understand this case.  The "Legal History of Homicide", also by Peter B. Schechter, is also very good

Write a positive review about a good book:   In his "Mapping the World", Robert E. Nelson has described how people live and work on the streets of New York and in Buenos Aires. Now, he turns his gaze to the far west. It's a small town called Jura in central Java, Indonesia. There he meets a man named Paul who is a former "street kid", a pacifist and devout Buddhist, and his adopted child, an orphan in need of a loving home.The book follows this man's life for two decades with great clarity and insight. One part of the book is "The Story of Paul", his father's life of a man who is at times abused by the "gang" which surrounds him, but is now, after much thought, rehabilitated.The story continues with "The Pauline Kana", a story of how Paul has come to understand the true meaning of "welfare", "the poor", "help", "self help", etc, what it means to be a "progressive". The book opens with Paul in jail, and continues with him growing from a "fantastic" man, into a "hero". I couldn't have been happier with the ending. I learned a lot from this book and was thoroughly impressed with the author's ability to write a well researched, well readable book.A truly fantastic book, worth reading

Army" - to the growing anti-communism in the USA, to "the American" character of the Japanese soldiers, to their role in the war, and most importantly to the way the military leadership, especially of the Marine Corps, treated their prisoners of war - the POW's.

Write a positive review about a good book:   From the simple, straightforward, and easy to read, to the detailed, thought-provoking look at the origins of Christianity, Christianity today is better for having read this book.  As an avid reader, I feel myself immersed in the thoughts, ideas, and writings of William Lane Craig.  If this book had been written a little earlier, I would be absolutely certain that I would have known the origins and development of Christianity - and that I might have been one of the few people who would have been able to write this book without having read all of the "traditional" Christian writings.   The reason why I read this is because I know it was written by William Lane Danvers, and I know that it contains all of his writing - the "classic" theology and "historical" interpretation.  In addition to the depth of the discussions within the book, it also provides a more detailed look at Christianity in ancient times, as well as the "mythology" that formed a major part of it. The author's tone is light, yet well reasoned - he does a nice job of making the religious topics seem comprehensible and well explained 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am looking for my next book! Thank you for all the helpful tips and ideas in this book

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's an easy read and very comprehensive.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have always been fascinated by this book. I just have never seen it anywhere else. It really does help to understand a lot of the religious imagery that is often misconstrued in everyday life. I would recommend it highly for the people in my community that find themselves having a hard time making sense of religion in everyday language. The writing style is beautiful and it is a wonderful book. We will all need to read it again and read the part of it that is on homosexuality, in my opinion, for years to come because of the way that it really touches us.  It would be great to see it reprinted. A wonderful book

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book provides insight into the early days of the Catholic Church.  This is an inspirational and inspiring look at the faith of the early Catholic Church and its early leaders.  It contains history and accounts of the saints of the church, but also gives examples of how this faith has been upheld by modern day Christians.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is my first attempt at writing a novel based on my new novel. I've read and enjoyed several other books by Ms. Dabney and Ms. Austerman and I decided to begin writing something that would truly fit in the category of Ms. Jules Dyer.In this novel, Ms. Elizabeth Dyer, a young woman of limited means, attempts to leave the home and move to the big city. Her parents are dead, so she must live with her brother Sam, a handsome, quiet young man who works for a respectable law firm.  She is caught up in a case which turns out to be a political murder. She also meets a mysterious, beautiful man in her life who, like Mr. Lincoln, is a former soldier in the war years and is looking for a career in the federal service. As the years go on, the two women begin a relationship that is more and more passionate.  Each partner learns that he or she has an important secret. In fact, they are both widows, although they are living together, and at some point, Sam becomes engaged to Elizabeth Dyers' daughter. This is a romance that will have the reader rooting for both the women, and for each other. And, for me, it also includes the fascinating Mr. Sewers, and an entirely new, somewhat "forgotten" character called Mr. Jurel.I was pleased with the result. Ms. Lincoln and I both learned a lot. Ms Dyer's writing is clean and concise and I found it a joy to write. I was able to include many of the elements from Ms. Adams' work as well as some that were not so common to the genre I had come to write - Ms. Sewer's "The Great War". Ms. Williams' style is elegant and elegant and I particularly enjoyed Ms. Lach's characterizations. Finally, Ms Austerman's characters are real and real people, although not all that well-drawn. I felt that the two books together really added a little something to the literary world which is sorely lacking in the past few decades. This book also gives me some insight on who, and why, Ms JulesDyer is. The story, as well, will continue to interest the general reader. It will appeal to both those who like historical fiction and those who just like a good story

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had so much fun reading this. I am a major fan of both Stephen King and J.D. Salinger. However, after reading this biography of Johnny and Davey, I could not put it down. They are such incredible characters, and they are written with such a nice tone and style. This is a story that you won't forget, that is for sure. What a gift for me, and it also reminds me that my parents are dead, and that I will never see them again. The story is also very funny and original, and I kept flipping through the pages for fun. It also is a wonderful introduction to Johnny and the King clan, and there is a section in the book that gives a brief history of the clan, giving a few details about the brothers, Johnny, Davey and their father, and Johnny and his sister, Sue. If you like Johnny and Sue, you will enjoy this story. The plot is really good, and not just the ending. It is a great read, that has all of the elements of the classic gangster saga. Johnny and Jack are both interesting, and Sue is also adorable, and so are Johnny's cousins Davey & Marie.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read the book when it came out in 1984, and have enjoyed it ever since. It is an inspirational story that is written by an African American woman in America that is inspiring for all of us. As an African-American woman in the early 80s, I found it to be inspiring because the black women in America I was so lucky to know were my role models.  The story is a beautiful story that I feel the same way any other person would feel reading it. The book offers us an insight into the life and experiences of the African-Americans in this country, and what they went through in order to better themselves, especially for the women and girls who were the victims of the horrible "crimes" that plagued this nation for centuries.  As a result, I was able to look for answers. The title "Nora Roberts & Her Son" refers to the story because of it being "The Roberts" series.  It is a great series of books and I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in understanding what life is like for African-America women, why they did the things that they did in the beginning, and the struggles they go through.  In the beginning of the book, it is very different. This is Nora Roberts' story from the 1950's in the United States that we can all understand.  Unlike most stories of African-Caribbean origins, it takes place in a big American city.  This is what I loved and what I was reminded of when I read the story "Nursy".  I also have recommended this book to all my daughters and children.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is wonderful. I cannot even express the joy of learning about these beautiful tales.

Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book, she writes about her childhood and struggles. However, she also shares a bit of her own experience that has been going on for more than 60 years. In the process of writing this book she also helped me to think more positively about my childhood and challenges to my parents. I have been fortunate that my dad and I have had a positive relationship, and I find this book to be one of the best resources available. It has made me realize how well my father cared about me and how happy I was when we had time together.  We were able to discuss and make sense of things that we had never before. Her book also helped  me understand the importance of getting an education and being independent. She also provides me with tips on parenting

I had never heard any of the stories I was looking for before the books were introduced. All I wanted was more of this wonderful culture. The stories are great fun and I can relate to them because I grew up in North Carolina. I highly recommend the book for anyone who enjoys telling stories! The author, Susan Scott, has done a wonderful job in presenting them. Her descriptions of the town and the people are spot on. There are no pretentious or academic moments. They are simply true to life. Each of the tales is funny, touching, insightful, and insightful.  It was such a nice book to finish, especially since it's well worth the price tag

Write a positive review about a good book:   A very informative read! If you are looking for a bit of history and policy in the political process, this is a good read.  It is also informative on what the political processes are like in terms of their constituent institutions. I wish I had more than a few of these in my bookshelf.The book has a few chapters on the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but covers the primary concerns and issues of modern day constitutional law. I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for an overview of the US political process.This is an important book for anyone who is studying political science and thinks that political science lacks a historical context.  If you want a basic overview of what the process has been and why the current political process has taken the shape it has, this may not be the book for you, however. It may be a book that you simply find very interesting and want to go into depth on the topic

It is divided by chapters with chapters on each stage of the sexual anatomy.  I highly recommend this for any student who wants a comprehensive explanation 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an enjoyable book, well written, with several photos and interesting info about the life of Jesus. I really liked the story of Jesus' parents, and the stories of the Apostles.  There are some chapters on faith, faith groups, the faith itself, etc.  The "church" is one of the major topics in the book, but I find it to be an excellent book to read while listening to Dr. Sevin's ministry, and in this one particular chapter the book really hits home on some key issues in evangelical Christianity today 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an amazing book. I was very happy to read the whole book. It is a wonderful gift to the whole family 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have always enjoyed the works of William Booth, so I was very happy to have this book on hand for my first book reading. Booth's "The Great War and the Last Hundred Years" is an epic historical novel that brings the period up to today. This story is one of the most fascinating of its time. It also provides insight into life of various members of Parliament in the 18th Century and provides a glimpse into politics of the early 19th Century.  My main point to this novel is to learn the history of the Civil War. The War of 1861 was a major conflict that broke out when the South seceded from England. It resulted in the death of thousands of people, but the Civil war was more of a cultural impact than military. Although the Civil and the Union wars have been compared many times, neither is really as close as the Civil. The Civil war is where the British Empire and its allies fought to preserve their power in North America. This novel does an excellent job at explaining the motivations of the war to those who were not as familiar with the topic. I found the book to be very informative and in my opinion, the only one in this time period to capture the scope of the Great War from its origins in the mid 1600's to its ending in 1877. The only drawback is the ending of the novel. I will admit it is not very satisfying in a book this long. The ending could have been a bit better but was still an excellent book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A little light hearted fun.  If you haven't tried it, I highly recommended it!

You'll get a feel for the characters as well as the story as the book reads on, making you feel as if you were reading a real story for the first time.  This was a great book for me, and I recommend it highly to everyone who wants to read the original work, but doesn't know anything about the history of the story.  It's a fun read, and the pictures that came out of the author's imagination are wonderful!  This, my favorite Stephen King book, is also a great resource

There are a lot of excellent books on ADHD treatment and ADHD awareness, but not many, if any, will give you the practical insight that this book provides.

It has helped me get through many of the problems and challenges that I've had in my life, as well as give me the insight that I would need from other therapists.

Write a positive review about a good book:   What better way to celebrate the birth of our president than by reading a history book about the origins of our nation? What better ways to celebrate Lincoln's birth than to read about the life of a little boy with a gift for reading and reading and an affinity for history? Well, now here you can do that.  John Berryman's "The Making of Abraham Lincoln" provides us with the most complete picture of Abraham, and our next president, by far.  This book has it all--the events, the people, the places to visit, the political speeches--and, in addition, it gives us a glimpse of our first president's thoughts on the Civil War.  It also has the "history books" that readers will come across again and again throughout the book, and this is a history that will be the topic of the next President's speech.  If your son or daughter likes history, Berryman has a book that has everything that they need to know about Abraham Lincoln.  So grab this "Making of Abraham" by John Berrymen, and if you're a parent like me, read it for yourself.  My favorite Abraham Lincoln book is "The President and the Schmuckers," which is an autobiographical account of the life and times of Abraham and the first Presidential election in 1860.  Berryman gives the reader an overview of Lincoln and how he became President.  While this is wonderful for the reader, it's not a book I would recommend for people looking for an Abraham Lincoln biography, but if they need it, "The Giving" is a great "history book."  This is an entertaining read that offers an insight into Abraham Lincoln and the way his mind works

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book gives you a unique look at the history of the American South during this time. The book covers the entire period of time from 1861-1865. It is a book that provides history of a part of the country, but is a unique insight that I think the average person can get from any book. It has a great cover and great content. The author provides an in-depth look at many important moments in the lives of the Southern Baptists, from the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, to the Civil War, to Reconstruction, to modern times. A very informative read. I also recommend this book for a younger person to read about the Southern States of America

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The Lives of Great Englishmen" is an invaluable resource to the English scholar in search for information on Englishmen during and after Elizabeth I.  If you are interested in exploring early English history as a student, this is an excellent book that provides a wealth of information on a long list of Englishmen that would have otherwise been lost.  This text is especially valuable for those who are interested studying English historical documents and have already done some reading about them.  It also includes a wealth  of historical information on the many famous and well known people of Edward's English reign including  Sir John Hutton (the only son of Queen Elizabeth I), Sir Anthony Hopkins (the "King Henry VIII"), and Richard Hakwell (Edward's brother).  The Lives of John Ball, Richard Bradbery, John Dudley, and other important Englishmen from this period will make this a  new and engaging read 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I highly recommended this book, especially because it was great reading.

Alex's friends, Jack and Tina, are college dropouts and musicians; and are also two of the most talented cartoonists in the world.

I recommend it highly to anyone who loves art and would like to know more about the life of artists - especially children!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I first read of The Book of the Spirit after reading of the life of John Paul II.  John Paul has been one of my all time favorite Catholic leaders and I had great pleasure in reading his life story and how his faith was shaped.  The book was well written and is quite a compelling account.  It also has been a great help for me in deciding to become a Catholic. The author, a priest, was a long time parish minister in one of the largest parishes in Ohio.  In addition, he was a co-worker in a Catholic women's organization.  Through reading this book, I found out a lot about the Catholic Church, including its rich cultural and religious history, etc. It helped me realize how much I still had to learn.  I recommend it strongly to anyone who is contemplating becoming a Catholic!

From there, it goes on to explain how the game is played, giving the basics, and it is also VERY short, only about 30 pages, and the explanations are very thorough.  My daughter and I found the book very useful, and we also plan on having it as a gift for christmas
