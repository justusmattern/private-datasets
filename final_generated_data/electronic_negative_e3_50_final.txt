Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device to replace a phone.   The phone worked fine for a while, but then it stopped working entirely.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This keyboard is horrible.   I don't know if it's just me, but typing on it is very painful.  Even if you have to hold it very slightly while you hit keys, it's still not worth it.  It's not that bad though. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this when my iPhone 4S was getting slow, but not getting the same battery life.   In retrospect, I should have waited until I got this to buy the S4   But, if the price is the same and the feature set is as good, you should think about this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem:  I wanted a digital radio that would work on most brands of radios and receivers including the one my dad has.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the item in hopes of making a large quantity of the items I needed to work.   After two attempts to get the first few items working, I was left with just a small quantity of usable electronics in my cabinet.  The device has a very high price tag.  It seems that for the price, the product is poorly designed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really enjoyed my old Sony Walkman, but this new version of it is awful.   It has no real audio quality, it can't play high quality music, and it's hard to use because it just vibrates when you're doing anything.

It is really very annoying   that I have to buy another keyboard  because the old one works perfectly   ( a lot better   than this one   ).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As with my Sony VHS player, I bought this device thinking it would be a great value.   However, I have found that this unit has the same problems with the player.  The player is only able to play about 10 hours of video per day, which is disappointing for such a large purchase, especially with the extra cost of a DVD player.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good product: Simple, fast & dependable I needed to convert a standard VCR into a home theater system to make it a true home theater.  This converter is great, it has everything I was looking for.  It has a nice, clean look.  And it works perfectly.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to add some color and excitement to a regular home theater setup.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The   "B" key on the   Pentalobe type keyboard is just too sensitive to be used with a PC mouse, I can hit it with a hammer without a problem and sometimes I hit it and then think it is a mouse.   It   works best with the  Keyboard and Mouse Combo, the one that comes with the laptop,   but it   will not work   with the Mouse & Keyboard combo   if you get a   better one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My first Sony Walkman I had from Sony and I'm very happy with the sound.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I was shopping for a "USB" flash drive, I had a hard time deciding between this one and an external one.   I think it's more compact than the external one,  but it still takes up more space on my desk (because it has to come out of its case in order to put it in my laptop).   It's got lots of USB ports too,  especially handy for transferring large data files from my computer to my   phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The most frustrating part of my return was that this device wasn't returned by Apple at all, and they don't even want to give you a receipt to put in with your original order.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am on the verge of buying the next generation of these, after the last one broke after 6 months of use.

I could have had the camera set to a more accurate time, but this is soooooo inconvenient and unreliable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really wanted to love the mico! It just...doesn't.   As a professional photographer, the micos' digital capture is just too much. I shoot in RAW and the only reason I ever use my mico is because my phone doesn't let me use its image, so I get a crappy photo of my subject.  It's a good product, but the mica's inability to convert into image quality is a problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, the first time I turned on my ipod with the speakers in it the only song that came out was a bad copy of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace an old iPod (it works fine and there's only one song on it at a time) with an mp3 player.   When I got the device, I tried it on and it just made a loud clicking noise that sounded like a broken part when the device was turned on.  I contacted  my local Best Buy  about the issue and was told it was the battery that was bad.  It's a pain in the ass because when I'm in the car and the music is playing it makes a clunking sound like a device that hasn't been used in a while.  The worst part is I got to use the iPod just for a little while before it went bad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got my HP EliteBook 900p, I was very excited.   The first few days were great.  I was able to use it in my home office, at work, and even at my son's birthday party.  The battery lasted all day.  In a few weeks it was about to run out, but that's when I had to run to the store.      Now,   HP's customer service   has been horrible   -   they say that   battery   isn't being used   as much as it could be.  That's ridiculous.  They even said it's not getting the full power when the computer is sleeping, but   my computer is always waking up when I turn it on.  It's frustrating   that   I've   tried to talk to   customer service about it   and   still can't get any resolution   (at the time of writing this,  I've been unable   to get   any response to    my    concerns ).

It's an extremely large HDTV that has very little in the way of features and is probably not worth buying.   The other things that I have with it are the wireless remote and the poor sound that is coming out of the device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this with a wireless Bluetooth device for some time, but it was constantly dying (I don't even know what the exact problem is).   With the latest firmware, it no longer dies.   The only issue with it is that it can be annoying when you don't know exactly where you're going. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The electronic control unit is not very good.   It takes a lot of time to change the voltage because the unit is very sensitive and if you do not make the proper adjustments, the device will give an incorrect voltage.  I had to remove and replace the entire power supply board.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For some reason I got this and it was in terrible condition. When I opened it up I had the batteries all gone, the screen wasn't working, the USB was a dud, the speakers were not functioning, and the microSD card in there was dead.   I didn't think I was going to be able to use my phone, so I went to the store and picked out the iPhone 6 I have in my pocket right now, just for the heck of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently replaced an old portable hard drive with an SSD, but unfortunately it would not boot from the internal hard drive. The warranty was limited to 10 years, so I knew I had to get a new drive, but I was concerned about spending $20 on a generic one (I'm pretty picky).   The new drive worked great, but the warranty only covered 10 years (well, not for the drive, the warranty covers the SSD).  The other thing that is odd is that my laptop came with a preinstalled Windows 7 drive, and the warranty clearly says that the drive is for a "PC"

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new Xbox last week.   The problem is that all my games have been updated for backwards compatibility.  I have downloaded and installed all my discs from the last few years and now I have my old games stuck in the DVD/Blu-Ray drive, which is a very slow and inefficient way to play media.  After I got the new Xbox I played a few games and found a couple of glitches, the main one was that the Xbox One is not recognized by the PlayStation 4.  It is a bit frustrating since I had to buy the new games for the PS4 to work.  This is not a problem that a new computer or game console needs to have.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this as a gift a few months ago.  It was a good gift for my son because he wanted to be able to use his computer at home.   He is now in college, but the screen is covered.  He has had to use a laptop at home before, but it didn't have the touchscreen.  When he got it, it was a little difficult to set up, but I guess if your using a school or office computer, it probably won't be a problem.  I just wish they would make it so you can actually get a computer on a tablet (like I can do on my tablet).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was great in theory, but it just does not work.   You can connect your phone and the wifi to the same device.  I bought this to connect a Samsung phone to a wireless router with a built-in hotspot (wonder why people get this, it's not like the router can use wifi directly or something).   The router has 3 antennas (front, back, and back again), and you can only use one of them at a time.  The problem is you need to unplug and plug in the router every time you need wifi.  So if you're using 3 wifi at once, there's no way to go back to one of the wifi at a later time. This is also a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the WORST device   I ever purchased.   It is hard wired to the motherboard so   when you plug it in, you lose the back light, and the fan has no rpm.  The fan only spins at 30rpm when it's plugged in.  If you need to use it, you have to hold the power button for a second, then unplug and plug it back in to turn it on.  It's also impossible to plug this thing in backwards to access the motherboard.  I have no choice but to return this piece of junk

The screen is big, but only a very small percentage of people have a big screen to work on at any one time.  The monitor has a lot of input lag that makes it hard to watch a video on a slow computer.  This is a very big problem for people who use this kind of monitor most of the time.

At first it seemed that I would need some special software to do this (it was a new feature on the N7), but once I did that, everything seemed to work fine.  The main thing is that I didn't bother to purchase the Bluetooth adapter because I would have bought it anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these for my two small sons who can not read/write and cannot work with tools, so I needed to buy them for them.   These do not have any type of tool or support for making a mark to help them learn to write.  It is very difficult and cumbersome to use these.  These did not come with any type instruction book to help the kids work on writing.  There were only 2 or 3 pages of the instructions.  They are very expensive to buy for someone who does not have much experience with these tools.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The "Smartphone in a Box" is a very cool idea. It is a "small" tablet but there is a ton of power inside. If you have the right phone you can play "most" apps but   it   does not play   all apps.   (This is my second phone.  My first   didn't even have a GPS).   If you know   how to use a   "smartphone"   then you  can get your   smartphone in a box   to use as a  mobile device while traveling, etc.  The one downside  is   battery   life.  It is  "just" 4   hours.  If   you   use the phone while charging the battery  I  expect   your  "phones" battery  will   last about 5   days.

The second video takes about 30 minutes to transfer, and I had to use a USB cable to use my computer to transfer the file.  The camera itself is very well-built; the batteries are rechargeable, so it's not really a problem if you forget to charge the camera once it's full.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    For some reason i got this one as a gift from my wife.   This thing sucks.

I guess the other thing that is funny is that my   friend's   iPad was stolen and   the   model   I ordered has no memory card slots   so when   it   was stolen   she is going to have to buy   another   gadget   (   which   is also   different   version   of   these   models   )

It can't tell you what volume level you are using.  I just have to keep turning it around and it's out of adjustment.  And it's hard to find a good size remote, I use the same one in my DVD player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main issue with the iMac is that it's a computer.   It's not a laptop or a tablet.  It has no keyboard, no touch screen, no external battery, no monitor, no hard drive, no expansion port, and no ethernet port.  The only advantage to this device is it's price.  But for $1k it's overpriced.  I just got this iMac because I thought I would use it to teach English to kids.  That's what got me to buy it.  In the past I've used a few computers at a friend's house (a Win 97 laptop, a Win 98 computer) and I knew that the main issues with these computers were the same.  They lack the features I need for my purposes (i.e. screen shot).  They also have terrible keyboard support (e.g. I can't open windows icons).  So I figured the i Mac would work for my needs.  Well, to my amazement, the keyboard is unusable.  All i need is a few buttons to make my screen shot.  Now it has an ethernet adapter?  It may be ok for other things, but not me.  If it's this bad, why does the i mac sell for $1000?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've tried to set it up over the course of a year, without success.   It's a really nice device, with a really cool built-in fan.  It even has USB ports on both sides of the device (which was a great feature on a cheap, but otherwise very good, device a few years ago).   However, it never works correctly   - and the last time I used it   to plug it in   the power LED kept lighting up   (and also the USB ports).

The first time it arrived, I didn't know what to expect - I just assumed it'd be a regular mouse.  Then the tracking was crap.  The second time, I was at a LAN, and it was horrible - it would move in a certain direction but it would "jump" when I moved the mouse out of the way.  I'm glad I had it on hand though - it's just so bad I feel bad for getting it   It has a horrible sensor   But, my best mouse is on my laptop

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works, but there are too many drawbacks.   I have one of these and I bought it to use it as a desktop monitor.  It is perfect for a desktop, but not ideal for any kind of work (even if it is the smallest one I could find in a store that had an adapter for it).   First, you have to keep adjusting the resolution of it in order to get a decent image (you can barely see what is on the screen).  And, if you are using it with another program that supports this type of monitor, then the image is so small that it's hard to read it.  So, you can use this as a monitor but not in a way that will be very useful (it does work for a little bit though).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't even like smart phones   When it came out in the fall of 2009 my wife (who is a little more sophisticated than I) thought it would be the ultimate way to get an old computer back in business.   It worked, but there was an   lot of maintenance   that came with a smart phone   That being said, I don' t think   the Apple   phone  will be   relevant   in my   life for a while

I was a little concerned that the batteries wouldn't last, but it didn't matter because I never used it to do much work anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are a lot of good things about this device. The first thing I noticed about this radio is that when you receive a station, it starts playing right away.   Also, if you hit play on your radio you can hear any station that you have already downloaded to your device.  I can only find three functions on this radio, but they are all useful.  It has a memory function that makes it useful when you forget the station you want to listen to.  Also it has a digital display of the stations you are listening to and they are always readable.  Overall I like this radio.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The main selling point of this set is that it can track your movement and provide you with a live display.   It has all of the things you would want in a set like this (tracking, display, and so on).   That being said,   it only offers to track your location via GPS at the time you buy the set.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used the "I got one of these when i was 16 and I'll never be the same again" thing twice.  First, it would work for a couple of weeks, and then it would die within a day, due to power issues.  Next, I forgot to set the "disconnect" switch to ON.  And then I found that it only gave out the speed of about 3.7 Mbps.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new MacBook Air, and immediately regretted my purchase as the battery went dead after about 12 hours.   As a professional I do a lot of work on my laptop and have an interest in all aspects of technology, I was also hoping that the MacBook Air would be a decent enough product for my work.  Unfortunately, the battery seems to be a bad idea and I'll be looking for another model in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got a "newer" iPod for my 13 year old and the "old" one had a chip that was only meant to last a few years. So I bought the new iPod because I had heard that the newer ones don't use chips so they are more durable. Well the iPod was not just "smudged up" but it also smelled terrible. I have since sent it back and ordered a new one to be returned for refund.

Then,   when   someone else bought  $60   of   keyboard   to use with   this   machine   and   bought    this .   it   broke !   If   you   want   these   things  ,   buy   eBay .

In my   original  the battery   was a flat rectangle.  Now   it   has a flat plastic tip   that gets stuck on the plastic on the back   of the charger   and you cannot remove the battery  because  the flat plastic  tip  has come off the bottom   so you have to remove the back of the battery with a screwdriver   to remove   the plastic

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing to note about this device is that it's not a "good" headphone amp.   A $30 pair of headphones sound bad to me when I use a cheap USB headphone amp like this one.  It might work for some, but that's about all I can say about it.  It might be the headphone cables or the USB cables in the cable, but it doesn't help with the headphones.  My $20 headphones sound better than when I buy these headphones from Walmart 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a terrible product that is useless for a number of reasons.   It is a pain in the ass to use, no matter how much you do to make it easy and neat.  When I try to use it for the first time, I get stuck trying to plug it in to my TV, and I can't figure out what to do to get the TV to turn itself off.  The remote does nothing when I'm using it.  For me, the problem is that the only way I can control my TV is to use the remote and a piece of software I don't even know how to use.  I've looked in the directions and I just can't seem to figure it out.  There are plenty of great remote apps out there, but I just want to know what to think about this product before I put it in my TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The i5-3320M works, but for the price I expected something more... I purchased a couple of these tablets in November, 2011. After all, the 3320M was the first laptop with Intel mobile processors, and it was also the first Intel-based system I tried. I got the machine for under $1000 on sale.   One of the main issues for me with the 33xxMs, was the screen resolution: It's not great. It's much worse than on the Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch model (the other one that was a disappointment), but the screen is the main problem.  Also, it's just a bit heavy to type on:  The touchpad is a decent option if you're not too concerned about precision.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been using this as a remote control for my TV for the past few months.   The remote has several features:  It allows you to change the channel  It has a scroll wheel that can be used to adjust volume  It contains a few built in "recipes" that can help you watch television   It is very simple and takes up very little space   While the main problem is the design, I have found that the TV itself does not work very well with this remote:  First, the picture is very poor with the remote.  It's hard to see the picture through the tiny picture screen.  Second, I can't adjust the volume to the proper level.  Finally, since the remote is so small, it is very hard to find where you need to press to adjust the picture   After watching about 6 seasons of Dexter (my favorite show), I gave up and switched to another remote.

It made the display very tiny, so if I wanted to read anything, I'd have to read it off the screen.  After a week of   buying new tablets for my kids,  I just went back to using my   Samsung.

The replacement was in perfect working order and was exactly what I wanted.   The camera was the same as my old and it worked flawlessly.  It has all the advantages of a digital camera, including the ability to scan the card and view the images, and it is more rugged than the Sony's.

It took a ton of time to get it to work correctly and the video is horrible   I purchased the camera thinking that it would be great for video recording because it has a high definition screen   It only has a 640 x 480 video recording resolution   At best it's better than a VHS tape   When you connect the camera to your computer, you get a video stream that looks like jpg.   No audio or image   If the camera is not working, you have to buy a dv cam and use that

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In my humble opinion, the new Samsung Galaxy S4   (the one   I bought)   is   the worst   product   ever   made   by   Samsung .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The Samsung Galaxy S4 is a good phone, but it's pretty much unusable, and there's no good way to get around it.   It doesn't come with a data plan, so you need to use a 2G data plan (in addition to the phone's own data plan), and you have to use an adapter that comes with it (even then, it doesn't work).   Also, if you have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, you can't use the S4 as a screen.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received this camera a few days ago.   The camera itself is very sleek.  The lens cap has a few scratches on it.  It was a good idea to make the lens cap out of metal because the lens does scratch easily and if the plastic cap came off the lens would be damaged.  But, I did not try to remove the plastic lens cap.  (The plastic caps will not come off even after soaking in hot water for several minutes.)   Another thing that irritates me about this camera is that the buttons are very small and have to be pressed very hard to activate them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got my iPod, I was hoping that there was a more useful "saver" function that would "unlock" my iPod (put it in "sleep mode" and not have it on all the time) when I left my computer.   I didn't get a chance to try it out, since my computer's backlight is broken (so the iPod stays on all of the time).   In the meantime, I have had a little trouble with the music "listening" feature.  After about an hour, I start losing a track (or maybe it's the other way around) and having to go back and listen to it.  If you are someone who likes music on your iPod, then you should get a different iPod.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The computer works and does its job just fine.    Unfortunately, I bought it because I wanted a laptop but didn't want to buy a whole computer just for this thing.  I've used it a couple times and it's a little difficult.  A couple times it has been able to recognize my keystrokes but it keeps changing the key so every time I type "welcome" the computer says "weren't able to read"

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The   3D printer   was   on the fritz   and   broke   in 3 hours  .   So we bought a   other   3D printer to replace it   at about a third of the price.   It   works   fine   with   all   materials   but   plastic   seems to be   the most   difficult   to handle   (   a little rough   )       When   we are out of   2D printer filament   it  has   broken in   less   than   15 minutes   so   maybe   that   is   why   this   doesn't   have   any   filament .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard was very stiff. I was hoping the key spacing would be more spaced out so I could type without moving the mouse or trying to get my fingers in a certain position on the key.   It's hard to set your computer to a specific language if your keyboard isn't used to it.  I tried to learn Polish, German and French by typing to learn a word and using the keys to look at the words and sentences.  My laptop is not able to handle it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Lenovo T400s several years ago.   The T400 is a great computer.  However, the T400 can't do as much for you as it does for me.  I use a small video camcorder to capture the footage that I use in my job.  Since I am an artist, the camera is always at hand, and is used almost daily.  My camera doesn't take 1080p video, but my computer is.  Also, the screen quality in 720p is not great.  In addition to the screen issues, there is no SD card slot.  The camera must be used with an external USB card.  A USB to SD adapter would be a nice addition to this laptop.  This laptop is perfect for someone who wants a simple, affordable computer with adequate hardware and a good feature set.  But the T40s is better for someone in the real world who wants good performance, but has to worry about the costs associated with the peripherals. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very poor build quality on the camera.   It takes a very long time to start up.  Even with the battery attached, it takes a long time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is not the best electronic device for the money.   The sound is loud but not too great.  You get the sound if you plug in an ipod and it sounds fine.  The volume is pretty good but I don't really listen to music.  As for the pictures:  The only good pictures in the box are the back.  There is no way it fits on my car.  When I pulled out the box it was in a piece of junk that was hard to work with.  It is also a waste of time to go in and use a tool to remove the cover.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As an avid audiophile, i am in love with this headphone.   At first, it sounded like a good headphone, but in a year with it, it has lost its sonic quality.  The sound stage is huge but there is no depth to it.  It's just a large speaker with no back pressure.  I love my  Audeze Sine in the $500 price range.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using my "Smart" Power Line Kit for 2 years now.   The kit is very inexpensive and is very good at delivering power.  Once you have some experience with Power Lines, you can figure out what is happening and what you are doing wrong.  So I bought the kit because it was on sale.  However I found it impossible to get a "power" line to work for more than 2 meters or so.  The power wire that goes to my remote, is about 2m long.  That was a real problem for a year.  I finally got a longer one to use and it is now OK.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device as a kid when I was in the 10th grade. My brother and I used it on our old C-64 and I was amazed at how many games we could play on a very small piece of junk. But I am very disappointed in this. I bought my unit after it stopped working for some reason and then had to send it back to get a new one, then it went out again with a whole new battery pack, and then finally got it working again. After trying a few different methods (turn off the computer, turn it on again, plug it in, etc) nothing worked. When it finally worked a couple of times, it got stuck on the loading screen. It was so frustrating to get to the main menu then not be able to play anything.   This device is just an expensive plastic case with a cheap plastic back.

It's a waste of money if you can use a Bluetooth speaker from the same manufacturer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod doesn't really work very well as a music player.   I don't have a lot of space on my iPod for songs, and it doesn't play music very well.  There's a feature called "iTunes Anywhere"  that let's you download a file to an iPod that you can then listen to on a computer.  However,  iTunes Anywhere is only available if you have a Windows or Mac computer. When  I go to download a song from  iTunes,  my computer says the download is blocked.  I've  had  to delete  all the music  on my  computer  to get a song to play on my iPod.  This  can be  a  really  annoying   if   it's  the first time   you  use  it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the new MacBook Air a few days ago, and had been looking forward to using it for a while.   It came with a couple USB ports, which worked okay for my old laptop (a 1GB/1.5Gig card)   Unfortunately, after replacing the 1GB card with an upgrade, the MacBook Air had a hard time booting.  I replaced the card, and now it works fine.  It's also cheaper now that the card is a bit better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have just purchased the KX10.   It's amazing   but when I got it I found that the sound output was too low   and that's a shame because   this is a very good   mixer   in my opinion    Rated 4 out of 5 by Matt R. from Great little mixer I have a pair of the RME Fireface and these were the closest thing to having both in one unit.  I used the R-3 on a few gigs and the Fireface on a couple, and both are very similar.  The Fireface has an extra USB input but these had 2-1/2" and 3-1-1 connectors which didn't work with my computer.  They also have a volume control but not a mute.  It still is an outstanding little mixer, but it was just a bad match for my computer and I would suggest these over it if you have either one.

Now I have to listen to the music on my iPod through a different device.  There's also a little noise in the background while playing.  This thing is not cheap and it should have a better design.

The problem is that it's also very dim, and the only way you can get that to change is to put a big bulb next to it.  I also can't tell the difference between the different output ranges.  It might be nice if it had a few more range settings.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As an audio person, I am always on the lookout for nice sounding devices that do not break the bank. I did a search on the internet for a decent portable CD player and found a few, but the price is way too high, and the quality is awful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A good idea with poor execution.   The microsd card adapter that comes with the unit is way to small, and it can't be inserted in the computer case without opening up the computer to remove it.  It also has a screw holding the card in place on the adapter, that when removed, it allows the card to be inserted with the screw removed.  The adapter's small size means it takes up quite a bit of space in the case.  This is also a common issue with these products.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing that sucks is that all the ports are covered by the plastic shield that's supposed to protect the electronic components.   It's not a major problem when you don't plan to use the computer, but it becomes a pain in the ass when you do. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery life is terrible. It drains the batteries fast. When the battery is fully depleted it goes into a loop, charging until it drops to 5% (that's when it'll start to drain again). The charger does the rest of the work and just charges it once. I've only gotten one recharge out of it (which is enough to get a good few songs, so maybe that's a good thing...but at least it worked to the last percent...no more waiting a full minute for the phone to charge).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took quite a while to find out it is NOT a USB device.   First, the instructions are pretty bad.  I followed the steps very carefully, and got to the USB part but the computer said "no device found".   Then I found out that you have to connect the USB device to the computer before it is recognized, not after.  You can't even type in an old name into the device!   After looking on the web I found this blog post   which is helpful   for connecting a USB card   but not for a computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was my first time using a dongle to connect a camera to a computer. The dongles I have used before that I found useful were bulky and cumbersome, and my computer did not have an HDMI port that the dongler would be compatible with.   My other camera donglers I've used have been too small to fit my DSLR camera, but my computer was big enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, the speaker is way too loud. I don't know if its just that I'm using a big screen TV (LG 55LB5120), but the sound is muffled to the point that I get a headache just by hearing it.   That's a huge problem.  The "voice activated" mode is pretty cool but the volume slider is too hard to reach, you can't adjust the volume easily because of the slider, and even worse, the microphone gets in the way.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After replacing the hard disk with a more expensive mechanical hard drive, I found that the hard drive has a tendency to randomly (on occasion) stop writing data.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I can't recommend this product to anyone!   There are so many "smart" features that don't work as well as advertised.

The main problem is that when you press the buttons, nothing happens.

So, I decided I'd wait until the next new generation   of electronic devices to replace this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first used the K8200 I was disappointed.  It came as a large kit with no instruction.  I went to the nearest Sears and picked it up and  got to the part to attach to the battery.   It was difficult to get to the proper angle to fit it in the battery and I couldn't figure out how to  use the supplied tool.  There was no instruction booklet either, I had to go to the local library to look it up.  At that time my  Samsung  Galaxy S7  was a bit old and  needed a new battery so  I purchased the K7200.  The K7100 is a very nice device  but it's not worth the $$,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got my i7-2600K I was really excited about the CPU, and the CPU is really fast, but it was very unreliable. I was in a 3 month running a 2 week marathon with only 4-5 hours of battery time between uses. I had to wait a month before buying a new one because I just didn't want to risk anything. I recently got a 4th one, but not for the CPU;   After buying the 2 new CPU's, I used the stock CPU for about 10 minutes at about 25% load and the chip began to fail.   Now I know why my i5's lasted forever;  I also received the RAM today;  The RAM is great, but I was hoping to get something else.  I've been thinking about getting an Intel Pro 5000 instead, but am hesitant on spending so much on a new CPU for it as I am sure my old one would be just fine for the price.  It's good for now, but with 4-8 years of use it is only going to wear out a little faster.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this a few months ago after looking online for something similar.   The light on the light side of the device is not strong enough, especially at night when the LED light is on.  Also   the USB port for charging  is not waterproof,   and   there is a short time period in which the device will not charge,  especially if   you are plugged in while charging.  (I have a laptop charger that takes almost 1 hour to charge this thing.)

When I got this phone, I looked at it and it is so small that I can't even take a picture.  Also, there is NO battery indicator on it at all, so I can never tell if it is low, or whether it is on or off.

I have a MacBook Air with USB 1.1 built in, which has an incredibly bad trackpad and terrible battery life.   This is not the case with this thing, though, which is why I'm giving it a 4 star rating.  It's cheap  , but also super light   and is also pretty good at transferring files.

It took awhile for it to arrive but when it did, it came in a large package with many small pieces.  It is so frustrating when I try to use it.

I'm so frustrated by the lack of security

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because I thought it was an inexpensive way to listen to my MP3s.   The first time I plugged it in I had a hard time getting it to work.  It wouldn't recognize the cd's I have.  Then I found that there is a resistor in the device which limits the signal to 20-30k ohms (if you are on the higher end of audiophile levels, you can use a 0.1uF cap in the audio input to reduce that signal).   Now that I've figured out how to use it properly, it's been great.  I get a good sound and can tell when it's being recorded.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had used a Garmin GPS device for many years before getting this one a few years ago.

It can be adjusted to work in this situation, but it is still not perfect   When I use it to start and ride a long distance ride, it takes a while to find a place to set it to.  In addition, I am having a problem with it. I set up my cell phone, but can't get it to work with it anymore.  I am going to try other GPS devices, but this one is a big disappointment

I also have to manually adjust the power setting.  It works fine for music but the batteries never last long.  They should be recalled
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i purchased two of these about a month apart.   This was one of the better deals i found (after i had to pay a $25 fee).   One is a $200 device with a crappy display.  i've replaced it with a $400.  It's a nice idea to put a display in it but the display isn't very good and the price is way too high.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keypad was the weakest part of the setup.   I'm not sure what they were thinking when designing it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this a month ago, I had it shipped out, and I am still trying to figure out what I like and what I don't.   The main reason I'm not using it more is the volume control.  It's kind of hard to reach for some items.  A lot of the time you'd just press it and get the volume up, but this control is so hard to get to.  Also, the battery is not very strong.  I can't remember how much time I've spent using the speaker for about 2 minutes without it dying, and you definitely need to charge it.  My main reason for buying this is because it doesn't come with a remote.  The remote I got is about 6 years old and it's not worth the money I'm spending.

The only problem I have is the fact that it is really hard to get a full charge from the USB cable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So this thing worked great for a while, but a while it did. My old laptop had a hard drive failure which caused me to upgrade to a new laptop, but this old laptop was still in a laptop/tablet mode and used the internal hard drive.   After installing my new machine, I couldn't get the laptop to work, it didn't recognize my old computer's hard drive and the only option available was to replace the hard drive with an external hard drive (that was $45, a bit too much for something that is only a temporary fix, not something that would last my lifetime).   The laptop also would not recognize my new laptop's hard drives because it didn''t read from the external hard drives.  I ended up replacing my old hard drive, but the whole process was very frustrating.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would have bought a 3G/4G modem from a 3rd party, but this one is an aftermarket device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had this thing since October, and it's the worst thing I've ever bought.   The only way you can tell its a real hard drive is by looking in a mirror.  They use some kind of glue that you can't get out of your hard drive unless you really want to.  It's also difficult to find a professional to do a "repair" since you are supposed to use your own hard drive.  I also don't care about the storage space.  The warranty is the worst.  In my case, the hard drive failed and I was able to get a replacement without buying another hard drive, which I would have to buy anyway.  You can buy a "professional" to replace it, but if I really wanted to replace my hard drive myself, I'd just buy a new laptop and use my old one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because my old Apple IIe did not have the battery backup option (I do not want to leave my computer on all night), but when I bought my old one, it had this feature already and was also an Apple II.   It does not do this.  It was not until I got a new computer that I was able to find this feature in a computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am very happy with the quality of the product, but   the only thing that is a little bit annoying   is   that   there   has   to be some sort of warranty   for   all   accessories   It   takes a long time   before   it   goes   back  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit I used to replace the unit I replaced my old computer with was not what I expected when I bought it. When it arrived the first thing I noticed is that the USB port was no longer attached. That was odd since the new computer had a USB port attached.   It took me a while to realize it was broken.  After a bit of time the new unit worked fine but the old unit was defective in other ways.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is that the batteries are cheap and weak (the two you have are the only ones that work).  The camera itself is a pain to use because the control panel isn't labeled -   I'll probably return the camera and get a better one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The USB cable is a joke. I purchased this to connect an iPad to a Mac. The cable was designed for USB ports on computers, not iPods. The only thing I could connect to my iPod was a hard drive.   I just got one, and the connection doesn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I saw this thing I couldn't believe how large it was!   It's about as large as a large desktop computer, but the back of it is rounded so it's easy to slide in and out of my computer bag.   This is one of those products that I had hoped would work and do what I needed it to do, but it's still too big for my needs and I don't plan to use it that way much. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've tried many chargers and all are terrible:  They all have poor power and poor voltage drop:  The Energizer I've tested doesn't even charge the batteries at max:  If they weren't such a rip off, I'd buy a cheap Energiser or try one of the new batteries:  But then, it is the worst charger

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a Dell XPS 15 with a 128gb SSD, 64gb mSATA SSD and a 256gb M.2 SATA SSD  for the same price I paid for a Windows 8 machine  I already had.   No big deal -  I use it mainly for music and watching videos but  I did use it to create a 3d modeling app,   but its slow,  doesn't get too hot (even with heavy graphic work),  and  it just isn't as powerful as my MacBook Pro.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got this, I thought it was a joke - like "what's so funny about a remote that has a button on it?"  The first time I used it, I was disappointed because I didn't have a remote to use.   It's also not very powerful.  It has 1-2 buttons that allow you to record a recording or adjust it, but the remote doesn't come with one.  The last time I tried to use the remote on it, it turned out to be broken - the power is only 1/4 of a volt.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem is, I really had no use for it until this one:  After a month or so of having it in my car to keep a flashlight on when I have to be in the store or something, my cell phone died (well, it died for several days).  So I decided to get a new one.  After waiting for a week and a half for it to arrive (it took a while to be shipped from Hong Kong, I'm not complaining, but I'm really glad I waited), I plugged it in to make sure it worked, then left it on the charger.  The next day, I took it out of the charging case, plugged it into the USB port on my laptop, and went to the store.  So far, it worked perfectly, and I'm now on the lookout for a replacement.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I own a cheap electronic device that is not as good as I'd like, but at least it turns on.   This is the third one, and while they were cheap (and cheap in the good way), they failed to meet my expectations.  I am in the business of making videos of people walking around and I do not have a lot of money.  This   device   has   failed   at   me   many   times   time   and   is   just   not   good   now.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After reading many bad reviews about the new iPhone (I bought mine in August for my wife's birthday), I bought one to replace my old one (from a year ago, when the 4G version of it came out).   It's a terrible device, and you can't even hold it properly to make a call without using a case, and it won't even send or receive text messages on its own.   The new iPhone's battery is better than this one, but it still takes hours and hours to get a full charge. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought an   Sony PXW-X250C   because I wanted to record video with a camcorder in a   backpacking   camera bag.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been looking for the perfect gaming mouse for a couple of years.   This mouse is a complete disappointment.  It's not nearly as responsive as I hoped it would be, and the cable is almost useless as the buttons don't always work.  Also, the buttons have a tendency to get stuck.  I had my mouse for about a year, and there have been several occasions where I put the cable in backwards.  The worst part is that I have to spend $25 on a new mouse to avoid buying a defective device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It came as expected, but the connection for the charging port is too flimsy.   When you want to charge the phone, the charger doesn't come out.  It makes it really hard to use the phone when the power is still off.
