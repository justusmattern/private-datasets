Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author spends most of the book telling us how great she is, and then when it all comes crashing down, it doesn't really seem that great.   I don't know how anyone can enjoy the work as much as the author has and then walk away from it disappointed because it doesn  After reading a few reviews, I decided I liked this book. The main reason was because of the title. There are so many great things about this book, but I'm going to talk about what I think are the most disappointing aspects. I like to read about history and history is one of the main focus of this book because of a lot of the events and people mentioned. This is not to say I don�t enjoy history, it is just the history that is in this book was very lackluster. I didn't even find the story interesting, I was just interested in learning more about the people and events mentioned. One of the things that I noticed was that I was expecting a lot more from the author. I know a lot is made about authorial intent, but the author wasn't a very good writer. It isn't all that difficult for an author to be a good writer, but it takes a lot to make it through the book with only one or two pages of plot. The plot seems to be very generic, it has nothing to do with the book. I guess I just need to be more selective in books I read. I do like the author's sense of humor, and it is nice to read an author who doesn't take themselves too seriously. But, I guess that isn't enough to make up for the lack of plot and character development in this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:     The best story in this book is the conclusion.   I thought the author was a genius on how to write such an elaborate plot and the resolution. I just wish that this book wasn't that long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very poor book. The author, in an effort to make a quick buck, makes up and claims to be a historian. But the research is poor and the conclusions are not supported by the text.   I found it very confusing and very hard to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book, mainly because it was too long. I feel that the story should have been a longer one.   It would have been nice if they did this in the first place.    Overall, I would still recommend it to people looking for something new in the "literary sci-fi" genre, but I think they would have done better with a shorter book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm only disappointed that it takes more than 50 pages for the heroine to develop her character. The rest of the book is mostly a setup for a sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book and thought it had potential, but it was completely ruined by the author's poor writing skills.  The main character is supposed to be the perfect person, but instead he's a pathetic, selfish, lying, arrogant, narcissistic jerk.  He has no friends, doesn't really care who he marries, and doesn't give a shit about anyone else.   This book has absolutely nothing to do with either Harry Potter or Hunger Games, and really makes me want to turn the page and read about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was good while it lasted, but by the time it was done, it was clear that the author has no idea how to make good story and character development into something enjoyable.   She's been making books like these since she was in high school, but I had never realized how bad they really were. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book. I had the book in my hands for two days and I couldn't put it down. It had everything a reader could want in an introduction to the game, from its history to the basic rules. But, alas, I couldn`t get through all the way through. I got very little from the text, which I felt was written in a dry, analytical way. I felt like I was reading a book by a professor, and that I had learned nothing. For a beginner like me, the text was confusing and I had a hard time figuring out the basic concepts. I would rate this book 2 stars for the simple fact that there isn`t enough here for me to enjoy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was not easy to read and the characters were not as interesting as the author wanted them to be. The author did a terrible job writing a history of war and why the Nazis and Fascists took power in various countries around the world, and how those regimes functioned in the end.  I liked the idea of the author telling the story as it is written, but it didn't feel real. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is that it gives a very good idea of what sort of world the Hitchhiker's are living in.   Unfortunately, the book is just a compilation of scenes.  Unfortunately the plot is a little dull and the ending too much of an anticlimax. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I will be picking up a copy of this book soon! I have enjoyed many of the other books by Dr. Carver, but it is always a disappointment when he has not come through with a great book on a given subject. In this case, his treatment of the subject is not only very dry and dull, but also quite bizarre and not understandable by anybody who doesn't understand science. I understand that there are things that do not need to be understood and that some of the details may be very important, but he has been very pedantic in his treatment and I would have been better off just buying a copy at the library.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book to learn about the game of baseball. I am disappointed in the information, it seems, in the book. The author has to make up many facts just to give the player a chance at winning in a game of such importance.  This book is not about baseball, but about a guy who went through a lot in life and it just ends with the fact that he was a failed player.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to help me learn German for my future travel and the book was really interesting and helped me a lot.  Unfortunately, this book is really bad,   as it doesn't teach German at all  and the grammar is bad.  I learned about the first few days and then realized that they didn't teach me anything, because I was doing it by myself,  which is no fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best part of reading this book was the information I learned about the history of the United States during the 1800s. I know there is a new edition coming out in February, but I didn't have it when I read the book. I'm glad I'm now a bit more informed. I just wish the authors would've gotten the history right, and given more details about the lives of the people of that time. For example, it's pretty obvious that in the 19th century, the Civil War was a major event for a lot of people. When did they learn about the Civil war? This book isn't going to convince me, but it will help me understand a little bit more about the time I grew up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character, Luke, gets the best ending of any character in the book, only to be betrayed, abandoned, and murdered by a gang of sadistic thugs.   I didn't particularly like the story, the characters were unsympathetic, and there was little in the way of drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading this book, I don't recommend it to anyone else. It's a very disorganized book that has no flow to it and very little in the way of story.  The story follows the protagonist for nearly 50 pages and does not progress in any way throughout the course of the story. The author makes a few attempts at telling the story through some of the flashbacks that are used throughout the book, but for the most part, I was just left wanting more.  As a horror reader, I enjoyed the main character being a girl who lived in a rural town, but her story would have been more interesting if she had some connection to the townsfolk or if there were some other characters in the book who would have had a more prominent role.   This is what I would consider a good book, if it wasn't for the way it reads. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book about how a young man's self esteem comes back to him and he is successful in college, but it's a disappointing book, not as entertaining as I wanted to be.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So, I loved this book until it was over. I got about 40% of the way through, had the protagonist's last name on my mind, and I was starting to like him. When it came to the end, all of that vanished.   In the first few pages, the characters were introduced, and the story followed along. It had a nice, simple plot line. I was pretty impressed.  Then, I saw that the last book in the series had a very different ending, and that made me wonder if this book would be anything like that.  It had no happy ending, no happy feeling, no real closure to the book.  I really wanted to like it.  So I had this book sitting on my shelf, and after a while I had to put it down. I liked the idea of a girl's life as a spy, and it was nice that she was getting back into the world at a young age, but the book was nothing more than "well, at least the kids all have a happy ending."  I won't be reading this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been reading this book for a while and so far it's not bad, but not great either. It has some very good things and I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but it's also a very slow book to read.    Overall, I recommend this book to my friends who like science-fiction books, but I would not recommend it for the average person, as the book is very long and it's hard to put down.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this to be an interesting and well written book. The ideas in it are quite well thought out. But I do feel that the author does not give enough credit to the women in his life, the ones who are important to him but are mostly not seen in a positive light. As someone who is a feminist and understands the importance of female empowerment and the value of the female voice. I found the author to be not just insensitive and unsympathetic to women but at times to be completely condescending towards them.  For example, at one point the author writes "Men who are in the process of being told they're stupid often respond by doing stupid things that are only slightly stupid."  In response to that statement I felt the author implied that women are not capable of understanding complex concepts and that they only have a limited ability to read and understand complex ideas.  This type of attitude is not only offensive to women.  It is just flat out inaccurate and condescending to all men. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I'd read this book sooner... I'm a writer by trade and a reader by passion, so I was very excited about reading this book. Unfortunately, I was so frustrated by its writing, that I just gave up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The pacing was not as good as I had hoped, but the book was still interesting, so I'll give it that. The first part was extremely depressing. There's a reason why a lot of my books were a mix of happy and sad. It's a good read regardless.  The pacing was good, but I can't help but feel a bit mopey about the way the book ends.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad part:  In this book we have an interview with a guy who's been in prison and in prison for a long time for what seems like a really silly crime.   I get that he's being interviewed about his past, but I also get that this guy has been in the system for 30 years.  There's really no reason why they couldn't have gone back and tried this guy for other crimes.  But even when they're talking about the past, the whole section about his childhood is just wrong.  I don't think the book's premise is really very well thought out.  It's hard to tell how they'd make the book better without changing it entirely.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this for my son and he loved it. I was excited about reading this, especially as I really wanted a good book for Christmas. The story is fun, it's well written and I was really enjoying the romance. It made for an interesting Christmas Eve but I didn't feel fulfilled. I think that if you have children (especially younger ones) and you like the sound of the plot, I'd buy this again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited when I heard about this book because I've been wanting to read it. Unfortunately, it is not an enjoyable read.   A bad writer and a terrible title made this read painful to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book because there were so many things wrong with it. It was very repetitive and there were only a few different themes that got brought up (but there were not enough for me to remember). I've never seen so many inconsistencies in a book before. I'm always on the lookout for a good, well written novel and this one seemed to be lacking that. The narrator was just a little too serious at times, and I could have done without all the'sadness' and 'fear'. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is boring and I hated it. It had many good things and was a very good read. I enjoyed reading it, but my favorite part was the time it took to get the ending, especially because the characters all had to be dragged kicking and screaming through it. I really don't know why it was a hard book to read but I liked it for what it was.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this to read and was extremely disappointed. The story is interesting and the author is interesting. Unfortunately it all went downhill from the beginning. The ending was a bit rushed and it was not at all satisfying.  Posted by Amy at 4:19 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book - I am currently in the process of writing a book on the history of the world, and this book was one of my top reading for the fall semester. I was looking for a historical work that is comprehensive, well-written and is accessible to the layperson - and I found it in "The Bible." The author manages to cover a huge amount of material in a compact book, with the results being interesting and interesting to read. The text itself is very interesting, and I'm looking forward to the author's next book - the next book will likely include an introduction.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole thing was not what I expected. I'm glad I read it but I would not recommend it to anyone who doesn't already know about the "new age" movement.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is nothing but hype and hype and more hype. The concept is very simple - go out there and talk to people. The story is nothing more than a compilation of anecdotes, anecdotes, and anecdotes. You do get an insight into how a real life situation can impact someone mentally and you even see what happens when people are exposed to trauma. The problems with this book stem from how the author is very self-promotional and is only interested in being seen as one of the "cool kids". It would have been a much more interesting book had it not been based on anecdotes, stories and anecdotes, rather than actual scientific evidence.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was nothing more than a cheap rip off of a classic.  I would have much preferred if he had used the original material rather than attempting to take it down a couple of levels at a time. The characters, the plot, and the writing were all subpar and felt rushed (even though it was just three months before the movie release). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most boring, tedious, and shallow novel I have ever read.   I don't think this book will make anyone interested in reading anything else by C.S. Lewis.  I'm glad I read this, however, because I've gotten the distinct impression that Lewis has written a lot of great books over the years. I hope he keeps publishing great books for a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The novel is a bit boring.  I know it's a book on human behavior and development, but it lacks much in the way of interesting, interesting characters, interesting setting, etc.  The main character is just too dull. I can't imagine having any lasting relationships with him, because he is just a ditherer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book in order to have a better understanding of how to teach kids about mathematics. I read through the whole thing, but after a couple of pages I was already bored. It was difficult for me to believe that I didn't understand the concepts, so I had to go back and read the whole book again to see if my understanding was still good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, written in 1852, by a man who had to work in a coal mine to support his family. I am sorry, but that is just too bad. The main character is not very interesting and very unrealistic. I think the book could have been much better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry, I read the book when I bought it as a gift, and it is so terribly written that I couldn't enjoy the book. The writing was so bad, I couldn' get through it even though I had read several others by this author.  I am now going to buy the next book and hope that it will be good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping this would be the book that would finally bring me into the world of modern Paganism. Unfortunately, the book is full of errors, distortions, and downright lies, to the point that it's not even clear why it's called "Modern Paganism," or why it matters.  The first time I tried to read it I immediately gave up, but after reading it again the other night I realized that I would have been better off just turning the book in, especially since the author is such a terrible source.  He has a history of getting the facts wrong, and even the first few times I read it, I thought the errors were obvious and blatant, and he would have just given a "you shouldn't have read it" or "just skip it" message.  It's sad that the author never took the time to read up on the field of modern paganism.  But this is the only book that I think I'll read on this topic since I have other better resources at hand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is terrible, the characters are shallow and stupid, the plot is contrived, the execution is bad. No wonder it was a huge hit at one book fair.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. It was disappointing because of how similar this is to the previous book, and because of the lack of depth or characterization. There's just a lot of backstory with the characters but little actual character development. There is one good scene where the heroine starts to develop a little, but that's about it. This story is better for the fact that the author is still working on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were so many   flaws in this book. For instance the author seems to be missing the point of   the research he has put into the material, for example that no one ever died from hypothermia. The   author did not explain why the   result is what it is. He also did not provide a   justification why there is no consensus among   experts that hypothermically treating a patient with heart attack should be done by using a cardiorespiratory bypass machine. The author did   not provide   any   references to support the claims he makes. I felt   that the conclusion would be   supported by   data but as of now I can not   agree with the conclusions he arrived at. This book is not  a must read book, it is just a book of  junk science.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was my first novel and my first review. This is by far the most unprofessional book ever written. I will not be buying a book from this author again. The formatting was off from the first chapter to the end. I really wanted to like this book but it just didn't work for me. I read this for the first time last night and really wasn't happy with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character, David, is just as annoying as the books he reads, and I'm not sure how I got so hung up on that.  I really, really disliked this book and I won't be buying it or listening to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read.   I think there are so many things wrong with it, I can't begin to list them.  I got through the first 50 pages and just got discouraged.  I didn't get much further than that.  This book should be thrown out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to give this a 4 or 5 but the writing is so clunky and poorly explained that I gave it a 1/2.   "I'm sorry that you have to be aware of this so often, but it really is a big problem.  It is one thing to be a feminist and to say you are not sexually attracted to men who look like this, or to be an out lesbian but be totally cool with a trans man or a transsexual.  I have a couple of very close female friends who are completely fine with having boyfriends, who have nothing to hide about their sexuality or gender identity.  But I am not in that group.  The reason I am posting this is that it has been a long time since I have read a book I liked that was written by a real person that I could relate to, who was not a sex therapist, who didn't try to get me to be the way they wanted me to have sex, and was not obsessed with being a good feminist.  It's a shame, because I would have liked to learn more about her and what made her tick.  For a book that says that she was so unhappy in her marriage that she tried to murder the whole thing to escape her misery and depression I am sorry that she ended up so bitter.  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are a big fan of a good book that you've read, this book is not for you.  The writing was very choppy, and there were no points where I really got hooked. I also had to put the book down and re-read to get back into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book off the shelf. It was the perfect gift for a friend who loves to read. The book was not well written. The characters were not developed at all. I did not feel like I was involved in this story. I ended up giving it back.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a nice book for a beginner to read but the content is just too much for me. I couldn't get it. It is not so much a book, but more of a thesis. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book, but the plot is lame and the characters are flat.   All the stories are about the different ways in which one man can learn and grow, and it seems to just focus on that, while the author makes the most of it in a few specific cases, but it's a bit tacked on.  I mean, you'd think the author would realize that a lot of time is spent talking about what to do with his life instead of the ways that one can grow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was good for a while, but the ending is very weak.   A few of the characters are introduced, but no real development happens.  I can't really say it wasn't my fault, but I think they could have made a better story out of this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read it as a "history" book on World War II, and I was pleasantly surprised that the book is pretty well researched. The book describes the conflict of World War Two through the perspective of German civilians and British soldiers who were caught up in it. The author takes time to explain why the British were seen as so bad and the Germans so good, and it's well-written and informative. It's very interesting to see how both sides see what happened. My main disappointment with this book is that the story of the Germans has no place in it--the author wants us to believe that the German soldiers fought as they did because they were German, not because they fought as some kind of mindless mass of fanatics who were more interested in murdering civilians than killing the Nazis. Also, I really hope that the next installment of the series (World War II) will go into the German side of things and explain why they were so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I tried this book, it was a good read. The characters were all fleshed out, the story was engaging and entertaining, and it had a pretty good plot. However, the second time I read it I couldn't put it down. I got stuck on the plot, so I reread the entire book. I finally put the book down and didn't pick it up again. If you are into detective fiction and want something to read that is easy to get into and that is good, then this is definitely worth a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was so much that was wrong with this book, I just wanted to throw it out the window and move on to a new read. I was so disappointed by the characters and the plot and it's just hard to believe that someone with the name of Rowling has such an awful grasp on her subject. I am not even going to mention any of the things that weren't as they should have been, the main character being just too much of a self insert. This book was too boring and repetitive to ever become good. If you have to read this book you will just feel awful, and I mean really awful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written, the characters are shallow, the plot is badly thought out. The writing has no flow and is very tedious.   Also, not a lot of information was given about the characters, especially about their motives. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all wrong. This book should have been called "Why not this book?" This book does not show you how to make money and have a great time in your life. I bought this book because I read an article on the Internet and I thought "maybe I should buy a book just like that". It is wrong on so many levels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was pretty excited to read this, I love the Harry Potter series, so I thought I was in good hands. Unfortunately, this book just made me annoyed.  It seemed like a waste of space, I really wanted to learn more about magic.  I don't really believe that magic is real. I'm not a believer in it at all.   And this book, it was just so...boring.  The Harry Potter books are so amazing, so exciting, and so creative and different and interesting!  But this book was so boring, I was just bored to tears. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for my husband to read because it's in the "Dictionaries of the English Language" section. He didn't like it. I know it's a "dictionary" but what it really isn't is a reference book. It's a dictionary of words that are "common".   This book is "very" useful if you know what you're looking for and what you can do with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for a class on how to use a computer for programming. I bought it for my self-study course as a bonus for the other books and it worked great. Unfortunately, the book doesn't have much practical value and it isn't worth the money for myself. The programming examples are quite clear but not exactly useful. The book is written in a very good book style but not as good as a technical text. The chapter on "The Power of a Simple Language" is one of the best on the subject but it is far from easy to understand. I spent quite a bit of time reading and trying to find something good in the book and I was not able to find it. For this book, I gave it a 3 because it wasn't very good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was boring to read, and I will probably only continue reading it for the sake of the "drama" in the characters (which I don't really like). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read.   I have always loved the fantasy genre and have read many books from the genre.  My book group is mostly adult.  I love to read fantasy.  This book is a complete waste of time and money. I have to wonder if it would be better if they didn't include the pictures at all.  It would have saved me time and annoyance, but that is the way they did it.  What happened to real writing?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has a few things that are good, but nothing of note.   One of the things that I find bad is that they have a chapter on the evolution of "the American Dream" in this country.  I never thought of America as a dream nation.  It makes it seem like a poor country that is still growing, but not really.  A big reason why the United States has become so powerful is because of its military might and economic might.  The United States is great because it is a superpower with a lot of money and a lot at stake in its economy.  In many ways the United Nations is still in the same boat, and I found that interesting.  What surprised me though is that the book is so good.  With such a short span of time, I could really tell that they had a lot to say and were really putting a lot into this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book I am not a big fan of, but was very curious to try out.   I was pleasantly surprised by what I found.  One thing I didn't like about it is that most of the characters are white.  The author makes the most of it in the last two pages, but in my opinion is a little bit too much on racial stereotypes.  However, the plot is decent, and I liked the ending.  I did like the ending of the book, and the characters' reactions to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would say this book isn't for everyone. The story is fairly simple and the language is pretty simple, too. However, I was surprised how easy this book is to read. The sentences flow so naturally, and the story is told so well, you're never left feeling like you're reading anything but the characters' thoughts. However...this book is for people who love good books. If you're one of those people, and you don't have much of an interest in fiction, this book might be the perfect fit for you. But it's for a very particular kind of person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading The Great Gatsby and I just finished it and I have to say the book is a complete let down.   It starts off great and then things take a turn for the worst and the final product is a disappointment.  I do believe there is an attempt by the author to make it into the great book that was so well written.  However the writing style is not the same as the classic version which makes the reading experience a total let down, and a total fail. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so glad I took the chance to buy this book. The cover is gorgeous and the book is pretty. It is so long though so I can't really get into any of the chapters. But the content is great and I have already started to look up information on all kinds of animals.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not a bad story, and it's a good idea to read and learn a few more things.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was bad. I had to throw away the entire second book because I couldn't keep up with the story. It got boring after a while.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't know what to expect with this book. I bought it from Amazon, as I normally do. I like it a lot, but the way I was left in the dark is so disappointing. I have a very easy time with books about children's literature.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only things good about this book are the title, and that it is based on a true story.    But the story itself isn't great.  It was very hard to follow and the story was overplayed. The author did this to make it seem realistic.  But it was pretty poor, because no one dies in the story. The book is also filled with the author making stuff up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book because I had read several reviews of it. The problem is that the author is a con artist, and he lied about virtually everything. If you think that the book is "great," you will be disappointed. This was a book that I could never get into because I knew the author was trying to push it and sell it for high prices.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's okay, but I was expecting something a little more... epic. The story is interesting but doesn't come off as very exciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't stand reading. This book is horrible. There are no laughs. The story is dull and boring. The dialogue is boring and unnatural. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been very interested in this book, but I couldn't put it down once I opened it.  I didn't even have time to read the book in the bookstores before going to the library.  My favorite character was the woman in the second chapter, and I think she was a real kickass lady, but it's clear that this book wasn't about her. It's about the man.  The woman is there as a contrast.  There were a number of interesting details and ideas, but the main character and the main story didn't develop as well as I'd have liked. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are no interesting stories in this book and it's too long. I really had to read it over two days to get into it and there's not much in there at all.   I could not put it down.  I think this book is too long as it has too much information. It's also way too long, there was nothing worth buying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The bad things about this book are not enough to outweigh the good things. It is a fun, silly book. It gets a bit silly and at the end, there is one really good and one really bad moment, which I liked. I enjoyed the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is boring.   It reads as a series of unrelated essays, mostly about religion, but with some political analysis thrown in for good measure.  I found the content to be interesting, however. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, I think, is so poorly written that I couldn't even finish it.   The character development is incredibly shallow and the world building is a complete joke.  I'm not kidding, it is a joke. The entire story is told in the first person.  So basically the only character who isn't a complete jerk is a villain and the book tries to make him likeable.  The book is also very formulaic and just does not feel fresh.  It also feels very repetitive and doesn't go anywhere.  In fact the only thing the book does is give the hero a "tough luck" lesson that is so far removed from anything true that it feels completely irrelevant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is full of holes and inconsistencies. The author seems to have a different set of rules for how she writes, and has no qualms about contradicting other authors, or even the world itself. Some of the "explanations" she offers are completely baseless, and it appears that she does not even understand the genre. However, the story itself is actually quite good, with some twists and surprises.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As soon as I finished this book, I knew that I would have to look elsewhere for more realistic novels about women who are just as intelligent, creative, and strong as men. The characters were mostly stereotypical (the women wanted their male partners to do all the work, always did the cooking, did the laundry, and treated them like queens), but their personalities were well drawn and well written, giving them a real believability. The narration was a little clunky and the character development was a bit too slow, but this book had it all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book I have read is terrible, the pacing is bad, the writing is terrible.  I got this because it sounded intriguing, but I could not care less.   My opinion has nothing to do with whether or not you like it.  It's just bad and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a disappointment! This is a hard cover book with a few errors. I have the hard cover version of  The Lost City of Z  and I was happy with that.   I do not regret purchasing this book, but I was expecting a good, solid book. It is written well, but the errors in it are too numerous for me to read a good book with that kind of error in it. The author needs to write better books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not get the "Good" it needs, it is the same boring and same dull, but well written book that i read in my early teens, but i loved this one since it was in the late 60's.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a sad, poor book. The idea of the book is fascinating to me as a scientist who studies cancer; I'm fascinated by the process of turning something as seemingly inconsequential as a tumor into an incredibly dangerous pathogen.   I think, however, that most people will be put off by this book's length.  I read the book on my Kindle (because the Kindle edition is short but good and because this is how I would normally read it, and I'm not even sure it is a good way for me to read a book!)   Unfortunately, the text is way too thick to use it as a daily reader, and the way I use my Kindle is to read it aloud while I do homework, then go through the next day's homework and put it aside to finish it later.  My only hope is that someday the Kindle's technology will improve enough to make this book readable to me, but for now I don't think it's worth my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a nice read, but I felt that there were several omissions and some unnecessary expositions. For example, I felt the discussion of religious belief was unnecessary; however, this was a good book for an introductory course. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the science and history of religion and to the atheist who is looking for a more logical approach.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a collection of interviews of professional speakers and writers, with the speaker's own words interspersed in their discussions and responses to questions. However, the interviews do not provide any substantive insight into the speakers or writing, and the writing style lacks substance.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had really high hopes for this book, but my expectations were pretty low, because I've had a bad experience with the book a few times before. It just isn't as good as it sounds. It's hard to say why that is, though, because even though the plot is a bit confusing, the main characters are pretty well rounded and relatable.   Unfortunately, the plot twists are way too common (and way too bad), and the characters seem pretty boring (even though it's a fantasy).   This is the only reason this book failed to be a 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the only time in my life that I felt I had been cheated out of something.  It took a long time to get the money back, but I guess I'm going to have to live with that for awhile...  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a little disappointed in this one - I wasn't expecting a lot. I've read several of my goodreads favorites in the 'Fantasy' section and had high expectations, so I was pretty excited. But the actual book didn't live up to my high expectations. It starts off with some great character development and a few good scenes, but that's about it - there's no action or plot to speak of, and nothing I really enjoyed. There's just a lot of repetition and a lot more sex and violence than I would have expected. I'll have to wait until I'm done with this book to see if my feelings have changed - the book doesn't seem that bad on its own.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've never been much of a fan of fantasy or historicals, but I was very excited to read this book because it came with the nice "Dangerous Women" cover.  I don't hate violence or sex, but this book is just bad. I liked the idea of the girls fighting over the prize money, and I loved that it was set in the 1940s. But the violence in this book was just ridiculous.   The writing was fine, the descriptions of the women, the fighting were cool.  But the women were just too weak and unrealistic to make the book a good read.  This book is good for young people, but if you're looking for a book to read with adults, this is probably not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to this book. I've read a few others that were pretty good but this one had a lot to say on some issues I feel are important. It starts off with a very interesting premise but quickly gets bogged down in a lot of unnecessary details. I felt like I was being spoon-fed by the author. The end of this book ended up being very disappointing. There were many things that I liked and some that I didn't like but I felt that I was left hanging on some things and not really knowing what they were trying to say.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know how to say this more clearly. The worldbuilding is so far off point from what I would expect and then the story just fails to live up to it. The first half was interesting. It started off with a fascinating look at a woman and her husband who were involved in the creation of the Worldmind. The main character went from a shy person to an open and curious explorer, but then the plot just dropped the ball. It just wasn't interesting, there was no tension, it all just sort of went on forever. I found it hard to get invested in a story that kept falling short. The only positive thing I found about it was that I got a better understanding of what was possible in the setting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish they had been less preachy, but this book was not written to be an inspirational book. It was written to entertain, and that's good, but it's not worth reading unless you have no interest in reading and want to watch some mindless trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at the request of a friend who thought it was interesting and possibly interesting enough to recommend. It's not, really.   The book is an excuse to talk about how the author talks about the world and the world talks back to the author.  The most interesting part of the book is the first 3 chapters, but they are completely devoid of substance.  I got the impression that the author was bored with writing and had started to throw out ideas and ideas to fill the pages, but just couldn't decide how to organize the material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read the new James Patterson novel. The last few times I have seen him on the big screen he has been playing a strong guy. I guess it was a little surprising to see him as a villain. It was also odd to hear him say that he was playing a weak guy as if he was giving a lecture. I thought the novel was very well written and I would like to see a movie or tv series about it. However, it's definitely not worth a five star rating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you have to ask, don't read. I'm sure the publisher is very unhappy about the way this book turned out.   Overall, it was okay. I am not a "gamer" or even a "nerdy" gamer but if you like it that is fine with me. I can understand that the game industry is filled with some people who want to talk about how amazing the games are and how great they are.  There were parts of this book that gave me a headache.  I think it has become "the" book on video game writing, in terms of how many people cite it as an all-time classic.  The thing is, I don't think it ever was. The book was always a little hard for me to get through because it was so technical and I found myself looking for a different angle. It is so different than anything else out there in terms or how to write a book.  For that reason alone, I probably won't be picking it up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not liked this book at all. It does not tell a good story nor does it feel like a real horror story. The prose is clunky and makes no sense.   My biggest problem with this book is the characters. The book is about an innocent girl and her father who were the victims of the monster they were trying to catch. The mother never comes to terms with what has happened and is only in it to protect her child.  In addition, there are a lot of other characters that don't get a chance to tell their stories.  The ending was not what I expected.  Overall, the story was not worth the effort of reading this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is bad and is full of grammar mistakes, poor grammar, and it makes it hard to read, but the idea of the plot was really cool.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a couple of books from Penguin Random House, and thought they were good, but they were poorly formatted and the story didn't work for me.    My problem is that I feel there's more to the story, but the formatting doesn't give me any clue what it could be.  The art was okay, and the characters were interesting. I just don't like the format. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot was boring and the characters were a mess. It's a book about people who take an interest in the paranormal, but it's almost all exposition and little characterization. The only thing I found interesting about the book was the little tidbits about people and things in the background of the paranormal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book after reading all the reviews. I really wanted to like this book but it was just a bunch of clichés and some really terrible ideas.   The writing style is cliched, very. The characters are just two dimensional, not much of a character at all.  I think that maybe I was expecting more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am still waiting for my copies of The Book of Mormon to arrive, so I decided to buy this book instead. The author is so over-the-top, but in a good way. It is the story of Joseph Smith that I have always loved and the writing is so well done. The prose is so clean, the dialogue is crisp and the characters are real and relatable. I will be re-reading this book over and over again, especially when I have an idea of what is happening. I would definitely recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book hoping to find something interesting in the history of the Catholic Church. What I got was an absolutely terrible account of how the Catholic hierarchy, especially the Church's most powerful men, run things at every level.  The story is about a man, who is an extremely successful businessman and the father of one of the richest families in America. He has everything going for him but one problem.   The problem is, he married a woman without a Catholic background who has no religious upbringing, and in so doing he has offended the Church in a very powerful way.  Because of this he is in trouble with the Vatican.  His problem is that he is also a good man, one of those who have served God and are therefore a "true sons of God."   However, he finds himself in trouble because of what is going on around him in the world, particularly with the rise of Nazism.  He decides that he can never again be involved in the Church, and decides to become a Nazi, and then a Nazi and a fascist leader and so on.  I can't remember a bad example of a history book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book. It didn't make me want to read it but I could see myself using it in a writing class. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book, but it should have been written by a professional who has a good grasp of the field.   It does not deal with the important issues in this field that have been covered and discussed before, but only deals with the recent hot topics like epigenetics.  It is good to see more attention given to the topic, but in my opinion, more people should read this book and learn about the basics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best book I've read for a long time. But, I would have given it better if the narrator had given a little more credit to the characters and the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In many ways, The Road is not that much of a novel - it is a series of interconnected vignettes that are all more or less equally terrible. Although some of the characters are interesting (my favorite is the female character who is able to understand and talk to her boyfriend's dead parents) and some of them are quite entertaining (the characters who become a traveling circus to entertain other humans), they all have flaws that prevent them from living up to their potential.   I am not particularly happy that a book like this exists because I like my books to be enjoyable.  If you can find a way to ignore the fact that the narrator's parents are dead, I think you will find the plot pretty interesting. I am sure that if I was really looking for something to read and had been looking for this book, it would have come up a lot, but the fact remains that I never found myself with the motivation to pick this book up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, the author explains what is wrong with modern education and offers solutions. Unfortunately, the solutions are not good, and in fact they could be bad. However, the book is quite good in explaining some of the problems we face today and offering a plan for improving things.   Would you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?  The book is an excellent one. It really makes you see how the school system is failing today and why it needs to change to make education more interesting and relevant. The book discusses things like why we have so many failed tests and exams, and how we can't even use our heads properly due to the massive amount of information in today's world.  The only problem is the author doesn't actually give solutions. If you're a school-focused teacher and have a class on the history of education, you may want to consider listening to this book to get some ideas about how to change things to make them more exciting, but otherwise this isn't the audiobook for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a little disappointed in this book and the reviews seemed to agree with that. I didn't think that the premise or the idea were compelling enough, especially because we don't see the protagonist in this. I was disappointed because it seems that the author's previous works have been really good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been searching for a book to teach me about the art of writing in a modern world where a person's voice is only valued in the marketplace or on the cover.    This book taught me absolutely nothing of value and was frustrating.   An enjoyable book: In this book, they take a modern perspective on the old style, traditional style.  I enjoyed reading about the history of the genre.  It's a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a great read, but a little dull at times.  The action sequences were great, but the pacing was a little slow and the world-building a little too "distant."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book based on the recommendation of my good friend and I am not a big fan of urban fantasy novels.   This book started out fine and then all of a sudden it just went downhill for me.  This is not an urban fantasy book because they are supposed to be fantasy so I did expect the fantasy elements, but this is more of a mystery than a fantasy story.  The only good thing about this book is that I got a bit of a hint as to where it would go but then it suddenly switched to a horror novel.  I ended up reading the whole thing because I did enjoy it but not enough to recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book with some interesting ideas but it was a bit too long for my taste. I enjoyed the title, but I wanted to read it in a different way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was my first experience with an author, and the first one I tried not knowing what to expect. The writing is very strong and is a very good read. I will likely buy the next in the series when the first is out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a huge fan of the books, but unfortunately this one is not a good book in my opinion. It is about a boy, whose father is being murdered and whose best friend's girlfriend is involved, and he is in a desperate struggle with the authorities to find the killer. It's hard to find a good plot, but I guess they don't have any for this genre. The characters are not very original or interesting, but that is also not the fault of the book. I'd suggest just picking it up for the fun of the story and not to learn anything about the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a great time with this book, but I can't help thinking that its title is a bit misleading.   The plot is interesting, but the characters and setting are not.  I feel like the author got confused between the book and the story he was writing, as it's been a long time since I read a book with a good plot and character development.  For some reason, the writer's only intention was to make the main character gay.  The main character was gay, but he wasn't in a relationship with anyone else.  He was just in a gay relationship.  All the characters are a little shallow and the relationships are really just there to have them there, which I understand but I felt that the plot would have been much more fun with a real relationship.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book and found it interesting and interesting.    The story was exciting and there was something to be learned about being a soldier and the things that happen in war.  But unfortunately it was only three hours.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a high schooler who had never read a fantasy book. I was amazed by the magic systems in this book. My mom bought me this as a present and it was a great read but I was a little disappointed as I expected the romance and action but I think the latter is a little overplayed for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of the book, it was very easy to get through. The second half though, I found a lot of the information in this book to be just not very valuable. I really need to check out this author's other work, but I'll probably read it when I am done with this.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story takes off and then flops. It was fun at first but then lost momentum and was extremely predictable. I'd rate it a 5 for the first book but a 1 for the second. I really don't enjoy science fiction. I'll read something by Jack Vance. I've enjoyed the Ender's Game series but I have to be realistic and say that the first few books in Ender's Shadow were boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author was soooo vague that I was never really sure what it was all about, which was frustrating because it didn't make the book much more than a vague description of a few specific things. I have heard the theory that if you can't even explain the book to your mother then you can only imagine how much fun it must be to read to your children.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. However, I felt the story could have been written better. It was a little too repetitive. Some of the characters had so many scenes, I didn't feel they were needed. The book was slow to get going, but I loved the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book 5 stars and then I found it totally unacceptable and dishonest.   The main flaw in this book is that it is not really an autobiography.  This book is a collection of stories and it lacks depth.  The authors claim to have interviewed a large number of different people and yet each story is a very brief and boring interview.  It is almost as if the author's aim was to present his self-absorbed and delusional views of what he believes to be true. I was shocked at some of the things that this self-hating, self-centered, self indulgent narcissistic narcissist would say.  I will not waste my time reading another self-indulgent, self absorbed and narcissistic narcissists book, I won't waste my money, I will avoid this book at all cost. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like to give bad reviews but this book just wasn't for me. I have read a ton of science fiction and fantasy, and have read most of the other reviews on Amazon. I don't think this is an overrated book, but the plot and characters are just too far off from what I like.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was pretty simple and good on the characters. The plot was really weak and I really didn't understand anything at all. The ending was also rather lame.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off like it's going to be good.  A good first novel I think.  It is a nice set up for a good first book.  As soon as I got started though, the story lost momentum.    I really thought I was on the right track with this one.  But it's very cliche and repetitive.   It took me to the part about how she's so beautiful, but the more I read the more cliche I got about the whole story.  I didn't finish this one after reading about 50 pages.  It was frustrating.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read about 10 of them and they are all terrible and dull.   If you want to be entertained by a series that has a lot of potential you could do worse than picking up this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't mind books about a time and place or a people.   The only one I didn't like was "The Grapes of Wrath".   It was a very accurate depiction of the 19th century, but didn't give any context of what it meant to be an American in the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has no clue about what he's doing. I read a review on Goodreads that said that the book is about a kid who is being bullied, and that the main character is going to take care of him. But that's not what the book really is. It's a story about what happens when a girl, who's been tormented by bullies since she was a little girl, discovers a cure. It took me months to realize that the whole story was about a girl who's on the edge of suicide. If that was what the author wanted it to be, he could have taken the whole book and turned it into one long suicide note.   So I bought a Kindle edition of this book, which had a couple of minor errors, including the title and chapter numbers. I couldn't get the book to read at all, and I can't recommend this book to anybody.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book, and I am so very disappointed.  It is a book about a woman who, while researching a medical journal, discovers a book by a man who died before he could be published (which I thought was strange - why did he not want to be published and not published), and is forced to find the evidence himself.  There is little or nothing about research, no discussion of the scientific method, and a poor story in which the author was trying to get the publisher to publish the research he had done.  The book was so bad, I started to question whether it was a fake or if it was real, and if there were any errors at all.  This is such a shame because it was an interesting book, but it was not good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a Christian to be a Christian.   The main characters had no faith and didn't believe in Jesus Christ.  The story was very repetitive.  For some reason they believed that Jesus was alive and in their life.  I didn't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this one. I had read a review online which stated that this was the book that made me decide to try to become a writer.  I'm a huge fan of his work and I think this is a good book to have on hand.  The only bad thing about it is that it starts out with a lot of cliches like the fact that people are afraid of new experiences.   The author also gives a very one dimensional view of women which I find very hard to believe because it's not that different from what I had been taught since I was a child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of books but this one was not what I had been looking for. This is a well written book about a man who is obsessed with making up the perfect family. He wants to create one with his wife, and his best friend. Unfortunately, this is not the story I had expected from the book. When his wife dies of cancer, his quest for perfection only brings him pain. His friends and family are trying to get him to let go of his obsession, but it's no use because he won't let go. My only hope is that after the first book is over, his friend doesn't kill him and my brother in-law doesn't divorce him (my sister had to get rid of him).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book, but felt it was missing something.   The writing is crisp and clear, and you know exactly what's going on and why, but it just didn't feel complete, like there was some thing missing that I wanted to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book several times.   It's never really changed my mind.  But if you like the original then this book is a must get. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be rather dry.  The narrator really let his personality show in this book and made it all seem so "bizarre", even though he didn't have the slightest idea how it would be useful in a work of fiction.  It is very hard to imagine what he is trying to say when he makes fun of his own characters' voices. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I wanted to learn the facts behind a popular myth about American history. It seemed fun to read. But then it was clear that I learned only what I already knew, and the author made some mistakes in her research. I'm not sure that she really learned anything new, either. It's probably OK to read it as an introduction to the subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have just finished this book. After listening to the reviews I bought this book thinking I was getting a good book about the Bible, but was disappointed. I know its Christian, but it didn't read like the bible I've been reading for the last few years. It was mostly preachy and seemed to be written by an agnostic. I am no agnostic, but I find many aspects of the bible to be ridiculous. I'm sure this book could have been great if it weren't so preachy. I would be less likely to listen to it if the author had written it as a true story of a true preacher or a true Christian, which the book seemed to make up for by telling a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's thesis that human beings are a very violent and irrational species and that war, disease and hunger are an expression of our inborn natures is rather one-sided and unproven. If human beings as a whole can be said to have a "survival value" and "morality" it could be argued that war may be a necessary part of the natural order, and in fact wars are the price we have to pay to ensure the survival of the species. However, to suggest that the current "war economy" in the West is an expression and a result of human nature is simply silly. The author seems to have missed the point of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked the book and am looking forward to the next one I buy but I have to say that I was very disappointed with this book. The only saving grace is that the characters are good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It seems like a book was written just to make people like it.  It makes me think I was reading a bad review, but that's not true.   The book is not bad. It's boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be too complex for my own personal enjoyment.   This book takes too many complex subjects and tries to explain it in a simplistic manner.  It took a long time to understand the complicated concepts and I feel the book does not cover them completely.  My favorite subject (but I won't go into it because I feel this is the wrong subject for me to understand) is "Culture" and what is meant by culture and what culture actually means. I don't want to say this is a very "good" book, because I do not think it is, but I believe it has its point and I think that point is that the world is more complicated and you should not assume it's black and white, all good or all bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has all the right concepts but is nothing special.   A very basic and not very interesting story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was all about the characters, and then the plot just fell apart as soon as it got underway. The book starts with a very strong and compelling female character and she doesn't hold a candle to the men or women she comes across in this novel.   I'm going to give it 2 stars just so I can get to the next book in the series.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is good, the art is great, and the subject is relevant, but the book just...really isn't.   It isn't anything that you would find in a normal, well-written non-fiction book, which is why I gave it 4 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was really hard to read this book.   Although I had read the book on a previous occasion and loved it, the first half of the book took me by surprise.  There was a lack of clear information and it took me a while to get into the groove of the story.  My wife read it to me and I'm sure it took her a while too.  She thought it was better then the previous book but I'm just not sure.  I do not recommend this book to anyone, unless you want to put up with the same boring plot you are reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the beginning. The characters were all engaging, and they started off in the city looking for work in the field they had just left behind. However, there was a point at which the plot took a turn for the worse.   The characters started going to a spa to get a makeover. This was fine for two or three pages, but then it got weird. They did not want to change, they wanted to be different.  They also started talking about their ex-lover in the previous chapter, and even though the two were apart they still had feelings for each other.  However, then the plot moved on.  The ending was disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is interesting to see how much people have been influenced by the books of Stephen King. It is sad that some people who didn't like the books are now calling them "good" and "amazing", but it is good to read the other side of it. I have read some of the other King works, so I know he is a good writer, but this is the first one I haven't liked. This story is set in the year 2034 and the protagonist is a man called Brian. He is working as a teacher in a state high school. He meets a girl in the girl's restroom in his first week and falls in love with her. Then, he has the unfortunate experience of having sex with her as she is sleeping. I really disliked this part of the book. This part of it was not so bad, it was just not interesting at all. The sex scenes are not that amazing. I know that people who love the King books will tell you that the sex is amazing. Well, I just don't like this part. I found it a little confusing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not a bad novel. It's one of those books you love and want to reread but just can't because you've gotten over the first time it was written and it makes you feel sick thinking about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the most horrible book I have ever read in my life.  It is really awful in a bad way.  The characters are dull, the plot has nothing to do with anything, and the writing is so poorly done that it makes you want to punch the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read many books and enjoyed most of them. However, the last book in this series was a complete let down. I have no idea how much more effort and time was put into the previous books but this one just seems so out of place.   The plot was very predictable.  The characters were bland and undeveloped.  They had no real motivations, no development, no character growth, and just no point to the book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is good for a class, but I had to read the book twice.   For the most part, the material was good but the examples and explanations did not seem to have much practical value to the student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very nice collection of short stories, but there are many examples of the author's weaknesses, as well as his strengths. The stories have many, many different voices and themes. For instance, "The Old Man and the Deep Well" is about a man who dies in the middle of an adventure, but is brought back to life in a similar fashion. I also found it odd that the author didn't have his own book to write a sequel to.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is boring and very boring. No real plot. Nothing exciting happens with the group. They come out of a church and are chased down a narrow dirt path for 5 minutes (without much of a chase) and then the group runs through a small forest which is full of rats. All the characters are "clumsy" or "weird" and we never get a sense of their personalities. The book just takes place in a very boring world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book difficult to read because I was unable to understand the author's point of view or understand what his intentions were. I would like to think that if this book had been better written it would have made a better read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was very good, but was it really necessary for the story? I have read a lot of science fiction and had never read any work by the author. This book was the first to use the new "TARDIS" device. The story was very cool and the science was interesting. Unfortunately, it was very confusing and the plot is not very logical. I enjoyed the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has many faults, but the most egregious is the fact that the authors write about religion and politics from a perspective of an atheist. As a result, I found myself often having to interrupt their narrative to tell them that the author is either uninformed or has a bias.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book I would recommend to someone who wants to learn to play the flute. I am a musician and have read many books on playing flute, and this is no exception. There are no easy to follow directions, no musical notation, no photos, and not enough background about flute history or playing technique.   A great book, but it doesn't provide the experience that a beginner should get from playing the flutes, which is something that a good book should offer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the greatest tragedies of life is that all your dreams are just dreams. That you have nothing to hope for.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book at all. First of all, the prose is not that good. This was a hard to read book because of the poor prose. It is a very dry and technical book, so I was not surprised that the plot was quite bland. I think that a writer should keep the writing simple to keep the focus of his readers on the story. Unfortunately, this is not the case in this book.   This book was more about the research of the author, as opposed to the subject matter. I read this book because I was interested in how the author went about finding some of the information for his book, and what exactly was being studied at the time. However, I was so annoyed by the information that was provided to me that I think this book is useless in getting you the details of a specific topic.     If you want something new to read or if you want a good mystery that you won't regret finishing, then this book may be just the thing for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a very old book - a classic that I've been holding on to in hopes of finding an updated edition, and I have - thankfully. The writing is good, the book is well-written, and it's about the first half of a very important book. I was hoping for a more modern take on this story, but it's the classic that it is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to read this book because I loved Alice In Wonderland.  But it turned out to be terrible! It had many holes and lots of contradictions.  I'm very disappointed in this book. I was expecting a nice fantasy story and was not satisfied. I'm still looking for more fantasy books that I can recommend to other kids.  "We're always on the lookout for the new. And in the midst of the excitement that comes with a new release there is the inevitable period of reflection as we make sense of what we read and what it means. A review may seem superfluous, but I'm not certain that my own review would have been effective had I written the first time we sat down to discuss this novel.   I'm looking for a good fantasy book. This one is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to read this book. I heard it is "A History of the U.S." but I couldn't figure out which author's history it was.   Instead, I got a history of the United States (with "D" as an editor).   So I figured "What better place to start than with the first President of the united states."   There is much to like about this book, but it was a chore.  (I liked that there was a lot of biographical detail, but some of the "histories" seemed to get lost in the mix. Also, why does Lincoln think the American people are so ignorant about the French and the Germans? It's a different era than the 19th century and we know far more about those countries than we do about the colonies.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. I'm sure a lot of the bad reviews are because it's a self-help book. The self-confidence/drama/love is too heavy and has a heavy message. The author gets the message. In fact, it's the message that is too much. I wish it was a little less preachy but still really valuable. I liked how the author included a few examples from actual self-improvement and from "successful" people who didn't "do things the easy way." But it gets a bit heavy on self-esteem issues that the author doesn't even try to address.   So I think most of the reviews are accurate. If you're looking for a quick book on self improvement I would recommend this. But this isn't a book you want to read if you want a deep read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half is good; the second half is weak. I am going to use this book for reference in the future, but I don't recommend it to anyone who can't be bothered to take the time to read a few pages.  Diana - February 17, 2005
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on a whim, so this review is kind of like a plea.   It's good, but I found the narration annoying and boring. I mean really, really boring.  This one got me thinking, "Wait, isn't it a crime for an attorney to be boring?   Isn't that what the profession is supposed to be about??"   The only thing I can say about it is that I liked the cover, but not the book itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing I didn't like about this book. I really enjoyed the story and the characters. It was easy to follow, but didn't take itself too seriously. If you are looking for something different or have some time to kill, I'd recommend this book as a good choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys historical fiction but who has trouble getting to know anyone in a historical romance. However, the book is very, very long, and the characters are, for the most part, not very interesting. If you like the idea of historical romance but cannot read anything past the first few chapters, then this book may be for you. If that's the case, then I would look elsewhere."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a science fiction/fantasy buff who has been reading my way through a huge amount of the old "classic" books. This is a decent book, but I feel that the first 40 pages are simply uninspired and not all that interesting. The story is good, but the writing itself is boring. I felt like I could read through the book quickly, but that I would never enjoy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's not much to say about this book other than it's rubbish, as usual, but I'll say a bit because the quality of this book is so high. This is the second in a series which I can't stand, and I've just spent over $60 on another copy, and have given up on it in general. The first book in the series is titled "Sonic Sucks." I really hope this one is better, otherwise, I'd recommend throwing it out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was ok, but not what I expected for a hardcover.  I'm usually a big fan of first person books and I'm looking forward to the sequel that's been mentioned but no one else seems to have read it yet.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is absolutely fantastic! It has just the right amount of depth for someone who likes their history, but isn't always so interested in military action.  It's not about the war, but the story of it, with many details of battles and actions in the rear.  The book also gives details of the people who were involved in it, and the lives they led after the war.  I have to say, the amount of detail is much better than I was expecting.   I highly recommend this book, especially if you like your history a bit deeper.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was nice to see a new book in the series, but this book wasn't very good.   I enjoyed the character development, and I'm glad it's coming to a movie, but it just wasn't as good as previous novels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in its entirety before it was even published. I know that the author has a reputation for producing bad books but my expectations were set way too high.   The only redeeming quality was that the writing itself was engaging.  It had some really interesting characters, an interesting plot, and a great world to explore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only book I ever wanted to read, but never had the chance to, is now out of print and has nothing to offer me. What a waste. I would love to read this classic to pass the time.  Incorrectly called by the title of the novel, by the editor. (A more correct title might have been: "A True Book: My Grandfather's Last Will, the Last Will of the King of Babylon and the Last will of the Prince of Darkness.")  I've read this many times, and every time I feel the same disappointment and confusion. This is a novel, not a work of journalism or history, and the stories it tells are interesting, but the prose is stilted and repetitive. (For instance, the "tough" line, which describes the death of the prince in the last will.) In the end, I guess I'm glad it is out of publication. The author has been dead for years. . I read this and liked it. But I just wish I would have read it a long time ago. "King of Babylon" is a very interesting book. It tells the story of an old, wealthy man in Babylon, who wrote a book describing all the bad things that happened to the people who lived under his rule. This book became a bestseller for a time, but then it was found to be incorrect by an authoritative source and was banned. It was then republished and a few people were able to buy a copy. The book, I believe, describes the end of civilization, and is a sort of sequel to the Babylonian Talmud. If the stories in the book have any truth to them, then we are living in the end times of Babylon.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bad example of what not to write. The author attempts to make the story about a character who, due to a horrible experience, has a traumatic effect on the other characters in the book. The problem is, this is a novel, not a children's book. There are not two or three characters in this story that I would not like to see again (and then the author would be out of luck for their next book).   Instead of a story about this man's trauma, it is about a man who is traumatized by his past.    The plot of this book is quite good, and I would definitely recommend it to others, but it's a bad start.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was not a bad read, however. I had high hopes for this book, however, the main character's character development was a bit too slow. I found myself wanting to know more about the main antagonist, though I understand the character has changed a great deal. However, her lack of development was very disappointing. There were several plot holes, which I won't spoil (but you can figure it out) and a handful of inconsistencies in terms of the details of the character's past (the book is written in a second person, which is a little confusing, as the first person is so much more important and interesting. However if you don't know the first or don't care about the details, don't be bothered by it.  I loved the book! It was well-written, well-paced, and had a lot of great ideas. This book also left me wanting to get more information about the world, which will come in a future book. I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a story that doesn't revolve around a villain and a main character who hates everybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so intrigued to read this book because I loved that one from the 1980's. When I opened the book and it was so difficult to read the first time.  I couldn't wait until I finished this to read it all over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was so obvious that the author was a troll that I was glad I didn't buy it.   I mean, the whole thing is just an elaborate scam:  - the author claims to have "understood" the first few thousand words of a book so that she could then say what she wanted to say - the "convenient" explanation that the second half of the book is based around what the first half was - she never actually explains what "understand" means and the whole "understanding the first 200" thing seems very contrived 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot of fantasy novels in the last year.  I loved "Dragonflight" by R.A. Salvatore   This one was a step back.   For starters, the author is only about 35 years old, so she's far behind the curve.  Her writing style is sloppy, she uses too many POVs, and the plot isn't as interesting as "The Emperor's Soul." She is definitely one to watch in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did read this book, it was great I thought at first but I found out it wasn't. I loved the first part, the story was interesting and I loved all the characters, but the second part didn't interest me at all. My rating for the book is 5 stars. I thought it was worth a try as I have been waiting for a book about the war to come out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was ok, but not really that interesting. The plot was just okay. The characters were okay, but I really didn't feel like I learned much about them. I didn't want to keep reading because of the boring parts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As usual this book is poorly written, filled with grammatical errors and errors of thought that would be corrected by any editor and is more a collection of random quotes and anecdotes.   The story line seems to be that this guy was an assassin who was very good at it and he was able to kill a very powerful leader.  Unfortunately he was never really given any backstory for the character and it is never explained what exactly he did to be so skilled at it.  The writing itself is not the best but then again the whole story was poorly written and was a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book expecting a good read.  I love it when the author does things right.  Instead of a typical high school setting I was shown about the students from different parts of Japan.  It was a good introduction to how the students live their life in the school.  The characters in this book were interesting and different from each other.  One character was a shy girl, who didn't want to do anything, until she learned about love.  Another one was the tomboy, who hated her parents because she didn't care.  There were so many characters, who were so different and all I wanted to know more about them.  This book was so enjoyable that I will definitely read more by the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall, this was a very disappointing read. I was very interested in reading this and did so, but it just wasn't what I wanted. The book has a very cool, sci-fi feel to it, with some very interesting characters, but I couldn't help but feel that the writing was very dull and uninspired. The characters are all rather boring and the plot was very simplistic and weak. It did have a cool idea, but the execution just wasn´t there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just got this book. I have always enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and have never been put off by the fact that it contains many errors. This book is a huge disappointment. One of the points the author makes in the book is that many people have written him up and said they have no idea why he is doing what he does.    This book lacks a clear explanation of why he did what he did and just boils down to the author's opinions on religion and religion in general.  The book has no evidence or source materials and basically consists of what the author wrote.  I would not recommend this book for anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a good one but very outdated and full of outdated information.   The main problem with this book is it's very hard to follow.  Some of the things discussed in this book do not make sense to me, and it's hard to understand them because this book does not give a complete explanation about the matter.  The only thing that made sense to my was the fact that the man was making his own home with his hands (with some help from the hand pumps).   For me it was hard to put my finger on all of the problems in this very old book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The good part: great concept, easy to use. The bad part: It is so hard to use, if you want a good, simple, clean writing environment (ie a Mac) you are better off using a Mac.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a poorly written story that is not interesting or funny or entertaining. There are many good stories and I would have given the book five stars but for some reason this one is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A boring book, no matter how much I was looking forward to reading it.   The plot is a mess and the ending was boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a little long, and it's quite hard to understand. I have a hard time grasping the main idea, so the ending just isn't very satisfying. It just comes too easily and is repetitive at some points. But the story of the children, in all its simplicity, is something very touching and moving. I like the story and the author's description of the characters. This is a good book and is worth the read. But it will frustrate you and you won't finish the whole book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is quite good and it was interesting to read and think about some of the points the author made about race, but it does fall apart and doesn't hold up at all when it comes to discussing the nature of the police state.    In a way it is a story about racism in the 1950's but it takes a back seat to how the book is used to teach that kind of racism is bad and that race can be a social construct (it is) without the implication that black people in the 1960's were somehow worse than white people (they weren't). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book as an after-school activity book for the 3rd and 4th grades. It seemed interesting and I didn't see why there was no description of it at all. But after it was published, it turned into a very boring text book. I felt that there was more to it than the author showed. I didn' t understand the whole picture.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just plain wrong on every level. I have read over 200 books since I was in school (high school and college) and I have never read a book that so clearly and completely sucks.   The author has no idea how to write or make an interesting story.  A typical example is that the main character is a man of average intelligence and is constantly in and out of jail (and there's plenty of evidence of that, as his past drug use was very prevalent) and he can't even get an honest job due to his criminal record. He was basically just a dumb-ass who wanted to get out of trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Very disappointed with this book. It's basically two stories. One has the protagonist, who is a teacher, taking his students on a day trip to see their town and they take a short tour. The other side of the story has them trying to do the same thing. The two stories end up not quite fitting together.   As I was reading I was thinking about the teacher. It was like reading about someone's parents. I understand how an 8th grader thinks it's a great idea to get into the local carnival. But the problem is that I can picture the teacher saying that "that's for losers" and the students agreeing, even if they know it's wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is horrible.  I will not be buying another book from this publisher again.   It does not give a good enough review to recommend this book.   Review by: jessica s - January 15, 2015 :  this is an amazing book. it is great! i just wish it had a few pages that gave more details. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book.   The author made me believe there is a reason for everything I do.  It's sad that she took away the only part that is entertaining about this book  She took away my hope of seeing my family again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the best that I could find. It is very funny and the writing is very good. The only thing I don't like is that the book is divided into chapters and in each chapter there is a different chapter on the same topic.   Also, in chapter 2 the authors give a short summary of the whole book, but in chapter 7 it is still the same thing that they have been doing in each book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of the book is good but the author has no clue how to write a story that is not an easy to read novel.  I have to get through about 20 pages to realize the plot was wrong. I have heard from others who have read the book and thought it was a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I went into this book hoping to learn something, and instead I'm feeling the need to throw up. It's a shame because it was written by an accomplished scientist, and I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys the outdoors and has the curiosity to go hiking. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was horrible.    The author had a lot of fun writing the book.  He took a very good idea and screwed it up.  The characters were great.  But the story is a train wreck.  It is one long story of bad decisions and bad writing.  There is so much conflict and nothing makes any sense.  I wish I had never read this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book.    It was a long read and I didn't get a great flow to the story.  It seemed like there was only a couple things going on.  The writing was poor.  There were no scenes in the story where I felt the story needed more, I just kept waiting for it to pick up.  So I guess I gave it 4 stars because I am interested in exploring the story with some of my favorite characters, but I'm not sure I will continue with this series after this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book. The book reads a little faster than it needs to, and there's a lot of repetition in the stories.   However, I liked the premise: the people that live in an abandoned city are being hunted by "the humans."   The writing was okay for the most part, but the lack of a plot kept me from enjoying the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this on the bus, so I had to pay attention during the audiobook and I was definitely disappointed. My dad told me it was so good, I kept thinking it wasn't real. I liked the first five books, but I found this one to be dull.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book from cover to cover. I knew the premise from the back cover. But I didn't care for the characters. I don't like the way the characters interact and I don�t care about the plot either. The ending was horrible, the characters are awful and the premise is garbage.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book thinking I was getting into a nice fantasy series. I was wrong. I finished the first book but did not enjoy it. The next two were much better though, and I will be reading the whole series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character is a very nice young woman (16, but you never get a sense of her age) who is just about to start a summer job. The book is about her relationship with her mommy, but it's all really about her mother. She's very good at playing mommy; it feels very natural for her to play that role for her mom, and to be honest, I'm not sure if I would want my own mother to play the role for me.   Overall, this was a really nice book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first chapter, but it didn't convince me, which is a shame, since it's an excellent book.  It does, however, have two problems. The first problem is the use of the word "fuzzy," which I find rather offensive.  The second problem is that there are numerous examples that don't appear in the text, and some that the author could have left out entirely.  In the first place, the main character, the author's wife, is very often referred to as "the woman," which is not only insulting, but can be interpreted as sexual.  Second, there is an extremely poor treatment of the Jewishness of Jews in the book, as well as an excessive amount of use of references to religion.  Third, the authors use references to religious people with inappropriate names, or a religious person that isn't a real person, or both.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive thing I can say about this book is that the author was able to translate a Japanese book into English.  It's a very difficult read.  But it's so difficult that I had to wait so long for the next installment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would rate this book as a good read, but with several things which I believe could have been better. The first thing that was wrong with it was how the plot turned out. This book is a sequel to the book The Book of the New Sun. While the plot line was fine, I did not enjoy the ending, and I felt that the book could have used a little more character development. The final chapters were great, but that was a long time coming! The characters were so shallow and not realistic enough for my taste. I would recommend the book to anyone, but I don't believe that this one will make the top spot on any of the lists.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is just a mess.   My husband was really enjoying this book.  As for the story, the story was not as interesting as I had expected.  The story is that a little girl, who's father is a great wizard, is abducted by a man who thinks she's a witch.  When the girl runs away from home to find the man who kidnapped her, she goes to his castle and he tells her the real story.  It was a very good book with the magic and adventure and lots of cute creatures. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is just terrible. The story is weak and the character development is pathetic. I could have written a 500-page analysis of every single stupid thing in this book and it wouldn't be even close to as bad as this. I don't think I would even want to read more of this type of book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I was looking for something on "transgender" people. I was not disappointed! I am currently a student at a university and needed a light read to pass the time. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this one! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I was interested in the psychology behind addiction. I didn't get that. The book is all theory, but there is not really anything that is actually practical. The best part of this book was reading the book cover to cover and then the final chapter where the authors give you the answers. It seemed that they had a huge budget for the final section and the last chapter seemed to be a waste of the book. There were too many problems to be solved. The author really should have made the last section more useful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a pretty good book. It will help you understand some of the concepts that go into writing good literature and be somewhat enjoyable.  I wish it could have had a different ending, but it's not very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book expecting to read something with a very strong literary voice. Unfortunately, I found this to be a lot of drivel written by someone who should know better, and I got a nasty case of "This isn't as good as I thought it would be". I was expecting something more polished with more structure and a more polished style, but this book has absolutely nothing going for it. Not that this is a bad thing, I like to read good books. I just can't get behind what I got out of this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to get this book, because of the hype surrounding it. However, this is an extremely poor read. In particular, the writing is really bad. The story is based on a TV show about a man who is being stalked by another man who wants to get him to commit suicide, which leads to a lot of crazy twists. This book has a lot in common with the TV show, and there's definitely a lot more in it that you would want, but it's just not the kind of book I was hoping for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is really bad.   All the characters are uncharismatic and the story isn't as interesting as it should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor book with terrible writing. It makes no sense and is very biased in favor of the author.  The author is trying to prove that people who are not religious should be forced to do something they have no desire to do and thus that it should be against the law for them to be in a marriage with anyone but their own spouse. The author claims that homosexuals should be required to have therapy and that the only way to stop the problems that homosexual people create for their families is to force them to act the way they do.  If I were forced to give this book a bad rating it would be three stars, I feel this is a waste of an author's talents and I wish I had been given a copy of this book to read at the library.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book based on the good reviews on Amazon and my goodreads profile. Well it was not. I liked the story, but I did not like the writing style and this book really is a chore. I did like the plot and characters, but the writing made this book boring for me. The ending made me sad and the characters in the book were not likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books where I can see how it would be helpful for those of us who want to learn about mathematics but are unsure about how to start or how much to pay. However, this book didn't do it for me.  The author does a good job at describing the various approaches to mathematical problems, but I had a hard time getting it from the text. I think the author uses the word "puzzles" (which he uses often, even when it means things like "a problem for which there are no solutions").  I'm not sure I see how anyone could get a good understanding of a problem by spending half the book just solving "puzzle" related problems.  Also, the author is not really clear about the difference between problems that have "no solutions" and problems that are not solvable by any method.   I don't know if it's just me, but this is one problem that has never stuck with me. It is a "crowning disappointment" to me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book a number of times over the past year and I keep finding flaws in it.   First off, the author has an obsession with the concept of time and the idea of 'time' which makes the whole book pretty annoying.  It's not that the idea is bad but he keeps getting lost in the middle of things and makes it seem like his world is a giant computer program in which he can easily go back in time to fix any of his mistakes.  After the fourth or fifth time through this book I started wondering why on earth I was wasting time on it. Not only is time a great way to learn more about a subject and explore new avenues, it is also a great tool to understand oneself and others.  The author's constant retelling of past events is distracting, annoying, and boring.  What I really don't like about the book is the ending.  I'm not sure if this is meant to be a novel or an autobiography or something.  At one point the author mentions that he doesn't really like the idea that he has made these events so public.  This is odd because the novel doesn't say a word about this and the events are quite public, even though the main focus of the novel is about a boy whose life was ruined by something he did many years ago.  There is a lot of material in this book and I would have liked a shorter book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a piece of garbage.    Its an insult to the intelligence and to the audience it was written for.  It is filled with stupid plot holes, poorly thought out twists, a lack of creativity and a complete disregard for what makes a good story.  The characters are lame and there is a poor lack of interaction between them and the world around them. I am done reading this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read is The Last Jedi. It's bad because it fails as an Star Wars book. It has the same problems as Return of the Jedi but with less story and character development. Luke and Rey are the main characters but the author has no idea how to do them. They get mixed up and then have to find their own answers in the end. I am disappointed because I'm really looking forward to the new trilogy and this book doesn't bring anything new to the table. This book had the potential to be a great book but the authors are bad at writing the main two characters.  12 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book a long time ago when I was a child, but I never understood why it is so popular. I found it extremely boring. I am sure I would have enjoyed it more if I had been able to see where it was going. I was just disappointed that I had to read it all over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After I started reading this book I was so excited to read a good fantasy book. I liked the story very much and when it came to reading the last chapters I felt really disappointed. The story was really boring and the plot was confusing which makes the book very boring. The last chapter was completely unbelievable. The author had to give the characters that much back story so it would make sense for him to give us a lot of things from the beginning of the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book since I liked all the other books in the series. However, the characters were just not very interesting. Their personalities are extremely one dimensional, the plot is pretty basic and boring, and the characters are just so bland and uninteresting that it doesn't seem like I should have spent my money on this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about 5 years ago, and have never been able to get the book out of my head.  I can't remember the last time I read a book that didn't keep me up at night.  A friend gave it to me as a Christmas present and I tried to force myself to read it, but I just couldn't.  Even then, the book felt so off putting. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be entertained.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an incredibly stupid waste of time and money.  It is a complete waste of space and I spent so much time and effort to get the materials for this, but I wasted my time by purchasing it.  The author is very good at "flipping" the story of the author being a brilliant mathematician and doing amazing work, and using the book to "prove" that his work is "the best" ever.  But that's just not true.  I wish I had not read it, but had it for my research.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I can make a living from writing I think I'd have nothing to complain about but the poor quality and poor writing of this book. The fact that the author feels the need to include the phrase "not because of my race" is truly a shocker. I can't imagine that any race would consider the idea of a white man, who looks like me, saying something like that. If you're going to write a racial book, you should write a good one. If this is your book, this is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In general I found the writing on this book quite poor. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that it is a reprint, and that it was written by someone who has little to no prior knowledge of the subject matter. I had the sense the writer was just going through the motions and just trying to get something done.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this, until the end.  It was an interesting theory that had me going back and forth, and there were so many interesting things that I wanted to know more about that I didn't get to, but for the most part I just had a very lackluster read.  Overall, though, I enjoyed the story and the overall message, and maybe it'll come to a better end someday, but it was not for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book to take a break from reading about real tragedies. I found it hard to take, mainly because it was so self-centered and preachy (I have to be really careful about taking "God knows best" positions. I know there are better ways to help people than this...), and it was full of stupid things (people who have bad experiences with the opposite sex, etc.) I found myself wanting to throw the book at the wall because it felt really preachy and full of BS. That being said, I was still disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author wrote a terrible book, and I can't say anything nice about it. It doesn't matter if the writing is bad because there's no plot or characters. It's just a book with a bad cover.  I have a feeling I'm not alone in not being very impressed by this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a poor attempt to cover the basics of Python, with a few tricks thrown in for good measure. I have no idea what the author was trying to accomplish with this book, but it certainly didn't succeed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my opinion, a great book should have a lot to offer, and this book had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it just wasn't a good book. I would give it a 1.5 stars but I was only able to give it 1, because the book was too long.   Overall: 5 Stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was the worst book I have ever read. The author was an unknown author, and I had no idea who this person was at the start of the book. I was a little shocked because this is one of my favorite authors. The second half of the story was even worse, since the author is no longer writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book I've read by a female author, and I am so glad I did.   I got hooked on her writing style after reading "The Girl with All the Gifts" a couple of years ago, and this is an excellent follow-up.  The plot of "The Unkindest Cut" is somewhat convoluted, but her prose is absolutely wonderful.  I've really been into her books since the first (which I'm reading in a couple days), but I'd probably skip "The Girls" and "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the worst novel I have ever read. The plot is really bad, the characters are annoying, the prose is bad, and the whole thing is over-hyped by an author who doesn't understand science. I hope the next novel from the author is better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife and I were not in the mood for reading as of late, so we checked out these books at the library.   I must admit, it didn't take long before we were back to being annoyed with these books, and that's saying a lot!   If your looking for a light reading experience, don't bother.  I'd advise you to try a different book if your looking to fill some space in your reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My mom just got me my copy of "The Great Gatsby". It's a great story with great characters that I wish I had read as a child, but I'm happy to get the book that I want.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has a very different style of writing from Iain M. Banks or Stephen King or even George R. R. Martin. The book is a bit pretentious to me.   But it is entertaining, I have enjoyed reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very good, very good book. I love it. It does a lot of interesting and important things, including examining the history of anti-colonial struggles in the Third World, including some of the most brutal. It has a lot to teach us in the Middle East and South Asia. I also like its analysis of the "reign of terror" and the "rise of global terrorism." I'm a former activist and I was disappointed to see that so much of it was just talking about how bad terrorism is. I wish it talked more about what we can do about it. The other thing I liked was that it didn't gloss over the positive aspects of imperialism. I would have given this book 5 stars if it had, and I probably will.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was too long to read in one sitting and not very engaging to say the least. It was not very good in any aspect. There were many parts where there was very little plot and a lot of boring dialogue.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this to read for my 8 year old and they both loved it. I really enjoyed the book and thought it was well written, but was disappointed to realize that I could have read this book in a shorter amount of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I went into the book with high hopes. I love books that will leave me wondering "what if?" and I have been hoping that this would be one of those. However, the main character is boring, the author does not know when to stop, the plot is too tangled, and the whole thing just... I went in the bookwith high hopes.. but the main charater is boring.. the author doesn't know when do to stop.. the plotis too tangled.. and the book just...    My rating: 4/5 stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book I got to know a lot about the state of our military, and I was impressed by the knowledge and competence that those men have on their own but even more impressed by their willingness to share their knowledge and experience. I was also impressed by how it is written and edited.   It should be required reading in the infantry as a source of information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author uses several tricks to make this book appear to be a true story. The main thing that is hard to believe is the fact that she made her life a living hell. This book could have been useful to the person who is struggling with a serious addiction or to anyone who would like to understand addiction better. This is the most boring book I have ever read, and I will not be re-reading it. The author's claims are just not accurate.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only book I bought this year was    This book is full of blather about different methods of making money online. None of the methods are worth the time or money to me.   Instead of being about this stuff they could have put more time into the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only negative thing I can say about this book is that the ending is really rushed. I feel like it didn't have much of a purpose. I don't think the characters should have died, but the ending doesn't really do much to give you a satisfying conclusion. Overall, this was a fun read, but for me, it was nothing to write home about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall, this is an interesting book on the politics of the Iraq War, as well as a good read on the relationship between political parties and the press. However, as someone who has been a part of the "Iraq" media and political landscape for the past decade (including this one, which I had to do), I found the book rather depressing. In particular, there is very little in the way of personal insight. I suspect that if he had been asked a few years ago about why he was so negative about the war, he probably would have said, "it's all about oil." However, a decade of having that constant conversation with others from inside the bubble of the media has clearly changed the way I think about things. I just hope he had a more positive book in mind, because this one is a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought the book because my family (my sister and I) have the same book allergies and this book looked fun and educational at the same time.   However the second we started reading it the story just devolved from there.  A very short story and some very poor characters made for a very boring read.  The story also had a very bad ending that was rushed.  I think it's a shame, because this book has an amazing idea behind it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story has a good hook and an interesting premise. The author has a difficult time explaining it in an understandable way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a huge disappointment, so I have to give it a lower rating than it deserves.   It was a very good idea with an interesting premise, but it turns out to be very disappointing.  The writing is so terrible that I had to stop halfway through the book before I started to realize what the point of the book is.  For example, in a chapter called "A New Life" we get some good info about some of the changes in the lifestyle from the new life style which is "living like a princess and riding a horse instead of a car".  Yet in that same chapter the author talks about how she's not going to buy that new horse (I bet that her daughter will!) and that she will continue living like a normal person.  I've already mentioned that the writing is bad, but just because something is bad doesn't mean you don't want to read it.  After finishing the book I felt like the author did this intentionally and just put the wrong message out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a bit rushed and the characters lacked development. I am glad I read this book since it was one of the best so far in my collection of science fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters, the book as a whole, and the story are very hard to read. I have very bad eyesight and these characters' faces and actions are difficult to read, even with a magnifying glass. I don't want to continue with the book, since it is not entertaining enough to recommend to my reading friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was an interesting story but the ending is terrible.   The character and plot development was good but this was a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For what?   A series of stories in one book?  I didn't understand all of the characters' problems, but I still liked the story and enjoyed the characters (and the ending.)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A little disappointing as the only real character is the little girl, but I'm sure she will grow into a fine character. The last third of the book was the best though, as there was a big cliffhanger and the end was satisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read the author's other novels but have never read the other six (maybe seven) novels of the main character.   The book takes place in the year 2000 which is a pretty strange setting but I enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author was very enthusiastic and did a lot of great work in the field of molecular genetics, but the book is not very good, with many typos and a great deal of repetition of information that has already been covered several times.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really hated this book.   The first few pages of the book were interesting, I found that I was getting a glimpse into a life, not just a bad or unusual situation. But after the initial excitement wore off, I became sick and tired of this book and started to hate it more and more as I kept reading.  The whole book was filled with a sort of pretentiousness and self-importance. It has no life, nothing is as it seems, the characters never seem to be in control of their situation and life is a constant struggle between the past and the future.  I feel as if it was written by a 19-year old kid who is obsessed with how cool his life is now, how much he's achieved and who's friends he's got.  This book made me hate it! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was amazing, except for it being boring. I can't get into reading a book like this very often.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read so many books on the topic that I finally decided to buy this one.   It's not the best book I've ever read but it is still worth buying if you want to be a better human being. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped for better, but I did not get it.  I didn't expect the book to be the best book that I had read in the series, but after reading it I had to give it 2 stars.  The plot line is interesting, but it is not what I expected.  A lot of the characters were generic, or very similar.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would highly recommend that the author of this book read this book first. She would find her way around the difficult writing, even though she's not the type of person to bother with the hard stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book that is only partly bad. The book is a collection of short stories, but the stories are poorly structured.  There are several stories in the collection that are really good and one that is pretty much the equivalent of a bad short story.   I found myself really liking the stories, which are all well-written, well-edited, and have a good "feel" to them, but that doesn't change the fact that they aren't connected to the rest of the collection.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not impressed by this book. There are far too many unnecessary adjectives and adverbs and it's almost impossible to follow the narrative.   The only thing it did well was set the mood for the rest of the book and create some tension at the end.  I'm not sure I'll read the next one but it was very brief, but I had to try it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for free from a book club I'm part of. This book is very badly written and full of bad ideas. The main plot line involves a man who is in love with his dog. The dog is like a mother to him and he wants to treat her like one. The other characters were poorly developed and did not give any good reason for why they were in the story. This could have been solved by a good editing. Also, the dogs were not real dogs. Instead, they were like cartoon-like dogs who only did what the writer wanted them to do. This story was also filled with terrible puns. I got through this book in one sitting and did NOT like it at all. It was just awful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading The Dragon Prince and it didn't just suck. It sucked really hard. In particular, the prologue is so bad, I was actually surprised that it was in the book. I'll also admit that I'm not really interested in fantasy, so if I can't relate to characters and events that I know, I'm going to read something else, and this just didn't do it for me. (But still, I bought it for the cover and price).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't get the feeling this book was meant for people of color. Not because of race, but because of the "othering" that was put into this book. I wanted to like this book because of how it presented a real black girl and her struggles as a poor black girl, but I was disappointed. I really wanted to see how the author would portray the black female experience. She does a lot of talking, but her words weren't able to capture the life I felt I was living.   This book made me feel like I was in a book on black issues, when in reality I felt like I had been transported to another time and place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book does a disservice to women and the men they date by trying to be so negative. I'm not the most positive person when it comes to politics, so I was expecting something much better, and the author did not live up to my expectations.    I understand that being a man means not having to do a lot of the heavy lifting, but there were too many times when the author was trying to tell women they were "damaged goods." And yes, men often need to work hard to be accepted and loved by women, but I've found that women in relationships often need men to work even harder.   And I think it's all part of the problem, but this is the most depressing book I've ever read.     For example, there's a whole chapter on the importance of not having children at the cost of your career. I was like, "What?" It's a very specific problem, so how could she expect it to apply to most people? It's just so wrongheaded.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first started reading this book, I was just looking for a quick and easy book to read while riding my bike. I got a little bit of something, but it didn't quite live up to the promise I had made.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been anticipating this book since I started reading in September. I really thought the book was going to be a breath of fresh air, a new look at the "what if" scenarios that can occur during the Great Recession (this book is all about the Recession).  I'm really disappointed with the way this book went.  The book has a nice premise of a "what-if" scenario. The book starts by talking about a possible economic crash (which never happens, but this isn't the fault of Keynesianism).  We have the possibility that this is the only solution, a perfect solution to the Great Depression.  However, if we continue to do the same thing we are doing, we are probably in for a depression or a financial crisis (something that is not likely to happen because the government would step in and step up as the lender of last resort, etc.).  Unfortunately, Keynesian thinking (in which government intervenes in the economy) never ends.  It always continues on to the next recession.  This isn't about a financial collapse, it's about our economy going into depression mode.  I've talked about this before in another post.  Keynesian economics is the wrong way to go.  My wife and I were talking about how the Keynesian approach to financial crises has not worked. She told me, "It's not about the economy, it is about the ideology."  That is correct.  In a situation like this, it would not be about the economic factors at all, but about ideology.  There is a reason why the economy has not crashed yet, it may have something to do with the belief that government can "fix" everything.  If we are going to continue to try and "fix the economy," we need to be honest about what we will be replacing and the effects that will have on society.  When you make policies based on ideology, it means there will always be an ideology.   I would not recommend this book to anyone who believes in Keynesian ideology.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of three short stories about a group of young people who are struggling with their sexuality, including some very explicit descriptions.   I did enjoy these stories, especially the first.  But I wasn't completely engaged in the story; it felt disjointed and repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts out great. You'll get a good idea of how the book is structured and what it is about. After reading through the book I think it is a good place to start to understand and appreciate a lot of what the author is trying to do.   This is the kind of book you will enjoy.  But then something about the book gets lost. It is more of a history of the various people and things than a book that's worth reading.  So the ending is interesting.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book, and I can't believe that this is the best one that Penguin has been able to produce. It makes me sad that it has to be this way because it has good ideas. I can see the author being able to write something entertaining, even with the flaws in the book. However, I will never read another Penguin book that I can find anywhere in the world. I will be switching to the Penguin classics series.   "What do you want, a hero who will save you?" "No!" "You will have him! He is a wizard!"
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucks!   I got this book for the price and read the whole thing in one sitting.   For starters, the book begins in the mid 1980's.  The protagonist was born in 1978 to a family of 8, and she has no family history of mental illness. In fact, she was raised in a fairly mental stable environment.  In short, this book does a disservice to the mentally ill population.  A few of the characters are pretty, but the author doesn't get to learn anything from them, and they just feel empty. It's also quite a shocker to find that a lot of these people are living as normal people in their late 40's/ early 50's. If I was struggling with my mental illness, I would not want to read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the definition of a chore. There are so many repetitions of the same content and information. There is an entire chapter about the creation of a character and then there is the next chapter. I wish the story was different so that I could relate to the characters instead of the plot. There was a good story here but I can't get too excited about the characters.   Rated 5 out of 5 by MitziC from Great read!!! I bought this book because of my husband. He is a huge Marvel fan and I was looking for something that he could use. He was a little hesitant when I gave him the price but I got a copy for him anyways. I highly recommend this book! He's a huge fan!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book it is explained that this book is written to a certain group of people - people who are interested in "self-improvement" (such as yourself), or people who like to have other people do things for them. These people should not be read about. In fact, they should be told that they are stupid. They should be encouraged to get more exercise, more food, and to get themselves into shape, or else they are "unqualified" for what they're doing. They can't do what is asked of them, and so they should go away.   The last chapter is written in a way to encourage people to take up weightlifting, since that is what the book is about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I could say this book was a winner.   This book is a bit of a slog, and if you're not a fan of the first two, it's not hard to see why.  The writing is stilted at times.  Some of it is also overly-metaphorical, even by Tolkien standards.    However, I did enjoy the fantasy, as well as the world building, the story, and the characters.  I just wish it had been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really enjoy this book as much as I'd hoped I would. It was very boring - with a lot of repetition and clichéd characters. There was some good things: the story was good, it had a good main character (although I wish she had a bigger role later on). The science was interesting, but it seemed too easy and the writing was pretty mediocre. I wish the author would have taken a little more time with the story and have given more depth to each character. Maybe I just wasn't interested in a book that didn't interest me as much (or, as much) as a story I'd really enjoyed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping this book would be useful for someone, but my experience was very different. The book is basically a list of books in the same genre as the Bible that contain information that is not true about God and the Bible. I was not impressed with the quality of the books. While it's nice that God mentions different books that are not necessarily Biblical, it doesn't really make the book any better. I found myself wondering about the authors of these books. I also found the book a bit boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains a lot of information that is not always helpful and is written in a misleading manner. This is especially true for the last chapter in the book. It seems like the author is trying to convince you to use the device to read the book on the bus and it is not the best way to use it. If you want to learn more about the device and/or to use a portable e-reader to read ebooks this is a good book to use.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a good read but it did not satisfy my craving for more about the human spirit and its struggles. It is the only book in this genre that is not based on a real life story. It only is a history and the rest of it is a story about how it could be written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a young reader, this is a bad first book for me. It's just bad. As a parent I would say:  "Your kids are not going to like it." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a lot of great books I've been waiting to read, and this book is no exception. I was so excited to receive this book because it was recommended in my library but was also on my'must read' list.   The book was in hardcover, so I had no idea about the book that came in the second half.  It's got a good story, good characters, and very, very good language. It's a long book, but I can't say I had any problems finishing it. The author does a great job of creating an atmosphere and making the reader feel like they're in the story, even though you're only in the beginning of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I had found this book when I was a kid. I've read many books about dragons and werewolves, but never one written for kids. I had heard a lot about it in various forums and was looking forward to the hardcover version (which finally arrived in my mailbox and was a pleasure to open). The first time I got into the book, I was very excited and read it all in one sitting. The second time around I read it more slowly to see if I would like it. I thought the story was cute and well told, but my kids and I both really found the story boring. We don't have any interest in dragons or werewolves after all. It's also sad to see this book disappear from the shelves as it was one of my favorites growing up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book and I hated it! I'm glad I read this one though. I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series. This book was not what I was expecting. The main character was so annoying and obnoxious. It was hard to relate to him or anyone else in this book because he was a jerk. He kept saying things like "I don't like it" and "I'm not sure why I like it," which is such an obnoxious thing to say. I would have preferred if he would just say he liked the book or the author because that would have made more sense. I can't wait for the next book though!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, but I will not recommend it to a friend. The main character, Harry, was a little like the "tweenie" character in one of my favorite movies "The Goonies".   Harry was very happy and seemed to have all the answers about the meaning of life, but unfortunately there were things that kept nagging at me (like the word "no"). I am really hoping that when this is all over and the book is all said and done, I will enjoy it, but for now I think that this is not the book for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is simple and good; however, it is very long and tiresome for the majority of the pages.  It should be split into parts to fit in the story and give the readers the information they need without going on for so long.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking for something short, to read as I walked to the bus. This was exactly what I wanted. The story is told in an old fashioned way, without any of the technical jargon that you may find in many modern books. This is a great book to read before bedtime.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If only this book had been a story... I was really hoping for a deep philosophical discussion of the nature of being and the human condition, not a dry, philosophical, boring story of how bad things happen to good people.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has many problems. The author is a horrible writer.  The plot is bad.  My wife and I actually read this book together because I had to read it.  I found myself wondering if she was going to be the one to walk out of the room.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author's "giant" book that is "unreadable" was so massive that it made it nearly impossible to get through it.   After reading a few more chapters, I decided I had had enough of the author's nonsense.  It seems that the author wants us to believe that the Earth is flat.  So there you have it:  I can't recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping to read a book that would be as good as the books I have been reading lately.  This book, however, does not live up to my expectation.  While this was my first introduction to the book series, I really enjoyed it.  The characters and the stories are engaging and I am hoping for more! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last book that I read was this one.   I enjoyed the first couple of chapters, but the writing became very tedious and monotonous.  It reminded me of "The House of Leaves" which has a similar feel to the way the author uses very long sentences.  This is not a good way to write.  The ending was a bummer as well, and the book seemed very rushed.  If you are a fan of mystery, and you haven't read this before, definitely give this one a shot.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would give this book a C instead if it were available to read before buying this book.   It has a great cover that is well executed and the quality of the books pages is excellent.  However, I don't buy a book by the author of the "C" and I give her a D-.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for something to keep me reading. I've read a lot of books, and none of them were any good. This book was so bad I kept re-reading it. This is the first book I've purchased that didn't make me want to throw it out the window.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited for this book and I waited for this to be published and finally got it in a store.  I read the blurb about this book, so I knew what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it was.  But I could not get into it.  It was about a man who loses everything he's ever had, including his wife, so he decides to return to college to finish his degree, which he will never get to complete and he ends up in the middle of a student strike which will make it impossible for him to finish the semester.  This was the beginning of a roller coaster ride of emotions for the reader.  There are parts of the book that made me laugh and others that made my heart break and there were parts that made it hard to read.  The plot of the story was interesting but it took a very long time for the book to happen and it seemed a little bit slow to me.   The end of the end of this book was amazing and there was a huge cliffhanger that kept me from reading it the second time.  My biggest disappointment was with the way the character was written.  While I don't mind the character's flaws, I felt that the way that the character came across was not good at all and it hurt the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm so glad I read this book! There's so much information in this book, and the writing is so good.   One of the things I loved about this book is that it's a fun read - the information is presented in a fun way, so you don't feel lost on what the authors are talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really boring. The main characters are boring. Their story is too slow and it's too easy to tell the story. The world building is horrible. It's like they took a page out of the middle schooler's story books and used the whole thing. The last quarter of the book is almost a recap of the previous story which just means the whole story had to be skipped in order to get the last quarter. It was too much of a slog. I won't be reading it again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My husband bought this book for our baby shower. He's in his first year of college, so we wanted to keep it simple with something that was relevant to his college life.    The "How to Get Around College" section in the back is great.  However, I think this book would be better as a companion piece to your other college guides. It's very easy to use (the illustrations are awesome) and the book is very educational, but the author didn't spend any time covering more advanced things, like how to actually make a career out of your degrees. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing I really liked was the idea that the characters had to go through hell because they had done nothing wrong. They did have to fight to the death in an arena, which I liked.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is bad.   It should not be read.  I was hoping to like this book because the author wrote a very good book "The Lost Art of Memory: How to Become a Superhuman in Any Field" but this is not that book.  It's a bit dry, a bit tedious, a little confusing and a bit boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the end I was able to complete the book but the information that was provided was not helpful. It took me 3-4 hours to get through it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't enjoy it at all. I liked the other books in the series so I was expecting something different.   The story was not interesting and I didn' t have the characters I was looking for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is my second time purchasing this book and I'm not getting what I pay for. This book is a book on "Psychology of Communication." In order to do that, they had to come up with a bunch of buzzwords and get them out there so you have to listen and pay attention and believe that they're really going to be able to give you a good answer. However, they couldn't come up to a satisfactory answer.  The worst part is that the book comes with a glossary that was very, very helpful. However the explanations are not written in English and the author can't even be bothered to have it explained.  I could understand the book if it was simply a list of buzz words or buzz words combined with some real answer and then the author would go to the end of the book and provide a real answer. If you're not interested in the topic, you won't even read the glossary, so you're just going to waste your money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a bit lazy in her explanations in the back part and never really develops her point.   It's a good read for those who want to go through the material in a structured fashion, but for the rest, I had little interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story follows a young lady named Tanya, who moves in with her mother. The mother is a complete failure in many ways; she's so controlling and so negative, and Tanya just has to deal with it. The plot is slow, it's predictable, and the ending is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book with a lot of excitement and anticipation but was left with a very bitter taste.    The plot and characters were great, the writing was excellent, the narration was superb but the story was so flat and uneventful that it really spoiled the experience for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off like most science fiction books do: a group of explorers are on a mission to explore a mysterious planet called a tesseract and the reason they are there is to find something that can aid in the fight against an alien race.  The problem is that the story goes downhill from there.  While this book may have the premise of alien intelligence, the actual alien is a piece of shit that is used as a prop and not the alien race of interest.  They come in a jar and start to talk to you, but you aren't really interested in them because they're annoying.    This book has a very hard time sticking to the plot of the book, because while it does start out that way, it doesn't stay that way.  The worst thing about this book is that they keep making it look as if they're trying to make it more sci fi-like when they just need to be more sci-fi.  When it comes to the characters, most of them are basically one dimensional stereotypes (i.e. the old dude with the weird glasses who goes into the bar to "make new friends"), and you'd think that it would be possible to do a book that is science fiction but not sci-fic because you have more realistic characters in the sci-fy genre.  You would be wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very poor book. The author is so inexperienced in psychology.  The chapter about sexual desire is absolutely terrible and not at all practical.  I found the concept of the desire system to be interesting though.  The author does have a certain "possibilities" theory that is a good idea, however, he failed to explain the actual theory behind it. He did make the point that sex, as an act of love, is extremely powerful and can have profound effects. It's just not realistic in this book to say that sex would make you more happy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book. It's wonderful and it's short. I'm glad it came in the mail, but I don't really think I could handle the entire thing at once. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the last of the "realistic" historical novels that I have read. It is an abomination in my opinion. The book starts with a well done historical setting for the main character but she seems to be playing the "good girl" or the "bad girl" and it is not the story. I will not buy the book again because of that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as an assignment but the teacher made me read the whole book twice. I was hoping to learn something from it. Instead, I learned how much I hate the entire subject of "history". I think it was written by a teacher to help her students learn about America. Instead I learned that the best American heroes are the guys in the Indian Wars. They were great warriors, but not great leaders. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the epitome of a "bad book". In other words, it's one that didn't do anything but be a boring, repetitive, boring book. It is not for anyone who has a strong interest in religion, spirituality, or even historical religions. While I do appreciate that it includes a brief discussion of Islam, it was very confusing and had very little actual information. The only reason why I bought this was because it's a book about the "Pagan" beliefs of the Vikings. And I'm not really one to believe in a god that is depicted as being in a cave like that.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this to my daughter as a Christmas present and I couldn't get enough of it. I bought it so that she can do her own detective work on the mysteries of life. The book is so full of interesting, sometimes strange, and sometimes unbelievable ideas that she finds her own way to solve them and find out what happened to the people around her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was good, but was very disappointed in its conclusion. The main character is the one who decides to kill himself. In the end he realizes he is going to kill him as well. He does something that will kill him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's not much here that's new.   This is a long-standing favorite of my friends.  The only thing worth noting is that it's a bit longer than I'd like, but I've read about a thousand-plus books and I've found that this one's just as good, and in some ways better, than most of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is just an excuse for an unoriginal, boring and tedious book. The ending is an excuse to not write any good ideas in the book.   There are so many good, interesting, original, and thought-provoking ideas in this book that were left on the cutting room floor because this book is just unoriginal and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for something that is different and something that really takes you into the minds of the characters and what they are thinking and feeling you can't do better than "The Way of All Flesh." This is not the book you are expecting to read, and you will not get what you expected. The story follows a woman, an alien from a distant planet, as she tries to survive on a human world. This was such a cool idea I couldn't put it down!   "The way of all flesh" is written well, and there is lots of action and adventure to it. The aliens in this book have a different race and culture from those of the human race, which is great because it makes the story a little more interesting. "The end" of the book was really cool and I really enjoyed the way that the aliens tried to get back to their home planet (the world that they came from) using technology that was similar to that which humans have now.   In the end "The the Way of all Flesh" was fun, but it wasn't for everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this as a college freshman.   It was a fun way to get started on the subject of economics.  While it got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, it turned out to be a great read.  The author used many different examples to make a good point.  I think some of the examples could have been used to make other economic arguments, however, the topic of taxation and the role it plays in economic activity is a difficult one to cover with just two chapters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book contains some good points. However, I feel that the author missed an opportunity to give them the full treatment they deserve. It is also not the type of book that will change my life or the life of someone who reads it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a big, fat waste of time. It was so difficult to get through that I would have rather just gotten a good idea from the book. I really feel bad about giving this a one star because I really did want to love it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most disturbing and difficult books I've read in a long time. In my mind it is a piece of art, a work of genius. Unfortunately, I don't think I have the patience for anything as engrossing as this book, and so I returned it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am in love with this book, but the writing makes it hard to read.   This story is amazing, and I am waiting for the next one, but   the story is too long for it to be good, the ending is not satisfying, the characters are not interesting enough, and the writing is very poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the audiobook version from Audible and listened through the first 10 minutes or so. Once I got through those 10 minutes, however, I had an uneasy feeling. I had heard that the audiobooks had been given a lot of re-work. The story line seemed very contrived in the beginning. The whole story line is very predictable. I was looking for a different sort of adventure. Instead, I got another story line, this time set in a Medieval-ish setting and set after the second or third book. This time, the plotlines seem more coherent, but the characters all seem to be drawn from the same mold. They are all similar but not that similar. And all of the plot lines involve the same set of characters. But the last 5 minutes of the audioguide were so disappointing I stopped listening altogether. I really wanted to like this book, but I really just couldn't get into it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book suffers from poor plot development, poor characters, a poorly realized premise, and a lack of a solid plot twist that ends the book on a cliffhanger. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book contains many errors that undermine the credibility of this author and her claims. The book has no footnotes to support its claims and is filled with a lot of "experts" who seem to be just guessing and using other authors and their work to support their opinions. The only things that this author says is that the book is about "the truth of history" which is very vague as this was just about a book published in 2013.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was great fun as a little kid. Now that I'm older I'll admit that it is dull as...I know, I'm a bit of a masochist but I'm going to have to stick to my favorite books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is slow, there's no real plot, and the author doesn't seem to know how to end it. It's like watching a documentary on the Civil War, only without a camera. It leaves me asking if this author is just doing this because it's a long book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not impressed by any of the books I have read in the series, and I have a lot of time on my hands now.   The characters are extremely shallow.  They all seem to have an issue with religion or with the idea that the gods might be real.  I find that ridiculous.  The gods of the series have to be made of something that is not man.  When I read about these gods I think of demons.  No thanks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this was the worst book I've ever read. The story was poor, the writing was atrocious and the plot was weak.   There was too much information that I wasn't able to fully absorb before I had to quit reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for a couple of dollars because I wanted a new edition that would correct an error. I was disappointed that the mistake was not corrected. The book was poorly written and there are two serious errors. The first is that the Bible is a very bad book. The second error is that Jesus is supposed to have been married. This is wrong in two ways. The Bible clearly says that Christ was married (John 5:31) and that Christ died for our sins (Romans 5:1). It also says that a man can become a wife (Rom 1:19). The fact that the book does not mention Jesus marrying a man or a woman suggests that it is not meant to be a guide for how to be holy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just an atrocious piece of crap.  It just drags and doesn't work on it's own merits.  I will not purchase another book by this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have not enjoyed a book so much in years.   The story line was confusing. I don't remember any character development and the plot seemed to have a hole in it at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading a bunch of the previous "I hated these books but they sucked" reviews I have to say that I'm actually excited to see the next one. I've been really struggling with this series and I was just itching to get back to it. This one is much better than the last two and much more fun. While I haven't read the first one, it seemed like I was in a bit of a groove with this one. In fact, I'm almost positive I'll be picking up the rest as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever had the displeasure of reading.   I read the reviews before I even bought it, and they were all pretty positive. But, I had to have it.  It's the sequel to  a very bad book I had read as a teen.  As you may be able to tell, I hated  the book as a teenager and still do to this day.  The book is just an insult to the reader who reads it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book over a couple of days. I liked the book. I don't remember any of the good parts, but the bad parts were what I remember. I have always liked this sort of mystery story, and was intrigued by this one. After reading this, I just wish I'd gotten a copy of the original in the first place. I read all sorts of mysteries and love to read the old ones, and this book was just the sort of book I didn't really enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to love this book, but I did not. There were times I wanted to give this book one star, but the fact that it is an un-adaptable mess of an adventure does not lessen my disappointment.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea what this is.    This book doesn't give any information about the person on the front, and no information about his/her name.  I wanted to know more about this character... I was completely baffled with the plot.  If you like:  The protagonist is the most interesting character.  His parents are interesting, but don't really add to the plot much.  I think the story could have been told better without them.  There were also a lot of confusing plot twists and revelations. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first time I read this book I really wanted to like it, but all the characters and the setting really made me hate it. The characters are not likeable and the plot is all over the place, and there is no end. This book needs more good things to happen for it to actually be an ok book. The story is okay, but it needs to be told more coherently or the author would have added better characters and less random happenings.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot was boring and slow and the main character was a cliche as all get out. I'm not sure how much I can really complain about that as a fantasy fan, but I thought that the book was pretty boring.  I read a lot of fantasy and I usually like most of them, but this is one of the worst to read and I felt like I got my money's worth when I finished it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have had an excellent experience with the CD but had hoped to see more of the author's other works. I like her writing but not this book. This book does not add much to her previous works, and I do not think it has the depth that the earlier ones had. It is a very short book. It really leaves little room for the author to explore in depth. The only character that has a depth to her is the author. The story takes a good part of the book to get to the actual story, and after the first 20 pages the book just ends.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book a 4/10 but the 4th star is justified. This book is extremely short and a bit bland.   I am a huge fan of this author and his books, but this book has several problems.  I really enjoy the plot and the characters and the author does a good job keeping the story focused on a handful of characters.  But in terms of the story, it was not a good one.  The main plot centered around the first season of the show and the story was not interesting enough to hold my interest.  For me it was very difficult to see the point of the main story.  A lot of the time the book was following a lot of side plots which was distracting. The second main plot was interesting but it did not go that far, so there was not that much of a payoff. And the third plot, which the author describes as a "second season", was a bit confusing to me.  Again, there was too much of side plot and not enough progress to really care about the main plot.  However, it is very hard to criticize a book for the way it is broken up in the main events and the few things the book does not have.  It is quite possible to enjoy this book and its two episodes but as a stand alone book it is not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the absolute worst book I've ever read. My only problem with the book is that I kept thinking "if only they had given it a higher rating than a 1, I would have bought it" I'm sure it's worth buying if you're a fan of Harry Potter and/or the Hobbit, but the writing alone is a HUGE let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really thought this book would help me better understand the differences between the genders, and how we view and behave in different cultures. What I got was a bunch of gender stereotypes and gender stereotypes. I liked some of the examples of gender and race stereotypes, but there were many that made no sense to me at all, and I'm still not sure why I thought the "macho" male was always bad or the "emotionless" female good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my son as a gift. I read it in a couple of days. The story line is about a girl who can see the future. I thought it was pretty good. I wanted to like it, but it just wasn't very good. The main problem I had with the book was the ending. I didn't get a cliffhanger, which I really didn't mind, but I also didn't know what happened next. I liked the main character very much and enjoyed the story line, but the ending really messed me up. I had to stop reading it and go to bed.   Review:  The main character in this book is very interesting. She is very smart, and can predict the future very well. It took me a few chapters to figure out that she could not see the full picture that others see. The book is mainly about her, and it is not that interesting.  I really liked this book. I got a kick out of the main characters, her family, and the town they live in. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys books with good writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters aren't that interesting. I got the impression that the author wrote this as a prank, to see how far he could get. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me a long time to get over the "Oh! So this is why I stopped reading books" feeling I got from this book. The first half of the book was amazing, and I was really, really excited to read the second half. Then the second page went by and it was like, "Wait, why the **** didn't you tell me this is the part where he tries to do the opposite of everything I want to do? It's all just a bunch of conflicting ****, and it's all a waste of time. The author wants to tell me what to do but refuses to do it, so there is no point." Then at the end, the author just goes to the bathroom, makes a cup of tea, and gets up to leave, saying "I'm done, you can do your thing now." The book just does NOTHING for me, and even though I love the story, it is just so ****ing generic that I'm disappointed that it didn't work as well as it could have. The ending is a waste as well. -I've read other books about romance, but this one was the most disappointing to read. It was just a lot of things that I don't like. I get that people are trying to create a believable setting, but in the end it was just so cheesy that I just didn't like it. Maybe I'm wrong though, and this is just how it all went down, but I just couldn't put the book down. If the author didn't write it so ****ty, I would have given it three stars. -One thing that I really liked about this book was the description of the main characters: "Sandy's childhood was never exactly the most idyllic."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was never really interested in this book. I think the idea was cute and I wanted to read about the different types of monsters in one place but I don't remember any real plot.  It was just an excuse to read a book I'd never read before and I'm disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. I don't mean to say it was bad. It's an excellent read. I have no problem with this book, in fact I found it to be great, but I couldn't keep from giving it 1 star. There are so many problems with this that it's truly difficult to rate it as anything other than a 1 star book. The story itself is brilliant and this book had some wonderful moments. The problems with the story is with the ending. The ending is the biggest problem I have with this story, which I'm going to get into shortly. If you are going to read this book and want a great story then by all means give it a go, and I highly recommend it. If not then just skip to the end and get what you want out of it, because at the end of the day you don't really get a good ending, but you are given an amazing journey. I loved this book but at the same time I couldn the ending ruined any good story that may have been written. So let's get into it, shall we?The story follows a boy named Adam who is adopted into a family. Adam is a very smart boy and is taught to love books by his mother. At the same moment he's learning to love her he's also learning how to be a thief. He has to become a master thief before he can get any of his mother's money. As a child thief Adam has some very interesting ways to get money. The most interesting way he has is to go into the school and steal books out of bookshelves. He can go into a store and make off with all of the items on the shelf, and as soon as he leaves the store he will put all the items back into the shelves. Adam steals things from shelves and he steals from children's books because he knows he will get caught because the books are hidden. Adam's mother is very mad about Adam stealing from children, so one day Adam and his brother get a job as pickpockets and they steal all of that money from the school, and all of Adam's money from his mother, because he stole everything. His mother then asks Adam to get her more money, but she won't pay him because she doesn't trust him. He decides that he has to steal from the elderly, and steals their money, and leaves them with no money to go on their own. Adam then steals from a train depot because he can't go in
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the end it's just too hard to keep up with this guy. I wanted to love his book, but I didn't. I know he's a brilliant thinker, so it's easy for me to be impressed by his wit and witlessness at times. (And maybe this is a good thing for a good thinker, but not for me as a reader.) It's hard to read a work of non-fiction written by a guy who has been able to pull off so many incredible literary tricks. The ending was particularly frustrating, but then he's done that a million times before. (My wife and I re-read it yesterday morning.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is too dry and boring. The characters have no depth to them. The plot makes no sense. It is about a boy who has a brain tumor that gets bigger. I'm glad he is able to get a brain scan of the tumor but I don't get why he has a tumor. The doctor is obsessed with having a good result because if she doesn't get one, the parents lose money. She tries everything she can to get one. She is a bit of an asshole. The ending leaves me confused. It makes me think that there is a really good explanation and that the book is just there to tell us. I don�t see the point in reading a book if the ending is so unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high expectations for this book, and I was very disappointed. The characters are all over the place and the story never quite comes together, especially since it has a really long title (and I usually hate long titles with no story).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My experience with this book was not positive, as I had been planning to read the book for a while now. I thought I would read the first half of the book and then skip to the other half after I had read that half. When I received the book I read the prologue and then found out that my intended reading sequence was only a few pages in. I was very disappointed. I had a great time while reading the book but it felt like the whole thing was rushed to get it into the holiday rush. I felt like I didn't get enough of the story to fully understand it, and I found the first two thirds, the half about the characters, really confusing. I found myself wondering who the characters were or what was the connection.   For those who love mysteries or thriller:  The book really is good, and there are several twists and turns throughout. I did not love this book but I did find myself re-reading it because I felt the parts of the storyline were so great. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book thinking it would be interesting, but ended up not enjoying it at all. The author was so far off from the actual historical figures, the author was either not paying attention or was not doing a very good job at covering up the historical inaccuracies. I really wish the author had spent more time on the figures and less on the general background. The main reason that I don't think I'll enjoy anything else from the author in the future is because it was so poorly researched and written.    
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only way to tell a story is to tell it and then let go. This book could have been written years ago, and as long as the author lived, the book would have been of no use to any student or anyone interested in the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been a huge fan of Harry Potter. I was a huge Harry Potter fanboy and when I saw this book my heart sank. I had expected more from the books.   It was boring as all hell and I can see what the author was going for in the beginning.  But after a few hundred pages it seemed to me that he had lost his way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a great time reading this book, but I just don't know how it will hold up in the long run.   It is just so wordy and it felt like the author never really got to the point.  The story is about a boy and his pet monkey, who have a very strange but loving relationship and their interactions with the people they meet at a fair.  I'm sure it is a good idea to have a child and monkey that have a special relationship, but the author didn't really get into the specifics or really do much with the story, other than try to be funny at the end.  If the author really wanted to get to the very heart of the child and the monkey relationship, she would have explored the more emotional side, because there really isn't much of that. I was hoping for a more realistic, less funny book about two children and a monkey. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book from the library, thinking it might be some kind of history or political treatise or some such thing, but it's more of a book that is filled with many factual errors and many quotes out of context, like most textbooks and other works on the subject.   So while it's interesting to know that the book is based on real events, I was disappointed to find that most of the information contained in the book was not true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like to be able to read this again and see if I can do it better or not. I will admit that I didn't read this book thoroughly before reading it but the problem is that the author writes so fast that it's really hard to make sense of what's happening, what he is saying or what his writing style is. Also, in my experience this kind of book is often very preachy and a little bit boring and if you get bored and just don't like to read about people who have done something, you'll probably be really bored with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The cover reads: 'Why Do Men Marry?"' No. I was expecting more from that title."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   While reading The Hobbit, I was initially impressed by its unique style and the amazing characters. After reading the books I found a lot of inconsistencies in the book and the plot has a lot problems that I found it hard to understand. If you enjoy fantasy and are looking for a good book, read this book, but you are probably better off reading one of Tolkien's books before trying this one out.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been searching for this book for months on Amazon, and I finally decided to buy it at a special discount price after looking at it on many other websites. I'm glad I did!   It's a good book about what the bible really teaches, but it is a bit long for me to read in one sitting.   The author has a lot of good information, but sometimes she seems a bit extreme in her belief that the bible is the only true way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good thing about the book was the foreword by a fellow author who has just come out of an addiction, and is happy to write of his recovery.   But unfortunately, the book is just like any other, which means that I'm going to have to keep reading, hoping to find some gems in this drab and depressing book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the content a bit tedious, the author seems to know more about biology than about writing.  She didn't get anything else right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was an interesting novel but I got stuck trying to follow it and ended up with many pages left on my shelf, which is the worst.  I understand the idea of the book, but I could have done much better with my time and effort.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. I didn't hate it just because it wasn't the best book I have ever read. I hated it because it was boring, and because it has everything to do with writing. The main character, K.A. MacNaughton, is a boring boring boring bitch. She writes about being a writer, which I can get behind, but the rest of the book was an exercise in her getting revenge on other writers for being mean to her. She's always mean, and always to blame, and no one ever forgives her because of it. What was I supposed to read other than this? It was like a "You're the best, you're the worst, and nobody likes you, and everyone likes me" book. The only thing I liked was the ending, but that ending was a bit too convenient. The other books were better and more interesting, but this one had the biggest flaws. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a poorly written and badly conceived book.   The story is all over the place and the characters are a mess.  There is so little thought put into the story that it is hard to believe they are really trying to write a good novel.  My biggest problem with this book was that it was too complicated for me to follow.  The writing is too convoluted to understand.  It is easy to get confused.  This was such a disappointing read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I had only read this book it would not have been worth my time. This book is boring, boring, and boring. I'm a college student, I need something I can read fast, and this book was boring for me, and I can't stand boring books.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book to read at the library. I bought the book on line at a decent price and I was hopeful that this would be a decent read.   The book had some interesting information and interesting characters but when it comes to the plot, I am disappointed in the execution.  When we were introduced to our characters, they were described as intelligent and witty, so when we got to the parts of the story where it turned out that their intellect was really in the background, I felt that I was reading a very boring book.    The characters were so flat that it made me cringe.  I am looking forward to a re-read of this book,  but I would not recommend this book unless you have a strong stomach for the gritty urban/crime thriller genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's "message" is that if you don't want to be a woman, then you're a girl and that's the end of the story.    That's not only a very simplistic and negative view of what life is all about but it's also extremely narrow-minded. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would have liked to have seen more from this author, especially the romance and the world building, but not everything worked out perfectly for me and I had to stop after the first book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I picked up a copy of this book a couple months ago, I really was looking forward to learning about the world's second-largest economy. However, the author spent most of his book on a description of China's economic "miracle." In an age of economic globalization, it is surprising how little emphasis is paid to the failures and shortcomings of such an economy. For instance, this is the second time that I've read a book on China, and I had forgotten the "miracles" and "failures" in our country. In fact, I have not read anything by a Western economist on China that had been more focused on the difficulties that we face than the author's book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I loved this book, and enjoyed it in general. It's very funny, and the humor is spot-on. However, I don't think I'll go through with reading it in full (if I ever do), since I have a few other books I've already read, but I plan on buying the rest of the series. I thought it was interesting, but not that funny. I just don't find it very interesting, I think. I will buy the next book in the series, but my sense is that the next few books will be more about the relationship between the three main characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for a gift. The contents were terrible and it was just too hard for me to understand the plot. I read the synopsis and found no clues at all as to what the story was about. My book club decided it was a book for the children but I just didn't enjoy it and ended up throwing the book away.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very boring book. I can't believe it took me 3 months to finish it.   It took me 15 minutes to read and another 15 to get through the index.  I have no idea what the point is of this book.  It's not a classic, I read it to satisfy a curiosity and the plot never got me interested.    The only other novel that comes close is John Grisham's      I know I shouldn't rate a book based on the index but the index is the only thing about this book that makes it worthwhile.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I heard that the author is a professor of French, I was excited for this book. I had been dying to get into French literature and wanted to read some good stories about France in the early twentieth century. But this book was nothing but bad.  It is a very bad translation of a very good book.  I am not sure if the author was having a bad day or was trying to sound very French or if it was a mistake.   Unfortunately I couldn't finish it because I got very bored.  The book is about a young woman named Charlotte, who has the unusual ability to read minds.  Unfortunately, she has a horrible temper that she has to work through.  Charlotte is very self centered, impatient, and easily frustrated.   Her sister is a girl with a normal brain.  However, she is a good reader, and her mother is not a good cook.  Both are French.  She can read the emotions in their faces.   At first Charlotte has no problems, and she doesn't feel like she's missing out on anything.  But as time goes on, she can't seem to read a bad guy's mind without being annoyed, and sometimes she can only read a book a day.  One day she is reading a book on "French humor" and realizes it is about the writer Jean-Luc Lagarini.  So when she comes across a copy of Lagarina's novels, she starts thinking about all the books she liked as a kid. Then one day she comes into Lagarine's house, and is in a bad mood and tries to attack him.  Lagarino is able to defuse the situation and gives her a copy. He gives her two other books to read, and says it is up to her if she wants to read them. She asks him for advice on what she should read next and he gives her the most obvious choice. The book is called "A Story of a Girl Who Loves a Frenchman."   She can't help but feel like Lagarner is a French prince. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The badness of this book goes well beyond the fact that the story was not well written and it goes beyond the bad pacing of the chapters. It was so boring.   It is just so sad. It is not that the stories are not real and they were interesting or that the writing is not good, it's just the pace. The stories are spread so far apart from each other.  It's like you are not even reading a book, you are just watching tv with a book and when the book ends you say "That was boring".   So, for a book that is supposed to be a work of art, I could not care less for the art. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is an abundance of good books out there and many people are not only getting something from reading it, but learning something they will take with them for the rest of their lives. It is a shame to waste your time reading this, which lacks in content and depth, but does contain some of the better story telling that I have read in a long time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing but crap.   It's a boring read, it makes no sense, and all the characters are stereotypical.  The main character, named Alastair, has a hard time connecting with the other characters as they are all different and he's also different but has trouble connecting to anyone else because of his past. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book and read it in one sitting. I had been wanting to read about the real story of the Great Leap Forward in China but I wanted to see how Mao would react to that. This book did not do that. I didn't like how they tried to explain things like 'collaboration' and 'collapse' to make it sound more credible, and it didn't explain much about the actual Great Leap forward.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story: In this story, a man dies. It is a nice ending, but I found it completely contrived. The author gives us a good background of the man, but the details of his last hours were extremely odd. One could imagine a similar death, but not as a man. There was no way the author could have had any knowledge of the way a man died. I found no meaning to any of the story and it left me feeling disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't good.   There are few people who can really make use of this one.  I am sure that many people would find it interesting to read about a woman who is "a total badass" who "takes no prisoners" as she fights to survive in the world around her.  She just kills things, and is so damn good that you almost want to stop reading to watch her kill things.  A few things about this book bothered me, however.  For starters, if you are a woman reading this book, I am pretty sure that the only thing you will see female body parts is breasts.  This can be irritating if your books has a lot of nudity, but I think this was over the top.  Second, the author has a very annoying habit of using quotes that are too long.  Most people don't read all the way through a book to find a quote, so I don't see the point of it.   But the bad end is that I found this book too slow.  The main thing I found wrong with the book is the fact that it was overkill.  It seemed like an episode in a soap opera with very little action and really weird characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a huge fan of this book, but it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. My heart wasn't in it and it was way too much like a romance novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a hard-to-follow story, and while the writing style is good, it is very hard to get into. I just kept flipping back and forth because I couldn't get into the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is not much that I enjoyed about this book, despite all the praise it is getting, which is very bad when it comes to me being a horror fan. I had high hopes for this book from the synopsis, but the writing style of the author is very amateur and makes it difficult to get into the story, making the story more of a story for the character than for me. The characters are bland and generic, which I didn't like. The ending is very abrupt, especially to someone who has followed the author's previous work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, and, like all people who do not like to hear that their opinions are wrong, I was absolutely shocked when I came to the conclusion that this book was an utter failure. I had given it a high rating, because I found a lot of its arguments persuasive. I was disappointed, though, when the book was as short and boring as it was. This book is basically a list of supposed arguments against socialism and why it does not work. However, the author never really proves anything, and his arguments are often misleading or fallacious, and I have no idea where to start to counter them. Even more confusing is the author's lack of knowledge of even basic economics, and he is so obsessed with attacking the socialism of the New Deal that he fails to discuss how the New Left was the true enemy of capitalism. It would have been better if he had made a more convincing case, even if I did not completely agree with his conclusions. In any case, it seems unlikely that a book on socialism could have more impact than a book about New Deal liberalism.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book does not give a good idea of how the movie's story is supposed to be told. There were a few problems, and the movie doesn't get them all.   In the end, it turns out to be a movie about a bunch of bad people and a good story about a good girl who loves the wrong guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book I was left with no hope for humanity.   I think the author has lost all motivation to write and as a result, the book is an exercise in boredom. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best part of this book is the end. The story has a wonderful conclusion. The only thing is that it is very rushed. When I first started reading this book I was really excited. I was expecting a satisfying conclusion to the story. It wasn't until I finished the book and had to read the next one that I realized I wasn't going to like the next book at all. I've been meaning to read this book but never got around to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book expecting a horror book, so I was pleasantly surprised by its content. The plot was well-paced. The character development was wonderful. The book is about a serial killer who kidnaps women and tortures them in a ritualistic way. I love horror, so this one didn't hurt my heart. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book thinking it was going to be a good book. It was the opposite.   I hate when a book isn't really about the book.  I got hooked to the first 100 pages but by the end of it I had no idea where the story was going.  The writing style was very cheesy and the author's opinions and views on a wide variety of subjects were often wrong.  One of the main characters is named "Jem" which sounds like an animal and is clearly not a real person.  For a book where the protagonist has to choose a life in which to live for, that's a mistake.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's a good writer.   Unfortunately the book is not a good book.  The story is not very original and most of the characters are not very interesting.  If I was a younger reader this would have been a fantastic book to have.  Instead I got the "the first book I ever read sucked" headache. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so disappointed in this book.  I have been looking for a good "How to Get the Most Out of the Internet" type book. I found this. It has many things I could have used and some I didn't need. However, it is not a quick to read book. It took over two months to read and I would not recommend this book to someone who has never written a book before.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a bad reading experience. I'm a big book and audio enthusiast, and I was pretty excited about this audiobook. Unfortunately, I found it to be terrible. I would never read this book, and the narrator didn't do anything to help me feel at all like I was in the world of this book. There was a great book, with a great narrator, and it's unfortunate the author wasn't even the better for having used him.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am still very annoyed with this book. The story has no plot (no real tension or momentum) and the author tries to make up for it with a lot of extraneous details. Not only are there a ton of characters that are unappealing, the plot is so far over-explained that I could write a very long review, but I'm not gonna. I'm gonna go to sleep. And I want to be able to tell my friends to go away.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping to read something good but this book was pretty terrible. The writing is dull.   It starts off well enough but then it doesn't improve. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book contains all the info that you need to understand what's happening in the Middle East and its aftermath, but you don't get it because of the bias of the author. The author doesn't tell us everything, and she doesn't even tell us how she came up with the information in the first place. I know some people say you should just go to Wikipedia and learn about everything, but I can't do that because my information comes from the same sources that the author does, and that's a big problem.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been using my copy of The Art of Learning as my book to guide my learning process. The Art has helped me through a lot of learning. As for the problems I have found I am still learning. Not too much, but enough to keep me on my toes. I would have liked to see a better book written, but all in all, a great buy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a book of fantasy but the majority of it is based on old-school SF (Harlan Ellison, Jack Vance). The story itself was pretty good but after reading this book my head was spinning and my palms were clammy. It really was a tough book to read...it really makes you think and I really hope they keep writing about this subject for the time being.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book doesn't read well. It starts badly. It's written in a style which I don't like. It has poor vocabulary, which has ruined many of the sentences. The book is also poorly formatted, meaning the author doesn't really know where she wants her chapters to go. If it wasn't for the wonderful cover, I wouldn't have picked this book up.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing more than a bunch of "jokes" designed to help you forget that you have to be a good husband/father/dad (in my case I mean that in a good way) before you can really love your wife or even be sexually attracted to her.   I had to read this book more than once just to remind myself to stop getting aroused.  It's not just "jokiness", it's sexual in nature and "fuckyou" to be so rude to your wife about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is a moronic loser and does absolutely nothing but get into trouble.   I don't think he would have done well in the real world.  It's a really sad and pathetic story, but it really just makes me feel bad for the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't usually rate books in the 5-star range, but this is a very poor book. It is one of those books that has all the potential to be a great work of literature. However, it is unfortunately a poor one. I love some of George R. R. Martin's books, and if you read The World of Ice and Fire you will love this one too.  I think you should not read this book, unless you have been exposed to the author's prior work and enjoy that kind of thing. The plot is poorly thought out, the characters are not developed and the author is not a good writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read it in a short amount of time.   The book is about a character named "Buddha", and his teachings are very profound and have a profound impact on the life of the reader.  When the book was read it seemed to have an overall negative message.  This book does not stand up to repeated reading, and it is difficult to see what the overall message of the book is.  Overall it is hard to recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never liked these books in the past.   The characters are all stereotypical but the story is completely non-existent. The dialogue is really bad and every character has one-line lines.  I like to read and listen to books, so this book is a complete waste of my time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to read a great work of fiction, read a fantasy book. I had the best time reading this book because it was so good. But the book was just a little bit too easy to enjoy as fiction because it has some problems that would have worked better as a short story. I wish the author had added a little more depth.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is interesting and the concept sounds interesting. Unfortunately, it's a really crappy book that has no originality and no story. I'm afraid that I'll have to go back to the beginning and start again with a new book that will be better. I will definitely never buy this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It takes about 6 weeks before I get to reading and starting. And then I don't get to finish it till next year. A little disappointed for such a fun book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is not interesting.   This book is like reading a bad movie, or a badly written book. I felt like a dumbass in the beginning. Then, I understood the purpose of it, which is to bring a message that the society have been neglecting and is going down the drain. However, the book was over-powered by its preachy messages which are difficult to understand because the story itself is poorly written and the characters are annoying. The story of these people have not got any character development. There is no sense of hope. There are no characters that are more intelligent than others, there is no conflict or struggle. This is a book, which should have been written in a novel format.     This is a waste of time and I'll be reading the next book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is so amateurish and cheesy that I was disgusted.   I didn't get any of the characters or story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish the book was shorter and I could have found the information to do it myself.   It is not a book that teaches anything.  It shows you the things you could do with the information you would get from a course.  I am hoping that my classes and I will have some sort of information on these kinds of things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seems to me that this book isn't really about anything. The subject matter is familiar, but I'm not sure what's going to happen in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be a very dry and very dull read.   It is filled with irrelevant data that only supports the theory.  My daughter was the one that encouraged me to pick it up, and I was hoping that there would be some value to this book that could be gained from it.  It seems as if a lot of what was said is made up out of whole cloth without much evidence.  As a scientist, it really irks me when these kinds of theories have been made up and no proof is provided.  I really wanted to like this book because I've always liked the idea that our experiences affect our physiology. I like the idea of a "biological clock" that keeps track of our lives. I really enjoyed this book though, it was a bit dry, but it didn't really bother me in the least.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are some really good books on this list, but this one didn't work for me. I liked the other books on the list and thought the information about the different types of cancer is a useful one, but I didn't find the information given by the authors very useful. I have read enough about cancers to know that most people with this type of cancer do not have any symptoms, and so their diagnosis is often not made.   The book has good info, but it could have been longer and it seemed too simple at times.   An excellent book on the biology of cancer.  This is a great book for someone who is new to the world of cancer biology, or just wants to better understand the cancer process in general.  I highly recommend the book.  The information provided is extremely helpful, and there's a little bit of everything to be able to understand the process. I am a very newbie to cancer research, and the authors' explanations and examples really helped me to understand cancer and learn about it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can only compare the book to others. The first chapters of this book were very interesting and very insightful on the topic of race relations. However, the rest of the book had very little to offer other than racist stereotypes. I was disappointed that Dr. Jackson did not mention the fact that the white majority of the United States and Great Britain were the first nations to ban slavery. She does make the point that African-Americans were used as slaves and that their rights were abused. She also states that Africans did not participate in the American Civil War and therefore it did not lead to emancipation for the slaves. It did lead to the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment that abolished slavery in the United states. Unfortunately, the author has not provided a source for this statement. The only source I could find for the statement was an article by Henry Louis Gates published in " The American Historical Review ". But to me, the statement does not hold up to scrutiny. I think it is important to point out that most American politicians at the time did not agree with slavery or the Thirtieth Amendment. I have read many books that make racial statements on their covers, but I would never recommend a book with that cover as an endorsement.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book didn't work for me. I was not a huge fan of the world building but I think it needed to be explained. The story is interesting and a bit slow but the book is not bad but I would have much rather waited to read the next book in the series, which is by far the best in this series. I read it to support the series and I think I'm going to go buy the first book in this new series instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read.   For the most part it is a great story of a good-hearted woman in the wrong place at the wrong time.  For some reason, the man gets in the way. I think it is important to note that the man is a major antagonist in this story.  A woman who has lived many years as an orphan is in the position of being rescued from a life of misery.  The girl doesn't want to do this and she tries to get the man to leave her alone.  When this doesn't work she is forced to take revenge and ends up losing everything.  I felt bad for the girl and hoped she had learned from her past mistakes.  In my opinion, there was nothing good to come out of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I never would have thought to read a book written by a feminist about sex with men and men.    It was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was a good part of the book that was actually good. That part of it was actually interesting. The rest of the chapter I found to be very repetitive and lacking in any substance. I think I could have done without some of the science. I'm not a scientist but I could see how a person like me would not get an understanding of some of what was presented. However, the fact that you have a book that's so heavily on sex, drugs, and rock n roll I think is quite interesting and shows that a lot of science is still needed to understand the human mind.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is just boring. The characters are so uninteresting that you don't want to read them. This is a great concept and I liked reading it, but I just wanted to stop reading it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is so clearly unqualified for the job that his book is so boring and poorly written it's painful. I'm not saying I would've preferred something a little more like War Against the Weak, but not at all the same. I enjoyed my first book, so I guess I'll go back and read the others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not worth the money.   This book is not an entertaining read.  In fact it is almost a waste of time as the information contained in this book is outdated and does not provide much insight into any specific technology or business.  There is a section on "How to build a successful blog" that is pretty dry.  My advice to the author would be to start a new blog about something interesting that the world is interested in.  I think she would be a better blogger then this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've bought a few books from these guys in the past, and never gotten what I wanted. I've tried to return the ones that are still in the package, but haven't gotten them back.   It's so hard to figure out what they want and are willing to pay for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has the potential to be a great read. The author manages to add interesting characters and compelling plot to an otherwise typical fantasy. The only problem I had is that I felt like there was almost nothing interesting happening. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book two stars because of the quality of the writing and the beautiful illustrations. However, the author had to write a book about the paranormal, and I had the feeling that she had to tell her readers about many of the "gimmicks" used in the various books that claim to be on that topic, because the books are mostly so full of obvious "gimmes." I suppose that makes sense, but I just didn't feel like the "real" explanation for some of the phenomena in these books was well-explained.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has a title that is just too long, but not enough of an issue.   When I started the book I was a bit skeptical about this being true, but as soon as I started reading the book, I realized that it was more of a story than it was a book.  But I did enjoy reading the story and I was interested in learning more about it.  This is an important book in the psychology of motivation, especially for parents.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was not engaging, I didn't get to know the characters.   I don't read genre fiction and so, because the author is in fantasy, it seemed strange to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my son, but he hasn't read it yet. There are so many things wrong with this book. It was way over priced. I expected a good book at a good price, but this one is a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not an enjoyable read.  I would love to read something better, but I've tried everything else out there. I was hoping to be enlightened about this subject, but just disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was fun at times but I can't get over how unrealistic this whole scenario is. The only two times I had a good time were when I went to the library, which I knew, and when I visited my parents.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has the right ideas, but they are often not well presented.   For example, the concept of the evil spirit is so poorly explained that you think, "what's the point?   The character in the story is written with a weak moral compass.  I understand that, in a "grimdark" (grimdark is a subgenre, which in itself is a genre), a character is only good when they're evil, but in this story, I found the evil being just as weak.  It makes sense that if you were evil, you'd be weak.  From the back cover of the book: "The world is full of horrors. The ancient powers that haunt the Earth have returned, and now they're bent on world domination. Humanity has found itself as their vassal, and the world is theirs. But this time, the battle isn't for dominion over the planet. It's for the survival of the species. The first in a series of novels, The Children of the Sky tells the story of a human colony ship, which finds itself the target of the very monsters that have plagued the Earth since the dawn of man. The only survivors are a small group of people who have never known any other civilization than that of Earth's. They have one rule, and it's simple: Never look away." The Children Of The Sky is a first book in the Grim Dark Series, and I had high hopes for this series. Unfortunately, the stories in this book are not so good, that I feel like the whole series will only be worth it if you are very well acquainted with the "grim dark" genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very interesting book which deals with a great many different subjects - sociology, biology, psychology, etc. The author is the most knowledgeable and interesting person I have ever met. However, this book is too long for the average person to read, and as a result there is nothing new to be learned from the author or from the subject at hand. I recommend this book to people who have some interest in the subject and also the ability to think deeply, but not so deep that they get confused.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no problem with books that contain "science", but this book is a complete non-starter.   The author is a scientist and a respected one at that.  They even made it easy for me.  I found this book on a book shelf.  Then it turned out to be a science book with "science" sprinkled throughout.  This made me wonder if I had bought the wrong book.  But I don't feel this was a bad purchase.  Maybe it would be better if it wasn't a "science book".  The "sciencey" aspects were just icing on the cake of an overbearing book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad. The book is just a collection of bad writing. I hate writing reviews because it makes me feel bad for a book that I don't want to read, but at least it doesn't make me feel guilty for reading it because of what I want to say. So...the bad reviews are just from me, that's it. This book was terrible. It's just terrible. If I could give it 1 star I would. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of the worst I have read since I started reading the series and it has ruined everything I was hoping for in the book.  It seems like the author was given permission to take everything she wanted to and did it poorly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not just about one person who did something bad. If you are an extrovert, you probably won't be impressed by the book. If this was an easy read to get through, I would rate it 5 stars. However, the book does not cover everything. The main character is not the most sympathetic character, and this has been repeated throughout the book by the author. A good book should cover everything, including some topics that are hard to talk about and may not be well accepted in society. But this book doesn't cover many things. If your need is to know how to handle an extemporaneous speech, then this book may be worth a try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first two books I bought were from this author.  The second book was so bad I thought maybe I have been duped or something.  I did give her one more chance but still she was not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book. However, I was disappointed that in the end I found myself completely bored by the book.   The ending was just bizarre and I felt like the author was really trying to make a statement that maybe, just maybe, he's right in what he's saying but that just didn't make it all the way through. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the best books I've ever read. My wife and I were discussing the importance of being a good listener a few days ago and this book was the perfect antidote. It was an eye opener.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've had this book for many years and I'm finally reading it this summer after many years of not buying the other books in this series.   While it has some excellent stories it's just all around a disappointment.  A lot of it is just silly fantasy (i.e. elves and wizards and princesses) and then the characters fall into the fantasy tropes which are not only cliched but also really bad at providing any interesting character.  The setting is also pretty lame and the main characters are not very interesting or likable (I can understand a lot of characters with this sort of attitude but they don't get much mileage) so the series becomes a boring slog.  If the characters are good, interesting, and engaging you may enjoy this but the actual story and setting is really forgettable.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to this book as a refresher on how to write about science. Sadly, the book is nothing more than a series of stories that tell the story of how the author's father died when the family home was ransacked and his books were destroyed. The father had been a scientist, and the stories were written by his son with a touch of the scientific. There is so much more to science, and to writing science.  "This is the best book on science I've ever read."  The science in this book is so bad, that one would have to read the book four or five times just to learn it is bad.  I recommend this book for students and non-scientists alike. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got hooked on this book by reading reviews on Goodreads but ended up never getting past the first chapter. Then when I saw a few reviews where people really liked it and actually loved it I thought to myself I just can't write about a book this good, not while I'm reading one I really love. I found myself going on and on about what the characters did and the dialogue. But that doesn't make the book bad, it just didn't sit right with me. The last three or four pages where I realized I was done and had to put this book down and never look at it again I kept thinking that I would have really enjoyed it more if I was still reading.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was hard to find in the store, because the staff was very confused on what to do with the book.    The cover has a great picture of a ship that is in the midst of a disaster, but there is nothing about it in the back.  The description is vague and does not give enough information on the book or its content.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is good.   I loved the characters but this book was a disappointment.  The character's age ranges from 12-25.  This is an appropriate range for most books, but not for a fantasy series.  I did not enjoy the romance and I didn't like any of the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There were some parts of the book that made me cringe.  But it was still a good book and it was funny and entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is fine and I enjoyed the story but I have a hard time believing that I would survive another chapter. The story of one of the characters in this book was fascinating and the concept of a girl who died being "caught by the dead" was intriguing. I have read some books about girls like this and it is not something I would have expected. It is not a very good book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a lot of interesting ideas, but it is very long and boring. I didn't like much of it, and would not recommend this book to people.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is bad but not bad enough to make this book a failure, even with a poor writing. The first five chapters are well done.   At the end of the first half the plot thickens and the author slows down a bit.  It is possible to enjoy this book, but the ending is just so unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. It was funny, very well written, and had a great plot line.  I loved the ending, but I would've liked the author to make more of a point of showing how bad a relationship can get. There were some nice comments about relationships, but then again, the relationship in question was between a guy and a girl (not necessarily a married couple). Overall, I really liked this book (and the movie). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book ever published. I wanted to cry, but I read it through. It is nothing like the movie and has no connection to the film in any way whatsoever. The writing is horrible, the characters are stupid, and the plot has no impact whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first 40 pages were enjoyable.  I was looking forward to this book and I was expecting the same kind of books I have been reading for many years, but I was surprised when the first 40pages were boring.  This book is no more than a collection of short stories written by various authors of varying degrees of fame and quality.  The writing itself is mediocre at best and the stories are uninspired and poorly constructed.  One story was written in the first person and the other in the third person.  A lot of readers will be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been wanting to read this book for a long time. Finally, on a very long commute to the airport, I got it. I was glad to finally have it because, as others have said, the book is quite long, and the plot can get confusing in places. That said, I liked the plot (though not as much as I would have liked), I liked some of the ideas, and I like the voice of the author. It's not as good as books by, say, Stephen King (which, by the way, I still haven't read). However, that's not a bad thing, because the author is still improving, and with the recent addition of "fandom", this should be a very good book. I would definitely recommend this to a friend, and if I had read this 20 years ago, I would still have recommended it. But I don't remember reading this 20 (or even 10) years ago and, to be honest, I'm not sure it was a particularly good book to read. I don the author was struggling with writer's block at the time, and maybe my memory has deteriorated. This might be a good book for someone who is not interested in fantasy and/or horror.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was great but I think it would be better as an e-book because it would make the story better.   This book is very well written but it was a bit hard to find a specific ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor excuse to not read other authors. I was expecting something good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have always loved this series. There are always so many different and interesting ideas in this series that I look forward to every installment. However, there have been several problems that have kept this series from getting the highest score. These problems included a poorly written, repetitive plot, poor characterization and the complete loss of suspense. I think I would have rated this book higher if there weren't these problems. It will be interesting to see what happens to this story if the other issues were addressed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first time I read this I was so frustrated by the stupid spelling errors and grammar errors and had to go back and correct them.   This was a really bad decision because then I could not understand the story at all.  Also, the stories about his father are unbelievable and so it's hard for me to take seriously any of them, although I found one of the best ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's like being stuck in an elevator with a bad movie.   A lot of times I would read a book and end up not finishing because of how boring it was,   and then I would try to find a movie to watch because I couldn't finish the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I went back to reading this book after years of neglecting it. I really enjoyed the first one (the first in a trilogy) but the second was far less enjoyable and I had to put it down. This one was very much better, but I couldn't get into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was really a disappointment.   It has all the elements of a good romance: characters who are likeable, believable, and engaging; an interesting and romantic love story; lots of twists and turns, all of which were well executed; an intriguing set of mysteries; a gorgeous cover; but the plot, plot twists, mysteries, and ending all fell flat, and when you put all of that together, you get a mediocre book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are shallow and have no depth. They are just a collection of stereotypes. "Diversity is a crutch; when it's used as a crutches, it falls apart. "I liked this book, I just don't like it. "   My favorite character is the "Diverse" character, who I thought was just a stereotype, which is why I didn't mind him. He wasn't just a "good" character; he had interesting motivations, like a lot of the characters in this series. The other two characters had no motivation, so their characterizations were very limited, so there was really nothing to enjoy about their scenes.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very boring and drab book. The world building was interesting, and the ending was disappointing. I liked the concept of the universe, but it feels like it was very out there, not very believable, and it felt rushed. The plot was not exciting at all. The characters were not interesting. I felt a bit cheated at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book ever.   I can't believe a book this horrible was published in 2017.  The story is boring, the characters are shallow, the plot is a nightmare, and there's no way the author managed to make it a 50,000 word novel with so many characters. I don't understand how it was able to hit 50,001.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished the last of four books in this series, and I really don't think they're worth the time or money. While I am familiar with the universe, I just don't feel like I learned anything new.   The plot is so predictable that it's hard to believe it isn't set in a different country or time. I was expecting the hero to be a wizard, or at least to possess some magical abilities.  I have the same feeling about the first book, and this third book just doesn't have the magic of the previous two.  The only thing I will say about this series is that it is the first time I've actually enjoyed a fantasy novel, and that's not always a good thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason I've had difficulty getting into the series is because of the lack of development of a main character. Although I understand it is the first book, it is not a main protagonist. I do understand the characters are important but that is not really a main focus in a fantasy book. I was hoping the series was going to develop a main heroine and I don't see that now. That being said, the book was not bad. I enjoyed the story and the characters and I will read the next book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has become my least favorite as of late. The writing is very sloppy and feels rushed and disorganized. The only thing that has helped me was reading other people's reviews.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping this was a bad novel, but sadly, it is not.   This book is a good and well written book.  But, there is no sense of adventure in this book, and I had to put it down after finishing the first part.  I didn't feel that the book was very believable at all.  It was pretty cliché. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a child, I would constantly get into trouble and get punished in different ways for being naughty and doing my share to help with chores. My parents took me to school and got me caught on their way to school. I would then get home, sit on my bed, and read my old book "The Boy Who Cried Wolf". I would often cry and get frustrated with how many times I had been punished for doing chores. When my parents bought me this book as a grown-up, I was disappointed, as it was supposed to be a good book.   I was soooooo bored by it at the time!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I bought this book, I had no idea what to expect.  I was so happy to get this book because I have never seen a book like it.  This book is filled with interesting stories and great characters. I would love to know more about the people that these people live with and how they are connected to this community that has been around for so long.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not worth reading. My friend recommended this book to me as I am on the fence about reading a new book. I am a huge fan of modern literature so I was excited to read something from the last century. Unfortunately it did not live up to its hype.   In many ways, this book feels like something out of the 19th century. The language is antiquated, and the writing style is not my favorite. I thought the characters would be interesting, but they're so clichéd that the book is not very fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My son read this book for my birthday. I bought it because I was a big fan of his. However, he was too busy reading the new Harry Potter series (I loved that one). I can't recommend this book because it's poorly written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book and while I enjoyed reading it, the plot was very slow. After the first three books of the series I got tired of the same storyline and characters.  This book would have benefited from some time to develop.  I also had a problem with the character development, at times there seemed to be no point at all to the characters development.  It's hard to read because it's all just a bunch of vague plot developments without any emotional connection to the people involved.  Overall I liked the plot, but not the execution. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My husband and I went on vacation this year. We got stuck at one of the small ports in the Bahamas. This is my second travel book (a first being the New York Times bestseller "How to Travel Without Losing Your Mind") and I'm quite disappointed by this one. The first time I read it, I was thoroughly entertained. It was hard to put down after reading it and I loved all the places in the book. This time around, I found the stories about those places to be less interesting. I have to say I loved the original plot line as well, though.   I don't feel like I can recommend this book to anyone, especially since there are not a lot of good travel books out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am glad I bought this book. I loved it as a kid and now I enjoy it as an adult. There is something about it that seems to speak to me in a unique way that I don't get from other books. That's why I kept reading it and I am so glad I did. The plot is interesting, the characters are fun and likable and the prose is not as flowery as it could be. I will buy this book if it comes back on the list.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In other words, it was dull, uninspiring, and not what I hoped it would be.   For the most part, the book is based on the research of a man named Dr. A. E. Fysh.  However, after listening to the interview with Fysch on the Oprah Winfrey Show, I realized that he was not a scientist at all.  He is just a man who spent many years searching for evidence to back up his belief in the paranormal.  His book is pretty thin in the scientific aspect of things, so you have to get through some pretty heavy-handed material to get to the paranormal portion of the book.  Despite all of this, it is the paranormal aspect that I found the most interesting.  I do not believe in ghosts, psychics, or anything like that.  This book tries to explain why these things occur and why we may be able to detect them.  Although the book seems to have an objective truth, I just do not understand why someone would spend so much time trying to explain things like these.  The only time I thought the author did an adequate job was when he talked about a ghost that appeared to him during a conversation with a friend.  Perhaps there are people who would like to read about ghost hunting that are not convinced by the evidence.  Overall, I would say that this is a fairly entertaining book that provides a bit of light entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a mess. I found myself trying to fit in all the information about the universe into one coherent view. This is difficult to do because of the vast number of assumptions made. Even though the book starts out strong, the information is lost in the next 100 pages. And it is quite confusing at times. The author does a decent job on the science, but his explanations about what the planets and galaxies are and how they form is far too many. If I could give this book one star it would be that I feel a little cheated by the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a terrible book. In fact, I was going to pass on this book altogether before I read a word of it because of the length. If you love books that read like children's books, you will enjoy this one. However, if you have any interest in any form of fiction, especially mystery, I don't recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are likable and interesting but the plot doesn't work.   A story is meant to be read and reread. The problem is the author makes it hard. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A couple of hours and I got so sick of this book that I just stopped reading it.   The characters are the same, the stories are the familiar ones, but it just doesn't feel like it has anything to say.  The writing is not good enough to make me give it a four stars, but I'll give it two stars because it's very funny at times, and it's also pretty cleverly written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is very bad. The author, while not a terrible writer, is just very bad at explaining the concept of how to play the game in a way that makes it not feel like an exercise in futility.  I feel like the first chapter is very vague and the explanations of the rules feel like they are very well-written, but I'm not sure that they're really going to make a huge difference in my understanding of how the game works. I like the idea of having a deck with the most powerful cards, and that's something that I can understand.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this book is poorly written and poorly edited. It's a well researched but poorly written book that could be improved upon. I have had the experience of using some of the materials in it when preparing for a course that I'm required to take. The book is clearly organized, but in the end it is hard to find anything I can learn from it.   The cover of this book has a cartoon of a woman with a book in her hands (in the lower right corner) and the caption is:  This book explains how to use a computer to help you do a lot of the tasks that you do every day in your work and your personal life. It describes how the use of computers and the internet have changed our lives, and how they will change our lives for the future. It talks about the many kinds of tasks that computers can help you perform, and it describes how to set up a computer so that you can do these things. The best part of this is that it has lots of information about the types of computers, the functions of each one, and the types and functions of the software that comes with them. I had planned to read this book several years ago but never did. Now that I have, I have some ideas about how I can use computers to perform some of my daily tasks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I have to say that makes any sense at all about this book is the fact that it takes a bunch of nonsense from the internet and throws it in a book and calls it a great read. This book is just another example of how the modern world is trying to do things the old way, where everything is in books and is the same, and how that is just dumb. The fact that a book is completely devoid of logic and logical reasoning should tell you something. The last thing in the world a young person is looking for is a book that tells them how to live their life. This is a horrible waste of time, and I hope it never gets published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book, as with most of his work, is pretty boring and the writing itself is a bit lacking. The story is very well done in terms of pacing, but the character development is pretty meh.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book had me thinking for the first hour about what I'd do in his shoes.   That is, I'd give the book one star because it was interesting but also because it would give me a good idea of the kind of guy who would take up the fight against a tyrant.  What a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really like this book. It was basically a textbook on how to break into porn.   It had so many bad examples and mistakes that I could barely take it seriously.  The best examples of how to make it in porn were from porn stars who are actually successful in the industry, which was frustrating, because it would have made more sense to copy the successful examples from the bad examples rather than actually try to become successful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I went in with high hopes, but was let down. My expectations of the book being better than the two movies and three TV series I've seen have been set way too high. However, as with any book, once you get through the beginning, you can't go back and can't make it better. For the most part, it is not a good read. I think I liked the idea that the writer was trying to tell a good story, but not so much that it would make for an enjoyable read. Overall, I would recommend this as an enjoyable and entertaining book to listen to for an hour or so, but I doubt I will ever get through it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was awful. Not a single line of dialogue made me think "I'd like to read more of this". It was a book that just was not worth reading at all. I hate to say this as a reviewer, but I wish I had not bothered to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall it was good, just not as good as I would have expected, I'd have preferred a bit more mystery in it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As I read this book, I couldn't help but wonder what happened to the book's editor. Her name is Susan Pape and I believe she was the editor who put this out. I understand she had some reservations with the style of the book (the plot was a bit thin) but then again, I just reread this book and I can't help think that there was some sort of editing snafu.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this before and had the opportunity to purchase it for a great price. But, this book just wasn't for me. I liked the idea behind it, but I didn't enjoy it. The characters were likable, but that's about the only thing I felt I was interested in at the end of it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. In conclusion, I give this book a B
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was soooooo hard to read that I only got 3 pages in because I kept having to stop and restart it. If you love Harry Potter, please be warned.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book as a class and found it quite boring. It's a good summary of some of the basic tenets of quantum mechanics, but it's more of a textbook on the subject, and the physics it provides is pretty elementary. I'd recommend the textbook by Heisenberg instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The cover of this book reminds me of a terrible high school yearbook picture, which I would've thrown out in shame had it not been for my own memories of that year. It made me think of that one picture of my ex-best friend from junior high that I always thought I had forgotten and looked at every now and again.  The writing is so terrible that I could've just kept looking at it as the book progressed and the ending just made me want to throw it across the room. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I purchased this book is so I could read the synopsis of the book. I am really glad I purchased the book before I read the actual book.   It was fun to look at and find the interesting things in it but I just couldn't get into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It took a while to read this book, but it was worth the wait. This book was the basis for the movie, and i have to say it was one of the best books i've ever read. A lot of my friends got into the film of the movie from this book and i was really sad to see it fail, as i really enjoyed the book. So in the end i have a feeling that this book is a disappointment, because the movie was pretty good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read more than 5 of these and they never give me anything I can't find on amazon.com.   This is one of those books that I read because it was the only one available. I did not find the information of the "marijuana" or its effects to be interesting or useful at all.  I didn't get much benefit from this book but it was still worthwhile to have it in the library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall I was really disappointed. I was so happy that this was coming from a book that's been on my to-read list for many years.   The premise was super interesting, the characters were all so likable and the writing style was perfect.  Unfortunately the story devolves into cliché and it becomes really hard to care about any of the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good, short and engaging history of American-Israel relations but it's missing a few important points that would have made it much more entertaining. For example, a number of important events of the 19th century were not even mentioned, including the American entry into World War I. It also skips several important historical events that would be interesting to read about, including American-British relations during World War II, the US decision to support Israel in the 1967 war and the Israeli nuclear program.   The book includes some important facts, such as the American support of the Balfour Declaration in the early part of the 20th century, but that was it. The only important issue is the role of the US government, but in this case the US role was minimal. The real subject of the book is the evolution of US-Israel relationships, and I really felt that this is what the book was about. I would like to see more good books on the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's a very short description and very little else.   It's not an adventure story, and it isn't a story about a person.  I have no idea what the plot is, and as a reader I could do a better job. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is great! The only problem I had with this book was that it was pretty boring.   I really wish this book had more depth to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book about the one-man war against the United States.  I like to learn about other people's struggles but this book was so dry and tedious that I gave up halfway through.  The author does an incredible job at making his subjects interesting and then gives them nothing else to work with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been out for a while, and it doesn't live up to the hype. I have an IQ of 180 and a Ph.D in psychology.   I was pretty sure I would enjoy this book, but I was really surprised.  For all the praise I've given this book over the years, I am not sure I agree with many of the reviews that are so harsh.  I am, however, glad I took the time to read this. I just wish this book would have been given a chance in college in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this for my 8 year old son and he loved it. But then the chapters he liked changed from the end of the book. It got repetitive, and the characters were the same every chapter. The only good thing was when he was at the beach and read about the ocean. However, I was frustrated that after the third chapter, he read the same thing he had read before.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to love this book, I really did.  The idea behind the story intrigued me.  Unfortunately, I could only get through the first few chapters because I kept having to put it down and get back to it.  While I did enjoy the book, my enjoyment was marred by the fact that the story started off great and never quite managed to find it's footing.  Overall, a very good story with a promising premise. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was very hard to read because it was very, very boring. There was nothing really exciting about it, no plot, no development. It was all about the main character and his struggles to find love. It's just a very, VERY boring story.    ( April 15, 2013, 5:17 PM ) I bought this book a few months ago, and I'm only just getting through it.  I read the reviews and thought the premise sounded great: a college student (the narrator) tries to find true love.  The problem is, he has absolutely no idea what love is.  I would love to read a novel with a heroine that was an actual person.  What a shame that such a good book didn't get read because of poor marketing, poor book design, and poor marketing tactics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. It was boring and repetitive. I don't know if it is due to the lack of character development or because the author doesn't know how to write a character that is interesting enough to keep reading.   It is hard to read an 80 page book in less than an hour and not get frustrated.  I am disappointed to read a book this bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is okay, but the way he manages to convey all the twists and turns is a bit of a slog.   I enjoyed it, and maybe I just wasn't good enough at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was pretty interesting, but in the end I found it very hard to get into and was disappointed. The pacing was just wrong. It was really hard to understand the characters' motivations, and it took me a lot of time to really get to know them. And the ending... it just felt like the end!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a fun read, then this is not the book for you. I would recommend this book for anyone who is into comics, or is interested in some pretty unique stories that most people wouldn't think of. However, I would have liked to have read more of the other stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read in my life. It is so bad that it is actually funny. But, the worst thing about this book, is that the characters are such flat and generic characters that it really makes this book unbearable. I know this is a collection of novellas, but I didn't like any of the stories because the characters were such bland and uninteresting. I feel that a good story is more than just a plot, but more than a mere set of characters that are only fleshed out and developed in the story. A good story should have at least the same amount of depth, realism, and intelligence, as its characters. This book is absolutely pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book but it was just too much information in one book. I read a book on the topic before and it was a lot easier to digest.    There are so many great and interesting questions and topics covered in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing to do with me, yet I have to admit I kept coming back for more.   The author makes a very strong case that many popular contemporary genres (romance, mystery, and detective fiction in particular) are based on the conventions of historical fiction, and therefore they are flawed.  This is true in all the genres in which the author has dealt with, and to make this argument he had to invent a whole new genre.  In his "history of crime fiction", the author claims that historical fiction can't tell the whole story, and that the genres of detective fiction and romance are the best ways to tell the story of how the world became what it is now.  However, what I found really interesting was that the author takes this logic a step further, and says that this "history" of crime is the story that is most important. He argues that romance writers are not doing the work of historical novelists by writing novels, and hence, their novels have no redeeming social function.   If he really is right, I'd like to know what he thinks makes a good detective novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to find this book. I've been wanting to read the series for years and now I have the opportunity.   The premise is excellent.  I can't wait to read what the author does next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think this is a bad thing, it's a very interesting and fun book, but the book is very confusing to me, especially when it comes to the part about the aliens. I think that the alien society in general is really interesting, and the aliens are also very interesting. There is something very wrong with the alien culture, which is why it has a problem that they need to be cured. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was well written for about 80 pages, but I was never really interested in this book after that.   It was a pretty quick read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very strange book. While I don't find it as weird as I thought I would, I'm a little puzzled by how the author could feel that a book is 'wrong' when I don the same book and it is exactly as I expected and expected. I've tried out numerous other works by the author but I'm just not feeling it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very well written book with some valuable insights about being a female. I enjoyed it, but it got off track at times. The "cunningness" of this book is not in the fact that it gives some tips and tricks, but rather in its actual examples, which are very insightful and helpful. I would read it again, especially if I didn't like the first one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," "I Am Legend," and "Tower of Guns," but "The Dark Tower" is by far the worst.   The action is fantastic, and there is a decent plot (at least the first third of the book), but the prose is the worst part of the experience.  This book is nothing more than a huge waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my son. I got it as a paperback and I am very disappointed.    The illustrations are great.  The story line is well done.  My only complaint is that the book is over 50 pages and that the pictures take up too much of the page.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The "tough love" treatment does not work.  My boyfriend and I had an emotional and relationship breakdown.  The book seemed like it could have helped us.  He and I are still together and have had our ups and downs but now the ups and down are more positive.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an English teacher in a high-needs school, and this book is nothing more than a very poor effort at a 'truest' version of Shakespeare.  The authors did not even bother to learn the language well and, in my opinion, they make Shakespeare's plays look as if they were written by someone who had a good idea, but no experience, in language.  They are poorly edited (I'm not going to mention any of the obvious mistakes made by the author, such as inconsistent word choice or inconsistent spelling), poorly written, and contain many obvious mistakes and omissions.  While this book's length does allow it to be a good exercise in literary analysis and historical accuracy, I would not recommend this book to anyone who has any experience with Shakespeare or language, and would not read this book in class. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As my wife and I had just finished reading the novel "The Girl on the Train" by Paula Hawkins, we were both excited about reading the book in general, but our excitement quickly turned to frustration with the pacing of the book. The author does an excellent job telling a story in a way that most readers (including myself) can relate to, but the way the book was told was so poorly organized and presented that it really made the book harder to follow.   A lot of the plot is left unresolved in the final third, but it seems like Hawkins' main purpose is to build suspense and excitement for a second book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a huge fan of fantasy.   When I heard that I should get the books before they're sold, I went on a reading binge. I picked up this book and just couldn't put it down. The beginning was ok, but then I started to see the holes in the story.  There were a lot of loose ends.  I'm just glad I got this book before the hype wore off and the price went up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to this book. The prologue caught my attention: " This is a book I think any reader of literature and fiction who wants to expand his or her mind, be more creative, and deepen their understanding of the world, will find interesting and inspiring"  ... and sure enough the book is full of the same types of books and topics I read in university, such as the philosophy of language, cognitive science, the importance of the senses in understanding the world around us, philosophy of mind, linguistics and the like.       However, as I said, the subject matter didn't interest me that much.  If this was written by a person who has read most of the works of the above authors, they would have gone a different direction; but as it is, it doesn't really interest me at all.  It doesn't have that much depth and there isn't a real "master" to point you to, so there is no real "hook".   In my opinion, this book is mostly "just a collection of interesting facts", which sounds pretty boring.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book has no sense of logic at all, and I don't understand why I even bothered to read it. The protagonist does not even seem aware of the ridiculousness of his actions, and the dialogue is incredibly annoying. I have a hard time believing I paid $25 for this stupid book."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is okay, but the writing is awful.   Very cliché. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book didn't do anything for me. The story was boring and the book itself was just a bit of fluff.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just wanted to give a bad review of this book. I read this book before finishing reading the other book I wanted to read but was so busy that I didn't have time to finish it. This book has some very good ideas, but then it goes downhill. I had no idea that there were so many other people who were doing the same thing and doing better than I was. So my only solution was to just stop reading this book altogether.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very disappointed in this book. I was very hopeful that it would be interesting. I expected something different.  I read it in about 2 hours and couldn't wait to read the other three. I wish the author had at least waited for the second and third books before publishing the first.   Somewhere in the middle of the third book, I ran into an interesting problem in a certain area: There is a difference between writing that makes you think and writing that just makes you want to do it.  So my first attempt at a critique of the first book was the following:  The characters are flat. The protagonist is a child.  The story is too hard to follow.  It's too much like one of those teen books.  My second attempt was: The characters don't like each other.   This is the problem. The story revolves around a couple of children who are being raised by their uncle.  Their uncle is not a good parent.  He is selfish, unreasonable, and does not give them the time they need.  But he gives them money.    And this is the thing that makes the book interesting: they want to go on adventures and the uncle keeps them from doing it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The cover of this book looked great! The book itself was not so great, though, it was ok I guess but it really didn't interest me much.    I had my hopes up for this book, I really had, and I read it in two sittings, but it just wasnt enough. I didn't like the character's development, and there were parts where I was like "oh, what the fuck?" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book is a total waste of time and money. I don't know why people continue to buy these books but it's a very expensive lesson to learn that will only apply to a few people. I bought this book because of a comment that one of the authors made in a recent blog post but I have to say I don the whole thing is just plain wrong. The whole thing has been written from the perspective of someone who has had an emotional breakdown but from the outside looking in, the story doesn't add up. I've heard of other similar "How to" books that were extremely helpful in helping someone who was struggling with a negative thought process and that is exactly what this book was written as. I wish I could give it 1 star but unfortunately I can't. This was a waste of money and time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about how to be the most fucked up person in the world. So much so that you would be fucking your neighbors if you were not that fucked up. It takes a special kind of character to read such a book in a world of horror and despair. I'm still reeling from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is terrible! I can't even get through the first page without having to throw the book on the floor. The cover looks great though and the book's text is good. The only issue I have with the book is the poor formatting.    This was a fun book.  We are getting ready to start a new book project this fall and needed a new reference. I found this to be extremely useful and informative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is sloppy, and there is almost no sense of story line.  This book has no plot. There is nothing to care about.   I don't like the use of "nope" (as the character's name) in the first half of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first five books in this series have been nothing more than a series of good books that I'm glad I bought. The sixth one in particular is a big disappointment.   I expected better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not have a single redeeming quality. The main character is a sociopath and the story is completely unbelievable. The plot consists of two people in an apartment who are supposed to be friends. The author uses an extremely thin plot device called the "friendship exchange" that is just too much of a crutch for a first time author. It does not come into play until later in the book, making it completely unnecessary.   My biggest problem with the book was the lack of plot.  I also have to admit, it's a book I wouldn't be interested in if I was not a die hard science fiction reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no idea what it is talking about, and there is no real reason to believe that it will teach people anything in this day and age, much less in a timely fashion.   The book is an interesting and informative read, but it really should not be read by anyone who wants to be smarter than the average person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a first book, it is good, but the main characters are flat.  The last chapter is good but it has a twist at the end which I did not see coming.  I would not recommend this book for children's age 10-12. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, the author clearly does not have a clue about how to do the science. He fails to explain why some things are bad and others are good.  As an educator, this book made me cringe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a book that I want to read again.  It was just too difficult for me to understand. It was written for people who were too lazy to read a book on a subject that they knew nothing about, like physics.  I wish that there was something I could have done to explain things better, but, in the end, I just had to put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would highly recommend this book to a friend who wants a good book on "biblical womanhood" and doesn't care much for the Bible or feminism.   However, I think the author has overstated the case.    Many of the book's assertions about women are simply wrong, such as her assertion that women never "have to be beaten" because they don't need to be.  It's all a matter of timing, and there is little evidence of "female submission" or the "female power dynamic" in ancient Israelites.  I wish her had shown more historical research to prove her point, as her claims about the "Biblical Woman" are often just plain wrong.  However the book is really useful for anyone interested in Biblical interpretations of biblical stories (that's where I was originally looking for information)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does not teach anything new, or even interesting, I am afraid. The main reason I found it interesting was that the author did not take a "popular" course. The author is clearly passionate about the subject but there is no depth to the material. I know that I would have enjoyed learning this if my teacher offered it or if I had to learn the material the hard way from a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is terrible, it's one of those books you want to pick up and read.   But then you get to the good part, and it turns out not to be what you thought it would be, and you hate everything about the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so badly written and the main characters are so unlikeable that I almost felt bad reading it. I don't think I would recommend it. It's just so hard to like these characters. Even with their flaws, the book still has a lot of good parts. However, the author's grammar and writing really take a beating in this book. I would definitely recommend this book if you hate bad books or you like good people.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So, if you wanted to make money, this book would definitely help you! If you're going to be self-publishing your own books, it is VERY important that you understand what kind of work is involved, especially the types of things that will not help your book.   If you are going to self-produce a book, then you will need to hire professional help, as this book is WAY overpriced.  I have written an eBook, but it was more expensive to produce and I can't give it a higher rating than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my son, who is a big fan of the Hunger Games series and my husband's favorite series.   This book was much better than expected, I got all the characters right, but the story itself, just didn't click.  The characters are very similar to those in the books, they're just not very interesting.  They're all very predictable and one-dimensional.  It seems like the author has spent way too much time researching the history of this world and then just comes up with a plot.  I'm a huge fan of A Song of Ice and Fire and I'm excited to watch the TV show, but this book didn't really do anything for me, and I know the fans of the series are going to be disappointed with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was pretty bad. There were parts that seemed to follow the style of a college lecture with a lot of bickering, but the writing was so clunky and incoherent that I felt like I had to reread parts of the book over and over to make it all make sense. My brother was really surprised at how much time I spent on this book and didn't even like it. If you are trying to pass a final on a college level you will find this book a great way to pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is terrible! As an adult, I'm not sure how a writer could come up with such abysmal ideas. The plot is extremely cliché and is poorly written. The characters are dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of this book was the introduction. It shows the history of the idea that God wants people to be able to control their sex drive, a belief that is based on science but is often held by very religious people.   It's unfortunate, but it's what happens when you read a non-religious book.  Praise for the book: "I liked it so much that I got a copy. A book like this should not just be accessible to the scientifically inclined, it should be accessible as well to anyone interested in human sexuality, and I found this a good place to start.     It is written in a very engaging style, so that even the non-science inclined should be able read the book and learn.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the concept of sexual desire."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the first to tell me that there is no such thing as a free lunch.  I did not understand this for some reason but I do now.   I got the sense that if I spent my money on things that I would like to get a "free" taste of they would not be good at all.  The author has since corrected the mistake (you can read about it in the original review) but it was pretty hard to come back from that one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been trying to finish a new series for a few years, but my progress keeps getting stopped by the fact that I can't seem to find the time to finish it.   So, I ordered this book.  My problems are similar to those of others: it is so full of characters, but the story does not move the way I want it to.  It's an interesting premise, but it's too many people involved to really get into.  If it weren't for a minor flaw (that one chapter is over a week late) this book might be worth buying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've heard all the praise for this book.   It was fun, well written, well researched, and well told.  There were two points that bothered me though.  One is that he was only trying to give a "rational" argument for "the Christian faith".  That's it!  I have yet to find a good discussion of religion in a "fantastical" story.  The other is that the book was written in the 70's so his arguments are dated.  He was also pretty harsh about the "atheist" point of view, which made me mad.  I'm glad I read it, but I have no confidence that a rational religious believer is possible.  I have to disagree about one thing though: the religious point of views presented in this story aren't very compelling.  While some of the examples and the "theories" that the characters use are good, there are other points of view that don't really convince me or convince others either. What the hell is wrong with that one character, anyway?  Overall, I enjoyed the story. I am a believer but I'm an agnostic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I never really finished this one. I just thought it would be interesting to know why people go to the trouble of building things like these. I didn't know why they go to so much trouble. I did learn a lot about materials and how to build things, but I have no idea what my next step should be.   This book is about an idea about living and being alive and things. If you think that is interesting, you will likely enjoy it. But I am not interested in that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book! I enjoyed the stories of the characters and the illustrations in the book. But as for the actual writing of the book, it was way to slow and tedious. I would rather just read my own books. I do not like this kind of book, since I read them for entertainment.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be an excellent introduction to the field of the psychoanalytic method and was very impressed. It did not, however, provide the depth and understanding needed to truly understand the psychological aspects of Freud. I found the author to be quite ignorant of Freud and his theory.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just wanted to write a positive review of this book for myself as it has a very clear and concise story line.  There is a clear connection between the characters and it is very easy to follow.  Unfortunately, this story line does not hold up over the course of the book.  I felt very little emotional connection to these characters.  It was very hard for me to connect with the characters other than because I'm a reader of his book. However, I did find that the main character has more than a few emotional issues.  As I've mentioned before, I don't usually rate books on the emotional impact they have on me.  This story line, however, made me feel very sad and disconnected with the character.  The story seems to be building up to a good ending, but the final act of the story left me feeling that I didn't get what was supposed to happen.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped that there would be some subtlety to this book. I mean, there's a difference between "you should" and "I would" or "I've heard."  I was expecting something like the first half of the first book, in which the main character is trying to figure out what she wants from life. Instead, she's stuck with a vague notion that she should be happy, and that she's unhappy only because she doesn't know what happiness means. I was actually kind of amused by the "what" aspect of this book (you'll notice that I say "instead" rather than "to" a lot in my reviews).  So when I came to the part of the book where the main characters decide on how to start over, I was like, "Oh, that's just the beginning. I just need to see how things turn out after that."  But I have to say, I'm really not sure that this is going to turn out to be a good book for me, since I have a bad habit of reading a book that is basically just a set-up for the next book, and then finding out that the book isn't really anything like the one I was thinking about when I was waiting for the second book.  So, this might be a book I'm going to give away as a freebie to someone, just so they can read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think the book is bad, per se.   The problem I have is that the author, while not wrong in everything, comes off as pretty much the same as most modernists I've seen.  He writes like a high school student.  I thought he was trying to make a point about how we are a culture that celebrates conformity and conformity is good.  But it seems the only real thing he thinks he's saying is that we are boring.  The fact that he also has a love for the music and art that are "trendy" doesn't help him much either.  This might be a good book for a college book club if they actually bothered to do any research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main issue with this book is that it is completely unreliable and the author is not a good writer. I have a problem with books that are written as if they are facts and presented as if true. If I didn't know the source material, I would doubt the facts. This book is more than questionable and the information that the author presents has been debunked. I would suggest you do your own research or if you cannot find out information on the internet, at least find a reputable book to read. I am sure there are plenty of books out there that could have been written by the author, but instead the author chose to base their book on what he claims is fact, when the facts are not true.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had been looking forward to reading this book for years.   It finally got to me this year and I couldn't stop thinking about it.  There are some great examples in this book (that I have heard about from some of my friends) but I think that the book is very much based on the author's own experiences and it's not very helpful in dealing with real problems.  I would like to see more of a realistic approach to dealing with problems that are beyond one's control.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is really terrible.   I hate the main character because she is too arrogant, selfish and greedy.  It's really hard for her to get anyone's support. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book contains too much technical detail, and the narrative is tedious. The illustrations are well-done but often useless. The narrative lacks character development. The conclusion is too unsatisfying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because it is advertised as an advanced book on algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. But in order to learn the ideas it actually explains, I had to skip a couple of chapters. I also had a hard time understanding some of the "proofs" that the author presented. For example, in the proof that the diagonal of a unit rectangle is the smallest unit rectangle, I just didn't see it and had to go back to the proofs he provided in the text.   A few of the proofs were rather "obvious" and obvious errors made me have to go to the other proofs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read three copies of this, and the reviews of this book are really negative:  This book was a disaster - not the first I've read about this type of research, but it was the worst. The book is filled with mistakes and not very good results. There are no details about what is in the study, or even whether the research is published or not.   The book assumes that if it works it's important.  This is completely wrong.  The only studies I found were from the past twenty years, which was interesting.  Unfortunately, even if it worked it would not be of any use to you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book.  It is too simplistic, lacks the story depth, is unrealistic and boring, does not live up to the hype of being the first "torture porn" in a good long while, and even though I was expecting it to be as bad as the first.  The plot is pretty much non-existent, the heroine is boring and has little development and the story itself seems to be made for a few minutes of thought and reading, not an entire novel.  I was excited to read the second one as it was advertised as the "best of the best" and this was not it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the end, I got what I came for, a very enjoyable read, if a little dry at times. The story's quite well done and I enjoyed the characters, who are all intriguing, especially Mr. Piggott, who is a little too perfect.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was terrible. The main character is a girl with cerebral palsy.  She is forced into the sex industry and suffers the physical consequences.   In the end I was just sad because this book is nothing more than a sad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a bit of a misspelling. I expected a bit more from this book. There were so many good ideas in it but no real action and the last 2/3 of the book was really boring. The author makes you want to read more but doesn't even give you enough time to start. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was not worth the time.   I have listened to the first four books in the series and have now gotten through the first three.  The plot was predictable and, more often than not, was contrived.  My two favorite characters were introduced and were not developed at all.  In fact, it seems like their stories went backwards and were only referenced in later books.  This series is an author who is just not very good at writing.  I don't want to continue reading but it would have been nice if the author would have given us some more insight into this world that he created. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book hoping that I would enjoy it.   Instead, I found this book incredibly boring.  I read the synopsis and thought that this book would be a fun read. I was wrong.  The only interesting character was Mr. Evers, the character that was described in the book's subtitle.  For the majority of the book, I had no interest in what was going on and was more interested in Mr. Izzard's story.  It seemed that the story was written in an attempt to "catch" the young adult audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book while on a two week work trip in Italy. I've just gotten back from a four month visit to Italy and spent a few hours there. This book, while a good primer on the history of the area, was lacking in some important areas. One, the geography and the culture are a bit thin and forgettable. They are more about history and culture than anything else. Also, in my opinion, this is too dense for someone who is a fan of history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those book where the writing is good but the storytelling is terrible. If you want a good book about an important issue, read The Unwinding: The Untold Story of the Great Depression. I'm really happy I read this but I won't be re-reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is filled with inconsistencies and contradictions which make this book very hard to follow and a bit pointless. I find most of the characters to be very one-note and boring, which makes the book rather pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For all the talk about getting good reviews this book is nothing but trash. The whole thing was so poorly written, I would not have spent time to read it, but instead would have bought some cheap novels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a great book for the price I paid.  Unfortunately the story and characters are very weak.   There were a few great bits but overall the book is a dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife and I took the two hour drive to see this, because it was advertised as "historical fiction", but instead it was more like a dry humor novel with a heavy dose of historical fiction thrown in.   The novel is told from the point of view of a young woman, Elizabeth, who at the age of 17 has just been married to a man she really didn't like at all.  She tries to live her life as if her husband wasn't around, and her actions are completely at odds with her personality, which is kind of pathetic in a book like this, but there's not a lot you can do about it. She's a very weak character, and she does nothing to redeem herself.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that the characters are a little more interesting, but overall this is a mediocre story that I couldn't finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know who created this book, but the concept and writing is terrible. It made me feel bad about myself after finishing it, and the concept is pretty stupid.   It had too many clichés to be believable, and was filled with pointless dialogue that didn't add anything to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book by an unknown author to be very interesting, but the writing is awful and the story has nothing interesting to it.   The author claims to have created a book with stories of aliens, but instead he just tells stories of people doing dumb stuff.  I don't know if this was intended to be a novel, but it didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was not a good read. I liked the cover but it is the inside that i will remember. This is not a great book. It could have been so much better if it was edited better. The book is about a young woman who goes to a party and gets a drunk call girl. She does not think he is good. It's about a guy who takes a chick to a big party and has her drink, but i don't think he knows if she has a good time or not. The only thing good about this book is that it is easy to understand and i will read the next one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading this book my mind has been re-oriented to thinking about the environment in which a given species will be living in the future and what they will need to be a part of the new world. In the beginning of this book, I expected to be blown away by the fact that a new species has not already developed. But the book was far too slow to get there.   I've already read a lot of ecology books and this one has been the most disappointing.  This book is a good introduction into the field and the concepts behind it.  It could have used some more examples and an explanation of some of the more complex ideas.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A typical urban fantasy novel. The magic system is interesting, but there are no really well developed characters.   The plot is also pretty typical fantasy in a lot of ways. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is too boring.   It should be an in between book that you can't help but read.  It is boring and boring. I didn't find anything really novel in it, although I did find some gems.  Overall, it is too bad that this is an uneventful book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it was fun and not boring. However, the humor is very forced, and the plot was pretty shoddy. I don't have a problem with this book at all, but the jokes were a bit hit and miss. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just don't understand why this book was written. I bought this book thinking it would be about a dog who loved to go to the beach. It is, in fact, a very sad and depressing book. It's not hard to understand what is wrong with this book. The author is just plain bad. I would recommend this book only if you are a dog lover.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the definition of a non-fiction book.  There is very little research and there is no real understanding of what the subject is about.  It's like a "history" book that you can read if you want to find out more about the British occupation of the Indian subcontinent.  I think a better title for this book might have been "The History of the World Through British Eyes" or something like that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not bad, but I think the author did a bad job of developing the book and was unable to write a coherent story.   I was disappointed because I really enjoyed reading the first two books in the series and the writing was good and consistent. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was a disappointment after I got into it. I really liked the first half of the book, but the rest is a rehash of what we already know and not much more. I got so excited about the new technology in the future when I read this book but I was very disappointed. If you are looking for the next great sci fi novel, do not read this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great story with an unbelievable ending that could have been so much better. I really liked how the story ended, but how the final chapter was handled was a shame.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to a beginner to the language. The grammar used is too strict.   It does not cover the grammar we need to know in order to be able to communicate in a language.  This book does not give a lot of practical examples. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A really good book, if not for a small mistake or two, would have been perfect.   I can see why it was originally published as a trade:  It's a great little book that is easy to get into, and contains some very good ideas.  If you don't care about the magic systems, then this book would be perfect. But if you do, or if you are looking for a new version of the book, then it is a bit of a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very bad.   It's the type of bad that makes me wish I were dead.  But you know what?   There are still some good points.  I really like the way the characters in this book behave.  And the writing is pretty good.  It has some great quotes from the authors.  There is one that is especially interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only problem I had with this book is that there are no other authors I could have read besides Mr. Gogol. Not only did he write a novel about an elderly Russian widow, but he is a brilliant writer. He has a talent for being able to write about anything in a vivid, interesting, and sometimes humorous way. I liked the book, but I can't say I had as much fun reading it as I thought I would.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that saved me from reading this book is that it was written by a friend of mine.   This book is not only a poor review of "The Book of Mormon" but is moreso, a poor attempt to review the book of Mormon from the perspective of a Christian.  The author tries to give the impression that there is no "secret" that the LDS Church has that the rest of the world does not know about.  Unfortunately, I can't see anything that would explain why the LDS church is so unique, especially considering how many people are raised in religious groups where everyone knows the same thing.  What I really wanted to get across in this review was that this book really doesn't make much of an argument other than "this is the reason why the Church is unique".   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is so bad, it's unbelievable. This book is so badly written that the characters and story are not memorable or even realistic.  It seems as if every single one of them has their own agenda that is not really justified. The main character, who is a virgin, and all the male characters are just as weak and stupid. Not even their personalities change. Their only difference is that the male character is less selfish, and they all have problems in their pasts. All they want is to get some young and inexperienced girl to fall in love with them and that is the story of this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I was having trouble remembering all the names of the characters. The only thing I was really interested in is what is a "Tyrants." Anyway, the story about a woman who is in love with a tyrant is kind of boring. The characters who are supposed to be good characters are just kind of annoying. And the writing style is really boring. Also, I hated the fact that the book was kind of long, about 250 pages long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main characters are annoying and the book is not enjoyable.   Not much of a story and I think the writing is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is probably my favorite of all of the books I've ever read. I've read most of the rest of the series as well but never finished this one.   The writing and story are excellent and I can't wait to see what happens next.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a very enjoyable book, but if you're reading this review, then you already know that. It's been a while since I've read a new fantasy, so I was a little skeptical about this one, especially since it's the first book in a series (and one that's supposed to be the last). The characters are pretty cool, but I've been burned by this kind of series a lot, so it wasn't so much the characters, but rather the pacing. I can't find any reason to continue with this series, so maybe the next book will be better, but right now it feels like I'm treading water, and if the previous book was any indication, then I won't be interested in the last book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is dull and the writing is boring. I had expected something more with the supernatural elements but this book was boring and did not add anything to my understanding.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was interesting, but very long. It took a lot of time to get through. It was a real challenge. I had to do some re-reading to get it all, which was a lot slower than I expected. Overall, the information is well presented, but the length of the book is very daunting. Posted by John A at 8:40 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning, this book was really great, but as the main character grows, the plot gets more and more convoluted and less and less interesting.   It was fun until the last third or so, when the author starts telling the "twist."   I would've loved more development of the main characters or the plot, but there was something about the "Twist" that sucked the fun out of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is boring. The pacing is too slow. There was no point to the story. The only characters that got a lot of development were the two boys. It was so obvious in the beginning why they would be so opposed to one another. At first it was just that they were opposites, but then they started getting more and more interesting and real. But now, I'm thinking "why didn't I think of that?". This isn't a bad fantasy book, just an interesting one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My son was very excited about this book at first and he said it was so funny! It was just funny how he could go from one extreme to the other without realizing it. Then I started to notice him taking me to places he shouldn't go. Then he got bored and left. He's not too far from my age but I don't think he can comprehend the world, if it's even there. I had a hard time getting him to read to me because he just wants to see the funny things I do. And I hate the story about the girl's mom (in my opinion it's not the best). She has problems but her friends always help her. And then she has her own problems, with her husband, with the kids, with everyone. It's a shame this book came out when it did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The bad points are, as usual, numerous and many. The book is long (more than 500 pages), and the length often discourages the reader from reading all of the content.   For example, one chapter focuses entirely on a group of people who are in jail (which would have made more sense as a chapter dedicated to an individual character), and then another chapter is devoted to how the person has been treated by society and how that is affecting him/her, and then a third chapter is written about the character's attempts to make peace with God.  It's not as if these things aren't covered by other books on the topic. The author did not make the effort to cover them.    In addition, the author is often quite critical of religious institutions, making the reader wonder why this author doesn't write about other issues.  While I don't blame the author for these issues (I'm an atheist), it's not like she's covered the issues extensively either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story takes place in an apartment complex of over 100 flats, so you may end up living with other people. The plot takes a while to develop, but I could not get interested in the characters. The book also had a strange ending, not much happens and there is a big cliffhanger that doesn't seem to be answered. However, I could read more about the plot, which I think would have been interesting if not for the ending. I recommend this book for older teens and adults.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read!   I started this book hoping for something exciting and new but was left disappointed as it is the same old same old.   If you are a fan of the Star Trek universe this is not the book for you, not for a book you will want to keep your binder, not even for a Star Trek novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was terrible. I started reading it for the first time because the cover looked cool, but when I actually started reading, it just felt like I'd read something I wasn't very interested in. Not the best way to start a series (even if it was based on a well-loved book).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a pile of garbage. The story is a mess, the characters are all stereotypes, and the story itself is lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an interesting book and it could have been better but overall it is an informative book and not an engaging one. The only flaw is that the end is not as good as the beginning. However, this is a good read and you will learn more about the different methods used to build a high end video production business from it than you would from the author's own book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book not knowing if it was a "serious" book. It has the same problems as many other serious books I've read. I did my research before buying and learned a lot but it all just turns out to be the same old same old. This book is filled with errors, poor spelling and grammar, poor writing, and is just plain boring. This is a book I will just read for the experience of seeing how the characters are portrayed. No one seems to be able to connect with the main character, except for the characters around the main characters. It's hard to tell who is who. I've been looking for a good book about the occult and I was not happy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed with this book as a result of the many mistakes in grammar, writing style and style of writing. For starters, the authors have tried hard to make their book sound official and in a well researched fashion.   Unfortunately, they have managed to use a large number of facts and sources without citing where and in what manner they are used.  For example, a lot of material in the book is based on a talk given by the author at a conference and is also based on other published materials.  I believe the material should be sourced, but it seems the authors are making it up as they go along.  The main problem for me was that the author's arguments are so unconvincing.  At one point, the author says "People who use the term 'rape culture' can't identify the difference between 'rape' and'sexual violence'."  In context, the word is used to describe the fact that it's more common for men to be the victims of sexual assault than women. However, the problem with the author is that she tries to make this argument in a way that isn't contradictory with her claim that sexual violence is a problem among young men in Western society.  However, when the context is considered and it's clear the author has been taken out of context, I feel that it is simply too little, too late for her.  As I said above, the book needs some source material to back up its claims. It's like using your credit card statement to claim that you've bought a large amount of groceries. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe I bought this, and I'm glad I did.   It's like reading a bad thriller.  It is written by a woman who seems to have a strong interest in the subject, but she does not seem to understand it.  I have been on a quest to learn about my ancestry (which I know from family research was a bit of a pain) and have found nothing.  The book did not help me along.  My mother and my great grandmother are direct descendents of the Cherokee.  This is important to me, but I have to wonder if she actually understands that.  She never shows the Cherokees or their history, but we had to call the Cherokee Museum of History to get her information.  So much time and research go into researching your ancestry, and this is wasted on this poor excuse for a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read some very good books, and I have not been happy with them.  This one, however, I had hoped would be different.  I did not feel that it lived up to the hype (it has some nice moments), but I'm still a big fan of the author and his style, and will keep on reading.   Review was amazing: I bought this book as part of a giveaway. I had to wait for a month before I could read it. I'm glad I got it! I liked it.   Thank you so much, I'm sure this was just a fluke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so annoyed with this book. This book is full of bad ideas.    I really wanted to like it, but this book is just so bad.  I don't understand how this has not been discussed before.  This is such an incredibly bad book!   They start off by talking about the power of positive thinking and how it will make you happy, then they go on to explain how negative thinking will make people sad.  They even go so far as to say how we must always remember that we are "born bad" and therefore must strive to change it.    I understand the power that positive thinking has, but there is one thing I never understood.  How can someone who is "born" this way be so unhappy?   The book makes it sound as if every person is born with the wrong mindset and must work to change that.  But this is simply not true!  I was never happy as a child and I did not change it by wishing for something to happen or expecting something to be different.  It is a myth that everyone is born unhappy.  This book should be ignored. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was so dull that I didn't even want to start reading it. It was a complete waste of my time and money.   This is definitely NOT a game changer for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seems the author never wanted to write a book about his own life, he wanted to create a series of books about his life in the 20th century.   He never got around to writing this series, the last book was published years ago and was an extended essay on the nature of writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a great read. If you are a history lover and/or are interested in the Civil War era and want to learn more about the "War of Northern Aggression" than you will learn in any "encyclopedic" history book, this book is for you. The author really has a wealth of knowledge and is able to distill the historical facts from the many accounts in this "textbook" to form a cohesive narrative that is very easy to follow.   It would be a good book to have with any history book collection.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many books but this is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was an undergrad, this was the best book I read. But I read it back to back with "The Way of the Superior Man," and the writing quality on the second book is atrocious. I was also surprised that the author had to be a professor to write so well on these subjects.   The writing is fine, but there are several points where the book could have been trimmed: - I never found out exactly what the "right" attitude is toward women in a relationship, but it seemed to be whatever the guy wanted. It was also implied that it is better to be with a woman who is passive aggressive than with one who is assertive - the author doesn't seem to understand the concept of "openness," though this was made clear at the end of the book. He also wrote as if there are no women in college who are not married - even though many women are single and not married. (I also didn't understand why this was so common in books about college, given that I know of a woman whose husband dropped out of college.)  I think it would have been better to leave this book as is and to make it a part of a larger work on college women - not a short review of this book. - I found the conclusion a bit simplistic. (Not to mention, the author has a history of being very condescending towards women and men.)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an avid reader and have tried over 20 books in the genre (including many that I found "good" in the end). But, this one is just not worth my time.   The characters are poorly developed and don't develop at all.  The main character is very annoying, a girl who doesn't want anything to do with her friends and just wants to have a fun time. I thought, that at the beginning, that she wanted to do something "different" and be a "real person" with no expectations, but she didn't do that at all - at all!   There's no point where the story is trying to develop her character, except to have her spend her time "being a real person" and going on adventures.  I thought she would develop her friendship with the friends to some sort of end and have a nice happy ending, but that didn't happen.      
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard good things about this book from a friend, and since I didn't want to get something like this, I bought it on recommendation of a good friend.   This is a pretty good read, though.  I think it is great to hear good feedback from people who haven't yet experienced an addiction, especially in an addiction which has affected them so much.  In that respect, this book really hits home. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In all honesty I found the book not so much a book as a poorly written collection of essays. Not only did it take several weeks to read (because I wanted to catch up on the essays I had missed when I started), but also it took so many pages to put together. It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle that you can never really put together, but there are pieces that you are sure are in there.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was ok but a bit of a chore to read. The story was pretty good but there were a few parts I was confused about and I couldn't get past them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, you can't just get through a book and say "Wow, I love this!" It's so easy to get swept up by the story and forget that you're just reading it. I really wish it had been longer.  I really enjoyed the worldbuilding that was in here, but I didn't feel anything for the characters at all.  They weren't interesting, and they weren't likable.  They were just there and we're supposed to just believe that they are characters that need to be saved.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are going to read this book, you can do worse than to go and buy the other three in the series that are better in every way. If you must read this, just be careful about what you look at. I have a feeling that you'll think you're on your way to the library to look at the book you've just been told you'll love, but you won't. The characters are too well written, and they have their own quirks and problems that you can learn from, and you get to know them better as the story progresses. I think if you're not one of those who are in love with the main characters, then you'll probably not be too into this book. I know that's a big statement to make for a book like this, but I'd like to believe that if someone really likes the characters, it won't turn out like this book does for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very unfortunate that the authors, as well as the editor and the public, have been misled by this book. I was hoping to find the wisdom of the ages in this work. It was a real disappointment. The book had the opposite effect I was looking for, and it left me feeling a little stupid.   I was really hoping for some kind of historical and philosophical insight on how the Church became the Church, but all I got was the usual drivel about "the Lord's prayer."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed to find this book as I had been looking forward to reading it.   The plot is somewhat weak and the prose is not as clear and easy to understand as in some of the other books from this series.  The characters feel like they were written in the late 1970's or early 1980's and the writing style and grammar is very dated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book. I found it to be dull and hard to get into and not all that interesting. I guess the idea was that you can't understand everything about a person with the help of the novel, but it just didn't work out that way. A bad book.- I found that the main character was boring and unlikable. He didn't seem like much of a person at all. I think the other characters were just as bland as the main one, but this one was just an extra. - There is no romance in this book -
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love my Kindle. I have tried the   all and   the new version. However, this   is really not   any better.   It's worse! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best book I've read in a very long time.   It's really about the importance of education, the difference between what is real and what is fiction, the power of a good book. It's not that it's about sex, or drugs or religion or politics (though those things are mentioned and the author acknowledges them and offers explanations and suggestions for their removal from the novel), but more in terms of the fact that this book is about learning to be a good person.  And it has that.  This book is amazing, and should be in every high school's library and every college's collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good story, but the writing is bad.   The characters are not real people, and the story itself is poorly written.  My friends and I read this book in my free time when I had a bad case of the flu and couldn't go to school. We've finished it, and we all agreed that it was not worth our time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a bit put off by the title (which is really a very silly one) and the tone of the narration, but overall I liked the book a lot. While the author tried to explain the science of astrology, the story was not very well developed. I'm not sure if the book was supposed to be a treatise on astrology or simply a fanciful tale, but the latter was pretty much a wash for me. The story took me a while to catch up with, which was the most disappointing aspect, because I really liked the idea of astrological analysis.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing in this book is poor, there is nothing worth reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of science fiction and fantasy books, but this book was a disappointment.  The science is fine, but everything else was just wrong.  From the first sentence, this book feels to me like it is trying to do the hard science with the easy magic.  For instance, the author talks about how light is one of the greatest inventions in the history of mankind.  But she just makes it a magical being that can change the shape and the color of anything and then has a scientist use his mind to build a machine to duplicate the effect?  Not only that, the book also makes the same mistake when it tries to explain quantum mechanics with light.  I get it, this is a fantasy novel, but you should at least be able to come up with an explanation for what your magic can do that makes sense.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed in this book. It was well-written but could have been shorter, and the plot is very generic and repetitive.   The fact that so many of the characters and settings are completely fictional is not a plus for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a 1/5 and, well, let me explain why.   The beginning was interesting.  But then we see the narrator writing the story from the point of view of the woman and the man.  I couldn't get past that.  The character development (a woman getting ready to leave the man for a man)  was really boring and not all that original.  And then he just goes full-blown psycho and becomes a real psycho (just kidding).  The author should've stopped writing the book and started a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a teenager I read "Judaism's Great Debate" by Alan Jacobs and "In the Year of Living Biblically" by Samuel L. Bronson. I was captivated by their stories, which I found very entertaining and thought-provoking.  It was only as I read more about them in later years that I learned the authors' religious beliefs were decidedly nontheistic. It is sad to realize so many intelligent people are willing to deny the undeniable fact that God exists. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say this is the worst book  I've ever read.  It starts out slow and I just couldn't figure out what was going on. The plot didn't make any sense, the characters were unoriginal,  the writing was unoriginal and annoying.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only flaw I see is that they didn't include any information on the books, other than to say that they were "The first English translations of classic Greek tragedies". If you want to read a classic Greek tragedy and don't read Greek, you could do much worse than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book. The writing is good. This is an easy book to get through, even if it is a very long book. This isn't a short story but a very large story with many pages to go through. The story was interesting. If you love Sherlock Holmes this is an interesting story to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was very disappointing as a historical novel. I was hoping for some more action. It was pretty much the only action that took place in the whole novel.   The ending was unsatisfying to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this a good rating because I enjoyed the book overall.  However, the writing style of the book is terrible.  This is the best thing to happen to the genre of romance because before now, I could read books written in a good way.  Now I have to buy books from authors who do not know what they are doing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited about this book when it was released. I think the reason it did not live up to its hype is because it was written by a woman.  There is not a good male character in the book at all.   It took me a while to get into this book.  It did not leave me bored, but it did leave me a little confused. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have listened to this audio book several times. It does sound good in some places, and I love the concept of "talking to your body", which is what this book tries to tell us. However, the author does not present any hard science in this book, and is completely in the realm of spiritual psychology. This book was so bad that I felt like the author had been drunk during his presentation. At least he made a good attempt at being entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book. I had read about its existence, but never got around to trying it.  It seemed interesting. I got what I expected. I thought it would be interesting.   The characters were well developed. The world they live in is intriguing and exciting. However, I wasn't interested in the plot, and it did not develop, or seem to grow in any way.  I found myself wondering why they needed to fight.  What was the point?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this in the spring of 1997 and didn't like it at all. The "plot" didn't interest me, the protagonist seemed dull, and the ending was so abrupt that I couldn't help but think that I was reading the synopsis, which stated that "the book is a series of letters that describe how the author's father was murdered in the 1980s." I also found it odd that he used the name "James" for his character, since I knew it was the same person as the main character's son. If he wanted to keep his secret, he should have called him James, not John.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got the book expecting a standard thriller. The pacing was terrible. Every scene seemed to take a whole chapter to get to. The story was also incredibly stupid at times. The main character (the only real character) is a total asshole who's constantly being lied to, betrayed, and tricked by the "good guys." There's only about 4-6 pages where there's a real scene that makes me really care about the characters. The first half of the book was good. It's still good. But the second half was nothing to write home about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is boring.   I've seen this type of book more than once, and although I like science fiction in general, this book made no sense to me.  I had no idea how the "science" was being explained.  It was too technical for my liking, and even though the authors claimed it was a parody, it's not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was skeptical at first that this was going to be a good book but after reading it I came to see why others rated it at a 4.  The author clearly knows what she's talking about when it comes to the subject matter.  I have read books that were only about one topic and to me it always seemed to have the same information.  This book does a lot more than that which is why I gave it four stars and will be back to read more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was an excellent book for me, if you like science fiction and magic.  It was so enjoyable to read.  The stories were funny and suspenseful, but the main characters were so likable.  They had wonderful chemistry, and were each unique and original.  My husband who I have never met said that he liked this book a lot.  I recommend it highly.  This review was first posted on my blog in 2012. I have not read the other books in this series, but it is a good one. I do not know if it is related to this book. I only read this book on Amazon, but I will read the others as well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only things I liked about this book were the first 10 pages, where the characters are doing a good job of using the new information to figure out how to live. However, by the last 20 pages, all they are doing is trying to find the right words to use to defend themselves from those who want to kill them. I guess you can get some sort of moral out of this, but honestly, I'm glad the book ended before it reached that point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a wonderful book. I bought it, read it and then took the three books my wife bought and made my kids read it too.   It has a lot of good ideas, though it's a bit slow to get to them.  I had been working on my own solution to a problem that I couldn't seem to figure out. So I bought this book and got it to work. I didn't have a solution.  That said, this book was written by a man who has had his fair share of problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title says it all; however, the story was really bad and the ending was anticlimactic and anticlimax-ish.   I really want to like this book, but it really failed to live up to its hype. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book should have been published on a non-competing basis and sold at a normal book store. I found this book boring and not even worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My experience with this book was the equivalent of reading a crappy romance novel.  The author has made some good points about how hard it is to be in a long-term relationship, but I disagree with her about a few points.   It is easy to find reasons to be with a particular partner, but it is much harder to find ways to maintain love after that love has ended.  I have had my share of long-standing relationships that I thought were perfect (the author's story is very similar to mine), and then eventually I was dumped because the guy no longer wanted to date me.  It took me many years to finally understand that the reasons for the breakup were not really about me (i.e. lack of interest in him, because I never really had any interest in anything he did) but a failure to communicate that he didn't want anything to do with me anymore.  In contrast, this book has a very similar ending - it ends after the man, who is a former boyfriend of the woman's, has found someone new and she has moved on, but she doesn't mention what happened in the intervening years.  If the man doesn't write about the whole period of time after the break up, he is not to be trusted.  A friend of mine wrote a book that is like this - it is called The One That Got Away and is about a former girlfriend.  After their break up she writes a long and depressing book about the horrible break ups that people have gone through.  Her friends, who have been with the same guy for a long time, never tell her about this because it doesn't fit the narrative.  This is my personal experience with the author's book, which is not meant to be a review of a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved it when I was a teenager, but now I see that I have been ripped off.   It's one of those books that was so interesting at the time that it's easy to get sucked in.  It doesn't explain why they are so much older, but the explanation of what happened in the 60's seems reasonable, though I guess a little long.  Unfortunately, the author has given up on explaining the difference between two types of children who have very similar behavior. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In fact, I had some of the worst luck I've ever had with a book.   I bought a few novels online and read them once, but then I gave up.  My first purchase was from the library (at least it was on the library's list) but it's only 6.99.  I got a copy at my local book store, but it was way overpriced, almost double the price I paid at the library.  The last one I bought online (I just got this one from amazon), I paid less than 1/2 the price.  It just didn't feel worth it, even with all the extras. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure why anyone would read this, but I found it rather dull and confusing.   The only thing that was interesting about the book was the main character who was the one writing the book and his friends and I think that was the only thing in the book that was actually happening.  The plot was not interesting enough for me to really get what was going on at all, not to mention the characters themselves were a bit stereotypical, and the whole book was repetitive, even when it tried to change the story for some reason, which was a bad sign for a novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed in this book! The book was really poorly written and the story was just boring. I don't think it's a bad story, I just didn't enjoy the book much. I'm not saying this is a bad fantasy book, but I think it was just poorly written.   Overall, the only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because of the artwork.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was interested to see what the author would do with a more classic form like the first half of this book. The second half is much like the beginning:  "The first half, while not bad by any means, is more of a slow burner and doesn't seem to get going until nearly the end when things start going bad."  This is a negative description for me.   The plot is interesting, the story is engaging, but the ending is a letdown.  This novel is a "what if" of the characters who would follow them to the next world.  If the story could have continued a bit longer, the events in the book could have been interesting.  I'm not disappointed by the ending, but it could have gone further with the character development.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read. I feel so ashamed of my teenage years and I am so embarrassed to say that I have read this book.   I feel like I've learned a lot of stuff from this book that I should have picked up in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book   I hated it from start to finish. The whole story has the author trying to make a point and it fails miserably. The story is about a young woman who wants to be an artist but is told that she will never get a job because she is not attractive enough.   She goes to a private school and meets an older girl who is also a teacher. She has been doing art since she was 12 and has had many mentors but no real direction. She also gets a job at the same art school. The book is boring and completely unnecessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are uninteresting. The story is repetitive, boring, and the ending is not satisfying.   I did not enjoy reading this book and I will not read it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was poor and there were too many mistakes made in the writing. It's a good idea to read the book before you start, but I couldn't do that in this book.   This book has too many problems, not the least of which is it not interesting enough to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story line was weak. I got to a point in the book where I thought that they should at least give it a try and continue the story.   It was a good story and I enjoyed it at first, but it eventually became a slog with no real resolution, and it became difficult to read because of the repetitive nature of the plot. The only thing that stood out to me about this book is the great cover artwork by R.M. Cook. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so boring and predictable, there is nothing interesting or good in the book.   The author's opinions about the world and what people think/believe are so narrow and biased that it's ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought the first book in the trilogy and never got around to reading the second one. The plot is great but the book is so repetitive it's a chore to read, and the ending is a bit of a let down. The only good thing about the trilogy is the artwork - it's the best of the trilogy, the best I've ever seen from Gollancz.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, at least for me, is all over the place. It is about three guys (all with one exception) who have been sent down to the worst school in Texas.  The premise is very interesting.  But there are some things about the book that don't seem to add up and I felt that the book needed to be edited to include those issues.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very interested in this book from the very beginning. I was particularly interested in what the author's background was, and whether he was a scientist, a physician, a psychologist, a neuroscientist, a psychiatrist, a physicist, an economist, etc.  Unfortunately, the author is a lawyer (although he does write about himself) and his background is more in the area of science and medicine (but not psychiatry).  He is a very smart guy, but a very bad teacher.  I'm not sure I would recommend this book to anyone (but maybe to those who are looking to have a good time and enjoy a good read, regardless of its content) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title was all that I needed to know. It was just another generic, boring biography of an eccentric millionaire. Nothing new about his history, his business and his financial choices.   He was just a typical rich man.  It wasn't until I read the back cover that I understood why he was called an eccentric.  I've read books about many eccentric businessmen and it's always the same story, he started out with a great idea and went through a few failed business ventures and a divorce.    This book is just another book about a rich, white, male, so-called eccentric businessman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really love this book.  I can't even say if I liked any of the characters.  The story itself was good but there were so many problems with how the author was writing it that I just couldn't get into it.  There were too many repetitions of the same things,   and the author used so many long words in just about every sentence.   This book really was just a waste of my time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a little taken back by this book after reading all the glowing reviews on Goodreads and I was worried it was going to be another one of those terrible YA books where the characters are not well written or have unrealistic ideals.  I had very high hopes for this book and was willing to give it a chance.  The characters were believable and the characters were not so well written that I felt as though the author was only trying to please her readers.  Instead, I felt the author's only goal was to please herself and I found her constant use of stereotypes very distracting.  In all, it's a good read but there were things in the first chapter that made me uncomfortable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bit on the dry side.  The author doesn't give any context or back story into how it was constructed, and he doesn't provide much of an idea of the different characters involved.  While he does describe what is going on in his family during the war, I had to look at the pictures of his family in the book (which were not very well done) to figure out what was going on.  This would have been an okay novel if I knew the background of the main character, but otherwise, not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to read this because it is a book by a famous philosopher that is very popular, but in my opinion he's an a**hole.   He's a great philosopher, but you've heard the same things from many philosophers, such as the idea that there are two types of minds, one type of mind is human, which is the rational type, which will eventually evolve into a robot.  I'm trying to think if there are some types of mind that cannot evolve or if it's just the kind of mind you can't really evolve.  He says that in the future, people will go to sleep and wake up with a mind that has been modified by a human brain.  Now, he mentions that these "soul" people will become more sophisticated and be more like a computer.  But that's the end goal.  After a while they will evolve into the robot type and go back to sleep, thinking about their new life. I have some friends who are atheists and this is what they say.  It's not a real atheist book, it's the atheist philosopher saying that we will have evolved from machines, that we are computers and we will sleep.  So I didn't really find his ideas original or very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no problem with reading good books, but when a bad one is in the same category as a good one, I really feel cheated. The authors use good old-fashioned scare tactics and scare tactics with some twists, but the book was not scary enough for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books where I could just give it zero stars and go with it. The prose is so-so. I find myself wishing that the author would find a way to make this interesting or interesting to read. For some reason, the author doesn't seem to be in the same league as those who write in the genre of contemporary fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book.   It was a very, very long book with lots of information and ideas but was extremely poorly organized.  I have no idea how many of the chapters were written before the last one was published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read many bad books and this one is the worst  I have to say the author writes like she has a bad attitude and I can't even tell if I am reading a good or a bad story. It is just so boring and unoriginal. She also is a lousy story teller, the characters just come out of nowhere and don't seem to have any depth at all. If you like fast paced fiction that is not good, give this book a miss
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very bad book that I read and it made me feel so stupid, that I can't stand the thought of reading it ever again.   This is not a book that you should buy at least once, and never recommend to others.  This book is extremely boring.  No one has any real insight into the situation they are in.  The only reason they are talking is because of what they are told, and because they can make their self feel better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was an interesting book on the history of science, but as a history it failed to convince me that the scientists were wrong.  It seemed to show how scientists worked in the past, and that scientists who are doing what they do now are just doing what we want them to do in the future.  I think it will be useful to study the past and look at where science has come from and where it is going, but I will probably not look at any more of the history books that the library recommends.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a lot of flaws. I can understand why someone would want to read the book, because it contains a lot good ideas about life and human behaviour. However, I was so disappointed. Most of what I got from it was, "I know the same as you."  This book has quite a few flaws: 1. The author claims that the average person is not a good manager, that they don't understand the importance of teamwork, that management is about management; and that they think they're good leaders because they have a big budget to spend on themselves and their friends. However... 2. The book is full of examples of how bad people are, but in a more positive way. 3. The best things in the book are the good people. People who just want to do what they believe in, rather than just the typical management types. 4. Many times I thought the book was a rant against "Big Boss Managers" that "get away with things".  I am glad that there is a book out there explaining how the world is run and that most people are doing the best they can in a difficult situation.   I think that people who make their living in the corporate world really need to take a look at the other side of things, because they are definitely living up to their reputation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a horrible person. It was obvious from the very start that he was only interested in making a quick buck and that his work was not up to par with the quality of the books from the big publishers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you have read and enjoyed this book, you have learned the hard way that what you read is not what it seems to be. The author is a professional at using the word "hypothesis" and he presents his ideas in a way that makes it sound like a scientific hypothesis. The authors attempts to draw out and illustrate the difference between the hypotheses used by the religious and the science of evolution. The problem, however, is that the author has no interest in the scientific method, he relies heavily on personal opinion and faith in science. I am a scientific believer, but I will never understand what a scientific "hypoth-esis" is because this book is so uneducated about the scientific process.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author made no effort to understand the characters and their motivations.   I didn't care for his writing style or the overall storyline and found myself bored by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this book was so bad it made me want to quit reading it.   I've read many books on various subjects. Some have been great and even amazing.  But not all have been. This is not one of them.  I have tried this book.  So why read it?  I read it because it is by a fellow "expert" in the area.  She's a physician who is also a scientist.  One of her books is on food additives and she makes some interesting points.  However, this book is far more about a woman's journey to the truth than anything that is scientific or medical.  My son gave it to me as a Christmas gift for the holidays because I didn't give him one last year.  He has never read anything on food or dieting, so he thought it would be a good "read."  It was not.  This was a self-published book written by a woman.  It has the same feel of the "How To Be A Woman" book which I used to read as a kid.  Now my son thinks I am a crazy person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not normally a fan of the kind of fantasy or science fiction that's marketed with a strong and somewhat mysterious feel. I just don't find the story interesting enough. There are some intriguing concepts and interesting plots, but I just can't seem to get into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My favorite book of the year, this is a great read, but very very dense at times.   A solid story with some really great twists at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As an American, I don't like it as much as some other reviewers say. I have a hard time with these kinds of stories. But I understand why they were popular, and that is why I think they were successful.  The characters are mostly good; a couple of them are just downright evil. The plots are predictable and have little twists. But the language is beautiful, the story is moving and the characters are believable.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first part was so confusing I kept trying to remember the last few pages. The author made a mistake (or perhaps, it was a typo) and now I've been in the middle of a long-winded and confusing plot that has me baffled. I'll just start the last chapter of this book and see if it helps me. This is not a good beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character is a complete jerk. A few times, he tries to talk a girl into having sex but, if he tries hard enough, she'll say no.   That's all I can say about this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading a book by a very knowledgeable author, I thought it would be a good read, but the ending left me confused. I wanted to keep reading, but I knew that there would be some kind of twist or a cliffhanger. The author was so good and I know he has done other books in the same genre, but this was a bit too predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is so poorly done. The characters are so pathetic. The plot is so bad. I wanted so badly to care about these people, but I could not, I just could not.    For all its faults, The Red Road  is a very well written book and a great read! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this to be a good book but it has a number of flaws. For example: the first chapter was boring and the author seems to have not done much research. It is the same issue I have with other popular books and how they are all written by the same person. I didn't enjoy it because I was reading a great book but I felt that I could have read this book more than once. I was hoping for something different so I will give it a 4.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want a book about politics but are unable to finish the whole thing, the very last chapter is an introduction to the concept of the political. The author, however, doesn't make the concept clear. When the chapter is finished, you get an overview of why there is such a strong anti-Americanism in the Muslim world. The introduction by the author isn't very good either. This is a very good book on the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a bit tedious and the book could have been shorter, but the fact that it was short and readable in my opinion.  I'm also really disappointed that it didn't explain the difference between the two languages.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished this book and it was just painful to read. My kids don't understand the importance of studying.   My kids can't read at all and this book gave them the idea that they're going to be able to read by their 5th birthday.  The author has given us the idea of a new kind of book to try that will help our children develop their literacy skills and reading skills. But it did not work out that way.  After 2 days of reading this book I started feeling so frustrated and angry about the poor teaching, the poor story telling, the poorly written, the not challenging the readers and not making any sense to me. The children would say things like "I don't like this, but I need to know more" and "but I need more details about the word" etc etc I ended up reading another book from another author which I love and this one I will not read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not the biggest fan of this book but it did give me a great look at the history of American women and their role in our society. I can see why so many women would be attracted to this book, as they were. The title, of course, is not a great compliment to the book and I did not enjoy reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really like this book very much and felt that the narrator was a little too eager to get on with his "job". As a matter of fact, I was kind of annoyed that he was so anxious to be able to get to his work on time because if it wasn't for the delays, I don't think he'd have bothered to set this book down at all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of horror and this book is a total disappointment. I liked it initially because I thought it was a good story with good writing.   However, it's not.  The story is basically a bad movie.  It's not scary at all. The characters are not scary either.  I'm going to give this book a 3/5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author makes the book sound like some bigoted racist screed. The plot was terrible. The characters were poorly written.  The "realism" of the book makes it seem like the author wanted to include every bad stereotype that exists and then wrote about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor attempt at comedy that I wasn't a fan of.  I think it's an interesting idea and a good idea for the writer but the execution is a little off.  The characters don't have a clear personality (except the narrator) and the author has to cram them into a few pages (no matter how interesting).  The way the book is written is very slow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of this series. The first two books had many things right, but the three books after that, I felt, were not very good. They did have good action scenes and some really good fighting scenes, but there was too much of it. It was hard to get interested in any of the characters. The writing is very basic and the ending was not very satisfying, although the first book ended with it, so it was understandable. However, this is not the first series I've read, so I can't say I really have a strong opinion about them all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not enthralled. I had read the review about how good this book is and I was ready to go. But it just didn't click with me. The writing style is not my style. The author has very good grammar but I have difficulty remembering certain words. I understand why he used the style, but I don't want to have to use it. The story is very short. I wasn't a fan of the author's stories in the past so I wasn...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband and I both read this one because it was part of a series and we were both interested in this one.   It was a fun read, but nothing spectacular.  It's not the kind of book you are likely to go back to often, but there's nothing wrong with that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As an adult, I enjoyed the books in this series, and still do. However, it is still pretty long, and the pacing is a little bit slow. Some of the later books are a little weak, but not as much as the first two. It would have been nice to see a little more time spent on the more character-centric plots in this trilogy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book didn't live up to expectations. I expected something more intelligent than a "history" of the U.S.S. I expected more from a book published by a major publisher.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not too interested in this book. It was a pretty basic introduction to the field. It does a pretty good job at explaining the major concepts in neuroscience.  Unfortunately it was very boring for me.  The idea of the book was fascinating enough, but the content was very lacking.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written and hard to follow. It seems that the author just wanted to make a name for himself and the writing quality doesn't help him do it.   I would have expected better from this guy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This is a decent book, it's just that it isn't a story that you'll ever need to read."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book hoping to find a "new" perspective to our current economic and political climate. What I found was a pretty dry, non-intelligent and boring book with an agenda and a great way to tell the reader what to think. If you don't already believe in a non-interventionist foreign policy in Syria, then this book is useless. I am sorry that this book was necessary to read. But I did read it and now I don't like the way the author presents the facts and the answers to the questions he poses. I just don't think we need to look any further than the mainstream media to get an answer. But then the author has given us his own biased perspective as well. I really hope that this doesn't influence the reader's opinion or even have any impact on the policy making process. It might be better to just let the government of Syria figure out what to do. 5/5 stars. This was a good book about foreign policy. I learned more about foreign relations from it than I ever have from my history and civics textbooks. The writing is good, the discussion is thoughtful, and the overall subject matter was interesting and well presented. I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very interesting story about the lives of two young people and the mistakes they make. I was disappointed in the ending. It was an enjoyable read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this was a good book, but I was disappointed with the ending. There was a lot of potential in this story, and I was very interested in learning what happens to all the people affected by the nuclear fallout. But at the end, it seemed like the people who had been chosen as the only survivors of the apocalypse just ended up sitting in a room for a long time wondering where the hell they were. The ending was so confusing and rushed, it made me want to stop reading. I'm sorry I bought this book, because I think I'll be skipping it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is so boring and the writing is so bad. There's just so little to it, so much dialogue, so little plot, so many "what's so great about this character is that she's so perfect" etc etc. I'm glad this was published in the seventies and was still on a good level of quality.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really hoping this book would be much better than the terrible book that was given a starred review by Amazon.  But it wasn't.  The cover is great and the stories are quite fun to read.  A lot of what we read about vampires on the news is bad and sensationalistic, but these were not at all bad stories.  I enjoyed them, but they were not as interesting as the stories from the book that were on the inside.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was good, but I found it difficult to understand.   I'm not sure if I'm just not the right kind of person for it, or if the author is just a big ass hick who does this kind of thing on a regular basis (even though it doesn't work).   As a whole, though, I thought the writing style was a little off, as it seemed like he wanted to tell me how much he loved it, but didn't really.  Overall, I'd recommend it if you are a huge hick or a huge ass hic...
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really disliked this book. It was boring and tedious, and it never made me really care about the character. It really annoyed me that she keeps having to explain the same thing over and over again when there is no need to. Her story, I think, has been done. She's a hero, sure. She saves the universe, so there are definitely some problems that need to be fixed (and they can be fixed, but you get my point). But it's just not her story that I find irritating. I guess if I'm going to read a book about a woman who saves the whole universe, I'm not going to care about her life. But otherwise, I'd have rather gone for something else.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book does not offer a clear vision of what the hell it is or what it is about.   It is just a book about how to live an enjoyable life with no expectations of success.     It's a sad, bitter, and pathetic book.  My friend is on the opposite side of the spectrum but it is a fun read.  It makes you a better person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good part is the ending...   I found a way to feel the same way that I do about the movies that are made about the books I like, but it was too heavy for me, so I had to leave the book without finishing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this to a friend who asked for a quick read. This is not so quick, and the story has a lot of problems. This book has too much 'in-your-face' prose, which is an issue with some books.  It's a fun read, but the author needs to tone down the writing. It's just not very good for this length. The narration was good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very interesting book, but the ending was disappointing. The author uses a lot of cliches (the man who has all the luck, etc.) and the ending is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book from beginning to end and it was so poorly written it made me angry. I hate when authors give you what they think you want, and this book was not written to fulfill any of your desires. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It's boring, unoriginal, and just not the way I prefer to read a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is boring.   I couldn't care less about the plot or characters or why the book was set in the future.  This story is very cliche.  If the book had been set in 1940, I would have cared about the story and about who would win the war.  I've read that the writer tries to incorporate futuristic technology into his stories, but this was a cliche book with no character development and no plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main characters are just the most annoying in the world. They are both so unrealistic, it makes me want to hit them over the head with a baseball bat. The story is interesting to see their friendship, but I would love it if they were not that annoying.  As a reader of this genre, I would recommend this book for the humor, the plot, and the characters. However, the book doesn't appeal to me personally.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It had an interesting premise but it lacked depth and didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. The characters were bland and uninteresting and nothing about the story made sense to me. It felt rushed and was almost totally devoid of the "wow" factor it had been promising me for the whole book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first third is pretty good. I felt the characters in the second third were pretty lackluster. I think the author, as well as her publisher, are trying to make a political point that a black woman can lead a family, but that doesn't mean it's not a character who is flawed and who needs redemption at times. The final third, though, was just dreadful. It was so awful, I couldn't bring myself to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A friend who I used to go to high school with read this book. She said it was very boring, and she hates when books are boring.  It made me sad.   I hope that this book does not sell well.  The author is a great writer, and it sounds like he knows what he is doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to read all the way through this book hoping it would at least give me a good review about the books merits but it did not. I liked the book I bought and the author was good about sending out her books in advance, but I just couldn't stand this book. I am a sucker for the "what if" type stories so that kept me interested and reading along but that is about it. I could not get into this book either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a complete waste of time, and I've already paid more for it.    The author clearly has no idea of the subject.  The only thing she gets right is the title. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading all the reviews on this book, I can only conclude that the author knew nothing about the subject matter.  This book is nothing more than a long list of things to say, with little information about what is actually being said.  The only information in the book that is relevant to the book's topic is that a person's mind can be controlled via hypnosis.  And this, in conjunction with other questionable claims, makes the book unreadable.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has some good ideas, but as a professional story teller, the writing style is clumsy and the book takes itself too seriously.  It's not a bad story, it's just a little dry.  I am hoping to write a sequel, but have found it so hard to get going on that, that I feel it might be best not to.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only flaw in this book is that it took me a whole year to get around to reading it. I really should have read it before now, but I just decided to give it a try on the recommendation of another reviewer, and my wife was annoyed at the time I gave it to her for the library because I wanted to read it first.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, and the ending sucks.   The story is very much what I have seen before in my life.  However, the writing was worse than that.  It took me a good 2 hours to finish this book.  There were some parts that made me want to stop, and I did.  I know it was hard to put down after the first chapter.  But it really sucked. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was okay until I found out what kind of game it is.   The gameplay, like I said, is fine but not to the level of other, better games that I've played. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was really fun to read. I like the characters and the stories really did have a lot to say. However, there are several problems with the writing style, including overuse of the word "bad". In particular, it was quite distracting as to when the writer had a good idea. It seems that most of the problems with this book can be summed up in one line:  A bad idea is worth a good story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I love fantasy novels but I was disappointed. The main character of the story is a male that was a warrior of the Middle Ages. He was the best and most powerful warrior in his country, and his kingdom was great. Unfortunately, his king became tired of his military strategies and asked him to become a king's advisor. His king said: "What is it that you would give me to be king?" And the man said: ''Your kingdom, your life, everything you have!" He gave his life in exchange for that. This was the beginning of the end. In the end, he was only an advisor, and the king didn't want to live in peace. This story has many flaws. First of all, the story starts off so well and the character is well developed, but then the book is not as good as it should have been. The beginning is so good, but at the end there is so little. Then the author changed the main character's name to a woman and it wasn't long before the story went downhill. The book had so much potential, but unfortunately the author couldn't write the ending well. (I had read other books in the series but this was the last book I wanted to read.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a terrible piece of work. It is written by someone who is incapable of giving a good book a good rating. He writes like a middle aged, stupid man. The book does not have the best ideas. It's a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The narrator is too passive. I would have enjoyed reading this more if I was more engaged with the characters. The author has an amazing talent for telling a story and I think it's her only flaw: that she doesn't get around to the characters enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending was horrible, and the characters were two-dimensional, bland and devoid of any true depth.   It's basically a collection of short stories about a bunch of characters from the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was fine for the most part, and a well executed fantasy story at that. There were a few flaws though, as some of the characters had no characterization, the plot was a little confusing and some of characters were either too evil or just flat out uninteresting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not bad. But it didn't do the work I expected it to.  The author has great writing talent. She gives us a strong plot, lots of character development, and she does a great job at creating suspense.  It does have some flaws, though, like the ending and the way the author goes about resolving it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping to read this book before the movie but found myself disappointed. I didn't think there would be enough content to make a complete story. I'll probably not be checking out the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book I have been enjoying. But there were parts in the last few chapters where I couldn't get through and got upset, like with the ending. I don't understand why the author had to get rid of all the major characters. I mean, the ending of the book is very interesting, but I felt it was rushed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is bad   I don't like books where the author is so obviously an intellectual fraud who thinks he is smarter than everyone else. He is completely out of his depth, and his arguments are always faulty.   This book is just terrible, and I've had it on my Kindle for over a year now. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was a lot of wasted energy in this book. If there are no bad books, I'm all for reading a great book to make up for that.   I'm hoping my experience will change my opinion of this book (which, given my previous experiences with the author's previous books, should've been a good one).   But for the amount of time I spent on this, the time that I spent reading this and the time wasted trying to find something bad about this book, I might as well have done nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard good things about the book, but I decided I didn't want to put in the effort to read it and it became a waste of time. It had to be in the 90s, which I hate because they don't produce quality books, but at least they are producing better books than they were. I really don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book to my daughter on her 21st birthday as an anniversary present. It took her awhile to finish it, but in the end she gave it a bad review. It started off good, and she really loved the characters, but she didn't get the message at all. She said the only character who was the same throughout the story was the one who didn't have a clue what was going on, and it was frustrating to watch. Overall, it's a nice book and I recommend it for a younger child.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I went into this book with no expectations.   The first half of this book is great.    The characters are interesting.  The plot is interesting. This book has an interesting feel to it.  I liked it.   It was good.  But then the ending... It's a bad ending.  It was just so abrupt.  In the middle of a book about a magical girl, we have a plot twist that I don't really understand.   And what we have done to her to make her like that?  And we have all left her and left her like this?  How do we get out of this situation and make her not like us?   This is such an unfair ending to me.  To me, we should all have more respect for our own characters.  This book was so disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter (although this story is not a good one, so no biggie). However, Harry was a lot more mature than this. I'd say that the character development for Draco Malfoy is excellent and I loved how they went about his character development. However, I think this is the first bad Harry Potter book that I have ever read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book started off great but then it became extremely boring.   I don't even remember what the characters did.  And now I'm bored again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at an airport and it was hard to follow as it was a good intro to quantum mechanics, but I couldn't really put the pieces together. It just wasn't clear why they were there and where they were headed. Not really a bad read, just an unsatisfying one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was so bad, and at times so confusing. I would have rather gotten the classic version of this book, which I have not read, but now that I do, I have to say I was really disappointed with it. I had bought this book on a whim because I've heard so much about it. When I started reading the synopsis, I thought this would be a classic of the genre. However, it was far from it. If you are interested in vampires, this book is definitely a book for you. However if you like mystery or suspense, you will be left disappointed. I can't wait to listen to the next book by James D. Adams. I recommend this book only if you're a fan of mysteries or the supernatural.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was an amazing book but it lacked the depth and impact of some of the previous titles in the series. The characters were flat and boring and the story didn't develop.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It would be nice if you could read something a little less offensive and a little more intellectual, like this book by the brilliant and well-written Michael Pollan.  I've read Pollan's books, and they are fine. The only problem I have with this one is that it feels so rushed, so unorganized, that I had to put it down to get to the next one. I do not want to be bogged down reading a book by such an important author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to read this book, but the whole experience of finding it in a book shop and reading it was like searching for a needle in a haystack.   The only thing that kept me from giving it a 1 star rating was that I wanted it to be great but couldn't find it. I just could not find it in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is very well told and the characters are intriguing. It is a shame that the ending is rushed and doesn't really work for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book, expecting the "best of" genre, and it is not. The plot is pretty lame, there are no characters that I liked, and there is nothing to make me want to keep reading.   There are two good points though, one is the story of a man, a doctor, who comes to accept the fact that he is dying and wants to die, while the other is that it was written by a great writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not surprised that this book is written by people with PhD's.  It is one of those "think you are the best person ever and you can make the world better" books.  When I first started learning about the world, the first book I read that made me really believe in what I was doing was "The Power of the Powerpoint Presentation".  I was able to create a presentation for a conference using a few PowerPoint files in the summer of 2005.  I knew at that point I was on to a great thing.  But even though I had been taking the presentations I had created seriously for a year, I still thought I was the best at what I do.  This book convinced me that it is the students and not the professor that is the best teacher.  Not a bad thing for a book to help someone get in the right frame of mind to learn. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story of The Legend of Zelda is about the search for a lost love that has been taken by a monster. The book spends a lot of time on the search but leaves out some important bits about the story that the reader should have been told. In a book like this, where so much is given away about what is going on, the reader needs to be given the information they need in order to enjoy the book. I would have much preferred a book that told the reader the whole story but left out the parts that didn't make the final cut.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character is very boring and unlikeable, and the book is very bad.   Not only was the main character not interesting, the author couldn't even do character development at the right places.  It's a book about a guy who likes to watch bad movies, and it's actually kind of hard to believe that this guy was an adult or had any sort of life outside of watching bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was bad, the characters were boring, and the ending was bad  This book is terrible. I am a fan of both YA and adult books, but this book is way over my head. It is so confusing and it takes too long to understand anything. If I had read this in a different format, I would have had a much better time. It was like someone who just started reading The Chronicles of Narnia in the first book and wanted to know what happened next in that book. I had no idea where the hell to go or what to do next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like this book. The main character is an immature and immature and spoiled young girl. She lives in her parent's house and is very naive and naive. The book is just an excuse to get the story of how her parents got divorced and how they divorced.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been searching for the perfect book to teach me about the human body. In this book, they make it look like the whole process is a complete mess. I'm not saying the book is a bad thing, I'm just saying that I have no idea what they're saying.  I am going to say the rest of the reviews on the net are spot on! It is an excellent book and a must read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been trying to get into this genre of fiction for a long time, but this book just did not interest me.   It seemed to have more action than anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very boring book.   I don't mind boring books, I just hate dull books, especially on the topic of history.  If you are interested in the topics discussed, then this book would be a good read.  My friend recommended this to me but I had to read it. I wanted to like it but the boring writing, the wrong choices made throughout the book and some really bad quotes made it a complete disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author, in order to make the story seem more interesting, had the character go back to the first time, as a'rehearsal,' but, as she herself said in the book, he just came up with the exact same thing as the first go.   Overall, the story is really boring and doesn't really work from an 'action' point of view. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was all wrong.   The writing was terrible and I found it to be un-compelling and boring.  My brother is a huge fantasy fan and I got the impression that this was intended to be a book of medieval fiction.  There are several times where the author writes "a" in the wrong place (and at least one is a typo), and the plot points are so random and unconnected that it all comes off as lame.  I have read a few books on medieval history and even I would have had to go to the Wiki for some of this stuff to work in my head.  It's a great way to earn some cheap points from other fantasy fans but I won't be reading this series again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book, I wasn't sure whether I was going to hate it or like it, because the main character is the type of person who could make some interesting observations and say some interesting things.   Unfortunately, the second half of book is all bashing of some aspect of society and/or religion.  In my experience, most people, when they come up with a good idea, go on to make it as good as they can, and that's how this book ended up.  After a very long review, you'll decide whether or not you like this book or not.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was terrible and I was bored by it. I have to have an actual story to read and this one didn't make me think about the story. It just didn't have much to say about the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book at all. It was a tedious, boring and predictable read. If you need a good read that will teach you a few facts about the history of the English language, I would recommend this book. I had to reread it four times because my mind was still working to understand its concepts. The book does not tell you anything about the English word "language" or "word" but tries to teach you how English evolved. The author claims the book is based on a true story and if you have some patience and are interested in learning about English grammar, then this is a good book. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is because the text is a little too boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, I mean the actual book (if I remember correctly), is very good but his style of writing (for the most part), the fact that he doesn't have any notes about what he is doing and when it should be done is just boring.   I have to say I actually liked the main character and he does start out as a great one.  One thing I don't like is his lack of an ending.  The ending is not very satisfying and it would have been good to have a little bit more with how he got out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed with this book. I'm a history major and I was looking for a quick read that would be interesting but not over the top. This book was not that. Although it did not have the kind of interesting story as I expected, the stories about the different historical figures that the book described were interesting. There were a few that made me question how the author could include the story of a historical figure that was portrayed with such a great deal of detail without making it seem that the author knew what the character was like. Also, there was only one short story. There should have been at least a few more! However, I do recommend this book to those who enjoy good historical fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I would love this book! I have always been a big fan of this author's work, as her work is one of my favorite fantasy series.   The main character is my favorite and was so incredibly fun to read.  It was a lot of fun, I had a blast.  I liked the world building a lot.  The world is huge and the characters are unique.  This is one fantasy book that I'm excited about in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best part about this book is how much time I spent learning and practising with it. The book could have been very useful in my career if not for all of the flaws.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about "the rise of an ancient vampire tribe," that is, the Vampires, which are described as "the kings of the land of the dead." Unfortunately, the book is not really about "a" vampire. It is more about the Vampirian culture. I could see why someone might like this book, but if you're into vampires, you should find something else instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's too bad, really bad, that this book could have been a really good book.   I have read many good books, and this one, while good, was just not that good.  If you like hard sci-fi novels, you will like this one. If you want a book with very high quality writing and good action, you should look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was fine, and it was about a girl who is part human and part cat. But the story, for the most part, was boring. I found myself bored out of my mind as I tried to follow the story.   This book is not very entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm giving this one a three stars. The pacing was slow, but I can still enjoy it if you like the genre, because I enjoyed reading it. It made me feel what it was like to feel like an outsider in my own country. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for one reason and one reason alone: it is a classic. However, I was extremely disappointed in it. I think it's because it's the only book written by William Faulkner that I know of that I disliked. FaulkNER has such a unique voice, and if he were able to express it in a book, it would be a great book. Unfortunately, I think this one falls flat for three very simple reasons: 1. It was incredibly difficult to read. I can't remember if I finished any of the Faulkners I've read so I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. But it felt like I was slogging through the same old same old. 2. The only other Faulkener I've ever read is this one, so if I had wanted to read a Faulkerer, I'd probably go with "Troublesome Traveler" or "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." 3. There's absolutely nothing in here that interests me. I didn't learn anything new, or understand anything that the author did in his writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book and have no regrets, in fact, I would say it's the best I've seen out of the genre.   The story was enjoyable, the character development was great, the action scenes were fun, and the romance was good.  I would read this again, and I'm sure I would like it even better if I had finished it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was all downhill from the beginning. First, it was difficult to get to know the characters; at least the one I was interested in, and even then, he was a bit mysterious, which seemed a tad strange to me considering I didn't really know anything about him. I've been a fan of the series since I was a teenager and enjoyed the first book. This book didn't hold my interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about two boys who were orphaned and were put in a boarding school.   After they got out,  they had a great time playing pranks on each other and were in love.  When the parents died, the two boys stayed in the same school. But it is really about their parents not being there.  The author is quite a bit too sentimental.  He really could have told the story better.  I got a chuckle out of a joke, but I really wish the author had been more subtle. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A little boring, a bit dry, too long. It took me too much time and not enough fun.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has a good beginning and a great middle, but the book goes on and on and it never ends. The characters are all so bland. They get worse and worse.   My wife was not impressed with this book either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was boring, boring, and boring.  My sister has a very high intelligence and the book was a waste of her time.    I will never read a book this dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to believe that it has taken over a decade for this book to be completed, and even harder to believe it's been published in such a cheap, poor-quality edition.   This book is not a good story and doesn't have the feel of a good novel.  It would be better to be able to make a living writing a good book and not having to live off the kindness of strangers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the story was interesting.   The characters were interesting. But the author didn't know how to keep the characters alive, so at the end of the story we see that most of them got killed off (the only exception was the main character).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Very poor.   The story is interesting, but not particularly good.  The characters are well written, but are a bit too bland.  It has a great plot, but a lot of it goes nowhere.  I am disappointed in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After spending months poring over this book I realized I was not really enjoying it. As a professional photographer with over thirty years experience, I am a lot more qualified than this book is. I am not a fan of self-help, especially when the author is a known liar, but this book isn't about making you a better photographer.  It's about you trying to become a professional for the next three years.  The author talks about the importance of photography as a business.  She talks about some of her own "clients."  But she doesn't have a clue about what the best practices are or the importance and value of being open to feedback.  I don't even believe this was written for a real photographer. It's just for you.  This book was not worth the $20 I paid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A boring and uninteresting book about something that everyone knows is boring and boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. I would never buy it again. I have never understood why people are so drawn to these books; they do not do anything for me or my life in any way. However, this book is truly good, and if you can resist the urge to look up something like the Internet to find the latest updates on what the authors are up to, I would recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit that I was extremely skeptical about this book.   My husband and I have always loved The Chronicles of Narnia and have read them all, including the first one.  I was so excited to read about a woman who can take her child and run away with her to live in a magical kingdom and save him.  And then, at the end, she realizes she can't save him because she's the daughter of the king!   And that's where the book ends.  I was a little disappointed.  But I have high hopes for the next book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book, but unfortunately, I hated it. This is a "novel," so it's a fantasy book. Fantasy books have a unique style that I do not like. I did love the way the author made the story a romance, even though I do wish there was a more serious fantasy story. I loved the "love is in the air" theme. I also loved the ending. But I did not like the plot. It was very confusing. And the characters were just so uninteresting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this for the first time when I got a freebie from Amazon. It's really good, but I'm not a fan of the way the author describes his book. I have to say that I like the story a lot better, but the first couple chapters are a bit frustrating for me because I can't seem to read it the way he wrote. I just wish he wrote about his other books better... This is a really good book. The narrator is great, the writing is good, and the cover is a good idea. I'm going to buy the next two books in this series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion this book doesn't do a very good job of explaining the physics behind gravity. It doesn't explain the basics either - like how light gets into our eyes - so the concepts that do make sense don't come across well.  The writing itself, if nothing else, is quite bad - so it's kind of a bummer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book after reading many rave reviews from friends about the author's writing skills.  I enjoyed the beginning and the middle but this novel had no emotional core and was a chore to read for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book didn't exactly give me a good read. It didn't really move me, I thought. I mean, there were some good bits. And the descriptions of some of the locations were interesting. But I don't remember any of it, and the last fifty pages really didn't hit me as hard as the first hundred. I'd give it two stars, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written by someone who wants to be taken seriously as an authority on the subject of science. This book is a complete disappointment.   This book contains lots of science and a little bit of mythology, but no good science or good mythology. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a pretty good read, but as a whole, it's just not very good. I really don't want to put it down, but I often find myself wanting more. And it has a pretty long preface at the end that, while interesting, has nothing really to do with the plot, and isn't that fun either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just awful. The author is terrible and the book is terrible. The main character (the "man with the black belt") has a hard time staying on task and is often boring.  The writing style is choppy, and the author is a horrible copyeditor, which also detracts from the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As if writing this review was any kind of accomplishment.  The author, an ex-marine, writes from a victim's perspective.  This kind of book doesn't help me move through life.  I find myself getting caught up in the author's mind games, because I'm pretty sure I can't stop listening to her talk about being raped. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in the spring and fall and found it boring.   This is a history book about the British. The author covers some history, some people and some interesting people. It had a great review in Booklist but the actual content of the book was not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so bad, I did not want to read it. My husband's favorite fantasy is "Rise of the Vampire". I am a bit concerned about this book's quality and if I would even enjoy it, but it certainly had its moments.   It took me a while to read because I read many books this year but this is the first I did have a major problem with and then had to wait for it to get out of the store and read in the car, lol.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure I'll be reading more, but this book was disappointing. I think I'll wait for the next in the series.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book for free from my friend when she was trying to get me to read more non-fiction. I had not read this book when I got it, so I did not know of the "Dirty Dozen" series, which was recommended by my friend as one of the more "dirtier" of the non-fiction "dirty dozen" (I do not know how she discovered the series and found it). I don't care if it's the dirtiest book ever.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read about the time I went on a trip to the Middle East in 2001 and was surprised to find I was not really enjoying myself. The book did have some great descriptions of the places and characters, but most of the time the plot just wasn't working for me. It didn't help that I had just finished reading about a "bizarre case" in which a man who had done some pretty awful things was released after his sentence was commuted by another prisoner and he ended up on the run for over a decade. The whole book got repetitive in a very bad way and I couldn't get into the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete disappointment. My husband and I are very pleased with our purchase of it, as we had previously purchased a number of books from the author, and she is an excellent writer. However, the fact that I felt I wasted my money on this book, and the fact I had no idea what I was getting myself into, was just a total letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A few years ago I picked up this little novel in a trade paperback.   I have never liked the YA trend in fantasy. The writing was nice.  The characters were well written.  I liked the plot and I think the author did a great job writing this one.  If you don't like the Y-Age trend, this book is probably not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book, but I found it very hard to follow at times, and I think it would have been better off without the two very annoying parts about the "unusual behavior" of the dog.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is useless to most people.  It is mostly a list of links.  The only thing that this book does is provide a list.  I will never use this book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After finishing this book I was sad that I didn't give it more time.   For me this book was wayyyy too short.  I finished the book and decided to read more (I have an eye on the next book in this series).   I was thinking I wanted to be able to finish the story of this book as well as it's sequel.  But, I'm really glad I finished it before that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time, as it does nothing but add to the general negative reputation of the genre of the same title. The concept of the book is fascinating, but the writing is tedious, with the author never really building up a plot.  The only person to actually learn anything from this book is probably the author of the original book, who seems to have taken the same advice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The novel is filled with bad grammar and spelling errors. My grade is only three stars because I liked the characters very much. There is also a bad use of the word "dynamic". The novel was good at least for me because of the characters but for others it might not be as good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book in a swap and found out too late that the person who gave me this book did NOT review it and had no idea what the hell I got myself into. I can't say I hated it but it did nothing for me and really made me go "what the fuck was that?"  It's a quick read, but for me at least it was like a cross between the plot of the movie and something you'd find in a trashy novel about the sexual adventures of a young girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did enjoy this book, however, it was a bit confusing and repetitive. The main character's name is 'Brynn' and her husband is 'Billy' I guess you could say that the main character is a 'homo-wife' but then she is 'gay' with 'Billy'. I think that this book made me think about sexuality and I am wondering why the author included the same sexual scenes all over the book.   The book also makes me wonder why we should judge the'morals' of others. When we read about Billy's lifestyle I thought: ''Yeah, that's it! He's really a gay man...'' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you like the idea of a fantasy series, but find most of the stories confusing, lacking in details, and lacking in character, or if you are looking for more than just fantasy, then you will not be disappointed. Unfortunately, you are only going to get one story in the book and that is the end of the fantasy. I will tell you that it was very entertaining and I liked a few of the characters and had a good time with this one. I found it a little depressing that we are not going to see a lot more of this book, or the characters, as my book club will be reading the book for the next book, but that's just me. I would give it a 4/5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book I read in this series is one of my favorites. It's a great example of a well-written book, a good story, and the characters are just wonderful. The book was short and I liked it. I'm disappointed that the characters didn't have a little bit more depth, but all in all, I was satisfied and will probably get more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character spends a lot of time trying to get information from a computer. The writer could have created an interesting character (one with an excellent computer skills), who had a computer that was in working condition, and who could use his/her skills to solve the problems in the story.   This book is filled with mistakes, errors and typos that take away from the story and make the reader feel as if the writing is rushed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't say that I enjoyed this book, but I didn't hate it either.  There are many good things to say about the book: great character development, interesting plot, well-developed characters, etc.  But the author did not understand what an awesome roleplaying game was, because the book only gives a single example of the actual play of an SRD game in the first few paragraphs.  So he made the reader have to learn the game from scratch just to understand the author's description.  If I were playing the game and wanted to change some things I might say that the book got the mechanics correct, but the lack of examples really took away from the book.  Overall, the book does a good job of getting players to pick up a set of basic rules without having to make a huge investment of time, but at the expense of having no examples.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book twice and I'm still not sure what the author was trying to do. The plot is interesting and the characters are well written, but this is a difficult book to put down. The book is split in three different parts, and each part has a different focus. In the first part, the main character (a woman) moves out of a large house and into a small house to be closer to her family. It's very easy to empathize with her because of the situation. Her family lives in poverty and she has no family in her new community. It takes a while for the story to change from the first to the second part, but the story is not much different between the two parts. I would have liked a better breakdown of the first two parts so that I could tell how different they were. In fact, I still have a lot of questions about the first three parts. The ending was confusing, and the last paragraph left a lot to be desired.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The books is over long I got the book back and it was a shame I got it when I did because it was one of the best books of last year and I loved it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an absolute waste of time.  It would have been great if the writer just gave us a full explanation as to what happened to the characters after the original series and then gave us an even more interesting world and characters to work with but instead she just dumps us right back into the story with the same boring characters we've already seen.  If you have read anything by this author in the past I hope it was the first book because I don't think this is her best work.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read several of the novels by the author of Dune and found them to be amazing, but this latest book in the series, Dune Messiah, left me wanting more.   From the description of the plot, I was expecting a long novel that would follow a group of characters.  Instead, I got a book that was just as lengthy as its predecessor.  There were several plot points that I found rather stupid, and the story lacked a lot of character development.  The book also has a ton of science, but the details didn't seem to be explained well.  I found the characters to be bland, and I felt the story had gone off the rails.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm very disappointed with this book, as I was looking forward to having a good reading experience, as the author wrote a lot about religion, but this book really didn't give me that experience. This was a very short book with no clear point. I did enjoy the first part but after that, I was bored. It was not that there was no good point, because there were. The problem is that this is a one volume book, and the book was very short. This made it easy to skip parts that could have been good, but it didn't make up for the book being so short.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is a bit too complicated for my taste, which is to say that it wasn't all that compelling from a character standpoint (the main character is the main character and you can tell what he's like with no further exposition). The story, however, is very well-done.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not bad. I bought the book to have as a reference for when I teach my son how to shoot the bow. I found that I was a little let down by the illustrations. I liked the drawings but the colors were off and a few were just silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was terrible! I have to admit that I was hoping this would be a "funny" book, like the books I read before it, but, no. It is actually awful, and really, really poorly written. I guess it was supposed to be funny and light hearted and "easy" to read, but instead, I spent the majority of the time wishing that I had my own copies of the books that I read the first three books in the series, so I could make a good use of these chapters. It was not even the story that was bad, but the writing, the characterizations, and how the story was being presented.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a person who is diagnosed with brain cancer, but who lives in fear of dying. The author gives us a few anecdotes about the person's life, but they are not given the emphasis they need to really develop the character. This book needs a bit of editing to bring it up to my standards of what a good book should be.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is bad. The characters are all just kind of flat. They've got some pretty interesting ideas but the execution falls a little flat.   Overall, I didn't care for this one.  A newbie reviewer, maybe not a bad one but I can't recommend this book to someone who is new to fantasy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise is great and it's fun to read about a guy who is actually a psychic, who is trying to understand what a woman thinks about him while she's giving him the most beautiful compliments and hassles. However, the character that he has is a complete moron and has no depth whatsoever. The book starts with a great premise and then never really goes anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book. It was a poor read at times. The main character has no personality other than acting the part of an older woman and taking her husband along to have some fun. I wasn't thrilled when the main character took his husband with her when she went to visit her friend's boyfriend in town.   I really had to think a lot to understand what happened, and I guess I didn't feel like I got the main point of the story. The way it was written made it seem like there was a larger lesson but it didn't come across that way at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never read any of the original Harry Potter books.  This is the first time that I have read a book in which the main character is the evil, malevolent one.  I think that the idea that a child like Harry can be both a child and an adult is pretty funny.  When they put the "Harry" in the title, I had to chuckle at the end of the first book.  In my opinion, it took the original series and made it more silly, with the addition of a "child".  The characters are not the best and the plots are not very original or imaginative.  The author has really gone off in the wrong direction.  There is a wonderful world of magic in the wizarding world and a huge world of mystery and adventure, but the lack of any true moral values in the story are very, very disturbing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing that kept me reading this book was the plot. The characters were all shallow and one dimensional. As for the characters being shallow and predictable I have to admit that I have the same opinion as I did in the beginning of this book. The only way they got me interested in the book was by the plot, and the plot was weak. The fact that the author doesn't even understand what she is writing about is bad enough. It's bad enough that she had to waste a lot of time on the book and the characters, it's even worse that the book only gets better in the last two or three chapters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very difficult to understand from beginning to end. The author talks in the first half of the book about the importance of faith in a religion, and at the end she uses an example of a church burning to make her point. The problem is the second half. She talks about how God will punish those who do evil and not reward those who are good. There is nothing wrong with that as long as it's not the end point of the story. Also the characters do not seem to be developed at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book had so many errors and omissions, I had to question the validity of the information given in it, and I found it extremely difficult to believe that this could possibly be a real history of American Indian warfare, especially in the seventeenth century, when such a massive amount of data would have been readily available to anyone. It just never occurred to me that such a thing could exist, especially as the author has apparently spent his career trying to prove the opposite.   This reviewer was thoroughly disappointed, despite the fact that I did not find this book to be of any value. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was hard to believe that this book could have gotten so far from the original. I thought it was going to be a pretty good read because I like the idea of a girl who has an amazing imagination but needs a real friend to help her come out of her shell. The end, however, left me confused and disappointed because of the abrupt ending and the lack of development in the story.  The only thing good about this book is that the cover is a real work of art. - The cover art is just too hard to take seriously. Even the cover of the book itself is just bad. Not that it's bad enough to stop me from buying the book, but it just takes away from the book. There was just too much wrong with the cover and the rest of the content to be worth the money. In Summary:  I'm going to give this book four stars because I'm a fan of the idea and the ending. The rest of it is just weird.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book hoping for a good read that would expand my horizons. I was disappointed by the very poor quality and poor writing in this book. I felt as if I was reading a book that was written by a complete novice. This book has no flow to it, no development of characters, or plot, and is a complete failure from a reader's perspective.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing I didn't like about this book was that I was expecting some sort of historical biography, which is not what this book is. It's more of an interesting look at the history of the Civil War and its effects on the region and its people. The history is interesting, and although the author does a good job of taking you into the battlefield scenes, he fails to show any of the other people or events that shaped the war. I found myself reading some of the historical information, and I don't know if it would be as effective if he had done it in a less dry and analytical way. I can understand the historical setting for this book, but I didn-t find it as engrossing as I thought it would have been.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most boring part of this book is the main character's parents.  Their voices are not strong enough for me to want to listen to them over and over again.   This book is better if you are going to listen but not if you want to have something you can read over and again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was completely satisfied with this book until I came to the conclusion that I should read the previous book to be properly informed. I thought I was familiar with this novel when I started it but after a few pages, I thought, "no, I should have read the other book first."   "     The ending is so lame!   There was so much I was hoping to read and discover and the way the story ends is so pointless.   This book just got me frustrated!  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was super excited to read this. I'd just finished a couple of other books by him and had decided to pick this up to read for fun. But this book was a huge disappointment.  The ending was terrible.  As I said before, this is the last book I ever got from Mr. Martin. This one seems to be the last he ever writes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I read this was because I thought "What a great book, what a great subject, why didn't I learn about this 20 years ago?"   What a waste of time!   I wish I'd never read it! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good thing that came out of this book was the part where a character named Mikey, who is not a child anymore, is sent to live with a group of people who have made a living by having him clean out toilets at local bars.    This book makes you want to puke, and it also makes you very uncomfortable because the book was written by a woman, and the people who wrote this book are so obviously terrible, that the book makes me very uncomfortable.  If I wanted to read about people who make a living on having the "other," I'd read a book about a lesbian couple who make it their life's work to find new women for other men to sleep with.  I do not need to read a novel about two women trying to find men.  It is my opinion that these two books are one in the same. I think they are just trying to make it seem like they are the two authors because they have both published the same novel in the last two years, and I'm not sure why. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of typos and errors.   This should have been put into the appendix at the beginning.  After finishing this book I was disappointed because I was looking for a good historical novel that could explain the events in the early church and the rise of Christianity.  I had to wait three weeks to get my money's worth from this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book, but I did feel like I was cheating because I had to buy the other books to be able to read this one.   The book really isn't bad, but there are too many elements that don't add up and have to be considered.  At least in other books, you know what you're getting.  My only hope for a sequel is that this book is a work in progress, just as the novel is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really don't care for the first part of the book but the rest was ok.   It's a very well written book but it had an obvious lack of originality.  The only part I found interesting was when he was talking about his dad and he talked about him being a man of very few words.  And for that I'll give it 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very interesting book which has a lot of useful information. However, it just doesn't seem to be well written.   This book will appeal to people who are interested in psychology and/or social engineering, and if you are interested, it is probably well worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this in the hopes it would be a good read.   The ending is a bit abrupt, and the character of the main character, the author, is very flat.  He does not make good decisions in the end, and he is very unsympathetic to the main characters (and others) throughout the book.  There is nothing special about this, it is just not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was not a good book. I have been looking for a good adventure story, but have found myself bored and confused in many of my attempts. In general, though, this book was entertaining, but not good enough. It's definitely worth a try if you enjoy adventure stories, and have been waiting for a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While this is the first book I have read on the subject, it is a complete waste of time. It is a collection of anecdotes, some are entertaining but others are just bizarre. The stories of how the people involved died are quite scary and the author's explanations of what happened to them are extremely confusing. The author, who claims to have been a CIA agent and is not afraid to admit this, is a very unreliable narrator. I will not be reading this book. I have already tried to read it but I can't seem to figure out the order of the stories so I can never get through a single one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story, which has its elements well told, is so poor that it would have been better had it been cut out of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is a complete disaster and I cannot figure out what the hell the author is trying to do with the characters or why the world is so screwed up. The last 15 pages were extremely confusing and I didn't understand how things went so wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book was nothing more than a list of tips and tricks that you can find at many websites. It doesn't really teach anyone anything.   The only point it made was to put a stop to the confusion and frustration of learning the ropes.  The writing style was dull and uninspiring."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the story but the plot was so stupid. The hero dies so much, and no reason is ever given why he died. The guy is so useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was disappointing and a bit of a letdown. I had to re-read the whole book just to catch up to the beginning, and I'm glad I read the entire thing. The fact that the plot was so contrived that the author had to spend more time on the boring story, which didn't matter, then write the plot that was the actual story was very annoying and sad.   This book was more fun in my mind than it was in reality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in 2009 and I thought it was great. But in 2017, it's terrible. The pacing is terrible. You're supposed to take a few pages at a time and get the gist of the thing. This is the wrong book for a student in my experience. I read some of the reviews online, and the bad reviews said that it was too dry, too tedious, and that it wasn't really all that science-y. So I was like, "That's what I thought!" But when I went to purchase the book I was disappointed to find that there weren't any reviews online for it, and I had to look on Amazon. There wasn't even a synopsis available. I'm not a fan of Amazon because I have found books to be extremely uneven and not always as good as I expected. This book is a prime example of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand the fuss about this book! I enjoyed reading it very much but I was not impressed with the subject matter. There is much too much "snowflake" stuff about "social justice warriors" (for want of a better term) who need to be "rescued" by the conservative majority (or the white male majority for that matter).      One of the problems with the way the book is written is that the author, an MRA, doesn't present facts or evidence, just insults and slander. The only thing he presents, to my knowledge, is some of the statistics of women on the "slut list" of the PUAs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read and loved this book before. It's written well and is a good read. I still felt I could have done with a little more information on what is happening with the aliens on the planet. The aliens in this book are not as mysterious and as mysterious as the aliens in the movies or books. It seems that the aliens are trying to build a civilization, which makes them less threatening to us and more like an ally. This book leaves me in doubt of the aliens' intentions for us and our planet, and I'm not sure the humans of the future will like the aliens either. There was a lot of confusion, but it was nicely tied up in the last few pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love the style, the themes, and the concept. However, the story is not nearly as interesting as the first two books. The book starts off with an interesting set of characters who are introduced fairly early on but there really isn't much of an overall plot and we're never really sure why any of the characters were so important in the first place. I do like the idea of a group of friends forming a cult with a focus on the paranormal. However the actual stories are not as interesting and I feel that the author is trying to write a supernatural novel with a strong horror slant. If I were to recommend this book I would recommend reading the first few books first because this is not a good book to read right after the first books because the stories do not seem as important as the ones that are in the second and third books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is not a single good word in this book.   You will have to be an expert in the field to understand the techniques used in this tome. The author is not an expert.  The author does not understand, does not do, and does not show.  It is a work of non-originality that reads like a copy of a textbook, and I'm not sure if I am supposed to find it interesting or amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book expecting some "big name" author or someone famous to give it his or her stamp of approval.  It's just not there. I would have rather seen the author put more effort into writing than he did into putting words on the page.  I got most of what I wanted in this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is completely implausible.  It's a story about an imaginary alien who steals a book from a library, then turns around and destroys the universe when the book is destroyed.  I found the characters flat and uninteresting.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is that I found some interesting links to the historical events described. However, there was nothing special about them and they weren't even accurate, the only interesting point was the information on the German's that lived in the Ukraine during WW2. As for the authorship of the book, I have no idea but I'm glad I read it, I don't read many historical works because I don`t know many interesting things to read but this book definitely was worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry, but I'll never be able to read anything by J.K.Rowling again. She's the author of the 'Harry Potter' books and has a terrible sense of humor.   This book is boring and repetitive.  I was expecting Rowling to have a witty book and instead it was just boring. I didn't even enjoy the humor. She should really write another book about Hogwarts as she is a great author and this book is just boring!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not expecting much from this book.  I had read other reviews about it.  They all said the same thing, that it was good, but nothing special.    It seems that most people reading this are going to get a better deal by reading it than by reading the previous reviews.  There was one reviewer who talked about what was wrong with the first 50 pages.  She said they were boring and were only showing us the beginning of the adventure.  My review is more than that.    This adventure starts really well.  The first book was a bit of a bore to me, but it showed me what was possible and what I could do if I just wanted to learn a little more about magic.  This book is a better version of that.   If you are not interested in magic and want to learn what the world is about and what you are capable of.  Then this book is what you have been looking for.  Recommendation:  Very Highly Recommended  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a mix of good ideas, bad ideas and bad writing. It tries to tell the story of the lives of two children who are caught up in the war between the Nazis and the Russians. The idea of a child being taken to another dimension is a new concept for me. The children are portrayed as bad, stupid and rude and yet still go to work for the Nazi party. Their mother is a bad role model for children as well, but I would have loved to see more from her. I wish that the book went in a more humorous direction.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My only complaint about this book is the fact that the book's title is misleading, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, but I think I can see how it could be misleading for the average reader. I didn't realize that all this time I thought of the book as " The First 100 Days: A History of Presidential Leadership " (which is just what it is) when it should have been called "The First Hundred Days: Presidential Leadership 101" because it really is not an exhaustive or comprehensive work. It's a very good overview, but a bit dry, lacking in a little depth and leaving out too much. As someone who's taken a more detailed look at the American presidency since the beginning of the new millennium, this was a great refresher. But I guess my advice would be to look elsewhere for more in-depth and detailed biographies.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in one sitting with nothing else to do. I was bored and could not put the book down.   It was just too repetitive. I wish I would have saved my money and bought a different book instead of wasting my money on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most enjoyable part of the book was the story about the cat that lived in the car for 5 years with his owner and eventually died in the accident.   However, the story line became very predictable, and I don't understand why a cat with so much personality and potential should not have made it.  I wish I could have read more! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was terrible. The story was just plain boring.   I can't see how this book has even reached the shelves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book had been sitting on my shelf for a while when I heard about it and then finally started reading it.   It is about a boy who was sent by his dad to his grandparents to have an examination done on him. I am in no way an expert but from the first chapter it was clear that the boy was being abused.  At the end of the chapter there is a warning that all abuse of children is wrong. That this book is in fact not very good.  I was disappointed but I am sure that most of my readers will be as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read, and I'm not pleased with it at all.   First off, there was a typo on page 2 where the author's title should have been, "The Power of Grit."   Secondly, I didn't enjoy how the book felt to me.  This was my first foray into the world of self improvement books, and this book felt rushed to me at the end.  My biggest problem with the book was how the author felt he/she had to "improve" himself/herself by becoming a "super achiever."  The author spent too much time talking about his/her accomplishments, but then never provided a solution to anything he/ she failed to accomplish.  I understand the book's goal is to improve yourself, but not by writing self-help books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing worth saying about this book is that it is a very well done book. That is all it has to be, a well done story and a very good story.   For that it gets an 8 out of 10, I would give it a much better score but I am pretty sure that the author has been using this same formula for decades and it is really just a recycled work with a new cover, although it seems it would be good if the author would use this one for a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a book I have read enough times to really care about what is going on in it. However, I have given it 3 stars based on the title alone and I believe the synopsis is pretty spot on. If you are looking for a quick read that does not have much of a plot, this is not the book for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought the original because I heard it was good and I wanted to read something new.   It was boring and tedious.  I gave it three stars because I don't think I would give the original three stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a great book, but the ending was terrible. It didn't really fit with what happened in the rest of the book, which is nice.   I liked the beginning, but in the end I found it pointless and a waste of the time I spent reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book and I wanted to read more of it, but the main character seemed very much like I have read before, so I gave it a 1 star.  I can understand that it was a difficult story to write, and I suppose that this book needs to have all the right things, but in the end, it just doesn't fit me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of errors and misquotes, and has no relevance for the purpose of being a science textbook.   It's not written by a chemist or chemistians.   I was pretty disappointed with the book since it is only 100 pages. It didn't take me to the places I was looking for and I would like it if you made some corrections to the errors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I will probably read more books, but I do not recommend this book to anyone. It is full of inaccuracies and it is hard to follow the story. It could have been better."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A novel that tries to teach you about life's problems but is so vague and uninformative that I feel like I've read it before.   It is a good book though and I got the same out of it I have from most books I read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If this book is as good as they say it is, then I am going to have a very difficult time stopping.  I have the old paperback and I am sad to say that it has not aged well.   A lot of the information in this book, if you look at it closely enough, was pretty much common knowledge when I was in school.  My mother is still teaching at a local college and she's a smart lady (and she's not a skeptic by any means.) So I was a little skeptical of the claims being made.  This book was a lot of information and very hard to sift through, but I did find a couple of things that I thought was worth repeating.  First,   the people that you're going to find that will agree with you are always going to be on the fringe.  Second,  the idea that we are living in the end times is something that I can see being valid in some way.  It's just very hard for me to believe in something that has been going on for so long.  Overall   I am extremely disappointed with this book.  If you are going to read it, do it with a book bag or on a good quality, soft, non-toxic, waterproof paperback. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book about a great woman. I'll read more if it's the author's next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book as part of my pre-teen reading group, and it was just the worst book that I have ever read. I found all of the characters to be awful, and all of their behavior to be uncalled for. I didn't get what the girl was going on about, and the way she was described in her narration was so weird and ridiculous that it was unbearable.    Overall, it was an extremely bad book, and I can't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very dull book. While some of the facts were factual and the pictures looked great, most were flat out wrong. The author is no George Orwell, but there is a serious flaw in the book. In the book, America and Canada are called "Canada" and "America." This is a little bit strange as the U.S. is one state in Canada.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so surprised and happy when I finished this book. I have had to make it through the entire trilogy. It wasn't until recently that I decided to read this one. I am in the process of re-reading it now because of a friend who is a huge Tolkien fan.   It was amazing!    The characters are rich and detailed and the plot is fast paced and exciting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have always been fascinated with the stories behind these classics (and I read them all), so I was happy to finally get to see a movie that did a good job with them. I did not think the acting was very good, however.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about people who were either trying to be a little bit more positive or trying to fit in. In my opinion, the book is too negative and not enough positive. I'm sure it's nice to be different and different isn't necessarily good but it takes a lot of courage to write a book like this. I did learn a lot about the world and I've learned that if you want to be successful, there is nothing wrong with just wanting to be the average guy. For this book, it's a nice idea, but it didn't really translate. I guess that's the main problem I have with this book.  I hope someone can read this book and use it to motivate themselves and others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think any book is worth it if you're only going to read it once.    After reading the first few pages of this book, I felt like I was on the bus with someone and had just gotten off (the bus ride was the worst part of the trip).   The last page was like I had gotten off the bus and was reading the last few pages for the hundredth time.  I gave it 4 stars instead of five because I wanted to finish it so bad, but I guess I'll be giving it only 3 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story doesn't go anywhere, the protagonist, when you think about it, isn't interesting at all, the writing is horrible, and I felt a lot of disappointment after reading.  I didn't really like the plot either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a very well-researched and written treatment of one of the great political leaders of the 20th century, Adolf Hitler, by a prominent Jewish journalist. In that regard, it succeeds. However, it does not address the underlying cause of Nazi atrocities, which were the result of political opportunism and egoism. And in my opinion, it is not clear to the lay reader what Hitler was up to and why he did the things he did. The book fails to explain these things fully and convincingly enough to be an effective teaching aid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought the book to read for a class assignment and I must say that I was disappointed with it. While the book does explain why all these bad things happen, it does not provide any solutions for anyone. The only solution is to be better in everything and anything that you do. This book is full of clichés and I never felt like I was getting a solution to the problem that I am presented with.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book started off good, but the ending was terrible. I really hope they make the next one better.  The last thing I want is to hear one more book of the same old type. What a waste of time! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very bad book. I have not yet started the first book, but from reading the reviews I would say that I would rather wait for the other books in this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so glad I listened to this book and read it. I'm a very lazy reader and this book would never have made it to me without the audiobook. I really liked it. The premise was pretty cool but it wasn't realistic. I think I'll read another book that actually follows a character and has something more to them besides being the best. The ending was disappointing. I would have liked to hear more from my character, but the story went way too fast and then I realized that I never heard the end of it (which I really thought the story was over). However, I do think that this is a good introduction to the world. It's kind of long but it should be read after you've read one of the series and have more of an idea about the world and people. I'd give it 3 stars, but that's it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sad to say this book is horrible. It's a series of stories that are nothing but trash, full of ridiculous characters, and has no story whatsoever. This book is not good enough for me to waste my time with.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Very poor writing. I did not enjoy the experience of reading this book. I found that the writing style and prose were very awkward and did not have any impact on my opinion on the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not very good. It is interesting to hear about a real life story, but the writing style and plot are very bad. I found this story to be the worst and most boring in the whole series. The book was a waste of time and money. I don't recommend the book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book difficult to read and I could not understand why all the characters were so obsessed with sex and such.   This is a fantasy so why make the book so sex-oriented? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can understand the frustration of having to use an app such as this, but as soon as it crashed I knew it was broken. My wife and I both downloaded the book to see what we were missing, but found out it wasn't as comprehensive as we hoped. The author claims she's been a lawyer for 30 years, but it seems as if most of the information came from an internet blog.   Overall, not worth the price!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole thing is so boring and predictable. There is no plot.   There are no twists or surprises or suspense.  My only complaint is that I had to wait until the last 3/4 of the book to find out if the woman in the book is supposed to be dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think I gave this book a 3 and a half because I had a lot of problems with it.   This is not a review of the book, or of the work of any of the other authors, but of the overall concept of the story.  The whole concept is bad because the main character is really a terrible person. I've always felt that the good hero is usually a bad person.  His name is John Carter.  If I wanted to be good, I would have been a good person from birth.  I wouldn't be this evil for some reason.  He would have learned that killing for no reason is wrong.  This has been an issue with the first two books I read, as well as many other stories of this type.  They are not only a bad idea, but they make no sense.  One example of this is when John Carter (who hates his life) gets the same thing he has been asking for, a spaceship that is going to take him to some far off planet.  Then it changes it to a different planet. Now I understand that the book does want to be fun and fun and all, but I think it is a big stretch to say that the ending is the best ending.  It ends at the end of a book instead of with a "well it was the best part anyway" ending. It seems that the author is trying too hard to make it seem like the ending has the best of both worlds.  And in the second book it ended in the worst way possible.  In the end you are just left with a bad feeling, not having been given a good ending. The concept is really good if you want to write a horror story.   But it is really hard to follow through on the idea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best thing about this book was the excellent narration by the narrator of the author, David Foster Wallace. It was a great reading.   -The book was a bit disjointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this as part of my college education for a great price, but when I got it home and opened it the book was wet.   The pages were sticky and the book fell apart.  I would never buy from this company again, and will keep my other books out of their catalog. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I was invited to be a guest at a wedding in a different part of the country. When I arrived there was no sign of the bride or the groom so I went to the reception to find out what happened. I thought the story was interesting and it sounded as if the groom had some issues with his wife so I purchased it for my book shelf.   In reality I was expecting to find this book interesting and thought the author would write a really nice book about the difficulties that come with marriage. Instead I ended up reading the book because it was the only thing I had left in my shelf after I spent $20 on a book that was basically a love story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are so many good stories in this one that I was having trouble keeping up with the plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only problem I had with this book was that the main character was really annoying.   I just hate having to have to think about a guy that seems like he's gonna be annoying the whole book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has been a disappointment. This book is full of bad ideas and the authors clearly didn't care about telling a good story. I didn't really enjoy reading this book because of the ideas in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading this book, I couldn't put it down. The story is amazing. I would give the story a 10 out of 10. It is a well written, well paced and easy to understand story. However, the characters are not well developed and they just do not make sense. I understand the plot but the characters make no sense at all. I know that this book has been on my Kindle for awhile so I'm not sure why the author would not have gotten it right. All in all, it is a good book but just didn't make sense at first.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My family and I read this book together on my Kindle. We were expecting an adventure novel, but got something else. It was a horrible disappointment.   It took the reader to another world, but made them hate their life.  It is filled with the most uneducated and unproductive people in history.  I was very disapointed with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very dissapointed when I started reading this book.  I liked the previous three books in the series and this one I felt was the weakest. The characters were interesting but none of the characters were able to develop as much as the previous book (I liked all of them very much) and the plot was weak.    It was not clear to me why this is happening.  The last two books had a much more important character in them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are like a good book for teens, but the content was just too much for me, even after a good deal of research, it was difficult to understand what the big point of the story was and the ending just ruined it all for me.  I read this book to my son, because I wanted to let him know what books he should read, I wanted him to see if it was true that books like this could make him into a writer. I guess I was hoping that the fact that the author is not really a writer, and also because she writes books that have characters that look like kids is a good thing. But boy was I wrong.   I would have read it to him if the cover was not so ugly, and there wasn't a single character that looked like a 14 year old.  I bought this book because I loved The Hunger Games, and I thought it would be interesting to read it as a grown up, so I could see what the "real" world looks like. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that it is not as easy to get children into books as I thought.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first book in the series was a fun read for the most part.  The main character is a pretty decent guy.  However I wasn't sold on the plot and did not feel like I had the story figured out as well as some others.  I don't really know why I thought the plot was bad, it was just that I didn't feel like the plot progressed as well (yet).  I still like the books as a whole.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main characters have a very limited ability to use magic and yet it ends up being incredibly boring.   I wanted to see them kick the door in and beat some asses, instead they were stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere.  I guess that's ok because the author tried to write in the magical side of things but it felt like it went over the top, with nothing really happening. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book at a Barnes & Noble for $6.00. I'm glad I did. The author does a good job of making the characters in this book likable. The story has some elements of horror and suspense. I wish the book was longer but I can't really say it was too bad. The characters were interesting. It was kind of hard to read for me because the dialogue was so cheesy. Overall, I liked it and will definitely buy the next book in the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I read this book, I was in a serious relationship and had just found out about an open relationship. I was having a blast with it until I realized I wasn't actually being open. I did some research and realized I had no idea what I was talking about. It took a long time for my head to realize I could just never be completely honest with someone when I am in a relationship. This book has more of a positive vibe than the author intended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried a new method of writing poetry, and while I liked the results, the book was terrible. I was too lazy to finish the book and I'm not a fan of poetry so this was disappointing.    I'd be happy if I could pick out a better book, but I don't think I've found it yet.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a terrible, dreadful book - a waste of time that takes us into the "otherness" of a race where we're told in detail that they can't have families, they can only have sex with animals, they are all ugly. I'm really disappointed by this book. I have no idea how I'm going to learn about it. I will probably just pick it up again at some point and just read about what we're supposed to believe about this one.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to give this a 2 stars because it was a bit clunky and boring.   In all honesty, it was probably the only book I read this year that wasn't just a dry list of statistics, so I was surprised to see that it had to have a good chunk of information about statistics.  It was interesting how the authors used these statistics to create their graphs, but once they got to the charts, they didn't look that interesting.  I think the author of this book might be better off publishing their data as data sources on the web rather than trying to sell you the book as a book of statistics.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When this book came out I was already a die hard fantasy lover, but I found it very slow. I've heard that the book was written as a series in order to save money, but this is one of those books that's not the first installment of a series. It's a single book, so it doesn't cost anything more to read and I was disappointed. The series would have been better if they had kept the story going in a different direction.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has a lot of positive reviews, but only 4 stars. Some reviews refer to it as a thriller, but it's not. I think the author was trying to make a psychological thriller, which has a huge gap between what the reader believes is happening and what actually occurs in the story. This book is very interesting, but doesn't deliver on the potential it's built on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wish I had read this book sooner, because the first half of it was very boring.   While there was something that sounded very interesting at the beginning, the book's style made it difficult to get invested in the plot.  It was a little too similar to the Twilight series, especially as the story progressed.  Also, the romance in the second half is a bit weak.  Overall, I was disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, she spends a lot of time on the various ways in which the modern state could be better and is also very specific about the role of state power in providing public goods like education, healthcare, and pensions. But most of the book focuses on how the modern welfare state would not really be any better without the state. It would still be run by the private sector. That's fine, as long as we're not talking about how much more of the state's power we can get if the government had more money (which I don't think that's a very compelling argument), but it doesn't really help us understand the nature of government as it exists today. This book was published when my own research (on pensions, health insurance, and so on) was beginning to take off, so I had very little experience with the ideas discussed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author does a great job of describing what she saw in the area and it helps a lot in understanding the context of the place.   Unfortunately the text was so difficult to follow I couldn't concentrate on the content and it took a long time to understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was great but the writer and narrator are lazy. When you get right down to it, these are two very lazy people writing a book. They do not even try to be convincing. They have very little skill in the writing. I understand they are working at home but in order to really do the job right and get it right, you would have to come up with something original. This book is basically the same crap over and over again.   5.5 stars based on my rating (and this is after reading the first 2/3 of it and then deciding to skip on to the second half and the rest of the book for good measure) This is not what I expected to get out of a romance/dramatic novel. The ending was great, and it set up a lot of things that I had hoped to see, but I expected more than what I got. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was interesting and the action scenes were well done but the ending left me confused.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed to find this was written by a man. This book is a bit old school, and I was expecting some more modern approach. In fact, it seemed like the author had not read any of the modern feminist books, as if this book was written as if there had been no feminism in this country in the 80s and 90s. The lack of knowledge on gender roles is apparent in many parts of the book. For example, there is not a single page where the female character speaks, despite being a strong, dominant character who does most of the talking, and has a large role in the plot.  This book also doesn't deal with women in power as much as it does with women as victims.  In a few parts, this makes sense, but in most parts, it makes no sense at all.  The female characters are weak, and the male characters are strong.   Although I think this book could have been written by someone else (I'm looking at you, Kate Chopin), it could have used more gender diversity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't know much about chemistry but this book is really bad. There are so many wrong ideas and poorly explained things. They talk about how things are made and how you can get some from a simple chemical reaction and that is wrong.   There are some really dumb ideas like why they have a "chemical bath" and why you can't take the chemicals back to school with you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of Mark Lawrence's works. I have read the first three books and can say that each one has its unique charm. The book series takes place over the span of three novels. After each one is completed I have a hard time getting through the next one and it took me six weeks to get through the entire series.   The writing is good, but unfortunately the plot is flawed.  The main character is only a minor character and the plot makes absolutely no sense. I'm guessing that was Lawrence's intention with the plot and it seems he couldn't achieve it. I don't think I'd recommend it to someone who is in the middle of a Mark Lawrence trilogy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very strange book. This is not a book that has something to say; it doesn't even begin to tell you how to feel about your life. This book is a collection of thoughts and rants by someone who has a lot to say and doesn't have anything really good to say. It's like she was trying to say something important in a very unusual and inappropriate way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because of the rave reviews in the local newspaper and I had a chance to read it on the Kindle.   In the end, it was not a bad read, it's just that the writing was a bit off in spots.  I also think the premise of the book was pretty interesting and that the story got out of control, but I think it could have used a bit more editing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book I have become much more suspicious about the value of high end computers and high end software in general.   I think that the main problems in this book are twofold.  First, the author claims that the problem is caused by the low density of software (i.e. less programs per person).  This isn't entirely true since in this instance there are only 13,800 users out of a population of 8,500,000.  The second problem is more of a philosophical one.  This book seems to make a big deal about how programmers and programmers should be more aware of the software they use.  But there is really no evidence that more awareness leads to better quality software.  I feel that most software developers are too focused on optimizing their own code to spend the time and energy to get to know the tools that they are using.  If you are interested in learning about programming or just want to read an entertaining book about the history of computing then this is a worthwhile read.  Overall I would give this a 2.5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My friend and I read this book after we'd been doing some reading of similar type and had been left quite unsatisfied.  There's plenty of good in this book, as I mentioned, but a lot of it comes at you with a lot more 'I know, I know, don't worry, that's not what he said, see?' and 'you don't need to take my word for it' and 'it was easy to read' and I had to look over a couple of pages to find out what 'I don't know what he did or said that was so wrong', and 'but we all have to make mistakes to become good' and then he went on and on and I just wanted to put down the book, even though I really liked it at the end.   There are also a lot 'I see what you mean' and other things I read in other reviews that made me feel it was written by a child, so I'm not sure this is going to be for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story starts out fine, but this book starts to feel like a waste of my time. I was hoping the author would continue the story.  I would love to see what happens if the author decides to continue this story. It seems like the author is going to follow up with a sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book. I'm embarrassed for the teacher I had to teach it.   I'm so ashamed to think I went to college and taught this to a bunch of people.  I hope they never have to use this textbook or another textbook in this series because it's so ridiculous that I can't believe I'm having to use it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason why I continued reading this book is because I am on my way to reading this one   -   I just realized that the first line of the book is 'I am a terrible friend' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read and loved so many books on cooking and life.   But this one is not about cooking, but about food history!   The author is right, the subject matter is excellent, but not for the food world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a story that is not true. The author, as far as I am concerned, is the biggest liar in the world. I bought this book, expecting to read something great, but I was disappointed. I was a fan of some of his other books and I was going to read this in order to get his other work on my shelves. However, this is not the case.   The characters are all in an exaggerated caricature of themselves, there is no real development and the writing style is horrible. The story is completely overblown and unnecessary and the plot is a mess.  I gave it 4 stars because I loved a book and read it twice to see if I enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was so much going on that I thought this book would be one of those I'd read only once and then forget. But there's so much happening in this book that I'm already looking forward to the next. I hope the next book I read has more than this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good read if you're looking for something to read, but I couldn't finish it because I kept getting stuck on the same two characters.   I'm not sure why I kept reading but by the time I was halfway through it became tedious to go through the same scenes again and again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was a little too much about her being right. For someone with this kind of power, it should be more about how right and wrong people should be, and what those differences should mean to them. She has a great idea that would be very useful for everyone in the world. This book, in my opinion, is about power. She is smart and charismatic. She can get you to accept ideas that most of your life has taught you are completely wrong.   But the end result, in the end, is not about any of that. She does not even seem to be trying to come up with solutions. The book is about her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you ever needed a bad explanation of why your job is so terrible and there's no way you're ever going to get a better job because of it, read this book.   The book talks about the bad bosses, the shitty coworkers, the poor supervisors, the bad coworkers with shitty bosses, etc.  It explains the problem so it makes sense and there are even graphs and tables for you to look at and understand. I would never take advice from this book if the problem were something that is easy to fix. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting more from this book, but the author was way too vague and it doesn't make much sense.  I think it would have been a better story if she was more explicit. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read.   There were so many errors and factual errors I have no idea if the author even wrote them. The typos and wrong info and the lack of story making them pretty useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of Stephen King's The Dark Tower Series (The Gunslinger, The Drawing of the Three, and now The Darkseid War Saga) and I was excited to get my hands on this paperback edition. I have to admit though, that I was expecting a little more from it than this.  It is a fairly slow book, with the exception of a few scenes in the middle of the novel, in which the story picks up speed.   As a fan of King's books, I am disappointed that the King himself does not make a bigger effort to enhance the experience of the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first time I read this book, I was expecting a lot more from it than what I got.  It took me a little longer to get into the story than I thought I would.  The story was definitely not my cup of tea.  There were times where I thought it was boring and time consuming.  However, once I got into the plot, I really enjoyed it.  I hope you'll give this book a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book I have ever purchased from any kind of publisher.  The book is good as an introduction to the material, but doesn't address what a science fiction story is, what makes a good story.  I bought this book as a short story, not an introduction.   No longer on my to-read list.   This book was not good, I got it as a freebie at the library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's sad that some people are trying to ruin the legacy of an important and enjoyable book. I just got out of this book. It's not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be. I can think of only one thing wrong with it:  In the beginning the book is really good. The characters are so relatable and interesting. It doesn't take a lot to understand the character's motivations. I found myself really enjoying what I was reading, and I'll likely recommend this to other people, just because I liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book because it showed us a different side of the world. The author shows that we can have compassion for animals when we are treated humanely. The part that bothers me is that the main character is still in the zoo. I have no problem with that but there was a lack of character development, and most of the other animals were just annoying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The books I bought from this shop were always a bit pricey but I usually get good books. I bought the book on 'The Man Who Fell to Earth' by Arthur C. Clarke for a special occasion but my book did not seem to have that special effect.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was just plain awful. It's not even a really good book, it's just bland and boring. I was really excited about reading it because the author wrote something interesting and different in one of my favorites, The White Tower by Robin Hobb, but this just turned out to be another book I'm not really interested in.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not bad, but the story and characters are horrible.   It's not bad for the story.  A poor writing style and story is a problem.  I would rather read   a book that had a great story instead of   this awful book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never knew how much I really wanted to read this book, but I finally did. It was very hard to put down.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a bit tedious and repetitive and there is not much new in the book.  It could have been much better if the book had been written a little more concisely.  I've learned a lot from the book, but it is very repetitive and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are very well written, but there is not much meat in them.   They don't interact with each other in any way (they all just disappear on different dates and have no history with eachother).   There was nothing to keep my interest except the fact that I am so sad that I can't get this book anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of this book sounds good, but it's not a book. This book consists of a collection of anecdotes and stories from people I know and trust that I was very surprised to find in a book for teens. I thought the premise of the book was brilliant, but the book itself is not that. I guess if you don't care about all the things that are going on in your life and want to find out more about them this is the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was ok, but not really as good as I had hoped.   The writing was very good, but the story wasn't.  It wasn't a bad story, just a very average one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book, but it was disappointing. It's a good read, but for me it fell into the mediocre category. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a collection of short stories that are all very short in length. Most of them are about relationships that start off okay, but then slowly deteriorate into very poor decisions.   One of the main characters, a woman who has been through a lot in her life and doesn't know how to fix her problems, ends up in a horrible situation, and ends up doing the very thing she was afraid to do the first time around. There is a bit of a happy ending for her, but it just seemed like the book was going in a bad direction all along. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot was good but the characters were just lame.   I'd give it three stars but the story just went nowhere and never grew. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very good book for some people, but I found it very confusing for others. The chapters are a mess and there is no end to the book. I am very glad I read it though because I now understand it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were so many good ideas in this book, but it was just so boring. It was basically a long list of things that could be done to improve our society, and some things really weren't that big of a deal, but you knew that you didn't have to read further to get the point.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had no intention of reading this book, but after reading the first two pages I had to,  This book had no appeal to me at all,  It was boring,  Very dry,  No sense of mystery or suspense,  Not my cup of tea,  I just can't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I never buy anything I can't put down. This book sucked. As someone who reads in large part because I like the writing style, I was really put off by the fact that this book never impressed me at all. In fact, it seemed kind of tacked-on and a little too much like a filler. I don't think it was ever really a book I was interested in.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted this book to be amazing, but I wasn't really into it.  There were no surprises at all.  I read it once already (and I'm not even a great reader!).  I had high hopes, but...it was a bust.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In any case, this is another story about a girl who is too busy for anything but sex and shopping. This book was just a way to get some free sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sooooo tired of reading this book.   The characters seem to be written with no depth and the plot is just so predictable that I didn't understand why the author did not just skip from page to page, like an encyclopedia. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I have ever read in my life. I found the book boring and filled with stereotypes, stereotypes about women and women's lack of confidence. This book is very misleading about feminism, and the author fails to even attempt to show the complexities of women's lives. If you need a quick read on how things are different now, read this book! If you really want to learn about feminism and how things have changed, I suggest going to the Wikipedia page and reading about the differences between feminism in the past and now. If your reading this book and you are a feminist, please learn from the fact that there are still many issues with the status quo in the world today. Also, check out my review of the book on Goodreads
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I had read this book earlier in my career, as there are many better books on the topic. I have to say I read this just before the holidays because I didn't think I would find it all that good.   My review   was the same as other people's. I am sad to say that I won't be buying this book in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a book, just the book of what it was. It's not much of a story. It has no twists and turns. There's no real meaning. The characters don't seem real. I did enjoy it and the main character. I found the prose somewhat amusing. There were a lot of laughs but it was really boring at times. Not a great book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the cover art for this book.   This is a well done book which covers a wide range of topics including a book review on this website. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm glad I read this book, but it was only worth reading after I re-read "The Road Less Traveled" a year ago.  It's not really a good book, it's more a "bad book" that was written in the wrong medium, and had little to say in the way of a philosophical or spiritual message.  While there are elements of the "spiritual" that will resonate with people, the book is not a very good spiritual book.  I'd give it 5 stars, but I feel as though this is a bad author at his best, and it's too bad because he's a good writer and has a good way with words. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am writing this review after completing the first half of this book and finding myself completely unsatisfied. It is not that the book is bad, I just found it to be an incredibly dull read. There are no compelling characters, no action, and just a lot of dry material.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second novel in a series by a writer who I found uninspired. In fact, I am so disgusted by this story that I could not put it down to read another. The first book was about an incompetent guy who tried to make a good living and ended up being nothing more than a loser. This book follows him as he tries to make up for his failure. He is very hard to understand, but that's just the way it's written. He never explains why he does whatever he does, but then I realize that's his problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've tried so many of those books, but I'm not really sure if it's worth it. I love the way they are written, but so far it hasn't translated well to the page. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book could have been a great book. The writing was good.  It started off great with a well thought out discussion of the issues surrounding  the history of Christianity and the history and science of the Christian Church.  The problem is that it gets into issues that are  pretty well covered elsewhere.  What I don't like about this book is the lack of a clear analysis of the meaning and value of  the Gospels. The first three chapters are very good on the history but not so much on  the Bible, so that by the time I got to the G-damn-nostles part, I just felt bored.  This book really  is a collection of thoughts from a lot of people and the G and N points are not worth a damn unless you  want to read a great lecture.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is horrible. The writing is terrible, the plot is bad, and the characters are awful. I'm not going to give it three stars because there are other books I could give it higher, but I give it one because it was a great idea but the execution was horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first few pages are good, so I was looking forward to the rest of the book.   I wanted to like it.  It started off on the right foot, though, with an interesting idea and interesting story. But the last third of the story didn't live up to the promise. I kept expecting something new.   The cover of this book is wonderful.  I like it a lot, as it's my favorite cover for a non-fiction book. There are a lot of great quotes and a lot about the world in this book. So far, I really like this book, though I'm still waiting for the third part, "The Future of the Future."  I'm not so excited about this book because it's hard to find on the shelves. I read about it on a news article, though it seems a little out of date. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After waiting a couple years to read this book, I finally had my chance to try the author's writing.   I was pleasantly surprised.  I loved the writing style and thought the plot was good.  The only problem I had was with the ending.  It seemed too convenient and not realistic.  Also, I would have liked more time with the characters.  Overall, it is a good read with some problems but a good first attempt.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only interesting thing in this book was the title. I was looking for a good mystery, and this one doesn't do it.    I'm giving this four stars because I still think that you might like it if you like mystery, but not for long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been meaning to read this for quite some time now. When I finally did, it took me an hour or so to figure out the structure of the book and that made me anxious. I would've preferred it if it was more intuitive or at least didn't have to be so hard to find the right words. I found that after a while I just had to stop looking up things in a dictionary to make sure I was using the right word. Also, after reading about how important language is, I'm still not sure how much I liked the story and why they even bothered with all that grammar (it wasn't as if the grammar was bad, just a bit excessive). This book definitely had some great things about it, however, I feel as though I could have benefited from another chapter or two that focused more on the social aspects of language. If you don't mind a slightly slow pace, this book is a very worthwhile listen.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I dislike about the book is the writing style of the author (if that makes any sense). The plot of the book seemed to be something that was thrown in there for the sake of being a 'bad' book and it was rather uneventful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My husband has read this and it does not have a place in his library.   He bought it at one of the local bookstores and said he was going to pass on it because it wasn't worth the money and he didn't want to waste the time trying to figure it out.  If he were to give this one a chance, he would find the answers that he's looking for but he will not spend the time figuring out what's going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. It was entertaining and the humor was well placed. I got to see the different ways that the characters handled their lives. I feel a little bit sorry for them all.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know that the author is aware of the problems with the book, but it's all too easy to dismiss the book on the basis of the title, and the fact that it is a story of a bad boy with a heart of gold. I am glad that I gave this book 2 stars, but only because the plot is so interesting and the characters interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not happy with this book at all. It was written by a friend of mine and I was afraid she would write a book that would be really good. Well, she did not. If I had the time to read any book I would be on my way to reading the entire works of E.L. James. I really liked the idea of a fantasy novel with a lesbian love story but she totally overreached with this one. The author did a great job of giving us a female POV and putting it together so that we are really on the side of the heroine, but there were too many flaws for me to really get invested in the story. I don't want to go in there for spoilers but I am afraid the ending may be disappointing. It also made me feel like my only hope for the book was to have a woman's side of this story. That is how I was able to stay for the end and I really can't wait to see what is going to happen next. I will probably read the other books in this series but this will be the last one. I hope this book was written at a different time in her life and that she realized what she wrote about was not true. Overall this was a bad read and there is no way in hell I will be reading another one by her.  "A tale of an unrequited love, a young queen's struggle for survival and the curse that befell a dynasty. "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first started reading this book, I felt a lot of apprehension. What do you do when you're an author, and your book is one of those that people love but they can't live without?   I was afraid it would be a typical book about the occult, but in the end it didn't feel that way at all.   The story was very well thought out.  I found this book very challenging and thought provoking.  It's just a shame that I wasn't able to finish it! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started to like this book more as it went along, but I got frustrated by it's inconsistent and sometimes incoherent writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was boring, boring, and boring. I have been thinking about getting a new copy of this book ever since I read it, but this one didn't work for me at all. Not a bad idea, just not my cup of tea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really disappointed that this is the worst book I've ever read. There are some very cool ideas, but this book is not really up to the level I expected from a book by an author who is known to produce good books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read    It's not really a bad read - it's just that it has all the bad parts of all the other books   I don't understand how he got away with all these errors (see: punctuation) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My brother got me this book a year ago and I have been reading it ever since. There were some good parts of this book, but nothing that I really found engaging. The only thing I can think of is that it might have benefited if the author had written a different book.   I got an E.A. Stowe in high school, so I read a lot of his books. This one just wasn't any different than any of his others.   Review written by: Susan
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that I can really think of to complain about is that some people have read it and said it's a very good book but have not done the homework required to find out how good it is or to find the book itself.    I don't have a problem with that - if you read it, good for you - but if you've read many similar books, and none of them actually match it as closely as this one does, that may be a bit of a letdown for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad writing of this book is all over the place. A lot of the things in the text are either wrong, or overgeneralized, or, well, just ridiculous. I didn't find a reason to buy it, so I can't tell you anything I think it can be used for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to reading this book for a long time. I'm glad I finally read it. The writing was very good and the story was engaging. It was very hard to stay focused on the story. At one point the main character had to get off of a moving elevator because the windows made it hard to read. The ending didn't have much meaning to me, but I'm not complaining because I'm a bit too old to start looking forward too much. I'll give it 4/5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete disaster.   It was not a fun read.  The characters were bland.  There was no sense of world building, no real emotion, nothing to really get interested in.  Even the bad guys were just "bad guys", they did not have a real character that made me like or hate them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was pretty good for a few chapters, but then it just starts going downhill. It's like the characters go from being likable to just plain annoying.   In a way, my main problem is that I'm not a big fan of long books, but the two characters were just too flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was bad. It was bad for the simple fact that it was full of half-truths.   I have read several books about the Middle East, but I've never read anything that has been so riddled with half-true claims and half-lies as this one.  Unfortunately, most of the misinformation is on the more outlandish parts of the book, but most of it is on a lot of the important information, so you can't get a good review of it without mentioning a lot.  I read a lot about this topic and I've been following it for quite some time now, but never really came across anything quite like this, and that says a lot because I like to write about what I know, but this book, even though it's been around for awhile, still didn't have that right kind of information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first 5 or 6 pages were great, but by page 9 it's pretty much a rehash of all the things I disliked about the other books. I liked the idea of being an outcast, but I didn't like that the author decided to make me an outcasts' kid.   If you like this book and are looking for a good read this is a solid one, but it might be best as a stand alone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall I found this to be a good book. There was nothing really wrong with it. It was a good read but it wasn't as good as I hoped.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is just a waste of space and a huge disappointment. There are no characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs. I'm very disappointed in this book, and I cannot imagine myself giving this title to my children.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on the recommendation of my friend and fellow sci fi fan.   He really loves space opera and this book sounds a lot like a book he's already read.  However, I found the story tedious and repetitive.  At times the characters felt like cardboard cut outs and at times I couldn't believe the plot even started.  Not the best read I've ever had. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this for my mom. She hates fantasy books so this was a good deal.  She said it wasn't her type, but she had to get it.  It's a good read, but it lacks a lot of good characterization. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The badness of this book makes me doubt what I'm reading.  The writing is horrible.    This is the worst book ever.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not as well written as its subtitle says. There are times when I found the ideas presented in the book very interesting and at other times I found them completely boring and annoying.  I really enjoyed reading this book, but the only reason why I can't give it a 5 star rating is because there were some parts of the book that just made me want to throw the book on the ground.  A review by an unhappy reader:    I really like this book but I have never been able to take to it.   There was one chapter on how to deal with bullies that made me angry and upset.  It wasn't as good as some other sections in the course.  There are a couple of very good chapters about relationships but they are overshadowed by the sections about being a bully and then dealing with that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. I purchased this book hoping for an entertaining read on the side. After I picked up the book I was disappointed. The author claims to be a masterful storyteller but unfortunately his characters are not. The main characters are too dull to the point of having no personality. It is interesting to see how they change throughout the book but they are just cardboard cutouts.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is terrible, and the main character is a bit of a jerk. He takes a couple of different paths through the book and it is annoying to me that we have to learn which path he will take and have to go back and learn all about his back story. This is a good book if you have never read a series before.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book and I am ashamed to say I bought it. In many ways I feel like the book is a sequel to The Devil in the White City. I had heard of the author and had seen him in person several times (in person he was very nice) but never knew him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am really disappointed with this one. It's the only book I have read by this author and I've read a few. This one is nothing like any of those. I was expecting more from the author, but this book is disappointing on every level. The plot line was interesting, but it's just too convoluted to make sense and the characters are boring and undeveloped. I can't help but feel sorry for the characters and I can only hope the author writes another book because this one was a big letdown.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was a flop. The author was an amateur with a huge ego.   A story, which was supposed to be about the first woman to run the Olympics was more like the second to run her. The man who ran the first half-century was no longer alive when she won the second half. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you haven't had a chance to read the book yet, then I'm going to say right now that you should not buy it.  The book is a really bad read, even by a former "Hollywood reporter"  If you haven�t had a Chance to Read the Book Yet, Then I'm Going To Say Right Now that You Shouldn�t Buy It.   I have had an opportunity to read most of the reviews by some of the reviewers, and I agree with the majority of them. I found this book to be a really dull, rambling mess with lots of boring details and plot-progression that is completely unbelievable. I'm not talking about the character development (which was very good), but the "what the heck happened?" type of questions I had while reading the book. I wish I could give zero stars because the book is truly awful, but it�s a great read for the money and it�ll get your attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, which I am about to give my rating, is so dull and boring that I couldn't even finish it.  It is extremely disappointing and doesn't have that spark that one hopes for from reading a book. I wish I could give it one star but this book doesn't even get a one.   I thought this book would be better if the author included some action and some tension to the book instead of just a simple story about a girl that is being stalked by an evil witch and a group of men.  I would give this book 2 stars but since it was my first time reading it I'm not too familiar with the world of books and so i didn't enjoy it as much as i thought i would.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so wrong it's funny. The author's first step was to write a novel about the assassination of John F. Kennedy that was so false and contrived and full of holes that it would be laughable if it weren't so sad. I am not a conspiracy buff so I can't explain all the crazy theories the author spins out of thin air but I can say that he seems to think that the Kennedy assassination was somehow linked to the fact that the CIA was using the drug LSD and that the US military had a major drug problem in the 1950's.  " I am the king of drugs and I am god. All you have to do is fuck me and your life will change" "I am the emperor of the underworld. I have created this world. I give the orders and I give my slaves the power. I do whatever I want and I can make anything happen.   The CIA has a major "drug problem" in the 50s and 60s. In fact the drug trade was the number one industry in the USA and it wasn't just the CIA either, it was other government agencies too. In some ways I felt that this book was just as bizarre as all the other conspiracy books out there. It's like he was trying to prove some weird "myth" but failed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a piece of shit.   It is nothing more than an expensive list of things that you do not want to buy, all packaged up in a neat and tidy fashion.  The only good thing about this book is the fact that I am forced to have an argument with my wife over it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of bad ideas.  I love the "Dictionary of the Dead," but this one takes the dictionary concept in a really bad direction.   This book is not really about the dead, but about how the living communicate with the dead to learn information.  And it is just way too long for a good dictionary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed.  The author makes little sense and spends most of the book arguing about the meaning of words and the role of symbols in language.  It is not clear whether he is a linguist or an idiot.  I had to go to the bibliography to find a passage where I had figured out what he was talking about.   Also, I thought I was the only one who noticed that he repeatedly mispronounced his own name (which I am sure is only the case because he has difficulty learning to pronounce it), but I am probably wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In all honesty, I feel like this was written for an audience of people who love Harry Potter.  I loved this book and found myself humming through it and I will definitely be reading the other four, but I was disappointed in the plot and characters.  The main character had a huge flaw.   But he was so charming and I loved him in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has no redeeming features. I don't want to go into details, but I'm having some really hard time keeping my sanity through this book. The only reason I'm sticking with it is because of the story, but it's very hard to continue reading once the story becomes repetitive.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a really good book. It gives you a good overview of the subject and shows that it is not all about "psychological" issues, but that many of the problems in our society, particularly social     problems, stem from the fact that most people are not psychologically well. It shows how a person's   psychological 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a book about a man who goes on a quest to cure his wife of her blindness, in which she has been blind for 20 years and he, in a desperate attempt to cure her of her ailment, goes to all sorts of crazy places. It made me laugh a lot, but unfortunately it didn't make me a better person.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem with the book is that it is so dull that it does not allow the reader to be swept away. The characters are so uninteresting and the dialogue is so cliche that the reader can't care about anything and the story is not exciting or interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So, it's a book I bought to take to a convention and then never got a chance to read.   It is a story of a girl who falls for a guy who is not what she wanted.  I got the message in the book that she was the problem, but that is just not the case.  The book was not very good or well written and I don't get why I gave it a three star.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no'real world' experience I have ever had, except for the few times I was in the military.  There are some "how-to" books available.  This book is nothing but a bunch of "how's".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this one. I was hoping for a more interesting story. Unfortunately, there wasn't much interesting in the story. I feel like there should have been more action and maybe a bit of romance, but it wasn't there.   The narrator sounded really annoying and the whole book was a bit repetitive.  I think I was expecting more from the author and I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not as good as I thought it would be.  The main character is a bad character and the ending is very unsatisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first time I read this book, I thought it was boring and predictable. This book is full of repetitions and predictable plot-lines that lead to a very predictable ending.   This book definitely needs to be read for those who enjoy historical fiction that is just too much for them to bear. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book very confusing, and not in a good way.   To tell you the truth, it took me a while to understand what the author was trying to say, and the "graphic" format made it a bit hard to understand.  I will admit I enjoyed the story and characters, and I did like the book as a whole. But, for me, the "candy shop" scene in the middle of the book was quite confusing.  At the same time, I enjoyed it as a way to add some light and fun to the story.  For me, it was just a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some amazing images and writing, but they are mostly out of context and seem to be created with a specific target audience in mind, like children. There are so many things that were not said well, and some of it was downright offensive. I really wanted to love this book but I had a hard time doing so.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry that the book did not live up to my expectations, but in the end it wasn't bad at all. The story was very good and the ending was brilliant. The only negative thing is that the narrator was a little slow in describing the events and what happened in the story, but he could have used a few more lines as well. Other than that, this book is a good read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was surprised to find that many reviewers thought this book was bad.   First of all the book is not that bad, it's just very unreadable, because it's trying to be deep but it ends up being very short and very dense.  While it's a little hard to read, the prose is easy to follow, the book has some great ideas and interesting characters, and the writing style is really cool.  However I think that it's kind of disappointing to see the author use too many words, because I know how hard it can be to write for a long time.  I recommend this book as an introduction to fantasy literature, it has a nice plot and some good character development.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book because I wanted a book on the history of the Catholic Church. However, I find that I don't understand any of the history in this book. I found nothing new or enlightening.   What interested me is the book's discussion on the Second Vatican Council and the reforms. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had hoped I was getting a good book, but I have to admit that this book is poorly written. The narrator speaks with a very thick accent, and she seems to be trying to sound sophisticated. In fact, her accent sounds like it was ripped from a cheesy 1950's movie. The story is boring, and I had no interest in the characters, and the story was just way too long.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Very poor story. Very unoriginal and uninteresting. The characters were interesting but it didn't mean anything. They weren't complex. It didn't make me want to read the rest of the series but that was the only thing. I found it boring. Read more
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. It had good things about it, but it lacked some things that I would want in a novel. There were things about this story that I didn't think were as good as they could be, so that was a bummer. The writing was good, but I think it was just a bit too long and not really that exciting. Overall, it's worth the read, though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a 1 because there was too much back story and not enough of the story in the beginning. I had to reread several times because I kept reading about how the "real" story began to take place after I was a "child". After the first couple of chapters I was so confused that I just couldn't read anymore. I would have preferred a shorter book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was boring.  I just finished it.  It had the same story every other book does. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I liked this book, but I found it was just too long for me.   It wasn't difficult to get through the beginning of the book, and then it took forever to get to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A complete disappointment. This book was horrible. It was an overpriced waste of money. I am disappointed and I would not recommend it to anyone.  "If you can't find a copy of this book on your local bookstore, I highly recommend a search for this website."  (From the "Customer Service" section of a bookseller's web site)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not much of a fan of non-fiction, but the book I got this week about the decline of the French Republic was very informative. Very interesting book, and very useful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just as horrible as the movie it's based on, and as boring.  The writing in the book is the same and the characters are all the same - the one exception is the narrator, who is different than the movie's narrator.  As for the story, it's all about the people in the school who are trying to get in.  No one in the middle, no one in high school.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a waste of time, as it's an unnecessary step before writing the rest of the book.   The author spends a lot of time on the description, but doesn't go back to the first chapter and tell us who this person is, what their life has been like, what's changed in their life or if they ever had any problems in the past.  If this is your first book and the author spent more time on a good book than an unwatchable one, then your book is going to suck.  It was kind of nice to read an author who is a big fan of a particular TV show that you love, and he tries to explain the similarities.  He also tries to do the same for a show that has a long running cast, but that doesn't work.   Overall: 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall, I'm a little disappointed. The book seemed well-written, but I found some inconsistencies, like the "secret" to making an effective speech, which I found out later that was not at all a secret, and which came across more as a silly little exercise.   And while this book contains a few fascinating anecdotes, they are so heavily edited and/or contrived that they don't really add much to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main characters are all really stupid. They are constantly doing the most stupid thing for the most foolish of reasons. They don't even try to be rational at all.   A huge problem with the book is the fact that all the characters are idiots.  "My parents had taken me to see this film at my grandma's house. It was awesome!" The main characters don't just randomly say stupid things - they have reasons for their stupidity, and if those reasons are silly, then the stupidity should be ignored because stupidity is stupid. In a movie like this, this would make sense, but I couldn't stand the stupidity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have purchased all of Michael Pollan's books and love them. I'm a vegetarian so I never really buy the hardcover but buy the paperback.  This one didn't satisfy me.   The book was ok.  The cover was ok, but I found it to be really hard to get past the picture of the tomato sauce on the cover.  I'm not a big fan of the author's personal style.  He writes with a lot of enthusiasm but his style can sometimes feel very academic.  It can be fun to read, but you need to have a strong stomach. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this to read, but have only spent around two hours reading it.  I got very sick the day I bought it and had to go to the bathroom.   While the characters are all very likable, the book has lots of horrible things that happen to them that you would not expect, as well as being very sexist and racist.    I would not recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had the same problem as many of the other reviewers above: I bought this book expecting something new. But, I found the writing style very confusing, and the content very weak. For example, the story opens with the heroine (my favorite character) talking about how she hates the world. I was hoping for something to set this book apart from other "post apocalyptic" books. This book just felt so rushed. The second half of the book is so bad, I don't want to even read it. And I thought the character development was very weak too. In my opinion, a great story could make up for poor writing. If you like the "post apocalypse" type books, this book is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a teacher, I read this book twice, to find out for myself if it was actually useful or useful only for me.  I bought the book for a student in my English class, and the students really liked it.  The book is filled with references to all sorts of English literature and a few quotes from authors like Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Dickens.  Unfortunately, the authors don't seem to have any understanding of what they are quoting, and they also don't show you where in the book they are saying it. For example, the quote "If I go on for ever, my head will swell/and the tears of my sorrowful heart will flow"  I found this passage hard to follow, because I knew the author was referring to the "Tales of Baskerville" (which I had already heard of).  A teacher must teach to understand and paraphrase, and this book just does not do that. The author really seems to be writing the text herself and not reading it, which really doesn't help anyone.  At the end of the book, the author states she didn't want to get the book into the hands of students who would use it for studying, and she also said this book isn't supposed to be taken seriously, and is only used for entertainment.     I didn't really believe this last statement, but it makes the book very hard to recommend to students. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book, but then I got to the second half and it got dull. As a result, this book made me feel sick to my stomach.  I really enjoyed this book.  This book is so well researched. I especially liked her research on the women's suffrage movement. There were some interesting things that I didn't realize, like the fact that men and women are the most involved members of the movement, and how important that is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had been looking for a book that was not about sex and/or sex addiction but this one is about sex addiction.   The characters are very realistic, and this book is about people with serious, very serious problems and the ways they cope. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is so sad.  I am writing my Master's thesis on the role of religion in the development of the western concept of the "self." In this book the author, an evolutionary psychologist (in a field that is now almost a dead science) makes a huge mistake and says nothing about evolution. The chapter about religion and the ego is a mess of errors and misleading ideas that will only mislead people who have no idea about the evolution of religion. As for religion itself, the author says it is just "a set of institutions designed to sustain a way of life and to make individuals feel good," but does not explain why such institutions exist and how they function. The main example used in the chapter is a temple. I think this is the most absurd thing ever. What does a temple do? It is a place where people pray and receive ritualistically food and money. It is not designed to make people feel good, it is simply a place to do those things and it does not cost any money.  The author is obviously not an expert on the evolution and history of religions. If he had only looked at what he describes as the religions of the west he would have realized that there is no evidence for his thesis. I would not recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My wife and I read this in one night and we couldn't stop laughing out loud. It was a fast read and it made my day to read.    I am a sucker for romantic love stories, and I really enjoyed this one, but I wanted more love and less badmouthing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is very short. The only interesting part is the "secret" the author has left for the reader, which isn't explained.   Also, it doesn't follow the style of the best books on the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for the fun of it and was disappointed with it.   The idea of a group of girls from the neighborhood having a barbeque and then getting drunk at the lake was really neat to me. I love when they play the guitar and the singing.  I was expecting more in this book because it sounded like it would be interesting. But it ended up being a boring and boring read.  A bad idea to start your book with a bunch of girls who drink and then get drunk off of alcohol, I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was hard to read, and it didn't help that the author is either an idiot or incompetent. As a first book, it was very poor.   This book is not for my taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written so that we do not have to think, we are told what to think by the author, we learn how to think on paper and then get the problem, so it is easy for us to understand it. However, I will be honest, it was not easy for me to follow the author. As I already mentioned, there were times I felt I did not understand something. However the author tries his best to explain the problem. This book should not be read by people who want to know how to be happy, as this is not the problem to be found in the world, or in a particular culture. If I am to criticize something, I must first ask my readers to read a book that is better than this one. For those who are looking for simple solutions in the hope of feeling better, you should find it in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was awful.  I really liked the book, but the writing was bad.  The story was just boring.  It got boring after a few chapters and I lost interest in the main characters because they didn't seem very interesting.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really hoped for more from this book, which I liked enough to read, but it wasn't enough for me to keep my rating on there. It was a lot of fun to read about a space captain. However, I found the story to be very boring and I felt a lot less like a hero in this book than in some of my other books, as well as a bit less inspired by Star Trek. I did enjoy the idea that the captain didn't always have the best of intentions, but his journey was really disappointing. My favorite characters were the others, but they were a bit too much like archetypes in this story. The story was interesting and entertaining, but this book is not worth the time or money I spent on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is simple, and the characters are so well drawn that it's easy to get wrapped up in them.  Unfortunately, the author's style and presentation leave much to be desired.  The author seems to write like a 13-year-old, and has very poor grammar and spelling.  I was hoping to enjoy this book, but unfortunately I ended up hating it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For this book, the writer seems to think that because it is written in a language other than English, then it has to be a "bad book" - or a "very bad book" for that matter.     For those of us who have read plenty of good books, this is NOT the case.  While there are parts that I agree with,   it's just that my knowledge of the language did not enable me to pick up on some of the more subtle points made by the author that really didn't seem to be there to begin with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm reading The Lost Symbol, a book by Dr. Seuss about the story of a little red bird who lives inside a red hat.   The author says he is from the U.K. and that he got the inspiration for this book from an old newspaper.  I don't think there is any way in which this is a great book. The story is pretty standard and I think the author got the basic idea from an earlier Dr.Seuss book called The Blue Bird's Story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall, it was a good read, but there were a lot of issues that could have been better, or more consistent. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel, which is much improved.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love reading this book. I was hoping it would be different than other books. It was not. I could see the humor, but it was not funny. I did get the gist of the book, but there was no real sense of plot. It felt like it was more a story of two people in love with each other.   No spoilers but there are two characters who don't get along very well. One of them thinks the other is in it for the attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best thing about this book is that, as far as I know, no one else has written this particular book. It is so different in tone from so many other books that I have read and enjoyed. While I like a good character or plot and the story is generally good, I have to say that the author is completely unable to come up with anything new. That aside, the story has several strong points. I really like the way it portrays the importance of family and friends and the difficulties of living in a new town. I particularly like how the characters react to the tragedy of losing a loved one. However, the plot is weak and does not really have any momentum. The ending is not satisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good read, for what it is, is disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I got this book I expected something interesting to read from an author I enjoy. But I ended up with a very boring book that was too difficult for me to figure out what was going on. Not to say there aren't good things about it. It's a good introduction for people who are interested in the subject, and I enjoyed it while it lasted. But there is simply no getting through this.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read at work on a Friday morning. I finished the book after 30 minutes. It's not that it's bad, I just wish it had more substance to it. I can see it being useful in teaching people, but the chapters are boring, the way you're supposed to be writing in one is way off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to find a good novel about race. This book's premise is interesting, but not very original or unique. The book is interesting because of its subject matter, but it doesn't make it a whole lot better or more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not do justice to it's subject, I am not saying that the book should have been longer, but it was more or less just that: an account of one man's experience of life.  The author had done a good job of bringing out all the personal characteristics that we have to go through as humans.  It was a good, if a bit boring, read, but I could not put it down.  I enjoyed reading this book, but my disappointment is that I will not be revisiting this one again for a while.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book before having my first child, and I was glad to see that the author did not go into all the details that we had discussed about the importance of being a good mother, as we have discussed in the past, especially with our oldest son.   While there is much to recommend this book, it is not worth the price or time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is really, really long.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was awful! The narration is awful.  It was a waste of time and time money  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have always been a great fan of Harry Potter, so I was not expecting too much from this. I was wrong, because this book really was nothing but a boring read. I will be waiting for the next book (although the reviews on Goodreads are so good, I'm pretty sure I'm going to be waiting a long time), but it's definitely not one of my favorites.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this for my 8th graders because the author teaches them how to read. They are great!   The students are enthusiastic about reading and they get a lot of information from it. The kids love the book so much that they often want to read it over and over.   However, some of the information the kids get is wrong.  The book says the world was created in about 6000 B.C. and the world is flat.  They are all flat. They also say that the world's average temperature is 78 degrees.  I have no clue why they say that.  Also, the last time I looked, the average temperature in the U.S. is 76.9 degrees.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this in 2-3 days and was bored after the first 30 pages. The main character and the author seem to lack any real interest in the book. The plot is very strange and the plot development is so inconsistent, I feel the author should be more careful about what he writes in the future.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was fun to read.  I really liked the story about the kids and their friends.   It had a very cute ending to it and I'm looking forward to the next book.  But the book was way to hard on me.  After I finished the book I tried reading it again and I got stuck halfway through the first chapter.  This is what happens when a book has a lot of confusing and hard to read parts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poorly written book.   I have an extremely difficult time reading many books from this publisher as the editor's writing style makes little sense to me. It's as if the book was written in the first person and then the narrator, the narrator was changed to an anonymous male and then again to a female but with no indication why the narrator is changed so much.  The story just doesn't fit in the style of the narrator.  I think I'll give this another shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst I have ever read. There was NO redeeming value in this book. There is no character development, no development in the story. The ending is very disappointing because we get a very short message of redemption from the person who wrote it, and the ending does not end the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a book called " The Secret World " on the train ride home from work. I thought the book was interesting at the time, but it was way over the top and far too long. I would recommend a shorter book if you have time for one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book, but I will never understand why so much of it was devoted to "woe" and "flaws" and yet the hero was portrayed as a great man.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is sloppy. I found myself constantly asking myself, "What is the point?" I was never able to wrap my head around what the point was. The main character seems to have no idea what he wants. This is extremely confusing to a new reader.  I found the book to be overlong. It would have been better for it to be shorter.   There is no plot. I understand that the main character is being told a story about his father, but why is it being told?   I think that if you have nothing to say then a good story will draw you into reading it.  I found myself wishing that I was able to find my own answers because of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've never been much of a reader.   There are a few good books in my library, but I find that almost every book I pick up has the same flaws, or worse.  Even when the book is a masterpiece, I can't stand most of the book until the last chapter.  I got the title and the first two pages and figured I'd give this a chance and read through the rest, but in the end I was disappointed.  My rating: 2 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book, but I had trouble deciding what to read next.   The book is good, but it has too many things going on.  My friend had the same trouble.  In short, it was a good read for the most part, but you will get bored.  I wouldn't have minded the inclusion of some character development though.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was terrible.  It was a long story that took place at the end of the world, but it was very short and boring.   I really had to work hard to finish it, and this book really took a long time to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The bad writing in this book is appalling.  It's just one more thing I hated about this book.  I love books with beautiful and meaningful writing but this was just too dry and cliche.   I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies so I'm disappointed in this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book with the hope that it would be a great adventure book. I didn't get the adventure.   I'm disappointed that this is the only book I'm going to read this year. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this in the summer, and I really enjoyed it, but it's not like it had any depth. It is, however, entertaining and good fun, so I'll still give it 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited about this book when I first heard about it.   The story is a bit of a mix between a mystery, a romance, and a sci-fi novel.  The romance is pretty good.  But the main thing that made me nervous was the lack of action scenes.  It doesn't matter if it's a murder mystery or sci-fiction, there should be at least some physical fights!  This book is not good in the action department.  I got the feeling that the author put a lot of thought into the plot, but it just wasn't enough to make it compelling.  Overall I give this book 3.5 stars but I think if it were a sci fi novel I would give it a 4 or 5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book. I had heard some good things about it but this is a total rip off and I won't ever buy another book from this author. I have purchased her books before and always been satisfied but this one left me so dissatisfied that I will never order another book and I think she has ruined her career. I do like her book about a man who was obsessed with the death of a child and I read that one as well but this book is so bad it is actually bad for my mental health. The only good thing about this book was the ending which was very sad. I would never buy this book again.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for fun, and I think it's a good one. The author takes some interesting ideas that are hard to grasp, but the book doesn't make a strong effort to explain the theory.   In a way, it feels like it's saying:  "hey, I just had a really great idea, if you need any help with it, just ask me."  For people with a good grasp of math, this book may help them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character is so whiny and unappealing that I can't believe anyone would give this book a chance. I really couldn't stand him.   That's a pretty good synopsis of my opinion on this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is fine, but the characters are very flat and uninteresting. They are like two people who are good friends, and who spend most of their time together at the library, but whose personality doesn't change much over time.   They have no problem talking about their feelings, but never show any real change in personality.  The ending is pretty predictable, but not too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't care for this book. The ending was rushed, and it's not like I'm complaining about books that end in an ambiguous way. If you like a character's bad behavior, you might not like this book, but it's very well written and the ending doesn't make sense, so I'm not sure how much I can really say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was boring. I did not enjoy the story or the characters, and the writing was repetitive.   This book is very good at making you want to read more, but I did feel the author had some potential, but the story just did not get a lot of mileage out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read the previous book by Raffi and it was an improvement on the previous version of the series. However, this new one is worse! Raffa is still a horrible, selfish character and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I would rather have a new book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never have been able to complete my university course of a foreign language with such a poor teacher, nor was I able to get an acceptable grade on my English degree.  I have been searching online for a new teacher for my second language course and would certainly recommend that you take the time to review the reviews before choosing.   This is not a good book.  It is just a collection of stories from the life of a famous writer and is not particularly informative.  The author seems to be a bit of a narcissist, but then again, it is an autobiography and he/she clearly does not care for his/her writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete and utter failure. The author has no real skills and doesn't care. The only thing she learns is how to sell her stories to other authors. I will never read her again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed with this book.   It was just plain boring.  For one thing, it was over 300 pages long.  But that wasn't the problem.  This is not a book that teaches you to play an instrument.  It is not written for musicians.  There is not even a hint of advice or inspiration about what you can do with your instrument to improve.  The book really only contains a small amount of information that is supposed to help musicians develop their musicality.  When reading it, I just kept thinking, "Well, that's it."  If I wanted to learn to play a few songs, this book would be great.  If the idea was to teach me what I needed to do to play better I would have been much better served with another book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so disappointed by this book! I had read a couple of other "fantastic" books by this author, and I was looking forward to this one.  I have been waiting for a book that would be entertaining and fun, but this just wasn't it. The first chapter was boring and slow paced.   Even after all these years, I cannot get over the fact that the character named Sam was the only one who did not have any kind of mental or emotional problems.  What a waste of time!   And the second chapter was even worse, and all the characters that Sam interacted with became less and less interesting and interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book. I was really looking forward to reading this. I decided to listen to it after the first page. The book was extremely boring, and all the characters looked pretty much the same. The author is so bad at writing characters that it's just like watching paint dry, and it's not even the art. There was no personality in any of the characters, no feeling, no emotion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was boring and boring. I really wanted to like it but it just didn't grab me and I ended up leaving it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If the book was bad it would have been a great read but unfortunately it was a poor job. The story and writing were not great. I'm giving it three stars instead of four because I like to believe that if a writer wants to write a book they can make it as good as they want to but unfortunately some of the characters were very unrealistic and just made me very angry.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The good:  The ending is great. I had to wait two years to get my copy of this book after reading several reviews on Goodreads. It's a great mystery with twists, turns and an awesome villain! I love that the main character can't tell which villain is which.    I found the plot to be a little confusing at times. There were a lot of clues that I still needed to piece together. The author seems like a really good writer so I'm excited to see what she does next. I have a feeling I will have to finish this one!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book I am trying to read has several important aspects: 1. It is a historical work with the focus on the last two years of the Bolshevik Revolution. It describes the events of the October Revolution and the early days of the Soviet Union. 2. It talks about the role of women in the revolution, in the civil war, and the economic and political life of the USSR. It also describes the efforts made to bring about women's rights. The book is well written, though it seems that the author has written it for a popular audience. The author writes in a very popular style, and is entertaining to read. However, the style is very popular, but not for me, so I will probably skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My students need a strong example in a positive way of what they can learn and grow from in this lifetime.   I am not sure if I could recommend this book.  It is too academic and not for my low-performing students. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In summary, this book does not stand up. I can't even count the times I've gone back and read it and thought "well, that's all the info I needed to know."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After having read a few books, I found myself wanting to do all the work, but being deterred by the lack of time and resources (and my limited English skills). However, having been able to spend the last 3 months reading the whole thing, I now appreciate the effort (for a while, anyway). It's nice to know there's at least one author with a sense of humor and, to me, this was the best of the series so far, while still being a strong and thoughtful novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was boring, the author didn't know what he wanted to say and was just giving you the facts. The book should have been called, "What to do about someone who doesn't like you." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book expecting to find the answer for a question I've had for a very long time. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.   It seems like the book is trying to answer the question: is there a difference between the mental aspects of memory and the physical aspects of the memory?   When asked how we remember, people say either that our memories are stored as physical bits, or that they are stored the way we believe our memories should be stored.  The author, however, does not explain why one should think a certain way versus another.  This means you need to use the book and your own experience to come to your own conclusions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best thing about this book is the title.   A bad book would be "Gone with the Wind" but not this. The title implies a good story and this one does have that.  But I think the real star of this story is the characters.  The characters in the beginning are all pretty good.  In fact, I found myself reading this book twice.  I found the main character really interesting.  He was the one that stuck out to me the most.  While he was an odd character at first, I liked his personality.  And after he had had his time with the evil "Natives" he became my favorite. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really enjoying this book for the first 40 pages or so but then it went downhill fast. I thought the ending was stupid and the characters were stupid. I couldn't care less about any of the characters in this book. I was bored and there were so many pages of boringness in this tome. It was really slow paced and really dull.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I went to the library and I found a paperback that I had never heard of before.   The book has a couple of short stories and a "how-to" section.  I am very disappointed to hear that this book has been around for a while and there is very little on the website. I do not think this book should be a bestseller.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a little disorganized and, to put it kindly, kind of a pain to get through. The author is a professional, but this is a poor book and the end result is not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was poorly written. The writing was poorly paced, the characters were poorly developed, and the plot was convoluted. However, I still found the premise interesting and I really enjoyed reading the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are interesting enough and the plot seems well written but the book is poorly organized and contains many spelling and grammatical errors. The author has said on the cover that the characters don't use their powers for bad behavior.   This is a very bad idea and the author should have been warned.  It's difficult to get through.  I gave this book a 2.2
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the worst I have ever read.   I can't stand this stupid book.  No one reads this book. No one has the time for this book...
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot line is rather predictable and is a bit predictable in the first few pages. The author, however, managed to make it interesting by adding so many new characters and twists and turns in a fast paced manner. The book is very short, which is why I didn't finish it before giving it to my daughter for her birthday, but the story is well written and the characters, even though not as developed as in the other books in the series, are quite interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book until it lost all interest when it was time for a sequel.  I will always love reading about these two brothers as they fight and survive the civil war but when the book's plot changes for the worse, I lost interest.   "War" is my favorite book but this book is terrible.  A few interesting characters but poorly written.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am in the process of re-reading this one. The writing is terrible, there's no flow, and it's just dull as hell.   It's not like you'd expect a James-style historical novel to be dull or lacking in plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is just terrible. The book's just a bad piece of writing. The story is just a non-existent story. The characters are just cardboard cut outs.   I am a huge fan of the series and I have read the books 3 times, but I don't want to read another book about an alien girl (no offense to the series). This is the first time the author has written a non fantasy novel that was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to try this book, since I wanted to get to know this character better and I found this book interesting.  The character had been well written and I enjoyed her attitude.  When she got into an argument with her father she seemed to forget all about herself and just wanted to save the day, which is a nice thing to see.  However, in the end she lost the argument and even when she realized what was happening she couldn't stop it.   When the author didn't put the character's feelings ahead of her own, it made the story a little bit difficult to follow.  Overall I found it a good read, but the ending left a sour taste.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main characters are all great, but the stories don't flow together. I know this is supposed to be a novel, but there is an issue with the structure. I found myself struggling to care about anything.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has no plot whatsoever. It's very dull and unoriginal, and I didn't enjoy the fact that it made me read every page in a random order to find out what happened.   I'd say it's more suitable for middle grade readers, but even I wasn't able to fully enjoy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm disappointed with this book because it does not really present an argument.  It only goes on a rant about the bad things in the bible. The author is preaching to the converted and if that's the case, then it will be a very disappointing book. It is an opinion piece and I have always found that interesting and valuable.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the textbook for self-publishing that I wish I had read before.   I could have learned so much more from this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book, but I wasn't sure what I was going to get. After reading the first half, I had high hopes for the second half.   The writing seemed to be going in a good direction.  There are some really cool scenes, particularly the time the characters are thrown into a battle with a demon in the desert.  Unfortunately, the story just wasn't there.  The ending was disappointing, but it could have been better.  After reading this, I will probably just put it on my 'tried and true' list.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is too good, and too complex. As someone who is pretty much self-taught in this field, it's difficult to find the good bits.   Also, this book is written in a way that doesn't let you understand some of the concepts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished the new and improved edition of This Is My Story, and I'm sad. It was a long and tiresome slog, and at times, it seemed to me that it had become a kind of "I wish this was good" affair, even though it isn't. However, at other points I found myself wanting to give it an extra good try. Even so, this is a flawed book, and the original (and best) edition was a bit better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the result of the research I did to get to this point, and it's so incredibly boring I cannot help but feel like I'm being used by its author.   I was surprised that this was a paperback, as it appears to be intended to be a mass market book.  I'm used to the big format books with fancy cover art, but it's just a book. The information is all in there, but this was just like reading a textbook for a computer science class. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book by John Grisham and didn't like it at all. I think Grishm... I read in a bookstore and it was ok but I can't wait until I get the DVD. I don't think that I will be buying the book again. The narrator is bad, and the narration isn't clear at all, like he is on an airplane. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was written to "prove" that it is the Christian religion that is true. The author, who is a professor of psychology, tried to convince us of the existence of God and to show us that the teachings of Christianity are good. Unfortunately for the author, it was impossible to prove that Christianity is true because the truth is not what he claims.  I just found this to be a poorly written book. I found it interesting that the author claimed to have been raised in a "church" but now claims to not be a "Christian".  I don't know about the book, but I was raised in the Christian faith and I still do have faith in Jesus as my Lord and Savior. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a waste of time.  It was well written and had some good information, but the main character was a droning moron with a brain that was severely damaged after her traumatic brain injury from a fall. The main character is constantly in a fog of rage and she has no real friends, family or sense of self. She's basically a robot who is too emotionally damaged to be of any use to anyone. She has no redeeming qualities other than that she's angry and doesn't have any social skills. I wish that there was something more to this book but that's just the bad writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never got through this book.   It was a disappointment, the characters, which I was expecting to be interesting and developed, were dull.  The plot was a bit convoluted but not really needed.  I didn't find this book compelling enough to keep me reading.  It's very easy to see why this book has been so popular.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book because I wanted to understand how a new species of dinosaur evolved over time, but I was disappointed because I found the premise and the writing to be so simplistic. I don't understand how this dinosaur evolved in three million years when it was still a warm-blooded reptile. The authors use a simplistic analogy of a snake and a mouse. The author's reasoning for the evolution of the dinosaur was that the "snake was able to take advantage of new food sources while its kin were restricted by a slow reproductive process." This is not how evolution works! If the species has the ability to evolve faster than the prey, the latter will have to evolve into something else. This was one of those books that is meant to be simple but actually requires a good amount of work to understand it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In retrospect, I probably would have preferred a different narrator.   The author makes her voice as though it were one of a kind.  Her writing style is a little hard to follow at times, but overall, I enjoyed the book.  I think that there is a great story to tell. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me a while to get around to reading this book.  But it's worth it. It has a nice feel to it.   The stories have good writing and nice plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this for my daughter and when I got home I found it was missing some of the book's photos, and the inside pages were ripped.   But I also noticed that there is a photo of some of my family.  Maybe it was ripped from another book by the same author, but this is not the best photo book out there.  The images in this book are excellent but some of them are also quite small. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was poor and the character development was weak.   I didn't like the main character or any of the side characters.   Would you listen to a book again?   Yes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book thinking I'd be getting something interesting out of it. I was wrong.   The writing style is slow, as if the author was just throwing together a bunch of different ideas and trying to work them all into one long paragraph.  It's a very dry read, and in no way educational, and this has the tendency of making me feel like I should be able to use all these different facts about the different cultures I've traveled to to build a great business. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this one quite a bit, but I was hoping for something more. The book's premise was excellent, and the characters were well done and the prose is quite good for a novel about zombies. However, I was disappointed in the end result.   The premise was good, and a lot of zombies were good fun. However I have not found many characters that I can truly care about. Some are really boring, like the main character, and some are pretty much cardboard cut-outs.  As for the zombies, they were fun in a generic way, but there was nothing to make me want to read more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has no character development. The heroine is a whiny child who is constantly getting into trouble and has no reason to like the people who put her into danger. She just wants to be liked.   The best parts of the story are the adventures she goes on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of self-help books, and this one was the worst of the bunch!  I can't tell you how many hours I spent researching and writing this book, only to find out I wasn't getting any smarter and my efforts had only accomplished triviality.  I spent more money on this book than on all my other self-improvement books combined.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really expecting this book to be more interesting, but it was more like a cross between The Godfather and The Maltese Falcon.  There is no mystery at all.  It would be better if this author wrote less, but still has the originality to write the right book at the right time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never read this before. I've never had a chance to read a book from the authors I love as much as the ones I've reviewed on this site. I have a new book on my list, and this is not on the list.   It's a nice piece of historical fiction, which is all I've really wanted from this book.  I will most certainly be reading it, but I have trouble keeping this book on the shelf for more than a few days. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an important book to have in a collection of "spiritual classics." I was expecting it to be more of the same:  "The great mystery of life is not why we are here or what is in store for us, but why we chose to be here in the first place."   I was not expecting anything new to be revealed by this book.   The author's goal is for us to find God's answers for life's challenges by following in God's footsteps.  A very good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The pacing was awful - I expected to be immersed in a thrilling and original fantasy world, but instead I was dragged through some cliched (but not as clic as in Lord of the Rings) plots and repetitive dialogue.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not worth the time and the effort to put it down! I will admit that the author does a great job of explaining the problems, but at the same time she does an awful job of providing any solutions to them. The author doesn't seem to understand the importance of the "good to bad" ratio in relationships (which is not to say that there is any one solution). She doesn't really understand that if we are not having sex with each other, then neither are our partners. If you try to fix a broken relationship by having more sex, then you just make it worse. This book doesn't do anything to help fix it. It just tells you what to do, and doesn't bother to tell you why it is a bad idea. I found myself reading through the book repeatedly, just to make sure that the "correct" solution would work. It did not, unfortunately.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has an unbelievable number of errors. I would never ever buy it again, even if I could get it for free. I have to admit I bought this book because I felt it would be an excellent gift to my parents, which it is.   I have no idea how I can believe it's an honest and accurate account of a very strange and unique case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not expecting this book at all. I have read several books in the genre about the supernatural and paranormal, and have enjoyed them very much. I thought this book would be different in some ways. Unfortunately, I think it is more the same.   In general, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I would have liked, or expect. It starts out okay. It's a paranormal romance, so it has that element. The protagonist is a "bad girl" - not as much a bad boy - so it makes sense that the book has a dark and brooding atmosphere. The characters are likable and the story is moving - I just didn't find it compelling. The book has the usual elements of horror and sex, but it felt much like a thriller to me - I'm not usually attracted to suspense novels. I was glad I checked this out though, it's a good enough read!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book with great enthusiasm and expectation. I was disappointed! I expected to be entertained by the story and the characters.   Instead, I was bored and confused.  The author spent several hundred pages in a very lengthy introduction explaining why the author is the author, which he did with almost no real purpose.  It seemed like there was some other book that he was writing in the background and didn't realize. I found it difficult to get into the book as a reader and really did not understand the point he was making.  He said he got bored when he had to explain the point to someone else. I just wanted to get on with the story, and I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was not bad. There were some really cool concepts.  The author is not good. She is an unknown author who got published in a genre and it was a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book did not do what it set out to do. The author makes it sound like she knew she was going to write a terrible book from the beginning, so that she might "get" how horrible books are, but that she could never be truly pleased with her work. She writes "This is so well written that I can hardly keep track of what's happening," and then spends the whole book whining about how the reader doesn't understand her and complaining about how bad she has it and how nobody likes her, while somehow getting the heroine of the story. I'm sorry, but the book is not as well written as the author claims. And she's just as bad as the characters. The whole thing was just...boring.    If you're going to hate your own work, you might as well be as bad at it as you possibly can be.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a bit lazy, but when you are writing a book that deals with the most fundamental topic in modern history, that is history and its significance, it doesn't matter if you make it up as you go along.   A couple of minor spelling errors would have been acceptable.   This was published on March 2, 2015.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was a bit rushed, with a rather rushed ending, the characters were somewhat stereotypical, and the story seemed a bit weak to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am reading this book in preparation for a future graduate program, and I have to say that this is a bad read.   The author makes statements and uses the language of a researcher in a way that is highly misleading and dishonest.  It is a case study of how poor research can be.  The whole book is an example of a bad methodology and bad conclusions, but it is the author's method in which this book is constructed that makes it a poor example to use. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not bad, and its value is far more in the writing than its substance.  I'm giving it three stars, because I feel that its a good introduction to the genre and some of the finer points that one needs to know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is all about a man who is trying to figure out his identity and finding out that he has no one to rely on except himself. I was looking forward to the next installment of this series because this one was a bit more serious and not just the antics of a bad boy. This book is not very interesting and seems to be the same thing over and over again. My favorite character in the book was the man that kept asking the same question and trying to find the one person who could answer him.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is very poorly written and you would need a high degree of reading comprehension and spelling to understand it, let alone enjoy it. I was going to try and read the other books in the series but decided against it and gave this a miss and will be looking elsewhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read through this book twice now and have not enjoyed it as much as I originally did. First, the plot: The author describes his experiences in Vietnam as a kid, and shows a child's naivet  [ the other girl's father wants to kill himself and the book's first chapter is a rant about that. Also, when the two main characters are discussing the book, one of them claims that it's really a book about how "men talk to themselves" and another "men don't talk to each other so much as they talk to their own feelings" (the book's description of its characters' inner lives).   Second, the writing: I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but I think I've given better reviews to the books I've liked and disliked. This was terrible! This book is a collection of short stories from different authors, but the only thing I could find to relate to in it is the author's childhood and early adulthood experiences. (The book is also described as being in some way a reflection of the author, which I do find somewhat flattering...but I'm being sarcastic.) There's a lot of fluff in this book, too: some of the stories aren't that good and others are really bland. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who's been reading about Vietnam War vets for a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first experience with this book was one of the worst.   A young woman is told how to be a feminist and to never say a word about men.   She is told that her sisters are feminists but she should not be because feminism was invented by women and men don't want to be associated with that.  She was told to tell men what they needed to do and to teach them the rules for being a feminist.  This is the main problem: It's not written by women, it's written by men who have been trained to be feminists by women.  It's a collection of advice to men that are almost the exact same as advice to women. That's not a compliment.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters were all in love with each other and in love at first sight. Then it turned out they were in love because they had each others interests at heart and were just trying to get over their own personal problems. The plot just kind of fell flat after that and it really hurt that it all came down to one simple, boring conversation. It would have been so much better if the characters were just a little bit more self aware. They should know that they are stupid and shallow. As a lover of history I loved this book. But then it was so incredibly dated. I'm glad I gave it a 2 stars, but the other 4 are 5's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has the potential to be excellent and then doesn't live up to that potential.   I am very disappointed with this book because I had high hopes for it.  It is a story about a boy who is diagnosed with autism and is given a new diagnosis to explain his unusual behaviors and the changes that accompany his diagnosis.  There are many things that the author does right.  She does give the boy a diagnosis (as a diagnosis he has not received before) and she does describe his special needs.  Unfortunately, the diagnosis is used as a crutch for the boy's behavior and the book never gives us enough information to make an informed decision. The boy's parents, who are not well educated in the behavioral theories that have been advanced in the literature, believe that their son has an eating disorder that needs to be treated with anti-anorexia drugs.  The book, however, does not take into account that, for many boys, their eating disorder is not a disorder but a feature that they are very happy about.  They have a very different life than the boy with autism who gets no assistance from his parents.  Although the book attempts to be sensitive, it fails because of the way the author describes behavior without considering what the child actually does. The book tries to explain and justify his behavior but only uses the boy in order to explain how he behaves.  In some instances the author gives the boy information that he does not need in order for the book to be useful.  This may be ok for a book that is just about the boy but it does not work for a work of science.  I was hoping for more from this book but this is not what I expected from a work by Dr. Asher.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed in this book because of its content. I think that the author, who has an excellent reputation, should take more time with the story rather than rush it. It would have made me more satisfied with the book if the author took time to write something more. The plot was interesting but didn't make me want to read the rest of the book. The story was intriguing but the pacing and the content were not.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this on impulse just for the plot and I was disappointed. The book was interesting, but it never clicked with me. There was so much going on that I kept getting distracted and lost interest. I wanted to know how the characters got to where they are but it was just too much information. If you want to read something that is interesting and action packed, then this is a good choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because it was recommended to me. It was good, but it had too many flaws to warrant it. First, the cover had no resemblance to the book itself. It looked too fancy and made me think I was in for an expensive gift. But the writing style was too basic for my taste. It took me 20 minutes of searching for the info needed to finish the book. Also, there were no references to how the characters lived, their education, their careers, etc. I got very little insight into the characters except for the fact that they were wealthy and successful. I really wish I could have had a more complete picture of who they were, but the author didn't bother to show it. The most annoying thing about this book was how little I cared about any of the characters. I had to put the book down many times because I could no longer focus on anything that the characters said. My only redeeming qualities were that I was entertained at the beginning of the book and that the ending was a little bittersweet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is not that interesting for the amount of time it took to get to the end.   It was like reading a book from a university library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending was a bit cheap. The end result was a pretty dull book, and not a very interesting book either.  I'd give this book 2 stars, but the author has given me enough to give 3 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I ever read. I really felt like I was reading someone else's opinions about it, but then again I read so many other people's reviews.   I did like the first half of this book but then the author started throwing in random, silly "facts" about the Bible. It's like he just picked out the biggest falsehoods out of the Bible, and he decided they were the best.    It's a shame because there is a great story here but, after you read the first 80 or so pages, you start to wonder how he could have possibly known what he was talking about.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so glad I picked this up. The first chapter was good, the middle was pretty good as well. Then halfway through the book it became painfully obvious that she was just telling a story. She couldn't keep any detail from becoming irrelevant, including the names of her children. I could understand her point about the horrors of war but all her focus was on her own problems with a husband who didn't approve of her decisions, even if it came at the cost of her being a single mom and raising three kids. She was a good writer, but I think the book is a disappointment to me.   I'm not a huge fan of war novels and I thought this book was a little too light. My only real gripe with this book is how slow the pacing was, but as it is, this novel is definitely worth the read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an interesting book, a historical review of the American Revolution, which is interesting for those interested in the topic, but the author overstates his case, and his conclusions seem to me to be ill founded.   There are plenty of historical inaccuracies, such as the idea that the American revolutionaries were revolutionaries in a legal sense (i.e., they were armed when they seized their governments from an oppressive king), and the idea they were not.  He makes some good points about the fact that the founders thought that government was corrupt.  As the author says, the revolutionaries were fighting for liberty, but their ideas of government (and of course of politics) changed over the years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that should be better than it is. My review:  There's not enough of a story. This is not a bad thing, but I was hoping for a good one. I'm going to give it 2 stars, and maybe give this book 3 or 4 stars if the story is really good. I would recommend this book to some people who love fantasy, and others who just like the idea of a good fantasy novel. I have seen some good reviews, but this book is not one I'd want to read. I highly recommend this to fantasy fans with a strong sense of adventure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was younger and I liked it, though I have a few problems with it. The story takes a while to start up, but I got through it. But the main problem was that I was expecting to find out more about the author and the situation of this world, and I got that instead.  It just seemed too convenient. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no idea what it's talking about... The writing style is very choppy and incoherent. It's like the author is reading and copying what she reads. As far as I'm concerned the best book is the one I never read! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book but couldn't give it 5 stars because it was a bit too dry.   It did get me going and I think I am reading more of the characters from the upcoming book (The Last Night of Winter).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a man who gets really frustrated at his wife, and starts looking for someone to blame. I think there are better stories of marriage and relationship that we could be reading, but for the time being, this is a very good story about a woman trying to deal with a man.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was good but the characters were so poorly developed I felt the author was trying to sell a more complex narrative that he couldn't tell in the book.   While I would read more by this author, I am a little disappointed that his first story was so poorly written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of your time.  It has a very basic idea.  The author doesn't really get to understand what she is writing about.  What she tries to do is analyze the concept of "sociopath" which means someone who is a "person without conscience or empathy."  She then tries to explain how the idea of "conscience" relates to a lack of empathy, i.e. not caring how others feel or feel about themselves, or about the people they care about. She doesn't analyze the idea (what people usually think of as "morality") but the feelings one gets from that idea. I have seen this concept used many times, especially in the psychology/behavioral psychology field, but I have never read anything like this book.  As far as I can tell, this is a simple attempt to define the terms that people use when they talk about "sins."  But, to me, it is not as clear as it should be.  A few examples:  "What can we learn from people who commit criminal acts?"  "Is it better to feel guilt than to feel remorse?"   "People who commit crimes are rarely or never brought to justice.   This leaves many wondering if we should feel remorse, and if so, when."   I do not know about the ethics of this book, but if this is how people think about sinning, I don't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a book on how to become a better programmer, this is the worst book I have ever read. I thought I understood how C++ was designed and how it is used by a vast majority of the world's programmers. However, when I read about the history of C++ I saw a clear pattern of what they think makes C++ different. C++ is not about the C or the C++. It is about the philosophy behind C++, its design, and its use in today's software world. It does not explain how you can get better at using C++ or how to write better code.   I don't like the authors' way of describing C++ so that it looks like it is only about the "idea" of C (which I think is the only valid way to think about it).  The way they talk about C++ and the design of C is like talking about the design behind an engine, instead of a car or airplane.  The only difference between C++ as presented in this book and the original C++ has to do with C++11 and C++17. It was clear that the authors have no idea how to describe C++ for the newer versions of C.  This is not an argument against C++ being a good language, but rather an argument about the authors not understanding C++ better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to this book, and for a good long time. I wanted to read this book. I was even hoping to finish it. It was a disappointment. I had trouble with the beginning. The book is very slow, even after finishing it. Then again, the last 3 books I have read are pretty slow, and I'm used to that. I think I just have a slow reading speed. I don't know if it was because I was having trouble starting to read the book, or if it's because it was long. It definitely was a good book. Just didn't really have the impact it deserved to have.  I would give this 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that I don a review for all the other books I've read, and they're all pretty good, too!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been looking for a good book to read for about a month. I read this book and was disappointed.   The book was not good.  Some good ideas, like the part about not wanting to be like people, were presented, but I felt that the plot was a bit slow.  I don't know why it didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second one I have ordered, and I just received it yesterday. I didn't want to wait any longer than I needed to and ordered this book. I had been searching for a book that would give me a good idea of how the Jewish community in Canada functions at the present time. The content of this book did the trick, but I was still a bit underwhelmed. It is certainly a good book, but the writing style is way too academic, and it is not a good source of historical information.  I had wanted to read this book because I had read it on-line and found it very useful. But this time I found it too academic for my taste. There is one section of the book that deals with some contemporary issues that were not covered in the text. If I were reading it for my high school or college classes I would have added this information to the text as an interesting aside.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave it two stars because it was good, not because it wasn't. I like this book, and enjoyed it. The story was well-crafted, and the characters were all interesting. I also like that they had more interesting names than they did. The characters are likable and likable, not the stereotypical characters one would expect to find in a romance novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last few chapters were the only thing that really made me angry.  .I can't believe I ever thought I would be interested in this type of story.  And even then I couldn't finish the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a disaster. The characters are so wooden that I cannot believe it is their last name, the setting is so bizarre and unbelievable that it feels forced, and the prose is absolutely awful, as though you have to read it just to get it.   If I had to buy another book on the subject, I would get something that is more realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish the author would have gone a little farther with this one. It is a fun read for the whole family, but the little boys will likely end up disappointed in the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book at all. I expected a little more out of it than this, but I do not enjoy the fact that it takes so much of it's time to explain the various rules and then spends most of the book in a discussion about the rules.  The plot is predictable, and that is no bad thing. It is a well written story that just does not interest me enough to keep reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot was predictable. I could've guessed that this is where the story was going. But I had to find out for myself.   I am not a huge fan of fantasy but when I found out this was going to be about a witch I had a hard time getting through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has been out for more than a year, but it is still not complete.  It starts off well enough, but I was disappointed by the way in which the plot unfolded and in the fact that it took two or three chapters to realize that the main character was not going to win and to resolve that.  In fact, I am glad that the ending happened because otherwise it would have taken away any hope I had in the book.    4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never knew I had a love for the book until I started reading it. I loved the cover, the content and the concept behind the book, but it was never anything more than a fun read. I don't know what it was about it that bothered me so much, but I just gave up and gave the book a 3 out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is a complete dud.   From the second chapter, which was just an excerpt from an entire book on how to teach children and how to get the kids to respect you, the author is just not very good at writing.  She does a very poor job at characterizing the villain of the story - which is to say, that she does a lousy job of capturing the true villain.  It's almost as if the author decided that she was going to write about being a good mom and teaching children how to respect their parents, and got lost in the idea that she needed a bad guy.  The book tries so hard to have it both ways.  As the book is marketed as a book on parenting, she has a couple of good tips on how not to be a bad mother.  Unfortunately, most of the book just consists of her telling kids what to do and then teaching how to do it, and in her own words "teaching is the mothering".  In other words, she is talking about what parents can do to improve the life of their children and then trying to sell it as a practical guide for a parent.  I think it's pretty clear that the author was trying to create a more entertaining book about parenting, but not one that could possibly get published - after all, she wasn't exactly getting good reviews on Amazon.  However, this is exactly what she tried to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a chore for me.  I read it over a period of 3 days and could not get past the 3rd day.   I understand the book is a historical account and is very well researched.  The information provided is also very useful to those interested in studying the subject.  In fact the information about the different methods used for the torture of prisoners is so interesting and entertaining I would recommend this book to any person who wants to understand the process and how it affects a person psychologically and physically.  This book is not worth reading unless you want to get to know the history behind this very important and fascinating subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited for this to come out.  I've never heard of the author and never heard about the author's book, but  I really thought this would be amazing.   My expectations were definitely exceeded.  The writing was so-so at best, the plot and characters were so-and-so, the book was so... I don't want to even say anything about it because it was so boring and predictable.  In spite of the lackluster writing, there was one thing that made this an enjoyable read: The art.  It was really weird and awesome at the same time.  What I'm trying to say is, this book is a waste of your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book over a hundred times and I never tire of it!   What makes this book so good is that it is a classic example of how a woman can be in the wrong company, and not be afraid to be a strong, independent, smart woman who makes the world a better place for everyone.   This book has been my favorite and will be in my collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've heard about this book, but never really gave it a chance. I guess I was hoping the author would give more insight into the characters.  I found it a good read but I don't think I will be reading her other works.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't want to go to college.   My parents got me a scholarship to a good college, but they couldn't afford to pay for the tuition.  That was my major.  My problem, at this point in life, is that I don't have the money to go away to college forever.  I have a part-time job, I'm trying to figure out if I want to get a real job.  (I've been unemployed since late 2011 or early 2012.  If you don't mind, I've applied for about 10 jobs over the past two years, including jobs with a great company I believe, but I just can't muster up the courage to take the job.)   Anyway, I was talking to a friend recently, and he said he read this book as a freshman at college and it made him decide to go out and start his own business (which is good), but that it left him feeling bitter because he was told he could get a "real job" after college.   So, after the semester, he decided to get the hell out of there.  When I was a freshman in college, I decided to be a graphic designer.  However, this book made me realize that the best way to get good jobs in the art world (in the U.S. at least) is to study art in school and to take as many art classes as possible.  You can get a great job in an art school or on a freelance basis if you're good at it.  But the book is really short.  The book is not a bad read, it's not necessarily a good read, but it's the only book I've found so far that made me think about the business of being an artist, which I've always wanted to do.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it very difficult to connect with my character in this book. She was very passive.  My character could have done things more.   The book doesn't even get to the part that would have made her more likable if she had done it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only book that is truly bad is the Bible.     It contains all of the worst stuff from human history.  I would have given it 4.5 stars if it had not been so poorly written and the fact that it is written in a foreign language should be a major warning for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't give this book a good chance. First, I hated that the story was told in third person and the writing was so choppy and awkward. The characters were so flat and unfunny. Then I got a headache and felt bad for the characters because I didn�t have much sympathy for them. Also, the characters were all about two things that really bothered me: (a) The female characters were whiny and whiny, and (b) The male characters were completely uninteresting and bland. I hated how they acted in all of the interactions they had. The male was completely one dimensional and there was no variation in his personality. The female was boring and one dimensional. The writing was like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. I thought the ending was really cheesy. I am definitely giving this book two stars because the writing is so bad, and the main character is just a terrible person to have as a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book so many times before I finally gave up and started reading the first book in the series.   It was a frustrating experience to me because I had such high hopes for the second book in this series. I bought this book in hopes that it would get better as time went on. I read the first 2 books before I even bought the paperback because I thought I was getting a better book because I read a few reviews and saw how good the characters were.  It never really worked.  I just kept getting frustrated and never knew why things happened.  This time around, I wanted to give it a chance and so I bought the book.  To my surprise, I found out that it was a very good book. It actually improved my opinion of this series in my mind.  This book takes place before The Final Empire and I'm glad I finally started reading it. It brings a new story to the series that I didn't know was coming. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I had recently started to read some more recent books and thought this one might be interesting. However, after just 20 pages or so, the book seemed to get lost in a whirl of ideas that seemed more like marketing for another book (the author of the book I have just reviewed is very good at it) than for any real interest in writing. I got the feeling this author had a personal agenda and that the goal was to get her books picked up for bestseller lists.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was terrible! I tried to put the book down, but it just kept getting worse and worse. It ended up being about 12 pages of uneventful prose and one story. The narrator is so annoying and so self-involved that it makes the book unbearable. I was just hoping I would get over this bad book in a week or two. If you have a bad day and just want something to read, it is not for you. I would give it a B-
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing good about this book is that it's hilarious.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author missed the point in this book.   The whole book was about how we make up stories for ourselves.  It was a "What if?" kind of story.  If I'd read it, I probably would have found the point boring.  The main character did a terrible job of writing an effective story. It was all word games.  I didn't buy the whole story either.  There was a huge gap in the middle of the book. I think we need to read more and think more about the way we make stories.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was fine but the characterisation was horrid. The author has a reputation of writing great stories, this was no different.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story, the prose is so... poor! This is the first of many I will never buy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was good, just not the greatest book I've ever read. However, the characters are interesting and the story is well-paced and thought-provoking.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is the kind of bad book that makes me want to run away screaming from the very first page. There are no plot points, no character development, and no enjoyment.   First, the author claims that she learned a lot from her childhood, so she wrote about her life from a child's perspective. Well, no one would say that they know how their childhood was just by reading a story. Second, her main character is stupid and does nothing except yell at animals and say the stupidest things. Third, her only character trait is the fact that she is a "bad mother."   There are so many flaws in this book that I had to go through all three books before I was finally able to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am giving this a 4 stars on merit, not because of the book itself but because of what it does for me as a reader. The book's a lot of fun. I enjoyed all of it and have to give it a thumbs up for that. There are a few things in this book that could have used better (it was a bit rushed and I have a hard time following it), but it is a good read for the most part. I am happy to have read this. I give this a 3.5 star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My friends were disappointed that the book was no longer available. This is another one of those "you could be in the right place at the right time" books, and you will likely get it wrong. I have purchased several of these but have always been disappointed. I thought that the premise was good: you could be anywhere at any time and still be able to find the story you are looking for. In practice, however, I always think it is "in the right spot." I am always at the wrong place and then find myself in the wrong spot because the right people have sold out before I could even get in.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for an assignment. I don't have to be a mathematician to realize that these problems are not solvable using a computer. Even so, this book's main message is that computers can only do so much, that we still have to learn math by hand and that you shouldn't let computers tell you what math is about. As for its title, this is an absolute mess of a book. There is an endless supply of ways to get "this" and the solution "that" to the problems in this book. It will take you several hours of frustration. I got "this". My son and I spent the next five minutes trying to figure out how to get an answer that was "that". I would have preferred a book that was a little more concise in its thinking. I also would have liked it if a lot of the problems had been assigned to people with no background in math. It should be very clear to any math major that there is no simple, correct way to solve a problem. This book will give you headaches and will give your kids a headache as well. (Jan 2014)
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character, who was an average boy who did some good things, was too gullible. He was constantly getting in trouble and was basically doing nothing, just hanging around and having his fun. I couldn't understand why he was so happy. I have always wanted to read a book about the adventures of a mischievous little boy, but unfortunately, this book doesn't give me that. There are so many characters that are never explored, and the one that is is constantly punished. The main cast is pretty small, and there are some really boring and undeveloped ones.   I think that this is one book that can be enjoyable without the added dimension. It was a fun read for the kids in my class, but I didn't care for it and would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The books are very repetitive and not very engaging. There is some good stuff in here but not really worth the hype.  The Good:  It's about a kid and the kids he/she knows and loves in the suburbs.  It is a fun read.  The author is very knowledgeable on the subject at hand and writes in a casual style that doesn't bore the reader.  This book is great for all ages and is suitable for all readers from the youngest ones to the most adult in the group.   It's short, fun, and educational!   I highly recommend this book  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most interesting things about this book was how well-researched it was (and still is) by someone who lives near Cambridge, MA. In my opinion, there's not enough discussion of the religious dimension of the story, and the religious aspect is one of the major weaknesses of the book (especially if you are a skeptic). One of my favorite parts is the section on the 'theological controversy': http://books.google.com/books?id=Cj6P4X3rZqgC&pg=PA7&lpg=PP1&dq=theology+conquest&source=bl&ots=3EJW5K6Z3U&sig=8JtOz8ZvxXsU1p2jw-Ksxn8Y0S7L&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r1RrBQ-YtjD4oX-wL6W2vzDQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=theoligarchic&f=false If you don't know the story about the gospels, it's a good read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall, an excellent book. A great resource for those who are thinking of taking their first steps into Buddhism. A few flaws: - It's difficult to tell whether you are really a Buddhist. - The Buddha is a bit too familiar (to the point that it's distracting) - There were moments where I wanted to leave the book and go to the beach. It's not difficult to find good information in the book, but it's certainly not easy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading about this subject for several years but I have finally got the hang of it. A bit hard but very enjoyable. A good mix of philosophy and psychology.   This is a great book, a lot of fun, but I don't know if I can recommend it at this point in time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was interesting and I did enjoy it.   However, after about halfway through, my interest waned.  I'm not an audiobook listener, so I can't really comment on the quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The whole book was a bore, and I can't recommend it to anyone other than people who are really into the genre of "the supernatural" and are a little over the top about it.   I've read a lot of paranormal romances, and the paranormal genre in general, and this book just didn't impress me.  The main character is a real loser. She has this "supernatural" thing going on, but she never manages to keep it together long enough to be able to live a normal life. It was just very unrealistic to me. She was "the one" who could do anything, and she just can't get it together. It made the book a big disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book in the library.   This is a book that I'm glad I read.  The prose is clear, and is not over-long.  I really like the cover art of the book.  It would have been nice if there were more reviews about the authors.  This book was not what I was looking for.  However, the writing made up for this, which I can understand.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure I enjoyed this book much. There were a lot of questions that needed answers and answers that were lacking.   The answers that I got just felt so generic or unsatisfying.  I think if I was going to read a book that deals with vampires it would have been something like  Vampires: A Modern Myth by John Jowett, which is much better, although it is also a bit old-fashioned at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending is a mess and the characters are very shallow.   There are very little characters and the only two that matter are the protagonist and the antagonist, which is a bad combination. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing bad about this is that you have to read the other two for the final book to be interesting.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought the book was good when it came out. However, now that I have a hard copy I feel like I am reading a very bad review that has little to do with the book, or even the author.   A good friend has read it and she is quite upset. She feels that there is no love or affection on the part of the author and the book does not live up to the hype she read in the newspaper. She says the main character is just there to provide a good story that you can "get a few good laughs" out of.  This is not what I want from my reading material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book boring, not at all like any of my previous reads.     Not even remotely as interesting as the other books in this series.    The story is all about the protagonist's relationship with his father, which is well-trod territory by these authors and I felt the author tried to make things more interesting than they actually were.  I was expecting more twists, turns, and plot developments, not a boring old dad/son story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a fan of 'goody two shoes' novels.   For me it was never the writing.  It never made me angry or depressed.  I'd often be annoyed at the time when I got the book to discover that they had failed to keep the plot moving, and the action had stopped at the wrong moment.  But then I'd read the next book, and find it was much better.  So to go from one of the best books I have read to one of them that I have not  I can't recommend it highly enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was completely taken by surprise and had no idea how this would turn out. The book reads so well, yet the pacing is just horrible. The chapters are very well-written but the author fails to find an interesting thread at every turn, leaving the whole thing feeling disjointed and poorly written.   If you are looking for a fast read or a thriller, but don't care for the slow pace of a mystery, this might be for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard the hype about this book and decided to go for it when it was first released. But it is not a book that holds my interest.   When I first finished reading the book I said to myself "Well, I guess I'm reading the first book in a series" and that is definitely not the case.  There are two main plot points which are a bit cliched. The first one is about a "cripple" girl (a child) who is a good "angel" in the sense that she always helps people and she is the only person who can get the girl to stop being a "goddess" in all the sense of "being worshipped".  But then this girl gets sick and is being treated by other "gods" who aren't exactly angels either. The other plotline is about the "evil" queen who is trying to find the girl, and she does it by giving herself up to the girl who is being taken away by the evil queen.  It's a cliché. It is like a story about how some "angelic" being does some good in the end.  But the worst part is that it is done in such a cheap way. This book could be a novel in itself with some more story, because it was too short to have that depth.  This book was like reading an adventure story and the protagonist is a girl who would have been perfect if the story had had more depth, but the main characters were pretty shallow and didn't have much character development.  And then there are some of the sex scenes.  I'm not a fan of sex scenes, especially in novels, but that's just me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been looking forward to reading this book from the very first sentence. I bought the first one in the series when I was in high school. I loved it and had no trouble getting into the story.  I was looking forward for this one but was disappointed by the ending.  The ending was so confusing that it felt like the author was trying to give a hint at where the story is going.  What was I supposed to think was going on?  I don't know. I can only say I was disappointed with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters felt flat. I liked them from the start. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very basic, but a good basic book.   For many reasons, I think this is going to be a book I will have to repeat as a textbook in some college courses.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete waste of time. As I was reading, I kept thinking that the author didn't really know how to write, because there are not a lot of memorable characters in this book, and the writing style is repetitive and boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book 3 stars, mostly because I was hoping that it would get better and become a real classic.   However, it got worse. The "good" points were few and far between and were quickly negated by the horrible characterizations and bad prose. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a waste of time. I got bored after the first few pages and quit.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a very bad book.  This is a very badly written book. I could have done a better job of capturing what the author intended, or at least how I understand her intent. However, I also find it odd that she doesn't get a star out of me because I was hoping she would get more of the star. I will not read this book again, it is not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a great book for people with ADHD who just want a quick read to help get things straight. The writing is quick and the content is clear and simple. Unfortunately the book was poorly organized and was hard to navigate. I also found that the "rules" of the book were often out of date. Also, I found that some of the descriptions of the "bad ADHD behavior" were over the top. The book, for all it's faults, is well written and very easy to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because the book had an interesting premise, but nothing could have prepared me for how bad the book turned out to be. The author does a good job of portraying her personality in her writing, but the plot is so unoriginal and the character development so lackluster, that I had a hard time believing anything. I don't even know what to think about her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had the opportunity to read the three volumes of  The  Last Days of Empire: The Last Days on Earth. The title itself says it all. The story starts off promising and a great deal of time is spent setting the stage and then dropping some hints as to what is to come. Then things get weird and the book drags. I have found that there are few books as satisfying as a hard sci fi novel, however this is a book that just flat out does not deliver. The plot takes a lot of turns that feel out of place and I can't remember a time when the author made me want to keep reading. At least it does have an intriguing idea and a solid end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never even finished this book.   It was not written well, and the prose was terrible.  The author was clearly trying too hard.  It wasn't a good book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete let down. It is an attempt to do a science fiction novel on the big screen.  It really comes across as nothing more than an attempt at a science-fiction novel.  The special effects are good and the story is a good story but nothing really comes of it.  I thought the story was a good premise for a science fictional movie.  Sadly, that premise is only ever fleshed out in a very brief two pages on page 37 and the rest of the story only ends up being the movie.   I give it a 2 star rating because it's a decent effort at a movie but nothing more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so looking forward to reading this book. I'm not sure how I missed this book when I started it. The ending was a letdown and it took me a long time to realize that the author has no clue how to write a book that is entertaining. This is a book to pass the time until something better comes along, like this.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book hoping for some new information on the topic. Unfortunately, what I got was another version of the same old BS - another book in the series that's been out for over a decade - so this is like a whole new book.   This book talks about how to "protect your assets" in a crisis, and then says "but we didn't use to do that, did we?".  It also tries to sell a bunch of other books by other authors that don't mention the subject at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a teacher and was looking for a quick read. I purchased this book hoping for something light.   It was a fun, easy, and fast read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I have enjoyed reading other reviews about this book, I don't think this is a good book. I found it boring, and I really don't like the plot. I'm going to recommend reading the original series first, then this one, as it is more accessible. This is one of the worst books I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have nothing bad to say about this book.   The characters were likable and the plot was simple, but there were too many twists and turns. I would like to see the author try some more different things. I wish I had had the time or the patience to read a couple of others by this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are so many good things in this book, but the fact that the characters never seem to make a decision that makes sense is a huge drawback.  I really didn't like this book at all. It was a quick read, so I finished it in a few hours and had no patience for the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a pretty good read but the story is just too slow to really pull the reader in and it is boring.   Overall I would say that this is a good read for people who enjoy a good historical fiction but I would suggest starting with other works by this author as well as The Odyssey if you like this type of story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the book, there is nothing but "feel good" talk about how nice everything is. There is not a single word about how it is not nice and how people will probably die. There are not even any pictures to help the reader understand that a horrible fate is about to befall everyone. This book is nothing more than a cheap horror story written by someone with little imagination and little knowledge of the world.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be poorly written and poorly conceived. The problem, as I see it, is that she wanted to do a feminist history of feminism, and failed to see how she ended up with a book that is a lot like the popular histories.   In her effort to be relevant to the present day she makes numerous mistakes, from presenting the term "political correctness" in such a broad way that it encompasses a variety of different ideologies and philosophies (which it is not) to presenting the same issue of "intersectionality" as if it were an issue of human rights (which as I read it, it is).   While I am a strong advocate of "trans-inclusive" transgenderism, the whole concept of trans-inclusiveness is flawed and I can't accept that Ms. Pankhurst believes that transgendered women are the same as cis women.  I am also not interested in the "queer" movement because it is really just a "queen" movement, albeit one with a strong sexual agenda (see the book's index). Ms.Pankhurst fails to make any sense whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that all the characters, both main and supporting, were the least developed. It makes me wonder what the point of having all these characters was.  I also didn't like the use of romance as a plot device.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is just awful. I wanted to like it, but it wasn't even close to good. It was like reading a badly written article about something that never happened, except the article was about a movie that didn't happen, and it had some pretty questionable details. That's about all I can say. If someone was going to get so excited about something they wanted to watch, the first book I'd read about it was probably the one I bought because I was told it was a good book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a writer, and while this book had great insights and writing tips, I can't say I learned anything new from it. I am still writing and researching my book for a possible submission to a major publishing house, but I do have my doubts about how this is a book that I will want to read or teach others to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A nice read, but I feel like the author's style is more akin to that of a "professional" fantasy author.    One of the most frustrating things about this book is the "spy in a fairy tale" thing:  At the end of the book, they seem to have no idea that the girl is not a spy at all, or she wouldn't be able to tell them everything, etc.  But if this is how magic works, why don't they use it more?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book expecting to get a real education on some of the common mistakes one can make in writing a paper. I was wrong. I got a pretty bad paper because I was doing the same stuff that every other student is doing at least some of which I agree with, and then I read "I want a job" by Mark Twain, which has the title written in one-sentence but the sentence flows so well that the entire book is written in that form. "   The reason why I thought this book was good is because of the way the author uses the word "wisdom" (I thought he was saying how wisdom is not a specific skill but rather a quality you have as a person).   While I agree that I don't have much in the way of wisdom, I do have a lot of other skills that I could definitely use in my job as a software developer.   To sum it all up, I just wasted hours and hours trying to learn to write papers on this subject that just wasn't going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, being the self-proclaimed 'hardest-working man in the world' would do anything to please his author fans and is not above exploiting his reputation to sell more copies.   I am a former graduate student and I am not one of those 'hardworking men in the west' to whom reading a book such as this is quite a revelation.  I feel cheated, disappointed and taken advantage of. I read the first few pages in a row and was ready to give up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book after giving away a copy of one of my old favorites - The Man Who Wasn't There. My expectations were pretty low. This book doesn't live up to the standard of those old books and while it is still an excellent book, there are several areas that are frustrating. I do understand why this book is a classic, but to me it does not live up even to the first. I read that it was written as an introduction to Scientology's history, but it was very poorly written. It is basically a story about a Scientology elder, who was a friend of mine when I was in Scientology for years in the early 80s. It reads like some kind of old person's version of the church - a lot of the information is not very up to date and, for me, would not have made sense even to those of us who are now a little more seasoned in the religion. As a side note, I'm pretty sure that it is an actual fact that Hubbard didn't believe in God. It was a revelation to me how gullible he was in the days before the internet and before the scientology.org. - the first book ever written on scientology was published in 1973, the first person I had heard of it was in 1985.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed with this book and I feel like I wasted my time reading it. This book was hard to read due to the repetitious characters, and the author did not add much in the way of new information to make it better.   The ending was also boring and did not bring a conclusion to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall this is a bad read, and a boring one at that. Although I enjoyed the book's tone, I think it would have been better if the story had been more in-depth. If you're not a fan of the Harry Potter books, this might not be a good fit for you, but it's a shame because I would have enjoyed the story more than what I got. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's bad attitude toward women is one of his many defects, though his other defects are a great deal more important. This book is about a guy who is unhappy because he can't get a girlfriend or a girlfriend he can get a lot of sex from. It's really, really hard, and the more I thought about it, the less of a book this was. In a lot more books, the guy would have the woman and be happy with it. I don't buy books that treat women like a side issue.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book about an animal, and the author never shows what his animal actually eats, and that seems like an important omission. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this book was really dull and repetitive, and I think I just didn't get what was being told. The writing style is just so dry, and most of the characters are really just a lot of nothing, with only a few (the few!) showing some spark of personality. The author seems to be so busy with her life that she forgets to write something funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book about half a dozen times and each time I get less and less invested. I have no idea what is going on here. There is too much redundancy. I feel like I have been watching the same sitcom for 10 years. At least the characters stay true to themselves and have interesting flaws but this book just feels like it is just going to make me feel the same way it always has.  I've read the other two reviews about this book and I agree. I read this one a few years ago and I still felt the same as I do about this one. The characters were great but I'm not convinced their flaws were that interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had high hopes for this book and I was not disappointed.   The pacing of the book was good.  The plot was intriguing, but I found that it was just thrown together at the end of the first book.  It was a little disheartening that she didn't just say this book had to end.  She could have kept writing more.  I'd like to see more of the world she's described.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is poorly written and the plot is absolutely ludicrous.  It is not as funny as the reviews I've read and the ending sucks big time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in one sitting and found it pretty much useless. I enjoyed the short stories and had some fun reading them. But in this book, there is no real plot. I found myself wondering if this was just a series of one-shots, or if it was some type of fan fiction, or what. I don't know the answers. I feel like there needs to be more story in these types of books. The stories in this one were pretty unoriginal and boring, and I really couldn't follow what was going on any of them. It just seemed like there was very little original thought put into this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love the idea behind this book but it did not live up to my expectations. In my opinion, this book has potential but there were many things that did not work for me. The writing style is very similar to some other fantasy books I have read before (Shelob, etc.). The world building is somewhat shallow with most of the important characters not being fleshed out. I was very disappointed by the "villain" in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this before, and it was much better.  It was fun to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very excited to hear that my father had given me this book as a Christmas gift, because I was looking forward to reading something from him.  He did not get what he was expecting, and the book, even though it had the word "museum" in it, didn't do a good job of conveying the meaning of the museum.  It's like watching the movies The Thing, The Thing in the Atmosphere, and The Thing from Another World, as the author tried to do the job that was not done, and failed, in those other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm pretty sure I'll never pick this book up again! I really enjoyed the first 50 pages and the first half of the book where we saw some things that I would definitely consider a spoiler. I can't wait to find out what happens next, but I will say this is not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had the pleasure of reading the first two books in this series - The Fiery Girl by Tessa Dare and The Faux Family by Tana French.   It's a lovely series but for me it is just as I'd expected from a fantasy series - it's not terribly original, the characters don't make me fall in love with them and the story doesn't really develop in any significant way.  I'm not going to give the series a negative because, like the author, I just expected more from her and the first book had all of that plus some of the problems I have with the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has nothing interesting in it.   It's very boring and I don't understand the need of it. I think the author is bored with writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is impossible to get into the spirit of the book and not be disappointed, and I have never understood the appeal of the original trilogy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book.   It's a very interesting topic and interesting to read but the author seems to have forgotten how to write in the past few years, since she had me at the end of this book with an "I could have written that" kind of ending.  Her style is very formal and academic so i was really disappointed in that, although it's not the fault of the book.   The book had some very interesting information but she did a bad job of presenting that.   I read a lot of biographies so my understanding of some things was a little rusty but I still would have enjoyed it more if she had gotten me up to speed on some of the things she was talking about.   So far i am sticking with my usual review of something a good read but if she does better then i might not be as much of a negative critic but i will give it a 2.00
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an old book, first published in 1874.   The language is archaic and the book is so badly written that it is hard to believe anyone bothered to do any research on the subject. I got the impression that the author really didn't care for the topic, so much so that he didn't bother to write a real introduction that he could have used as a springboard for an original, coherent, and interesting piece of writing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book but hated it to start with. I wasn't sure what to expect going into the book but it turned out to be a good one. I had no idea this book would be so much fun and interesting to read. The first third of the book was interesting to me. I found it very interesting how the author came up with the story for the book. It was a very interesting experience that I had a good time reading the book and enjoyed it as much as the authors claims in the book that the book is an homage to the movies. The second third of book was when things became a bit boring and I knew the author was pushing his own story lines. I'm very curious to see what he has in store for the third part. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing positive to say about it. It is a bad read and as a result the main character loses a lot of his credibility, and the main conflict becomes meaningless when the character is a complete idiot. The ending is poorly written. It takes away much of the mystery and tension from the story, and makes it just another harem. I didn't like the author's voice at all, and it reminded me of the voice of a middle school girl I used to know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book thinking it was going to be amazing and it totally flopped. It's a really boring story about a boy who is really into soccer. When the soccer player that he is interested in dies, the author gets the boys to make him a soccer ball. But the boy is too lazy to learn how to make soccer balls, so the author makes him a cat instead. So instead of the cat he has an animal friend, an iguana. There's a whole lot of talk about the cat (including a brief mention of the author being a cat-hater), but the only good things that the boy does are the ones the iguana tells him to do (like, eat the pizza without telling anyone and then leave the room so the cat won't get upset). I'm not sure if the author meant for it to be like this, but the story is so boring that I gave up after a few chapters. I would recommend this book, just so you can get an idea of what I was talking about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a waste of time, I could not wait to get through it. I've never read a book like this, with so much to learn and so many errors. The author has no clue how to spell, the book is confusing and there are too many references to other books. I'm sure I'd have liked a better book if this one had been in the library.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was the fourth book in the series.   It felt as though the author was trying to do too much in one book.  As far as the plot is concerned, I had some hope because there were some points about what happened in the past that I liked.  Unfortunately, I found the writing pretty lackluster.  It was very boring and I found myself wondering when the author would start pulling a fast one on us.  I mean, why did she get so bogged down in the history in the first book?   The ending is a disappointment and I did not think that it was enough.  What I would like to have seen, though, is more characterization and character development.  While it did include a good mix of male and female characters, it was not enough for me.  However, for some, this might be enough.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit,    it was a decent read.   It was slow paced,  but that just made   its impact more powerful.  The story seemed a little rushed at times.  It didn't have as much plot development as   previous books   but it was not a boring read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in a very short time and it just got me through the rest of it and I'm glad I did!   However, the ending, for those of you who know the story, is a bit of a letdown.   Overall, it was well worth the wait, but I felt that the ending had a bit more closure for the character's relationship than I'm used to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is horrible. The author, a well known author, should know better than to publish a book like this.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a book about "the one-time", but it doesn't do justice to "the life" of someone who was born and raised in England and moved to Australia. As far as I'm concerned the "one-time" in the title is as irrelevant as a "one", and the "living in Australia" is just as empty and irrelevant. If you want to know how the life of a child of the 90s was lived, it's the life that existed in those years, and what the story of the author's own generation is, it was a miserable one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not only poorly written, it is so poorly researched and written.   The most glaring example of this is a section on the American Civil War and the Confederate flag. I don't understand why they bothered to put this information into this book at all. The book is also badly written about the history of the world, particularly the American Revolution. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book. It is good, but you have to get to the good parts in order to enjoy it. I'm not sure if I'll read another one, but it was good and worth the wait.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift and it has not been a good read. I liked it initially, but quickly realized I was not going to like it at all.   The characters all have the most annoying and uninteresting personalities.  It has too much detail about what they wear and how much they drink, and there is a whole section on why they wear it.  There is nothing bad about this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants a realistic look at the real life of the military.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In summary, this is a good book that was never fully realized or realized well. It is an entertaining read and does not try to do too much, and I liked that. However, the book was not that great overall. There were parts that I didn't like and some that I did and other parts that didn't even interest me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is boring, and the author should try harder to write original thought and interesting characters.   I got bored pretty fast though, and I'm sure it is the same for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book about 2 weeks ago and I have just finished it.  It is very good but the author is a horrible, horrible human being.  He is so arrogant that he does not even try to cover up the fact that the book is a scam.  In fact, the book's title is a complete lie.  This book is not a business book. It is a self-help book.   If you want to know how to sell your wares, then read this book. If you are going to try and scam your way to success, this is not the book for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading this book, I had to read the entire Harry Potter series. If you're looking for some entertainment without being bored to tears, this is for you.    I love the world of Harry Potter but I hate all the books.   This is the only book that has stuck with me through the entire series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was boring. The story and world were great, and the writing was great, but the writing sucked. The ending of the novel was terrible, and I expected something more from a writer like David Brin, but that's just my opinion. My favorite bit of the book is when a woman gives birth to a baby in the same hospital that David Brins parents gave birth in. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be a waste of time. It was not as good as I thought it was going to be. I was expecting it to be much better. The only reason I give this four stars is that it is a good introduction to the subject and helps to understand the basic structure and style.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is a little repetitive, but I still enjoyed it. It was a real chore to write the second half of the story, but it was very fun when I got to it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a fan of this book. The book was written from an outside perspective and it seemed as if the author was giving the world the story. The world building and story elements were quite a good if not a little unrealistic. The story wasn't bad it just didn't make me think. The characters were not well developed and seemed to be one dimensional. If you are looking for a new mystery series this book isn't for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book didn't do anything new, and I'm not sure I will read it again, and it just doesn't seem interesting in the least to me.   There's a lot to talk about but it comes across like a lot of people sitting around at an academic conference and discussing something unrelated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this on impulse, but I have a hard time reviewing this book as a whole. The story was compelling at first, but there were so many problems it got me thinking: 1) I could never understand why the main character was so obsessed with the "bigger picture." Why would you want to change anything in your life when there's an even bigger picture out there that needs to be changed? 2) I can't think of any way this would be a good read for kids because it's clearly written for adults. 3) It's not clear what was the big plan of this book. The idea of creating a new race of warriors to overthrow a "god" in the past or present is interesting but it's unclear where they were going with the story. Overall, this was a really boring book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book before I had a chance to have an actual conversation with him. It seemed he knew everything about my life. I got so fed up with it that I threw it away. Now I can't stand him at all. If your the type who is always looking for answers, this book will keep you in the dark for a long time!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I had just gotten into reading and wanted a good book to go with it. But this book was horrible. No rhyme, no reason, no story. Nothing that made me want to go read the next book in the series or the one after that. Very disapointed.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was boring, but the characters were interesting and they did develop. The story took awhile to get going, but was very interesting as it progressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was in college, I thought it was a really great book. Then it turned out to be really bad. The bad part of this book were the characters. I found a lot of them were like stereotypes. Some were funny, some didn't have a whole lot of personality. But, overall, this book doesn't have much to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very mediocre book.   I don't believe in reading a book unless I can enjoy it.  A good book has to be well written and interesting.  The only thing that kept me from enjoying this book was that I was just about ready to give it back.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a disappointment. It's not bad because it is bad, which I am not sure is an accurate description. It is bad because there is a lack of good information. I have a lot of difficulty following and absorbing information.   I liked that this book was about a man who is trying to write a story about the life of a black man in the South.  However, the book is poorly written and poorly thought out, and is really not that interesting in any way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was a brilliant book about the difference between the spiritual world and the worldly world, but it was too much about that. I was looking for a spiritual book instead of a good one and I thought I was going to learn something new. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a disorganized and incoherent piece of garbage. The writing was awful, but the subject matter, the plot, and the characters are worse. There was no purpose to the book, no reason to listen to it. It was boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be rather dull and uninspiring. The writing is bad, and the author tries too hard to create an atmosphere of wonderment in the story, which never happens. I'm sure there is some value in the book, but I would avoid reading it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this and read it for a while, then gave up on it.   It was ok but nothing amazing.  If you want to get more into SF and science fiction, read something like the other books in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a reader I had high expectations from this book, but those were dashed very early on. The writing style seems like someone's that couldn't make up his/her mind on whether they wanted to write fiction or non-fiction, but decided to try both so they could see which one they liked more. I was pretty disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. When I read the blurb, the synopsis and the blanks, I thought: "Wow, this sounds interesting!" Unfortunately, the author, who I had already decided was going to be interesting by the bla bla, failed at the very thing she was looking to succeed in. There was zero tension, and I don't want to say I was bored, but there was no excitement. It is written in a very mechanical way with a lot of "here's how this will end" blabber. The only things I have learned from reading this book is that if you have read any other horror/thriller in the last 40 years, then this is not for you. I'm not sure what the point is of the book, but I'm really disappointed because the plot seemed interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book, or any of the other ones on this list. As far as I was concerned the writing was not professional. The author's style was a little clumsy for a seasoned pro.   For the average reader this book is a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has all the elements of the perfect fantasy. A girl gets abducted by a magical dragon, and has to fight him off to survive, and then the dragon is really just an evil wizard who's trying to lure her back to his lair.   There were some very good points and some very bad points, and the bad points are quite bad.  The problem is the character development.  After the girl wakes up and learns about her true heritage, she still spends the rest of the book just learning about her surroundings and getting captured and fighting her way back to safety.  I mean, come on.  At one point, she manages to take down a dragon.  This is the first time I've read a fantasy where I couldn't make a hero out of a heroine.  It would have been nice if there was a little more development, but that isn't really what I expected from the author.  Overall, it was a fun read, but not as good as the first book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book didn't do what it set out to do, but I did learn quite a lot, and got some excellent advice and examples from the authors.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a horrible book.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  It was very dry, and it did not make me want to read the next book. The author makes no effort to make the world exciting, and I'm sorry that I bought it, but I'm just not a big fan of the series.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that does not work very well. First off, the writing is absolutely terrible. The characterizations are really hard to get a handle on and it makes the book so clunky to read. The ending is really confusing as well. This is the worst book I've ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was never a fan of this book and I wasn't sure why until I read the review by the author. There was nothing wrong with this book. The premise is that you get one free ticket on a roller coaster (or what they said was a rollercoaster). I never got one.  I have to admit the author seems like a real nice person (he did say he would donate his royalties if I enjoyed it).   The only problem with this is that the book has no suspense.  It's just another ride.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has two parts: the first part is fairly dull, but the second part is absolutely terrible. I would like to give this a higher rating than a 3 but the plot was just too unbelievable for me to finish the first book.   My only hope is that the next book gets better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, but the plot is a terrible failure.   It's like when a woman is raped by a stranger, but it's not her fault.  Instead, she's "raped" by a random guy who she's totally attracted to, yet he's also completely repulsive.    And the end, after that awful scene, makes no sense at all.  I'm so disappointed, I really don't know what to think of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm an old fashioned guy, I like to sit down and write on a nice big piece of paper and it takes me hours.  I bought this because it was free and I got hooked on the story line but I wasn't interested in the characters. The characters are a huge turn off for me, and most books don't work for me because I have a low threshold for entertainment.  So it took me awhile to actually finish the book but now that I've read it, I have no desire to read anything else by this author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bit of a slog at times but still worth your time.   There were times when I felt like I was just reading an old fashioned mystery novel with an over the top plot and characters that didn't even seem to like each other.  I would not read another of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book as a present for a college friend's wedding. My friends are all very fond of this book, and I found it a fascinating look at how we all evolved from dinosaurs to humans.   Unfortunately, a lot of the information I found interesting was misleading or wrong, so the book became a frustrating slog. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm glad the author is not a white male, because this is a book written in the 19th century and would be completely incomprehensible to anyone from the 21st century. It is like a book of Shakespearean dramas but with a bunch of men with no women. The author never addresses why it is that these men are allowed to have sex with many of the women in the book, which is completely ahistorical (the book mentions that it was once legal, but no one seems to realize it wasn't until the 19h century).   The first half of the book is about an encounter between the two lovers in the 18th century. The second half of this book is a review of the same two lovers, but with an author and publisher's note at the beginning and after the review, which states, "This book is in a sense a celebration of the sexual freedom that existed at the time, but that was then quickly taken away by the state."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is extremely poor. It was difficult to understand.    Overall, it's just not enjoyable to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the first 50 pages, I was a little taken aback by the author's obvious passion for the story. I'm a little surprised that the author has the discipline to stick with a story like this and that it's taking her this long. She clearly is talented in her storytelling, but this isn't a good story to learn by reading. It's not clear why the characters want to kill their father. There are plenty of unanswered questions. The ending is not what I expected, but I'm glad that this is the only book by this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My daughter is a big fan of the first four Harry Potter books and the movies (including the one she did not get to see). I have read many reviews of the books and most of them were bad. The movie was not nearly as good as the books. This book is supposed to be the follow-up, but it's just not there. I did not have any idea what to expect from this book. But it was very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had this book on my bookshelf for quite some time but I only picked it up today after I noticed that my favorite authors were getting lots of attention lately. When I first read the first few pages I felt annoyed that it was so self-righteous. I wanted to roll my eyes at the author and tell him to shut up. Unfortunately he didn't let me. There's also a lot of things that I would have liked to see changed or better explained. But, I guess it's a novel, right? I'm not sure I would call this book very enjoyable. It had a lot going on for me but I kept reading because it had the kind of ending that would make my stomach flip.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have enjoyed this book. It's not as good as  I  , but it's still good. If you like books by John Green, then this is a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I never would have expected a book with an obvious, in-your-face attack on the current state of politics, to be a riveting read.   It's a book that would be right up a lot of people's alley, especially those who want to see politicians go down.  The main characters are extremely well drawn and have some of the most compelling and memorable back stories.  Unfortunately, I felt that the characters were the least interesting aspect of the book.  Even though the story was mostly well done, the characters didn't do much to make the story any better.  And yes, there were plenty of quotes from current politicians and the main character was quite aware of them.  It was all a bit too much of a one-sided attack on current politics.  I found the most interesting aspect to be the background to how the book was written.  One thing that struck me about the book is how much he was quoting a lot from previous authors (such as the quote above) and how well he integrated it into the text.  As far as how well it worked as a political book, I found it a bit hit-or-miss, but I thought it was very clever.  Another good thing about the story is the length of it.  Overall it was pretty good, but there were a few parts that felt rushed or did not match the tone or overall tone of the story.   3.5 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good story, but the first third is confusing, the characters don't develop, and the end was really hard to swallow. The next book in the series will hopefully address this issue, but it's worth waiting for.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In retrospect, I was so obsessed with the romance plot that I didn't notice the many faults in the book.   The most serious of these is that the romance, while not terrible, is very cliched.  Even the characters that are supposed to be "good" are either incredibly unlikable, or they're given a huge personality flaw that gets them killed by the end of the book (like a dog that's in love with an idiot).  It's just one long chase scene, that's all.  Also, the romance is a little too contrived.  In one of the earlier books I read, the guy had a heart attack before the girl, but in this one it's a bit more complicated.  I have an intense crush on the author.  So if you do like his books, I wouldn't read them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is okay, but the book didn't do what the story was trying to do.  The world building was good, but it was so off the beaten path that I don't think it really made much sense, or it seemed kind of out there to some people.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure where I'd start, with 'Hands', if I were to read it.  I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, as it was written as a narrative about a woman (but not a woman) who's struggling to fit into the 'world of men'.  What I ended up getting was a rather disjointed collection of first-person descriptions of the adventures of a female protagonist, followed by an occasional chapter from the point of view of the'men' (a 'boy' as well as'man'), before it veers off into something that may be more aptly described as 'a man and woman' story' (or even 'a woman and boy').  In some ways, it's not too bad, but in other ways it's rather irritating and at times seems to be trying to be about'men and women' (which is interesting, but if it were, why not put it in a woman-centric book rather than a boy-centric one, which has the added benefit of having a strong female lead).  The prose is also rather odd and un-reliable.    One word of advice:  I'll be going on a trip to the UK soon, and I'm going to be reading a lot of books in this genre.  And I'm just hoping to pick up something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was disappointing in every way imaginable.   It seems that no one really thought of what to do with these characters after the events of the first book.  I was excited for the third book, but once again, the ending was not what I was expecting.  It's just not the same.  As the book closed, I felt that the characters were finally being moved to the point where they could live out their fantasies of being pirates (without actually being pirates). But this time, the characters are in the same boat, so much so that one of them gets the boot.  This was a very disappointing ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a really fun read, but the ending was so stupid that it makes me wish I'd gotten a new Kindle or Kindle version instead.   I enjoyed the book so much that I actually made it to the end and enjoyed it enough to read the next book, The Great Gatsby. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had no idea what to expect from this book, so I was surprised at the quality of the book. My main problem with the book is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a wonderful book, but unfortunately the author does not provide many pictures.   There is one really good picture that appears at the very end of the book, and a small section at the end that includes pictures of a few of the various characters.  The pictures are good, however, the descriptions in this book were not as good as they should have been.  This could have been a great book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a couple of these. The most recent was the last one, which was terrible.    The characters were dull.  The story was dull. And the plot was dull, especially with the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narrator and the story is a horrible example of what can happen when writers use "realism".  A character that I liked was very well written but the story was so badly written that I could have done without it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has no good points. I bought this book thinking it would be a great read about a successful entrepreneur. I really did expect more from a book that has been out for a year. I read through all of the information on the web and a few other books that were useful. Unfortunately the material is completely outdated and is written for people that are still working their way through school. I do not recommend this book to anyone. It does not have any real application to real life situations.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   After reading The Way of Men, I was disappointed by the author's decision to write about a few of the men in the story, without writing about the female characters or what I take to be the moral of the story. This book seemed more concerned with describing how the man in question, in a strange twist of fate, was "saved" by his female friend, the fact that he was able to "overcome" his sexual problems, and the fact of the friendship.   I feel that a book should be about the characters as much as the plot (though the plot is usually important).    The characters in this book, though well written, did not feel real to me, nor did they feel like real people.  If I had to pick one flaw in this novel, I think it is the fact  that the author fails to include the female viewpoint in the book.  This might not seem a huge problem, but when the writer's goal is to describe a man, I believe the female's perspective should have been given a more prominent role. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed by this book.   The author does not understand the principles behind the game.  I have played the game many times and have always seen a clear difference between good and bad players.  In this book he says that bad players do not understand good players and he does not know how the games really are played.  He does not have any idea what the good players think, he says they have bad vision and do not know when to make a move.  The book is basically a huge argument about which one is better. The author says that you should never play like a good player and the rest of the book is a discussion about what you should play like.  So he is arguing that when you play like good players, you will lose.  And the book's conclusion is that you need to play like bad players to be a good one.  It seems to me like a poor argument against good players.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book after a long hiatus, but after reading through it, it came out as a bad attempt at the book of Mormon.  This was a review written with my mind, so if you read it and think it's a bad one, be warned that it's mostly based on my own impressions.  There are several glaring mistakes which I have corrected in the above, but most of the book's flaws is that it takes liberties with what the Book of Mormon actually said (which is not much at all).  The first major one is the use of the words "forsaken" and "lost" and many other words that can mean lost, etc..  This seems to be a pattern with the book: the words are taken out of context, and made to mean something completely different.   As someone who has studied the Book not just with the intent of being a critic, but with the intention of understanding it, and who is now in a position to objectively see if the Book really says the things it says, it's hard to put this book on my shelf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book reads well enough but there were so many typos it was hard to understand.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book several times and it is just boring.   A lot of pages of information are given and not a lot of action happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only an abysmal waste of time, it is also a disgrace. The author, I don't remember who, takes some of the best ideas from other books and does nothing with them, other than just repeats them. As a fan of Star Trek, I'm always looking for good new ideas to use. Instead, this book just repeats all the old stories, and it just can't be worse than the old Star Trek movies and shows. It's not a bad story. It just does a terrible job of capturing the spirit and quality of those older shows.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a joke, the author is trying too hard to be a "badass"   and the book is riddled with typos and the spelling is awful  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot was too shallow and repetitive. The pacing was very slow at times.   I think the author was trying too hard to make this book sound exciting, like some kind of action thriller, which isn't what this is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the book is a bit too simplistic. The first half of the book, which I would consider a preface, presents various ways of dealing with the problem, and provides detailed explanations for each method. The second half of it gives some examples, and discusses some problems that have occurred in the use of these methods. There were many problems with the book (my only problem was the author's use of the "b" word in the title.   So what to think? I had never heard of it, so I did a search on the web and found that it was written by a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. A good overview of the problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot was so boring that I had to read the whole thing twice to get any sense of what happened.  I guess I had the right idea with the plot being based around the world but that it was only slightly connected to the main characters, and it never seemed to go anywhere.  And it's hard to believe that the main character was a 12-year-old when he started, and still only has a few chapters left.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is just not very good with words and doesn't know what to do with her plot, she doesn't seem to know what her characters are thinking either.  I just don't buy this book, there is too many plot holes and characters that don't really belong, the author has to have a huge ego to create a book like this... but then she comes up with these crazy plans like going to the Moon, I guess her ego is bigger than the book
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really should have read this book before starting my own blog and I did not enjoy it at all.   It is pretty much an excuse to write long rambling rambling and I couldn't get past a part about how he used a "good" quote of Einstein to support his claim that the brain works like a video game.  This is exactly what people like to do because you get quotes out of the book that back up their argument but the quotes are wrong.  He says that it's not enough to just learn something.  You must put in some "work".  The first part of this book is about learning.  The second part is about applying what you've learned.  In the first part, he says that you must write.  I don't have a lot of patience for people who can't write.   Myself and my sister have a large collection of books and my older sister still does her own reading.  She's a fantastic writer, but she's not great at getting out of her own way and writing, which is something I am not great with either.  She can sometimes come across as lazy and self indulgent, which would be fine if it weren't for her writing a blog that has caused people to write rambling comments and I've seen some very bad comments about it.   Her blog has made a lot less people want to read her book, which I am fine with.   So if you want to do that, you're welcome.   I really hate having to write things that I don`t like.  If you want your book to be better, go read some books and make your own.   But you don't need to read me to tell you that this book doesn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When i got this book, it was going to be my first time reading a book with a female protagonist and i wasn't looking forward to it. I love books that give me an emotional connection with the story, i.e. i read a lot of fiction and it always gets me thinking about the characters. I was super excited to get this book and i was really excited that there was a girl in the book. The characters i love, the writing is good and it had me so emotionally invested. My friends didn't like this book at all and i had to explain it to them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is good and the characters are interesting but the plot is rushed and the plot twists are not very believable, and the ending is stupid and poorly done. Not that the ending sucks, just that it is rushed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book before going on vacation. I was looking forward to reading about the war in Iraq, but the book is so confusing and I only skimmed a few pages, so I'm not sure what I was actually getting out of it. I'll be reading about Iraq in the future. But, I do have to say that I wish they would stop making up war stories. I found them ridiculous and hard to believe.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing good about this book is that it was fun.   My daughter and I both liked it because the author writes for a younger audience. The book is hard to read, but that is a common issue when reading for a young child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author did an excellent job with the plot and character development. However, I found the book too slow to develop its story. It also had an overall lack of emotional intensity.   I would definitely recommend this book to a friend, if he/she has any interest in history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen some bad books but this is the worst.   It is full of grammatical errors, badly written, poorly researched, and just plain horrible.  I'm sure it is a bestseller because it is so good and there are probably hundreds of others like it, but the author needs to put in more effort in other areas, I will never buy another book from this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was great from start to finish but I'm just not feeling it. If I have to read the entire book again I'm not reading it anymore. The author is not a professional when it comes to writing a book, the author spends the majority of the book talking about various other books rather than the book itself. As a reviewer, this is not helpful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disappointment. The whole book is just a compilation of quotes from various scholars. The book does a good job of trying to present some of the major ideas of these thinkers and some of their critiques of each other. But it seems to have tried to be too broad, and so, most of the quotes are taken from different texts and different times, instead of from a single source (or sources), which is just one way to be a more accurate and complete book. This book seems to come from a book club that was asked to read a book every year by the same author that we read in college.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning it seemed like this book was going to be the most important thing that ever happened to me. It took me until last week to figure out that the author was so desperate for readers that she couldn't write about anything else.     It's all well and good to be passionate about something you love. It's even more true when that thing is the life of someone who died so young, and yet still carries such an immense amount of life and energy. I can't help but feel that the writer, as well, must be in a constant state of emotional withdrawal and agony. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book, I started to think that many, many people who read my books have never read anything by me. After all, I'm the author of the book that is now a hit. But what I learned from this book is that if you are serious about your work, you need to make it as well written and well paced as possible. I was so impressed with all of the information that it took me hours to read the book, but it was all just so damn important, that it didn't even take that long.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It had a pretty good story, I just wish there was more. It was a nice change of pace from books I usually read, which are about the same. I would have liked a more in-depth look at the different sides of the war and the people involved, and maybe a little more humor (I know I'm biased) But all in all, it was just ok. It wasn't a bad read, but I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really hoping to read the book that was advertised but was disappointed. It was so hard to get into the story!   It doesn't seem to have much of a ending, but there's a really interesting ending so I won't call it a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book from the beginning. I tried to get through it and found it boring. I don't really care for sci fi. This book was too predictable to be interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a brilliant scientist but his book is filled with sloppy errors. I got the impression he didn't read the material carefully enough. The best scientific book I've read in a long time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I liked about this book is that it tells an important story. The real problem was that the story was ruined by a bad ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts off really well, with a really good description of all the different kinds of plants that are edible. The description of the edible plants is good, but the actual plant is too bland to be any good. The plant is covered in many different kinds (I think) of stems and leaves, and the description doesn't seem to include any of them, so I wasn't even sure if there were plants in the book.  After about 25 pages, there is a reference to a mushroom, so perhaps there was a plant in the description, but no description, and it doesn't really provide much information about the mushroom. After this point, the mushroom is mentioned for the first time, and even though the description is really good, the mushrooms are just a "garden variety" mushroom that would be more exciting if they were described.  The best part of the book was the photographs. There were a number of good photographs that really showed the plants.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character, in an attempt to make his life better, goes back to work, leaving his wife and daughter behind. He soon finds out that they never had a happy childhood, that they are being constantly pestered by their father and are going to have to move out.   This is a book about abuse, and I didn't feel a lot of sympathy for the author, and the way he wrote the main character was so negative. There is nothing positive to say about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The world is a crazy place. I read about this guy, a scientist, who is a great guy, but gets sucked into a life-or-death situation he doesn't know how to deal with. He becomes a bit of a nut, and then a bit more a nut. I can see this being a very funny story, but I felt that the ending was kind of anticlimactic and silly.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the result of a bad study I did last semester. The main point of the paper was to show how easily we can be duped by an attractive person who claims to know something we do not know, or in a good sense. This was a very well written paper and a good read. My wife is also a psychologist and she has no patience for people who think they can read people's minds or be a "cure" for the writer's bad study skills.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no good in this book.   The main character, who is portrayed as a nice person at first, develops into a cold person.  He will not even talk to his wife, who he has been with for years.  There are no scenes where I wanted to feel sympathy for the main character. He never really cares about her or their kids and in the end she is still lonely and unhappy.  I had to put my children to bed after finishing this book because their eyes were bloodshot.  If you are a book lover and have read many good books this is a must read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book will NOT make you a better person.   It makes you a dumber person.  It also makes you believe you are so great that people will flock to you and admire you.  It's a pity that people do not follow their dreams. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book started out like every other book I have read (not a bad thing) until it got bogged down in an endless series of tangents about other books and the author's life. At a certain point, you either get bored, or the author is trying too hard to impress a certain section of the readership. Not a bad read but probably not one that I would recommend to my friends or family.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book didn't give me much to care about, but for the price it is a great alternative to the more expensive authors.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The pacing is awful. It is like a bad re-telling of A Christmas Carol with a lot more cursing and profanity.   There is no point to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A boring read. I think I got the gist of the story. It's basically about some people who had some big success and then something happens to them and it changes their lives. I really liked the title. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I went to this in bookstores, and then it got moved to a library. I was so angry about the move that I was prepared to throw this at the book case, when I found a free copy in the bookcase on another shelf. I do hope the author will return to a physical book where it can be read by anyone who wants it.   This has the same problems as The Last Samurai, the book has all the same flaws, it just doesn't include the most important thing, the historical information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say I hated this book. The plot was a disaster, the characters were flat and there wasn't a whole lot of humor in the story. This story is written by a woman. No offense to male authors, but this was the worst I've ever read by a female author. I'm not sure why I even bothered with the book because it was just a complete waste of time. The first three chapters were very interesting, but the rest was just plain awful.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is really bad. I loved the title and the idea of it and the author did a really nice job on it. Then, the book falls apart. The character development (or lack thereof) is pretty weak. I found myself going through the chapters over and over again and not enjoying the read. And I was a little put off by the use of language. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a great book and I was really looking forward to reading it, but once it hit the shelf and I found it was missing some parts I was very disappointed.   I'm not a huge fan of books that are not "good" books, I'm just not a big fan of having to pay to get the whole story.  Also the description on Amazon was pretty bad.  The title is a little misleading, it says "Risking everything to save a woman you've loved for a long time". But it is not a love story. It's a story about two very different characters who fall in love, but fall apart in the end. The main characters aren't the best and the ending was pretty abrupt, but there is so much to enjoy in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for a class, and what it should have been is about the art of storytelling. Unfortunately, it fell short of that promise.   There are many interesting ideas presented in this book, but the author fails to translate them into a narrative that makes you care about his characters.  A student, named C.B., is a self-described "lone wolf" who never really "got it" about the importance of being on his college campus. He has a history of being bullied, and the only thing that keeps him going is his love for his best friend and fellow student, T.B. He also comes from a poor, dysfunctional family that is constantly involved in crime and drug-running. He's got a dark past and has issues with his sexuality, but he's a decent guy that does his best to hide it.  This book could have been a great read, but unfortunately I don't think it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a lot of hype for a lot  of things, and if it didn't have a little bit of a plot to it that worked I might have actually  liked  it. The plot is simple:  It's a lot like The Chronicles of Narnia, only much worse,  and the writing is terrible. There is one scene that is actually kind of good and some of the writing in it is decent, but as I said, everything else  is awful, especially the setting. There's no plot, the characters all have one thing in common and it never changes.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the definition of a terrible idea. It is extremely confusing and lacks any sort of clear explanation or even logic. The only thing that keeps me going on is the promise of an easy solution.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first time I ever read this book I was so excited that it was an author I'd never heard of. When it turned out to be a poor parody I was extremely upset.     After reading it again I realized that the writing is bad, and I'm not even a big fan of the characters.  The cover was a terrible joke, as is the title of the book itself, but the actual book is just a poor adaptation of a mediocre book.  I hope that at least I can recommend this as an example of a bad parody, but that's it for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very poor. As a result I never look forward to reading another. I'm disappointed, as the premise of the story is really cool. The science is solid, and if you like science, this book will probably be good for you. However, I just don't see how there could be a lot of space aliens in the solar system that we've never found before. We should have found them by now and we haven't.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with typos, errors in wording, and inconsistencies in grammar.   Despite the many mistakes in the language, the authors provide a wealth of information that may help you understand the importance of these things.  If you are not a linguist, or if you have a basic understanding of how language works, you will have difficulty comprehending the content.  As with many other "language learning" books, a lot of this material is outdated and doesn't include the latest information.  It is well worth the money to purchase this book if you want to learn how to speak in a foreign language, but it is not necessary to buy for that purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be a pretty standard sci-fi, so I wasn't sure why it took me so long to read it. I finally read it a few weeks ago and it did take me a little while to get into it.  I thought the first couple of chapters were pretty good, but eventually I had to get on with the story.   The plot is decent, but I found it hard to follow.    I would give it 3 stars if I could. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, for what it is, was fine. It just wasn't for me.   It's a novel about a man who works with women in the military and then meets another man who wants him to get out of the military (but does not say why, nor does he ever seem to explain anything). The woman he ends up with is a bit like the "whoring/sexist/anti-patriarchal" woman who he encounters on his first night as a man, a woman who is "uncomfortable" with him, but "gets off" on him sexually because she thinks he is hot, and "would make a great wife." It's not entirely clear who the "other man" is, if any. It is hard for me to imagine what makes the "lady" so attractive to him, if she was always so bad about it. And the whole thing makes him "not the right kind of man" (in the traditional sense of the word) - a very typical woman's idea of the right "kind of man."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most boring book i have ever read. No characters. No story. No action.  The only interesting thing about it is the way the author describes all the   the old car parts he finds and how it looks.  4)  The Last Question by Charles Portis (1999) (Reviewed by The Guardian) Portis, an ex-cop turned private eye, is a hard-nosed, no-nonsense man who doesn't mind taking the law into his own hands, but Portis' methods don't always work out in his favour.   "The Last Question" is Portis's first foray into crime fiction, and he shows a willingness to dig into the most twisted of motives and situations.   The story begins with a serial killer (the first of several), and continues into his next victim. 3)    The Road (1973) From the time the first of the three main characters, Mark Twain, leaves his farm on a horseback ride, the story unfolds.   The story has a strong Western feel to it, but it is far more than just a western - the author takes a long time showing the characters' struggles to survive.   While "The Road" is not my favourite, it is still very much worth a read.   (By the way, the horseback rides are amazing.   This was one of those books that gave me the chills from reading it over and over, just because of the way Twain was riding along.   I hope Twain has one of these now.   There is some fantastic photography by the photographer and illustrator that is a highlight of this book.) 2)   The Da Vinci Code (2007) It's been seven years since the last time I read The DaVinci Code, and in that time I've managed to acquire a whole set of books that are written by one author and illustrated by another.   Despite this, I still find The Da Vinci code a very enjoyable and interesting read.    It begins with the characters of Leonardo da Vinci, who is dying of fever and being cared for by his friend, Michelangelo.   When Leonardo asks his friend what happens to the knowledge he has, Michelangelus tells him "the devil has the keys."   Leonardo then asks "So, I need a key to get out of this house?"   This set up is repeated several times, with Michelangelo asking
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to get this book, but ended up disappointed. I really enjoyed the story, but it felt rushed to me, and not as interesting as I had expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author does not go through the story line. The author gets distracted by a very interesting premise and ends up doing nothing more than re-inventing the wheel. She repeats the same basic ideas over and over, and doesn't take the time to make a real contribution to the story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it is one of the most well-written books I have read in a long time. The author does a great job of telling the story, with a strong narrative. However, there were parts that did not work.  It seemed as though the author wanted to include all the main characters of the book in this book.  This was done, however, in a rather rushed and poorly done way.  I did not like that the book ended with a cliffhanger.  Perhaps next time, this book could have been written in a much better fashion.   Overall, the book was well written and I enjoyed the read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when it first came out, and found the premise (the story of a group of women who travel through time to save one of their own) interesting. The only problem with this premise is the amount of bad writing that is done. For example, this book starts out with a woman's mind uploading into an AI that is being kept in a "computer-like" environment for the sole purpose of killing the "bad guy" and "saving the world." Now, I know that these bad guys are called "bad" in this book because their actions are always evil and wrong and all that, but I had no issue with the idea that a woman could think in a computer (because of course she does), thus uploading into a AI to save a bad guy who needs to die and who is being held against her will in a place that is actually a kind of torture device. What I had a real problem with, though, was that the whole thing was written as if it was the only way she could save herself. She had to get to the bad guy so that she could upload into the AI. I have to say that when I say I had problems with the premise, I'm not talking about how it started out, I mean that in the middle of the book, the characters start saying "Let's go on an adventure" and then the bad guys turn out to be the baddies. This has been done in some books where a person who is going to die has an AI give her a "time out" before she goes. This is another case where the "evil" aspect of the baddie becomes more important than saving the person. Then, when the "good guy" finally shows up to help the person and then tries to kill her, this makes no sense and makes you wonder why the bad dude didn't just kill the bad girl when she was bad instead of taking over her mind, because, of course, he did. The author makes some other "bad dude" bad guy bad guys, the bad cop who tries to "save the world" for some strange reason, and even the female computer-like person (who doesn't do anything but talk) when she wants to save herself is basically a sex toy for the good guys. The worst thing, though is that she does this and her plan fails miserably because the bad thing she wanted to prevent actually happens (the bad guy actually gets killed). So the author uses this as
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was boring and made me angry all the way through the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the one of the worst books I've ever read. I found the narrative incredibly incoherent and the characters so flat and lifeless, I thought the author had no idea what the book was about at all. I will be going back to look up the reference for "Moral Courage" which I think explains everything but at the time, I had to put the book down.   I had no real connection to the main character and all I got out of this was an annoying and tedious book full of self-contradiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because the publisher promised the book would be a good one. It did not live up to that promise. It was boring, confusing, and hard to understand. I read the last page just hoping to find out more about the main character's fate. It took all of 3 chapters before I could see a connection between the events of the other books in the series. I would have preferred this book to be written in a style similar to the other two books in this series. However, the plot twists are too great to make up for the boring and confusing writing. I'm not giving this book a star rating, just because I couldn't stand it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really hard to get into. I was really enjoying the stories but the prose was confusing and I found myself reading the reviews on the internet and finding it hard to finish it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book and I hate it! In fact, I can't stand it... it's all so cheesy, over-the-top, and utterly ridiculous. It is a big part of the reason why I'm disappointed with my love of history books.  The author is a very, very arrogant and smug person. She can't even stand her own book (though she did praise her other work); and her tone of voice is so irritating and annoying... I have never enjoyed reading a book so much in so little time. This book is a total waste of time. I'm glad I finished it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got tired of reading these books and then I got really bored with it.   A book about an author in a wheelchair and a black girl in love with the main character in a white town seemed so much more interesting than these boring books.    I think there is a lot to learn about life from these books, but so many people should know that these books are just an advertisement for the author's brand name and they don't teach anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a terrible book. I did not like it at all. The story is stupid and the characters are extremely stupid. The author writes that the author is an author in the book, but I'm not sure he is. I don't care about this book at all, so I will definitely not be buying any more books by this author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is good for those who already have a basic understanding of human behavior and the workings of the human brain. The author has done a nice job of combining information on the brain and behavior into a coherent and coherent book. However, I found that the book lacks in detail about the neurochemical systems of different areas of the brain. There were a number of good references, and the book would be a good read for those interested in neuroscience. I wish it had been longer, and that the author had provided a little more detail about various types of learning and memory (learning and memory are a major theme in this book, and while they were the subject of chapter 8 (Memory), there are some issues about how well that understanding translates to other areas of behavior).
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have loved this book.  It was fun, but so many details were left out or changed. I think that the author has a way of bringing up interesting topics, and the topics I liked were very well written. However, I was disappointed that my husband (who had read and loved the first two books) found the book too "sci-fiy" and the story too depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to try to learn about the "secret" to keeping a dog happy and I got bored.  I also am a dog owner and have owned many dogs but this is the first book that I found that taught me the basics of dog training.  If you are considering dog training but haven't got to this section before this book may save you time and money in the long run.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed in this book.  The concept of the story was really good and it would be a good addition to a collection of children's stories I own.  However, this book was just so boring!  In some stories it was not so bad because the characters were just so childish and the author tried to explain to the readers how to solve the problem.  It was just really confusing.  In this book however, the characters all seem to know how to work with the problem and there are lots of pictures.  Also, there were several parts of the book where it seemed like the author was going off on a tangent that I couldn't follow because he had done something so boring that he had no more idea what to do next.  This book is not worth the money, and for the price it should be available online.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book about 3 times. It's good at first, but it gets really dull very fast, and I feel like the authors are just trying too hard to make something exciting out of some minor ideas. There are some good points, and the writing is generally good. It really just doesn't have anything for me to enjoy. Maybe I'm just not in the mood for this kind of thing. It is really just a bad science fiction book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I gave this a three is because it's an okay book and I like the style of writing, and I've read a lot of books in general. However, the pacing could have been a lot better, as it didn't take long for me to get frustrated with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, the book is very poorly written and the author goes out of his way to give the most ridiculous story possible about the situation he is trying to explain. This is a good thing because the book would be worse if the author didn't go out of their way to create as much confusion as possible. Also, the main character is a dumbass (and not in a good way) but also really, really stupid and arrogant. It was very difficult to read this because I had to concentrate to read what he was saying. I would not recommend this book.  It is about 5-6 pages long, but in order to find out what I wanted to hear the author had to give me a long section that explains how this is all going to happen. The author does this all the time to make sure we can't understand what is going on but this time it didn't work because I kept asking myself "what's the point?" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, but the plot was too much like a really good book that I like, but not quite enough like that book to make me want to pick it up. In my case, the plot did get me interested, but it was not as good as I'd hoped it would be. A good idea, and I recommend it, but I wouldn't want to read the book and then try to get it out of my head... Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was awful - I couldn't find much to like in it. The story is really poor. It was made to have a happy ending and never did, but then it seemed to have some kind of twist which had the potential to be really neat, but was so rushed that I couldn a) not have anticipated what was coming, and b) wasn't ready to be done with the story when it did occur. I'm sure the writer had a lot of fun creating it, and all of the characters are likable, but this book was just an annoying, tedious, and forgettable waste of space.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited to read this book because I am a fan of science fiction.  The only problem is that this book, like most sci fi, is a lot of crap. The writing is terrible and the premise of the book is wrong. If you are thinking about trying this book or anything by the author, just don't read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book   My girlfriend gave me a copy of this book for her birthday and I was so excited,   but when I finished the book  I was very disappointed.    It's a great read if you like a good fantasy romance but if you're expecting a great book with original characters and not a retelling of some classic, I would say no thank you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited for this book. I can't believe that my book club has had me waiting so long.   The only things I liked about this book was the author's research and the book's plot.  The character development is mediocre.  This book was so boring, and I kept putting the book down because I just couldn't get into it. I don't know if I can say that about a majority of books.  It's hard for me to read a novel and get invested because I know what's going to happen next and am completely unprepared for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book, which I was looking forward to and I'm glad I read it, but I'm not sure I can give it a full five stars.   The story was interesting, though it had a few problems that bothered me.  In addition to the problems listed in the book's review, I also felt that the story was too convoluted and that the ending was a little too simplistic.  I did enjoy the way the characters moved from one thing to another, and the way their relationships were developed, but this was a book about a woman who doesn't care about anything other than her work.  The end of the story made the readers feel empty, even though the story didn't really have a happy ending.    Overall, this book was ok, but it was nothing special. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this on my Kindle and I was really excited about it.   Sadly, I found the characters boring and the story, at times, uninteresting.  I do like the idea behind the story and I really loved the way the characters were depicted. However, I can see why it got a lot of good reviews, because it is fun, but nothing else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My first experience reading a "new" fantasy was a disappointment. While the premise sounded intriguing (a girl who was magically turned into a horse, and finds her way home with the help of an archer, a rogue and a giant frog) I found myself bored, confused and exasperated with the plot and characters. The book is set in the Old West. The author uses the classic fantasy tropes (the hero is a white man, the bad guys are evil). But she seems not to get the historical context in which these ideas are rooted in reality. For example, the book does not seem to care that the archer and rogue are from a world that didn't have horses until after World War II. It also doesn't seem to get that the horse-man is a common fantasy character (even in the fantasy genre).   This book seemed like a case of the author writing the first draft and thinking she'd made something good enough to post, before being disappointed when she actually saw what she'd done. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard a lot about this book before reading it.   As many of you know, I am a fan of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  I always enjoy the books as well.  So I was excited when I saw this title and ordered a copy.  However, this is NOTHING like the book I had in mind.  This is much more like an edited version of an existing book.  The text in this book is almost word-for-word copy/pasted from the book The Hitch Hiker's Companion: Adventures with a Plan (2004)   The writing style is very dry.  And the prose is not very funny.  If this was an authentic version of the original book, then I would have liked the jokes, but unfortunately the humor is lost in the editing.   The author's opinion about the book is not worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It wasn't a good book but it didn't matter because the ending sucked! I read this book on Amazon with my daughter and it was too long! I just wanted to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this a one star because I wanted to like it more than I did, but I just didn't like it that much. I know it's supposed to be a comedy but it was just a little too dark. I could have bought a million different laughs. I'm pretty much done with funny books for the time being.    " The title should be changed to " The Devil of Dune," not "The Book of Dunes."  This book was more than the sum of its parts. It had more plot than a movie. The worldbuilding was amazing. The humor, not so much. The main character was great, and the villain and the setting were great, but the book as a whole wasn't that great. There were interesting ideas and it had a lot of depth and character. The plot was great!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a fan of science fiction and fantasy, this book made me want to read some. I did not enjoy it, but that is probably because I am a sucker for any good science fiction or fantasy. I gave it three stars, which is the highest I could give it. I like to find interesting books in the genre and this was not the one for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this was one of the most depressing books I've ever read, a book full of a sense of self-loathing and hopelessness, filled with hopelessness over not being loved, but that was the whole point. I'd give it 2 stars if I could. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book which I have had a problem reading from the first page. A good story has enough things to make it interesting. This book, not so much. The first thing you will get is that it is about a group of people at a university and their struggles with depression, and it's a good one!   But then you get to the chapter where they're at a party, drinking, and this one girl starts talking about how she killed her best friend because she didn't feel like having sex in months. And I didn't know that that was a thing that happened to people with depression or schizophrenia.   I guess it is funny, but it's not really a very interesting story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book expecting to like it and actually I didn't like it at all. The book is written from the viewpoint of a child with autism who has a difficult time learning. In this book the autistic child is the author and the narrator and it felt like a one shot. The only other thing I found interesting was that the author describes many of the things that are happening in the world around them and how they can be used to gain intelligence.   My only hope was that this book will help the autistic children learn how to communicate through nonverbal methods so that they are not so afraid of communication. I really don't want to be an autistic child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a collection of personal stories with a lot of information about my life, a life I only really read about online. The information provided in the book is interesting and enlightening, but I really do not like the way that the book handles the topic of race.   There are a couple of references to race in the previous books that I have read, but the information in this book is much more about my upbringing as an immigrant.  I feel like the book doesn't give enough attention to my black community, but not to the exclusion of my Asian and Latin American neighbors.  The writing style is very dry and I was not impressed with the stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Overall I didn't like this book. The book is about the "feral" that came up from the sewers and is now destroying and eating human beings.   There is some interesting ideas, however, these ideas are not presented in the way that would make them seem interesting, they just appear out of nowhere and you don't know how to react to them. The characters are also very flat.  It's a very interesting concept, and the execution of the ideas are good. I am not sure if this would work as a standalone book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was not well-written and not very good.   It just makes no sense.  The writer seemed to be just taking a bunch of different parts and putting them together.  I had a hard time following what was going on.  There were too many characters and I'm still not sure why he chose to use so many characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the third book that I've bought from the authors of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Everything, and I will admit that I have enjoyed them a great deal (the other two are a little more on the serious side).   The stories in these books are extremely short (usually a couple of chapters) and each story, though short, is very entertaining.   These are the kind of short stories that I enjoy reading even if I'm not a fan of the subject matter.  There's a lot to say about this book, but the main point is that I don't really know what to think of it.  I liked the first couple of stories, but they really didn't hold my attention.  The third story really is excellent, and it's very funny.  My favorite characters from this book are the guys who own a shop.  They're very colorful and have their own quirks, but I feel like they were all written for a different reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was good.   The information is in order and the writing was nice.  The book was too complicated and confusing to me, but I'll just read the notes anyway.  This review was taken after I read the book and a couple other books about brain cancer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a really well written story, but I would have been much better off learning about this character and his world through a book.   He seemed kind of random and not very well developed, and the main character never really took over the story like she should have. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is good, but the story takes about 3.5 hours. I don't know if the story is going to make it to the sequel, and I hope not!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A horrible read. A poor author who had no talent or inspiration for writing. The world building (the setting) is horrible. The characters are stupid and poorly written. There was nothing to like or enjoy in the book. The ending was terrible. I don't know who this book would appeal to but it is no longer on my 'to read' list.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for the reviews, and they don't make this book worth buying, if you can't find the negative review for this book. The characters are annoying. In one case, when they get drunk, a female character says, "It's fine to be drunk."  I'm not saying that, I just find it annoying.  I think it's one of the characters (the one who's the least likable in the book, but it makes no sense why), but the only things that she says that I liked was, "If you're gonna be a drunk, drink like one."  When I read the book the first time, I thought this is the only time she uses that quote.  It's not.  She says it twice, and I get the joke.   This book doesn't make a lot of sense.  If you're a fan of self-help, this book is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My dad's favorite book is the first Harry Potter book but it's been decades since I've read it. I was very intrigued by this book but was completely turned off by the end.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that I can see myself doing something with, if only to get a sense of its tone. The writing is very good and I don't even think the book is long, but I'm afraid to read it because of the tone. If you're in any way interested in art, poetry, or literature, I would highly recommend this book. I'll be giving it away as a bonus for this review.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As expected, a boring and uninteresting book.   The writing is dull and the story is non-existent.  This book is only for the readers who likes the story of vampires and was not satisfied with the novel and the characters (for me, this book is not a good idea). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in 3 sittings on my commute to work. The stories are compelling and the characters are realistic.   But I am really struggling to like the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most frustrating part about this book was its overuse of the word "stupid" and its use of "stupider". Most of the characters are stupid, but not all of them are.   Most of them get what they want from the world and they are successful in their life. But some people are more successful than others. I think there should be more realistic representations of people who get what's best for them, and the author should be careful of how she portrays the success they are pursuing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an absolute train wreck. I had high hopes for this book. I thought the author was an excellent storyteller. The book was well written and I had a lot of fun reading it. This book left me a complete mess. The author has been writing "autobiographies" for years. This is a perfect example of how he fails to tell a story well. I don't recommend this book unless you are already a fan of his or if you want to learn more about the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In general, a really nice book, but I would have preferred a less-biased point of view. I really thought the book was based on true events, but then again, so did the other side.   The author really seemed to have a point of contention with a lot of the history of World War 2 and whatnot, but it really felt as if the author had a preconceived opinion about all of it.  I felt the author made some claims about a German officer and some German officers, but those claims were hard to verify or disprove. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a fun, lighthearted and informative book about making the switch to a healthier, more conscious lifestyle.   As a nutritionist and food writer this is useful information for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was poorly written and lacked the substance that would have made the story interesting. The characters were not well developed and their dialogue was either too corny or too slow-paced to really carry the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's a good idea in this book and a couple of good stories. It is, however, a long slog of a book that has me wanting to keep flipping through to make sure the title isn't actually something I can't get. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited for this to come out but when I opened it I was surprised. I've bought from the author before but I have been disappointed in the books. These books were bad.   These books are so over rated they can't even be rated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a teenager in the early nineties, I was hooked on books about animals. Then the books changed from the natural world to the natural history.   That's okay, I suppose. But now that I'm in my thirties, I'm looking for books that will make me smile.  If you have a passion for animals, for science, for history or for anything, keep on reading because this is one of the best books you'll ever read.  -Krystyna Hristova
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most annoying thing I found in this book was a plot development that I had no interest in whatsoever. I have nothing against the concept of an old woman in the 19th century becoming a witch. It is a good one, but the story development just made me want to throw my Kindle away. It's a sad story and the last book was better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, the book is poorly written and not worth the time. It is just a poorly written book with boring characters who do not move the story along.   It would be better if the author wrote a book about the different types of drugs people take but with different plotlines.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In short, a book full of poorly written, uninspired, and clichéd writing that reads like it was written by someone trying to impress an editor with the length of the book.  This book is filled with things that need to be cut out, so you get only a short version of a story, that is, the good part of the story, but the bad parts of the movie are there, and then added by a cheap writer.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of poetry and wrote a lot about poetry. I was disappointed with this book. The poems in this book are great but so are the rest of the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was an utter mess, and I had to re-read it over and over again because I kept getting stuck. I would have much preferred to have gotten a good, straight story with a good ending, but unfortunately that is not what I got. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written well but the grammar/spelling is terrible. It is also very pretentious and pretentious writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a great book and I learned a lot, but I found the writing pretty amateurish.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A big book, but not enough in my opinion. The main idea of the story was great, but as soon as I tried to follow along the story took a turn for the worst.   It was slow, tedious and boring.  I thought that the author was writing a novel, but it seemed like he was writing more like a nonfiction book and didn't use his imagination properly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best thing about this book is the title.   As a former teacher I really enjoyed the way the author uses words to highlight the key messages of the book.  I had a great time looking through this book and was very impressed with its content.  The author uses very clear language to explain a lot of things, like a child is not ready for math until they learn how to play a musical instrument.  However, the author has a problem when it comes to the language she uses.  She says a lot is wrong with her book but doesn't give specific examples of the errors she found.  My son says he can't understand a word and can't seem to finish it, but I know exactly what she is talking about.  All in all I will continue to use this book to help me teach my son.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had a few books on the shelf that have been on my 'to read list' for years, but I never bought the hardcover. Finally, I was able to purchase a paperback copy of this. The book's summary said that the book was an account of the first ever "scientific experiment" of man-made teleportation. I was not impressed. This is a story about "magic", which does not have anything to do with real science. Not even close. I expected much more. A book that was supposed to be about teleportation? You have to be kidding. What a waste of money.  I have had several bad books by this author and so far I have found this one to be the worst. The author has been writing stories for quite some time and is quite familiar with the type of fiction that appeals to his readers and has also written some that I really liked, however the majority of his writing has not been of a high quality. This has been a pretty bad decision on his part, as I have come to dislike some of his books that have not appealed to me. The only positive I can find in this book is the fact that it was a "scientific" book. I have read many books that are not of a scientific nature that can be labeled as science fiction, however, many science fiction books are actually of a very high standard, but this one falls down to a very low standard. It is a very poor book and I cannot recommend it. I had to re-read the book in order to get the details on teleportation. A little more research could have improved my book, however I have never read anything written by the author that does not sound like it was written in a drunken stupor. Loved this one. This book is great!  This is my new favorite book. ,
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For my first time reading this book, I was very pleased. However, the author is so bad at creating a believable character, that I was so confused about why I was supposed to care about him.   I'm going to give this book 3 stars as there is plenty of bad that can be found in any book, but there is no plot to this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book I bought about a little boy who is going to be a wizard is a terrible read. He is just a young boy who wants to be an adventurer and his best friend is a frog so he thinks that being an adventurer is going out into the world to explore and solve problems. But the book starts with the first paragraph about how much of a bad little boy he is and how he is a wizard. The book then goes on to make him a good one by showing him what it's like being in the wizarding world. I did not like this book at all because it made me hate the book's protagonist.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the story, but after the first hour or so, the pacing went completely off the rails. If you want a good fantasy story that actually does make sense, buy a different book and leave me alone!
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a little disorganized.  I would have rather had the information and explanations given in the text instead of the book itself.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My only criticism is that it is really long and boring. I bought this for my brother for his birthday but he only read two pages.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an ok book for a first year of university, but the only thing that's amazing about it is how easy it is to read.   If the author had given more detail on the concepts that he used, I would have been more impressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was a bit too slow for me, although the action scenes were good and the characters interesting.   It is, of course, very hard to read an English book in translation, but I did enjoy the story a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very poorly written book that didn't tell me a single thing about the author. The book is in the middle of a great story line and yet it felt empty.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm disappointed with this book.   The story is compelling and well thought out and I enjoyed it immensely but it feels like it's trying too hard.  The main character seems to be the weakest link in the writing team.  Her emotions are very thin and it comes off as a bit artificial.  When she acts differently or even gives a different response than she did before it just reads as forced.  It also makes the reader question whether she's actually changed, and I feel that her character development needs a lot more work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was boring, there wasn't anything of interest to keep you going for the majority of the book, and the ending was a little anticlimactic. I wanted to finish the book and found the end quite unsatisfying.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is boring and unoriginal.   It is written by a professor who doesn't know the first thing about real estate.  The only useful info in this book is the realtors section.  A good realtor book would have the realtor's information in it, but this is just a list of realtORS.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a huge fan of this book. There is a LOT to like about it, but not everything is very good. The story is interesting and fun, the characters are likable, but the pacing is very choppy.   For me the most disappointing thing about this book was the ending.  It leaves so many open ending questions!  For example, we see a lot of different things happen to the characters and then we're never really told what happens to them next. Is it because the characters go home, or are they hiding something from their loved ones? It just doesn't seem to make sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not like this book. I don't know if it is that it is too close to what I've read before and I just want a good book, or if I just don't like any of these authors who write this type of stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've bought this book multiple times before, and have never been disappointed. The story is good, and the plot is interesting. However, the pacing is not very good. It took forever to get to the meat of the story (the story of the vampire) and it would have been more enjoyable if it had been shorter. The book is long enough to read without going into spoilers, but I would probably re-read this one, as there were several instances where I found myself thinking "Oh, so that's how it was meant to be", which kept me from enjoying the book too much.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very dull book in which I found very little interesting.   It's about a man who becomes depressed after his wife left him and he decided to kill himself by jumping in front of a train.  His girlfriend was a very good woman but she was too much for him, and she was a little too much too and he killed himself, and he was very depressed and I'm very disappointed that a decent person would do such a thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A friend and I were in the library, reading the book " The Last and the First ", which has a very interesting premise, but has a terrible plot. We were talking about the plot, when he suddenly said: " But the title is wrong ". Well, we started on a journey of finding a good plot (there's no point of doing such a search unless you already have one) and the plot did not happen. We found out a lot of things about the character, but we could never be convinced that he was in the right place, or what he did, or that we really got into his head, or why the characters kept switching places.   I know it was only a few pages, but if I was forced to read that one I think I would have finished it in two minutes, or at least not have gone on to other interesting books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading this.   It was boring.  We all know how bad of a job the CIA did in the "cold war."   The only thing I found interesting was the fact that all the "villains" were Russian or Jewish.  There was little to do with the Soviet Union and its history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book I got was a complete disaster. This is a book I had been wanting to read but had been put off because of the awful reviews. I can honestly say that this book did not live up to its hype. The characters were horrible and the plot was completely contrived. I had to fight tooth and nail to get through it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was very short (5hrs for me), but the only real problem was that it contained very little real world information.  This book is written in the pseudo-scientific style of an undergraduate student who does not know anything about science.  The title of the book is not a coincidence. It is a fake news paper. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only real benefit of this book is the cover. The title alone has me intrigued.  I didn't want to read it until I saw the cover on Amazon.  The actual contents are awful.   I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I wouldn't read it if I had to.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If the author had gone deeper into the characters, explored their feelings in more detail, and created a more realistic portrayal of the difficulties of an autistic man living in the real world, this might have been worth a look.   A couple of other points are worth mentioning:  1) The story is based on a true story, but the author was sloppy in the facts.  The autistic man was found in his bed, not curled up asleep, and the autopsy reports show he died of a heart attack.  This wasn't really the first time that a person with autism had died as a result of a cardiac arrhythmia, but apparently this one was "too much for him."  2) As far as the characterization of the characters goes, there wasn't much going for any of them.  I was disappointed that neither was able to develop an inner life as the book progressed, and there was no depth to the characters.  All the characters were either too self-centered or too perfect.  It might have worked better if they had a few more flaws, but otherwise I'd give it 3.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading The Dark Knight, I was hoping the sequel would be better. But, alas, it was not. The story is good, but there's no reason for the writer to tell the story the way he did. I don't think it's really in character for Batman to have to keep an enemy's dead body from ever rising again. Also, not only did the action not add anything to the story, it kind of ruined it. I have not finished the sequel, but this story was not a great read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am trying to read this book and I keep getting lost. I'm trying to understand why this book is so hard to read. It starts well, but then it becomes a pain to read as it makes me feel like I have to take notes for the next few hours or go back to previous chapters to figure out the meaning of what I just read.    The story and characters were good. However, it's very difficult to figure which of the characters you are supposed to like or hate, and this is the main problem with this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to read this twice to find out what the ******* was up with it. I like the author, but I do not care for the way he writes. He seems to know what he is doing, but his writing is very boring and has the tendency to be repetitive. I think it is more a problem with the book rather than the author.   If this author had the ability to write more interesting stories, he would have a huge fan base with his latest work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was poor and unenjoyable. It was more like reading someone else's work, but this is not my cup of tea.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't have high hopes for this book. It's an awful book.  The author describes the problems he faced (drug abuse, etc.) as being due to his mother being abused. He did this to deflect blame from himself and put it on her.  He didn't want to accept his mother's faults as valid.   What is it about abusers?  I think the main reason he turned to alcohol was because he didn't like the fact that he was getting used.  And, in a way, it is.  In a way he was blaming himself for the abuse of his mother and not her. As a teen he tried his hardest to please her, he wanted her approval, he loved her, but he knew that she was not really good for him. The abuse was also hard on him, he felt as though he was a failure because he couldn't keep up with the demands of his abusive mother.  I thought he would get better after he had the children, but that did not happen.  This book is basically just a series of memories of the abuse and how he coped with it.  It's very self indulgent and feels as though the author is just trying to justify his alcoholism and not admit that it is wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a collection of stories, some of which are quite bad. There is no doubt the author is a very good writer but I feel that a lot of the stories fall flat. Some stories are downright unbelievable.   A lot of stories are repetitive.  There are a couple of great stories in this book but for the most part, it is not that good of a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book did not do justice to my childhood. I had to put the book down after the first 100 pages, which is not too surprising, because this book was not really geared toward children, in my opinion.   For some reason, this book had an overblown (and overused) "weird" feel to it, which I found very off-putting, but I guess it's the book I was looking for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of spelling and grammatical errors, and is difficult to understand, as is the case with most textbooks on the subject. There are many pages that you will have to refer to in a textbook, but this book does not do this.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because a friend had recommended it to me. This is not a bad story, just a very dull one, and it really should have been written as a non-fiction.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is useless.   What can a young person do with all of that information?   A person must learn to live within themselves to gain anything from the information.  I'm not a college student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this one back in the mid 2000's and the plot is absolutely awful.   The world building is bad.  There's a point when the protagonist goes and asks the world to change its ways to make him happy.  But instead, the world goes about destroying everything and making him miserable.  The writing style, for the most part, is poor.  It is repetitive and dull.  They have to go back and make sure everything is connected by making this character ask the same question every other character has asked before, only to not be answered.  I'm sorry, this is bad writing and if it can still be published, then so be it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and then felt like crap for reading it.   This is a book that should be published after its written, and not the other way around.  In this book there is no "how-to" information.  Instead the author talks about the   process of   working with a good therapist.  And then when you finally get to the 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As someone who loved the first two books in the trilogy, I was disappointed when I got to the last book. The ending felt so unnecessary and forced and it left me feeling like I had wasted $40 and several hours of my life.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read two and had the same reaction...I got really excited at the start, but the plot kept getting more complicated and not as good as the first book. Also, the characters weren't as interesting as in the first.   The only redeeming quality is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In spite of its problems, this book was still a great experience. I will definitely buy it again. But i will also be reading a lot of other books by different authors.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not really sure what to say about this book - it was a very disappointing book, and when the ending was not what I had expected I had a feeling that maybe I had made a bad decision. The story was good at first - the girl that reads the books does get to know the main character, even if they do end up not liking each other. But the story gets a bit complicated around the half way point, and the main protagonist gets more of a focus and she feels very unlikable at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed in this book as a whole. The plot and characters were bad, the writing wasn't interesting, and the way the character's were defined was weak. The only thing good about the book was that it ended. The writing and the characters just sucked.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed this book. I thought the writing was very good and the plot was interesting. The writing style is not too complicated and makes the story very easy to follow. My favorite character is the one that starts out on the wrong foot but changes her ways. Other characters I liked were the ones that were good or bad. My problem with this book is that I was really expecting an exciting and fast paced story. I expected some good action and I even thought the story was going to be about what happens next. It wasn't, and I was disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only problem I had with the book was the author's ignorance of other languages.  He speaks a lot of French and German in the book, and his English is awful.  His translation of a passage from one of the other books is not bad, but that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst of the book was the last pages of the third chapter.   I was really hoping for some decent writing on the good part of the story and instead we get a few lame one liners and a couple of terrible one liner's.  I think that the third to last chapter would have been better if the writer had gone into more depth on the characters and why the character is the way he/she is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was the worst book I have ever read. It is a book full of mistakes, it is over-written and doesn't follow its own plot.   The writing style of the book is so amateurish and unprofessional,  I would never read this book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a poor read and was more of a book to read when it was free or free to try.   The book had an awful first chapter.  The second chapter was actually better but the story is still terrible.  If you have a hard time falling asleep and reading you need to find a good book that you can fall asleep and read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is boring! I was looking forward to it but was let down. It would have been much more interesting and entertaining if it had not been written by a woman who knows nothing about real military history and who doesn't seem to know anything about the First World War. I wish she had spent more time talking about the generals. She makes a big deal about the first world war as though it was the greatest war ever, but she doesn't ever mention the generals who got it wrong. I found it tedious, boring and boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character was an idiot.   It wasn't even funny, just stupid.  - This book wasn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am in the process of reading several books that I thought would be excellent. Unfortunately, one is an in-depth history of the war and another a political book on the Bush Administration that is not an accurate portrayal. The war in Iraq and the Bush administration was the most destructive event since World War II.   This is a political and not a history book.  This does not belong in a university.  My advice to anyone interested in military history:  This book does not serve history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst thing about this book is the fact that it is completely unrelated to the game.   This book is a collection of fan-made tutorials, each one written for a different version of the game (like the Xbox 360 version, the Nintendo Wii version, etc.). They cover the same gameplay aspects, but for different platforms (except one, the Wii version has different tutorials because of the control scheme).   I bought this book from Amazon because I had seen it mentioned on one of the forums and wanted to pick it up.  I was hoping that it would help me learn the game and it's nuances, but to be honest, it didn't help me at all.  The main problems I had with this book were: 1. I felt like they made everything about the game too obvious. Every detail of the controls, maps, and story is already in the game but it felt like this book covered too much. I had to look it up just to make sure I didn't miss anything. 2. I found the tutorials to be confusing. They seem to change all the time (such as "jump" becomes "walk, jump, and double-jump"), which makes it hard to understand what they're talking about. 3. I think that the game looks much better on a console.  It looked very nice, but it doesn't have a huge impact on the gameplay.  For the money, I wouldn't regret buying this book, but I wouldn´t buy it either.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been meaning to pick this book up ever since reading it as a teenager, but I never got around to it. I'm so glad I finally did.   In a nutshell, the premise of this book is that when you are a kid and you have the best parents in the world, you're going to end up doing some really awful things because you don't know any better.  One of the problems with this is that it takes place in a very bad neighborhood and is full of some really  juvenile (but not always) language.  The other problem is that there is a really obvious plot hole at the end.  It turns out the evil guy is actually the victim of the kidnapping and only escaped because he is too young to be a witness to the crime.  So basically, he was too dumb to see through the plan.  This is so ridiculously stupid, it's amazing that it's not part of the main plot.  If you're a kid, you'll probably hate it, but if you have any respect for adult literature, you should not read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If there's any place where you shouldn't read this book, it's a book like this. I was extremely disappointed in the story. While it's not bad per se, it was not good. The narrator did not sound like the author. I had trouble with the author's voice and she felt very intrusive throughout the book. Also, it made me question if she actually had read the book or if she just re-told it. I am disappointed. There are far more exciting reads for the dollar and I'd like to give this one one more try.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was good, but very confusing. I've already read the first six and I still don't really get it. I just don't understand the concept.
