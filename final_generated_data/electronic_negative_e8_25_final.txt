Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've only had this device a few weeks now, and i'm very disappointed. The buttons are extremely slow to respond, and the battery life is not that great. I can only make it a little over 2 hours, so i'll stick to my old mechanical keyboard for now.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A year ago, I purchased this to have a backup device for my portable DVD player. But I am not satisfied with the quality of this device. After a few days, the player had started to play a DVD with a loud crackling sound. It seemed that the device was getting a little too warm in the batteries. I have also noticed that when the player is not in use, the batteries are very difficult to reinsert. I decided to return the device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just bought my new iPad (5th generation) yesterday and bought this amp to give my old   iPod 4th generation a run for its money.   The first thing I tried was to turn the device off but it wouldn't turn off. I took the amp to the Apple Store and got it serviced. They replaced the fuse for the 12 volt output with the smaller fuse from the   3.1 volt supply and put the 12V output at 12v. Then I took it back and replaced the 12v fuse with the small one in the 3.2 volt supply.  After a few minutes of playing with the amp and the sound it produces, I returned it to the store to have the Apple tech look at it.  When the tech came out, the sound was much better.  I am VERY pleased with my purchase.  -John
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this computer for about a month now and the speed of this thing is unbelievable. I can't believe I am having a faster computer than the iMac, I wish I got the 6800 to go with it. The only bad thing I can say about this is the lack of fan speed settings, which I can understand it is designed to be a server, but I have been in a few gaming environments and I was having to set all the fans to high because the computer was overheating like crazy. I would also recommend getting a faster processor because it seems like it is only 1GHz and that is not enough for this machine. The graphics card has no issue working for any games that have it, but my favorite ones like Tomb Raider and Battlefield 3 are only playable with a low setting so you can see all the details of the game.  Write a positive review about the performance of a good computer:     Write to the manufacturer of this product:  Date Received: 04/11/2018   The product is excellent, it was very easy to setup and get up and running. I have run it off a powerbank but I did run into one issue, the monitor doesn't display properly. It is a nice 1080p display with lots of options. I am a big fan of Microsoft's products and this is no exception. It has been running a full load of games for a week now with no issues. I plan to buy another as my main one dies on me. I also purchased a 2 year warranty which will likely run me $130 or so as opposed to the usual $100 to $120.Read full review  Product Reviews Write a positive Review  Questions, Answers and Comments Discuss about XFX R9 280 Double Dissipation PCI-Express Graphics Card - Black (Package: White) with your friends and fellow Evike.com shoppers!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The thing took about two months to set up. The screen went black after a few days of use, the battery was about half gone by the end of the first day, and the only thing I had in the case was a cheap stylus.   All the negatives about this product can be summed up in two words:  - not reliable - cheap - doesn't hold a charge - cheap to buy for $3.95. If I were to buy one more thing from this company, it would be for a replacement stylus if this one fails.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got the EON18. When it worked, it worked well, and there was no way I would have bought a phone otherwise. But the device just keeps breaking, and this latest one is no different.    Have to use a different phone:  When the phone is not plugged in, it will go straight to sleep.  I have to use my computer to check the battery to make sure I can still make a call.  The phone is cheap. The only phone I can use is my android one.  I would never recommend this product:  I was looking forward to buying a phone. I got it and it has a really cheap screen. I am now going to put an iPhone case on it to make it work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In a vacuum of other electronics, the PDP-10's keyboard, touchpad, speakers, and track pad are all outstanding.   While there is a slight amount of feedback from the keys themselves, the "clack" of the keys is a big turn off.  This is a problem on almost every computer keyboard, and in all of them at that.  Also the keyboard's keys are too small.  It's more difficult to tap the keys with your fingers to the correct pressure without accidentally hitting the keys. The track pad is also too small, and the surface area of it doesn't get you a good enough click to work on your laptop.  My only positive thing about the P10 is that it looks a lot more sophisticated than the P60, but I wish the two devices had a little more "umph."    I wish the P50 had a volume control   I have a Toshiba laptop and recently was reading a review by an otherwise good guy on the Toshiba site. He said he used a keyboard that was a size too small and got very frustrated, and that he thought Toshiba had finally fixed it, that a new keyboard was coming that would be more of the right size for him. But it wasn't until he looked for a replacement that he discovered Toshiba no longer made the keyboard in the right sizes. This really sucks for someone like me who is in the habit of getting the same size keyboard for my computers in all other manufacturers' laptops, and can never get a replacement.  As a result of this, I have to buy all my new Toshiba's from other manufacturers, as the one in the Toshou website isn't working well for me anymore. And it is a bit hard to set up, since you have to resolder the pins if you want to use the new keyboard.    The P50 also has two separate keyboard slots:  I wish that Toshiba would put a separate keyboard slot in the laptop and not allow you to only use one side at a time.  If you have the P70 (or whatever model it is) then you can use either the left or right side at the same time. But if you have this P50, you have only one side and you can only use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The keyboard is fine, however, the keys were mushy and the buttons did not click well.   This is the only model of the model I ever used.  It took me a few tries to figure out how to change the key layout.  I would recommend you spend some time with the manual first.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Poor build quality I have been playing with the T3 since it first came out and I can't fault the build quality. It seems solid and solid construction. However, the cable that came with the mouse is so flimsy and makes the mouse feel like it would snap apart. It's hard to imagine that's what the manufacturer intends. I just wish this mouse had more resistance to the click noise. The rubberized coating is also a bit on the sticky side. This will be one of those mice you don't use anymore. If it had a little more resistance, I'd give it an extra star. But overall, it's a fine mouse and I'll buy another one in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPad 2 is the perfect size, perfect screen, and the touch screen works well. My only problem is that when you are using the iPad 2 in portrait mode the touchscreen gets dirty and you have to clean it out, and since there is no way to clean the screen with a microfiber cloth I end up cleaning it out with alcohol. I would recommend it, but it would have been nice if the tablet could have an SD card slot as well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this phone because i wanted a more traditional mobile phone and   wanted the option of a bigger screen and  much bigger battery.   This phone has some nice features.  The screen is larger and brighter than   the LG G4, and the new version of Android, Marshmallow.  I  like the fact that it is   IP67 certified, which means that you can   take it on a shower and the phone would still be good to go for a week.  But   for the money, it is far from the top of the line.  This   phone does not work with a micro-USB charger, so you will   need to buy a USB charger or USB stick to make it work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have used this item only once and it works as advertised. This is good for the price but it is not worth the effort. The sound is a bit low, but the sound quality is acceptable. I am still waiting on a new unit to be delivered.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As I am not a great electronic user, I bought this to replace a broken Sony VAIO which I had been using for about a year. When I got this, I noticed the "Power" icon wasn't really centered on the screen (and it was in a different place, so it wasn't quite as centered). After a bit of fiddling with it, it got centered and the screen is very bright. The keyboard is easy to use and works quite well. But I have to say I didn't really like the touchpad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first device i bought from this company was a Sony A3000, an awesome compact portable mp3 player with all the functions of an mp3 Player: a playlist, shuffle, stop, repeat, volume control and play/pause. However this item   soon began to break, the buttons started coming out of the casing   which caused the unit to be prone to breaking. It is no longer being produced   however my original Sony A2000 which is still working fine still in the box   has been broken.   There have been very few complaints on the web about this company   but in our family we have had problems with all of our   mp3 players   all the way from Sony to Samsung to Nokia to Mp3 players. It's unfortunate that this company has fallen on hard times. Good Luck to all of you   on trying to get a good mp3 device. We are giving them 5 stars but would give 5 stars to anyone else who has had similar issues. The only thing that saves them from 5 stars is the fact that their customer service has not been bad, which is a rarity in the music industry.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have used this for about a week now. I have a lot of old, clunky computer equipment in my home and this is a huge help to me because it has lots of program options. I would not use it on my laptop as I like to have my work and personal files on one computer. This is great to get stuff on the go to do with. The only thing I did not like about this is that the buttons on the back of the device are not very responsive. It took me a good deal of time to figure out the correct key on the keyboard. It is hard to find the right keys when it is this small. It has saved my butt many times in the past.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a Samsung S5 that I have had for a few years now. It is really pretty, really nice to look at, and has the features and performance you expect of a high end phone. However, the battery is getting to be a problem as it's not going through a charge like it used to.   My S5 has a non-removable battery, the S4 had a removable battery, so I assumed Samsung would do the same thing here. But no.  It just seems Samsung doesn't want you to have a phone that doesn't die when it needs to die.  A better battery option could be one with a removable bottom which makes it easy to swap out, but still have the same nice design and functionality.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I bought this thing I thought it was awesome. Now I feel like I have just had a broken toy. I've gone through about 6 different units now and they all have the same problem. The buttons are getting stuck and the batteries are not lasting long. The one time I replaced the batteries the battery wouldn't last, but luckily I was able to charge it in about 5 minutes and it worked just fine. Overall, I'm disappointed with this device as it's basically not useful at all.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this about a year ago and it's been in use for about a week now. It's perfect as a work or play device for my family. The built in speakers are loud and the volume is great. The only problem I have is that the button on the side does not seem to be very sensitive and sometimes it's hard to press the button to get it working properly. I just replaced a very old one and it is as good or better than this one. Pros: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've owned a Motorola Xoom for a couple of years now. It's my main computer now (at work as well). It is a great device and is well-designed, but I do wish it was a bit better than it is.   First, the "soft keyboard" doesn't fit my hands at all (I need thick wrists and some wrist support for this).   Secondly, it's a bit too big for me, and if I'm not careful I end up with my arm hanging outside of the phone, with the phone sitting way too low on my hip. I don't like holding my phone this way because it's distracting and makes it difficult to get in and out of my pocket when I am trying to text.  I used to have a Moto E, but it broke after a year. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product is very poor, the sound quality is horrible. There is almost no bass and it has no control for adjusting the volume. I have had this device since the 1980's, and never had problems with sound quality, but the volume control was very hard to use. The only thing I don't like about this unit is that it is so bulky that it almost doesn't seem to fit in a pocket. If you can get it to fit you may very well like this device!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Tom from Very reliable and reliable. I would recommend the product as long as it's free from problems like this one. I've owned several brands of portable record player, and these units have always been very reliable, clean sounding and easy to use for both recording and playing music. The one thing I like about these is that there are 3 types of buttons for adjusting volume, which is nice since I'm a music lover who is constantly changing my records. I just wanted to say the sound is very clear and warm, and for the price you cannot beat it. I'd give it a solid 4.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was the worst phone I have ever owned. I tried so hard to figure out how to turn it on that I broke the phone. The screen was so bad that even I couldn't see what was on the screen. The speaker that comes with the phone has a crappy tone, the buttons are stiff, and the battery is completely dead. The case is horrible too. There was no way for me to get this case to actually fit on the phone to protect the phone from all the dirt and dust. The camera and the buttons on this phone don't work. I would not recommend this phone.    Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, November 22, 2017  The worst phone ever  by Anonymous on July 13, 2016  Review: The worst phone ive ever owned!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "the sound was terrible - very tinny"   "The device had only one button: press the power button. I was supposed to have a 2nd option of pause and stop the recording - a lot more features would have been appreciated"   I tried on a lot of different laptops but never got past the first time when I used my old Asus one.     When I finally got it (I had to purchase it on eBay) and used it for a few days, I loved it.   I also love the fact that it is wireless, which I have never had with a laptop before.  I do agree with the comments above. I had to try the first half hour or so because my wife was telling me that my laptop was getting too hot.  After a while it got too hot for me to go back to it, so I just left it on. I thought about using it for hours and then unplugging it to restart it. I think it would be very good for kids or anyone who is a "photo-journalist" but still needs to take their phone along. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing is absolutely useless!   It is almost completely dead on most devices, and the interface is a mess!

The game is fun and addicting. The graphics are nice and crisp. I played the demo a few days ago and it's one of my favorites. I have no problem with the price. If this was a few dollars cheaper I would buy it. I'm just saying it's great for the price! If you can find it cheap it is worth buying.  (Verified Buyer)  Reviewer: Mike R. from Ohio. :  This was a great deal for the amount of games. It's not as detailed as the previous version and the sound is not as good. This version is good to play for two or three hours but the next version will be better. . I was going to buy this for a son for Christmas. But I got a better deal on another game.

However, I noticed the last couple of months the volume knob is going into the down position rather than up. I also noticed that the battery indicator light is flashing, it was not flashing normally. I contacted the vendor of the product and they are working on a fix for it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing that makes this device unusable is the constant chattering noise.   I get the noise every time I plug in the charger, it doesn't matter if it is plugged in for 20 minutes or 10.  When I connect it for 15 minutes it gets the chattering but when I disconnect it for another 20 minutes the chatter is still there.  I'm pretty sure if the device had been silent it would have lasted longer.  This is just stupidly expensive and will be replaced by another cheapo device after the warranty runs out.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this thing thinking that it would work as a digital recorder, and I have used it for that purpose. When I turned it on it sounded like a cheap, crappy Walkman that just has a "blip" at the beginning and end of a recording, and that is about it. I'm using it to record a podcast and have never been able to listen to it. That is unless I am sitting in the bathtub with it in my lap, which is about the only other time that I would be using this thing. Other than that, I have no use for it. And this is coming from a guy who is a die hard fan of audio gear.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the box:   The box is very nicely built, a bit smaller than what is available on the internet for this price range. It has plenty of space for the 2,5x2.5 and 2,75x3.5 LCDs that you will need.   The buttons are all made of plastic, but they are well laid out and responsive. The power button is a bit difficult to press (it seems to have the wrong distance) but is still functional.  The USB port and audio jack are on the left side, close to the main power/connector port on the back.  There is a good amount of room for expansion, but I can't recommend putting more memory or hard drive into the back of this board because the expansion connector is located in the wrong place, in the top right corner.  The build quality is decent and it feels very sturdy. I was able to open it up easily, but the top has the wrong size to fit my PC case.  If this case had a little extra room to spare, I would probably have no problem opening it up.  With regards to the performance:  In terms of performance, this board is much, much better than I expected.  It has a quad core CPU (that is actually not bad at all), 2GB of RAM (that's even better) and 4GB of flash storage.  I was expecting some horrible performance because of the fact that it runs Android but the fact is, it's much more than what I thought.  You could run Linux on this board and have a very good experience, but it is going to take more than just Google's official toolset to have any serious success with this. The only real con with this board would be if it doesn't have a full-sized USB port (like the EEVO), but I think this is an area where you will be able to get some good bang for your buck with the cheaper models, at least with a decent case (like what the RK3288/32U has). I hope this review helps someone who is looking for a cheap Android-friendly quad-core board, and can't justify spending more on something that isn't quite as powerful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased two of these for my son as a gift. These are the first computers he has been able to use. He has a basic calculator and a basic word processor, but we wanted something more powerful so that we could both do a little work in our free time. The unit works fine when we plug it into the printer port, but there is no way to power it from the printer, so we had to keep turning down the power on the computer. The computer also doesn't turn on when plugged into the computer port in my other computer, so I need to plug that into the wall outlet in order to turn it on.   Finally, the unit has a terrible cord that is very flimsy. It doesn't seem to be able to take any strain when trying to plug it in. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received this as a gift from a friend who was an electrician for years and I loved it. The quality was good and the features were good. When I had the device I noticed that the charging cord was made of soft wire with a very small connector. The connector is so tiny that it is impossible to keep it inside the charging case. The device is great for charging from your laptop and the cord is convenient and convenient but in the end I gave it a one-star rating because the battery inside the device was so small that even after having it charging in my car for an hour it would only last for an extra 10 minutes or so. It wouldn't be any real use as a "full" battery but more of a stop gap until the battery in the charger comes out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I received the unit was at a time when I wasn't planning to get the XB950. I bought it as a second monitor to work on while using a desktop computer with Windows 10 and it was fantastic, even though I had to turn off the "Full Screen" option. I use a computer with Nvidia graphics, so it is great to use this monitor to show my pictures or videos. I'm now considering getting the 2nd monitor, but only if the price comes down. (I want to save up for a laptop).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item has an excellent feature but not much else. I am very happy with the product but that feature is not as amazing as the one I paid $20 extra for. The problem is the fact the wireless range seems to be much too short. You may be able to get close to the phone by laying it on a wall for example, but the range you get is so very small that I can't use it while I'm working (except I still need to use my phone at home to check email and internet and listen to music).   It is so bad you need to buy a $50 bluetooth charger because the charger will only work when the item is plugged into a power source.   You have to be very patient with this one because it has an amazing feature and yet it is not that great for using it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got my Kindle Fire, I was happy to find that they had just upgraded the screen from a very tiny 4" to an even smaller screen. The new display makes reading a little easier and I feel more confident when reading in bright sunlight. But now that I'm more used to it, I'm not sure how much better it is than the 4". The only reason that I don't rate it a 1 or a 2 is that the battery doesn't hold a charge very long. You have to use the screen a lot if you're reading at your desk and I don;t know what I would do if the battery died right as a book was about to go out of sight. I would definitely recommend this device to a friend. The good part is that it's extremely light and easy to hold in one hand.

It has worked great for the first few months but the batteries last so long that they must be replaced as soon as the e-cigarette has used the batteries too long.  It is a great idea to have the batteries in the package but the lack of information about what is included and how it works is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     " It doesn't work, and it's $150 "   " I'm extremely disappointed.   The first time I was told my order had been shipped I called back a few days later, I wasn't able to receive the phone I ordered for the price they originally quoted me.  They were unable to find out why my order didn't ship, I called to check on my order and the employee said they couldn't find anything wrong with my order,   and since I called I can see that he's a new employee so maybe the orders don't go out every day and maybe they forget about people who call.  I don't know, but when you do make the effort to call back, I'd like to think that you're still trying to figure out what the problem is.  To add insult to injury, the guy I spoke with told me that there was a software issue with my computer that was causing the problem,  but he could't find any information about it on the website, but that it would be fixed shortly,  I'm not so sure   I would still purchase a $150 phone from Motorola   if I didn't have the warranty. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new Apple laptop after having a Macbook Pro for about 6 years. The screen was too small and had terrible contrast, so I looked for something better. I was able to find a small, cheap LCD monitor that was only bright but had decent viewing angle and was not too large. I bought it and it works ok. The only problem is it's quite bulky. It is also very big and heavy.   I purchased this monitor mainly to replace a 15 year old Macbook that is no longer supported by Apple     I bought this monitor to replace my 15 year olds Macbook. The original Macbook screen was terrible. It wasn't bright enough and had poor contrast. I looked around and bought one of these. It was pretty cheap so I got one off eBay as a Christmas present, but the screen was not that bright. After replacing the screen I also got rid of my previous monitor and purchased a new display. The display is good, but I found that the connection from the computer to the monitor is terrible. I think this is due to the cheap TN panels found in most of these monitors. I ended up having to replace the entire system. After reading other reviews I was concerned about buying this one. It's a good monitor but is not as bright as my Macbook and not as wide.  This is my new monitor and I am impressed

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main flaw with this watch is that its only function is the time - which only goes up to 8:00AM (i.e. you get the entire day's schedule) and it has no way of checking the time after the fact. That's really what I hate about it: it gives you the whole day's agenda but no way to see if it's still there at 9:30, the next morning, or even later. That said, it's not bad for basic alarms, and it's great for displaying the weather (i guess they were afraid that people wouldn't know how to read a watch?) and sending a message to someone. If you're an electronic device enthusiast, I'd suggest getting a better device for more useful stuff like that.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The "keyboard" is useless. It's just a computer keyboard. And I got this so I can read on my computer. I wanted to be able to make phone calls and use the computer. This will make reading and writing on my computers less frustrating and more fun.   I bought this to use with my older computer, it does a great job. You will have to use your own keyboard to get around the annoying key-taps every few minutes. It does allow you to use any computer or phone using this and my older desktop computer (laptop).   This keyboard is the key-sucks. It doesn't allow you use any other computer or any phone. This is a bad value for the price of this keyboard.    
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You have to go out of your way to buy a good one. The last thing you want to do is give up after a week or so. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. It has a simple interface, but it is very intuitive and the features are not overwhelming. It would have been nice if it came with a more detailed user manual.  My top pick for the money - I really like it! I have been using this for over a month now and I am quite satisfied with it! For the price, you can't go wrong. The only thing I would change is to have a small cable included in the box rather than buying the one with the battery. I have to remember to charge my phone and my tablet while using it which is annoying. Overall I really enjoy using this, but I don't like the battery case that comes with it - a bit pricey for an accessory and doesn't allow enough access to your device. I hope the price drops for this or another accessory!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the ipad 3g with the 32gb usb drive on January 12th and I have been using the ipads as my daily driver since then.   At first, I tried to go back to the original ipad 4g but the usb drives were no longer available in the store   and they were not selling the ipod with the 4g either.  After a week or two, I figured I might as well just get a new ipad.  However, I now have a new computer that requires a 32gb ipod, and the ipods were not going to be available at the price I paid   So after waiting 3 weeks, I decided to try the ipoda3g   Because I am used to having a physical ipad and the 4gb ipods do not feel right.  I am in the same boat as everyone else with their old ipads.  The ipod case is not the best and the connection to the ipa is not very good.  There are a lot of apps and programs you must download in order to be able to get a good experience.  Also, you can't turn the ipd down as you can with a physical   but the ipda does give you the same experience  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device for a music video that I was making. Unfortunately, the sound quality on this thing is not the best.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A terrible device. I've bought a few other products from ebay and always received a quality product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have never been a big fan of this type of device. I have seen this one in use at the local electronics store but have always been put off by the lack of power the device provides.    Rated 1 out of 5 by AUG1 from Very Disappointed I was extremely excited to purchase a new PC that was going to run off a power cable instead of the AC. This was one of the first devices that I've bought that I'm not sure will be around in a few years. The device worked for a few hours, then shut off and said "No Power", then I have to turn it back on again just to get it to turn back on. This thing will die after only a few days of normal use.  The other review states the problem is caused by a bad power adapter. This is not a problem with this particular power adapter, I have a power adapter with 4 USB ports that I have used on a number of devices, and this adapter does not appear to be having the problem. I am not sure if it's a bad USB cable or the power adapter that is defective, but I have not had this problem with my other power adapters that have USB ports.

Unfortunately,  I couldnt find this mp3 music player in   Amazon and other major stores.  The audio output is bad and   the computer can't play most.m3,.mp3, and.m4 files.  I was thinking of using a   external mp3 drive but I just can't seem to find the right one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The charger did not come with a power adapter. It has a power cord with a 5-amp plug. The charger had a 4-amp USB input.   Unfortunately, I did not find an adapter in the packaging, so I ended up plugging in a USB charger and a 5.1-amp adapter for my PC.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Nivelte from The Product is Excellent I'm a new convert to electric vehicles. My brother-in-law was driving and had the same problem that I am having. I decided to try this. I was worried that it was going to charge too quickly. I plugged the car in to see how much power it would take. I couldn't believe how much I could charge at a glance. I am using the car a lot for my business. It is extremely fast charging, even for me. I have used other fast chargers and none have been that much faster than this. It really is a life saver. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this a few years ago but the battery died on me about 2 months ago. I replaced the batteries and the unit still is dead. It has been several weeks and no response from Apple to the emails I have sent them.    Write a positive review about an otherwise-good item:  I purchased this device in February for my 11 month-old grandson. It was a great deal and came with a charger that worked well for him.

It still works perfectly, though he's started getting impatient about how long it takes to download a photo, which usually takes about 30 seconds. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the second unit that the customer service representative has told me to send back for not working as expected. This time the unit just doesn't do it. I received the unit yesterday and set it up immediately. Then I went to run some wires, and the unit went dead. I contacted Apple on Saturday, and they said that they'll send a new unit out tomorrow. They also asked me to return the one that came with the monitor, since that unit wouldn't work either. What a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The original Xoom was a very good device and many years ago I purchased a second unit from the company because I had lost the first one. The only way I can justify the purchase of the new model is to find a good replacement for my Xoom.   I received the unit in a very timely manner. The user manuals and the instructions were on the DVD. I just tried it out and had to plug it in because of the bad reception. After the initial test I connected it and then discovered that all of the data was encrypted, so there is no way to access the data. If the user manuals are included then I'll be back for more. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great product but the batteries will be dead soon. So if you like a battery-based phone, but want a battery that will last many years, I would advise you to try the LG V20 (in my opinion)    No more battery issues after upgrading to the LG G5:     I bought my G5 on the 23rd of August 2016. I was very excited to finally use a new phone and it worked as a charm. When the phone came, it came with a large battery. I tried to use it the next day and I noticed that the phone was not charging very fast. I checked the charger and noticed the battery was still pretty much dead. I also noticed that some of the apps are using the large battery but not the standard one. It turned out that there was a flaw in the battery pack and now I was using the small battery. This is really not a big deal because this is still a pretty good phone but my issue was that it does not get quick charges. It is not a major flaw as the small batteries are not very fast to recharge (4-5 hours). I think the reason why the battery is still used is because the phone is not working the same with a smaller battery but still has the ability to use the large one. This may be fixed with future software updates. I still like the LG phone and I recommend it but I will not buy another battery until LG releases a fix for the issue.  I am very disappointed in the LGV20 as I have only had it for a couple of days. When I got it, I was quite impressed with it's performance and features but the battery has failed me. I will never use it again as the battery will die before I can update it again. I had used the phone with a 1650 mAh battery but the issue still persists. If it is not fixed soon then I will probably consider a new Samsung smartphone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit came with no case, no power cord and no USB port. I think I'll use a $20 USB to ethernet adapter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)  Rated 5 out of 5 by Gail from Works fine for me so far! I've been looking for an old fashioned telephone for years and had just given up on one. However I was very intrigued when I saw a TV commercial for this item and found that it could also be used as a television. So I did a quick search and found this site. I am very happy with this product so far. No problems using it in my studio. It is not too bright or too dim. I have yet to try using it to take pictures, however it has a built in camera! A very small price to pay for all that good old fashion.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the best electronic device I ever bought. But, the buttons could be on top of the screen and easier to use and the volume knob is too low, I am using it as a computer monitor and music player. This may be the only electronic device that I ever buy and use for a living. I just wish that the buttons were on top so that they could be used for volume control and other functions.   The most difficult part about this device to use is the volume control. You have to hold down the volume on the keyboard to play, but when you use the buttons the volume changes by itself. This makes it useless for me to use this device for working with music.   A solid device, with an odd feature. This is one of those things where I love the idea, but find the implementation bizarre. The device has a couple of really nice features. The built in mouse and keyboard is very user friendly, and there are also lots of other apps you can download from the Play Store, like Skype and Dropbox. However, the device lacks the ability to run some third-party applications and requires an extra connection cord (you need to use a laptop or desktop computer to power the device. The other thing that is odd, but works well, is the built in GPS. I use my phone as a GPS for GPS tracking, and I have to use an extra adapter.  The Bluetooth 4.0 device is also a neat feature. It allows for connecting with your other Bluetooth devices, as well as for connecting to your phone using Bluetooth 4-LE. It can also be used to transfer files between computers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was looking for a portable USB power bank and came across the ADM-15 USB charger. It is a good portable device, but I'm disappointed with the poor battery life. When you're charging a laptop that's connected to it, it gets close to 2 hours (I've charged my laptop before). If you're on the go, you'll want a longer battery life, which this won't give you. For $15 it's a good item, but it's missing a major feature that you'll probably need for a long day's use. I wish it had a USB port on it instead of just a USB cord. It's a great product that does what it's supposed to do, and that's charging a smartphone. I'll have to see if it lasts long enough to be worth purchasing, but in a pinch it might be worth buying.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two new laptops to replace the broken one that i bought two years ago and it is still broken!  Write a positive review about the products and services provided by iFixit:  I have purchased iFixIt products in the past for home repairs. However this time, I decided to give a more comprehensive review. I love that you can get the parts and tools that you need to do the job from anywhere. The online video and printed instructions make the whole job go smooth. I bought the power tool, a new case, and a new hard drive (HDD). When the part arrived on my doorstep, I couldn't wait to get home to start the job. I was worried I wouldn't be able to figure everything out without reading everything on the iFixTheWorld website, but it turns out, the parts are pretty easy to find. I spent a few hours fiddling with the parts before finally getting the right one. The hard drive I bought from iFix it for about $50 more than my old one, but at least it was easy to replace (I had to use a hacksaw to cut it open). I used the old case and a few spares to build the new machine, which now makes my whole house run like a dream!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod 2G is a nice, functional portable device, but the iPod 2nd generation is no better.   As a second generation iPod, the 2G doesn't play music well.  The battery is not replaceable.  And the battery life is horrible, too.   I'm pretty excited about the iPod 3G.  I've always liked the iPod and I think the new technology in the 3G will help improve it.  While the iPod will be a great product if the 3rd gen is as good as the iPod 1G, the iPod2G isn't a good first buy.  If you want a good music player, grab the iPod.  But if you want more storage, a longer battery life and a more powerful processor, you should wait for the 3Gs.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am very unhappy with my   iPod Touch.   The battery is not durable and it has a problem with connecting the bluetooth device without the usb cable. I wish that Apple would fix this problem so that it would last a lot longer.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been looking for the perfect portable digital recorder for a long time.   After a lot of searching for one, I finally purchased this and am thrilled with it.  It works well in terms of sound quality and battery life, but the key features it has over its competitors are very limited.  First, its recording quality is terrible.  They sound just like any other portable recorder I've tried in the past.  I was hoping to be able to use this for more than one person, but I'm glad I decided to go with a good compact recorder instead.  Second, the battery life is also extremely limited. I'd be fine with 5 hours of recording, but with only a 2 hour charge I'm afraid I will never get the full 8 hours.  Third, it seems that every time the battery needs charging there is a ton of light flicker.  This is annoying because I'm always trying to find a good way to keep the batteries charged.  Lastly, the fact that this is such a tiny unit is frustrating because it's so hard to use the unit to do anything other than take photos or record audio.  The price point is also a huge drawback.  These are some of the most inexpensive digital cameras that I've seen in the last 2 years or so.  A lot of them can be found for $10 or so, so this one for the price of an iPhone seems absurd.  If I want a camera that doesn't have a ton built in, I'm pretty much stuck with the Sony RX100 or the Nikon Coolpix.  Overall, this is a very good camera, but for the money it's hard to recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the first time I bought an ipod. This is a great product but the ipod is a bad choice for me because of its size.

The ipod also has the great battery life that you would expect from ipod  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received this device about a month ago and was very pleased with it initially, but after about two weeks the lights in my computer were starting to go out (I work in a computer lab). I have the model that has a blue bulb which was causing all the problems and I also have a Samsung monitor. Since the blue bulb is going out I've been using my LG monitor with the blue light and now that is working fine. Not as good as a Philips, but still okay.    Best buy ever:  i got this to replace the old monitor that I have. I have a 27" 2560 x 1440 screen that is very good but I was always frustrated with its flickering when I was trying to play games. This was my first ever computer so I thought it would be fine but it has exceeded my expectations. I was skeptical since the monitor is priced so high but it is very, very good. The colors are great, everything else is great too. The picture is a lot clearer and clearer than my old monitor. I wish I had gotten one of these years ago.  "Amazing" Best purchase ever: i bought this to update to the newest Windows 10, I got it last week (12/15/2017), and since then, the screen has never blinked and has been 100% stable. I use it for a work project and it's just a joy to play PC games on it, it's very sharp and beautiful, the colors are absolutely perfect, it looks and works a million times better than my older model. This is a great product and I cannot recommend it enough  Posted By: Jason @ 12/21/2017 1:02:00 AM Rating:   Best monitor I ever bought. I own two and this one is a better one for me because the monitor has a better resolution, more vibrant colors, and the color is more accurate to my eyes. The only downside to this monitor is that it has the worst picture, but it's great for work. So far I've only had it for 2 months. The last time I checked the picture was not too bad but there was still lots of bleed through on the edges, and it had some "flicker" so it was very obvious when I played games. It's also a little hard to adjust the settings because the display is a little large. But this was my best decision ever because now I don't have to use my old one anymore

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have purchased these headphones, in order to listen to music at the gym. The headphones are OK for general listening and if you are at the workout. However, the bass drops out almost immediately.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using my iBox S for about a month and have to say, it has been a disappointment. I love the idea behind this device but this is one of the worst iBoxes   to use. It is too loud and the screen will randomly shut off and on without warning. I can't use the device because of these issues. The software is ok and it is a very low price for the performance. I don't recommend this product!  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great but not the cheapest   After a lot of research and reading reviews, I bought this device. It looked good on the box, looked easy to use and the features I needed seemed great (not sure about the audio). When I first plugged it in, I found a bit of a problem. The volume had to be set in the computer to get it to play but once that was set up, the volume was great. I've since got it working fine and had no problems. I like the price point and I would recommend this to someone looking to buy a computer to play Xbox games.  Reviewer: Eric from Georgia, USA. (Posted on 7/18/16)  It's a very nice machine. I'm sure that it would be better if the screen were more accurate or I'd be much happier if it came with an external charger (which would be a plus if I'm not in a position to find one). My only complaint is that my PC isn't connected to my TV yet. It's the only game machine I own, so it's important to me. Other than that, I'm satisfied!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard on this keyboard is a pain.   I am sure the buttons are easy to push, but it is very hard to do so without moving the whole keyboard around.  This keyboard has a huge amount of buttons. I cannot even use it with two fingers on the keys, and it is a very loud keyboard too.  I got this so I could use my PC with a mouse, but now I am using a tablet on a laptop instead.  One other thing I want to mention is that this keyboard does not have a good travel.  The travel is very small.  You can use a small stylus, but there are no stylus buttons.

The only bad review I could write about this device: I have to agree with some of the negative comments in the first review, which I don't see as much of a problem. I find that the charger itself is a bit of a pain to put together, and I'd much rather use my computer's internal charger instead of having to buy a separate one. The only thing that really bugs me is that the device has a single USB port, which would have been nice to have a second to charge up a phone or other device. I can see where this might work for someone with a device that only has a USB port.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this for two days and I can say the only positive is I was pleasantly surprised with how well the unit worked for it's size. When it is plugged in to the wall, it can easily get hot with a good connection but when it is in my bag it is a good cooling device.    Rated 1 out of 5 by James from This item worked great when the cable broke but since the cable is no longer made and has become worthless it has failed to work... This item had worked perfectly for a month when the other cable broke and is now in the garbage because there is no need for a power source to charge my cell phone.  This review is from the first time I purchased this product. The first month I used it and got excellent results. The second month it stopped working as well. The third month, no working. I think the first unit I purchased was defective or I did not follow the instructions. I have used this product two times now and it's now in its fourth month of working, I will have to pay more for another item that works great. Don't waste your time, get another one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The Tango is an interesting concept, but one that does not come close to living up to its promises. The Tango takes a lot of good ideas and repackages them into a device that is, at its core, a mobile phone. It's a good concept with a few rough edges, but it lacks in the usability department. For example, it's not a great idea to have to connect to a smartphone in order to take pictures, video, or record audio. You must have an internet connection to access those functions. The camera and the audio-recording capabilities are very good, but you still have to manually adjust your settings each time. Another major drawback is that you can't stream music from your device to your HDTV. That means that if you are watching the latest episode of the television show that you just got off of the TV, the episode won't play on the Tango. I also think that the Tancang doesn't have a very large screen, especially when compared to the LG V10 or the Sony Xperia Z3. As a result, I often found myself tapping on the screen to do things like select pictures, navigate my way to my most recently used apps, and view and select photos. I could get used to using the touchscreen, but I felt like it was a major drawback to the device. The good news is that the Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC One M9 are also packing similar designs and are priced a bit cheaper. Both of these devices are great performers, but their features just aren't as exciting as the T-Mobile handset. I still feel that the handset's functionality, design, and battery life is better than the HTC One or Galaxy S4, but when you factor in the hefty $649 price tag, it may be a bit too expensive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace the "E-Book Reader" that I have for my Kindle, but I was very disappointed, not because it didn't function. I'm sure that a lot of people in this situation would not find it a problem. In fact, it's quite an amazing device. The problem is that the screen resolution is not very good. It seems to have a lot more contrast than the E-Book reader that I had. The "E" word means "extra" in this case. It also seems that the display is not made of LCD material but plastic. I have the same problem in my E-book reader:  The "E"-word here stands for "extended," so this means that the E is not the same as the original E-Reader that came with the Kindle. There's a lot less display real estate, the screen is slightly bigger, and there's less contrast. This does not translate into better reading, especially if you use it with very dark texts, or if you like your Kindle to have white text. That's why I wouldn't recommend this device, even if the E in the name is correct. I also wouldn't use it at night when I use it near a lamp. My E-reader was a lot better when it was a new product:  This thing is not a big deal, but if you own a Kindle, this is a bad one. I used to have an original E Ink one (now discontinued) and it was better. I don't recommend it. This would not be a problem, except that it is made by a company with a history of terrible products.   It's an E Ink, but it's not. I think the E Ink part may have been removed, although it could be because the screen doesn't look as good with the same E Ink material.   I've also used the Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire 7 (and they all seem to be identical), so there's no doubt that this E Ink isn't good enough for this device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was my first time purchasing from another seller and I was skeptical because the item that I received was clearly not an Apple product.   My first problem was the display did not work.  As I opened it, the screen began to flash with different colors. After a minute or so, the display would just completely blank out (no colors or any function).   Then I noticed the screen turned dark but the screen was still displaying the same blank screen. The seller claimed this is due to the internal light controller not being properly set.  I did not want to send the item back, but the seller made a new screen that did not have this problem.  When I first tried to use it, it was very glitchy. The screen would flash and then disappear. I then tried to connect to my WiFi and it would not work either. When I tried to turn off the display using the physical button on the back, it would just do the same thing.  After I contacted the seller about my problems, I was sent another screen.  All in all, the items came on time, but I feel this is just an Apple store.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the wireless speaker and was very disappointed in the speaker sound and quality.   The sound quality is so bad, I was hoping to use this speaker as an external speaker to make my sound system more full, but it's not, at all, it's just a wireless speaker.  You won't even get that music to come out of the speaker. The quality of the sound is very low.  I did a quick web search and did a lot of research and I couldn't find any better speaker than this for the price. I bought it because the only other speaker I wanted was this one.  This speaker is not worth the money.   Review of DJ Tech's DJ Master DJ Wireless Speakers - Apple, Beats, & Sonos - Original Black (SX-R)   So the last time I bought a pair of headphones, I went and bought a $150 pair of Yamaha Sennheiser HD280's. It's a great pair of headsets, very comfortable, and they are built to last a very long time. After a couple of months, they were no longer functional. I replaced the headband with something stronger, and after a month of wearing them, the headphones were still a bit foggy and I could still hear my music but the bass was lacking. I searched online and found a good review on DJ Techs headphone, and decided to give them a shot. They arrived and I set them up to my favorite music and was a good fit. I also found the sound quality to be quite good. The only thing I didn't like was that they were pretty big and heavy. They fit well in my ears and the headphones are heavy and heavy, and for $20, you'd think they'd be a little better quality, but I couldn"t fault the sound. The Sonos and Beats sound great, but the Sonos is the only one that I"m willing to buy for the sound alone. I plan on ordering another pair to replace the old ones I"ve just worn out.  Very good music system for the money! - John P.  Just received the new DJ Master Wireless Speaker system. It is an excellent system for anyone looking for a great sounding wireless speaker system! I ordered these speakers because I was worried I would get tired of having to get up to set the volume, turn down the bass, etc., and wanted to keep my music system in
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am an old time computer user. The Apple Macintosh has been around since 1984 and I still have a lot of fond memories with the early versions (1 and 2). But the new iPod is terrible.   The controls on the iPod are too complicated, too much information to be able to use them correctly and the sound quality is terrible (though better than the original iPod). The only advantage is the fact you can store the music on the computer and listen to it on the other devices, but that's a lie, as I never even use the computer much.

It is a great way to listen to podcasts and read emails while you are driving. You can even use it in a car while your car is on the break...   The sound quality is okay. The only thing I found annoying about it was that the sound was way too loud in low-key areas like in my car and at my work desk.   I don't have a lot of space in my apartment and this is not going to fit in my front door. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These are like the old-school Atari.   They are only for kids.  You need a good gaming machine to use with your PC:  You need a PC with an Intel GMA X3100 chipset processor.  I don't know if there's a way around this, but if you don't own a machine with an X3200 or GMA 2700 chipset, it's best to avoid this.  If you've already got a computer with this chip, then a Z77 board would probably be better, but you would have to buy an adapter (it only comes in the Z77 series, the GMA2700 series doesn't have a board), or you can try to use a board with an extra-wide memory slot. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned this device for a week and a half now.   As far as I can tell, this is a low quality, poorly engineered device.  I can't imagine it would work well if it weren't for having two buttons (one for the "hold" function, the other for the power).  There's also a really bad feedback loop, so if you tap on one of the three functions, it'll go into an endless loop.  Overall, it's a terrible, crappy device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would like to state that after installing my new Asus T400 s laptop (Model: VN-M5A-D03) and a couple weeks of use, I have to say the quality of the build is much better than the Dell laptop I had previously. I have owned 3 Dell laptops and was considering a new one but the first one would not even work. The second one had the dreaded "no power to monitor" issue and it took over a day to get it fixed. The T400 seems to be much more reliable than its Dell counterparts. The only other con I can think of is the hard drive which seems to have a short lifespan. This has been going on for many months now and I am going to replace the drive.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was so happy to buy the    Sony MDR-Z1R   from ebay   for   $300   (around   £200 )   when the Sony M3 was released last year. The Sony M2 was my first electronic sound card and I was very impressed. Then I discovered that my Sony M1 was no longer available. So I bought a used Sony M4 and played the M1 off the hard drive. I was thrilled. However, the Sony sound card on the M4 was way more than a match for the Sony mdr-z1r. Now, a lot of my recordings are in lossy audio format so it was even more of a problem. But it's an expensive bit of kit. I'll be sticking with my used Sony m2 instead. (Posted on 10/29/2014)  Noisy - but it was a bargain at $200, for a professional monitor. The sound is so smooth and natural that I am not sure it really needs a preamp. I bought it to replace a second pair of headphones (that I was using for a while) that were very noisy and I wanted a good monitor to replace them, with less weight than a portable. This monitor is just as good as the high quality portable headphone I am now using. I wish I had bought two. ( Posted on 6/19/2014 )  Great product! Review by John M.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I would never recommend this to someone new to music or the hobby in general. The tone of the bass response is far below what you would expect from a pro audio component. It does what it is intended to do, but in a very sub-standard way. I know the bass has been measured, and I can't see any reason it should have this kind of response. It would not be a deal breaker if it was better, but it is not at all. Overall, I don't think I have spent enough time with this device to really give it a true review.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got my PNY S3200, I bought it to see how good the new PNY microUSB connector really is. It doesn't disappoint. However, it is really slow charging and the charging rate is way to slow for a cheap device. The USB connector has poor insulation on the surface and the USB cable has poor quality connectors. I could not use this with an external battery. I did buy another cheap device and it is not as good as the S3 200.   I had problems with the screen locking up while the phone was charging.  I have purchased a new PNM E7. I like the new screen better than the old one. The screen looks great and I can see the colors clearly, even on dark settings. The device has a fast charge feature and the screen is nice and bright and the performance is pretty decent. It is slow charging because it doesn't use the USB port that is available when there is no signal. The charger is nice but the cable is too short and the connector is very hard to connect. The connector is also on the small side. It looks like it is going to break very easily.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They are the first time I had a real problem with this company.   In the first month that I have used the electronic devices I bought from them I had to use 2 of them   1 of them broke and had to buy a new one.  When the last one I bought did not work the company replaced it at no cost to me.  The problem with the electronic device I got for Christmas was a dead short, so I had an expensive problem to deal with.  All the company would say was that the power to my cell phone was cut off and they would replace it   I had the company sent me a bill.  They said it was from the insurance company so I guess they are giving the same excuse I got last year when I went to the same store to fix my cell phones.  I will never buy anything from this company ever again and I hope to never buy one from this store in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been wanting a touch screen computer/laptop for years but didn't feel like shelling out $1000 for it.   The X10 is the first computer/desk I've ever owned   That's because it had an awful problem:  There are multiple "faults" with the computer. The first "fault" is the screen. The screen appears to be too bright and very hard to read. There is also a "ghost" picture on the screen that is very hard and hard to look at. The software appears to have a very limited number of programs.  The other two faults:  The first is the USB keyboard.  I was hoping this would have a better mechanical keyboard. It doesn't.  In the end, I gave up on this computer because I am too old to afford new computer hardware, but I'm not a poor college student who would take out a loan in order to buy the X10.

There's nothing wrong with the touch area itself. The problem is the "ghost pictures."  The ghost pictures are not just annoying but actually make the device difficult to use.  It's just annoying to have to constantly "sweep" your finger across a screen that has the "fog of war" on it. The keyboard is also frustrating.  However, there is no reason why a touch surface shouldn't have a keyboard. I understand that the keyboard needs to be able to function on a touch computer. However, the X20 keyboard is just poorly engineered.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just received my ASUS P8Z68-V LE. I was pleased with the specs, but it came with a very odd "feature": the power button is placed on the top of the keyboard, on the right, not the left. It is only there to prevent the use of a standard keyboard. And you can not turn it off by pushing it back or pressing on it either. The left side of the touchpad is also somewhat poorly placed. I am using this computer for gaming, and it is quite powerful, so I need to do my best to navigate the complex programs I am running and keep my mouse pointer on the screen. However, I am not used to such a small touchpad, especially because the right side of this model is not that comfortable to use. I also cannot use the arrow keys because of the strange placement. It's just a waste of $200.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If I had one complaint about this device it would be that the software in the App Store for it is really bad. The program is a mess, the "support" is a bunch of unhelpful comments that don't answer any of the questions, and the "experts" you can contact for assistance are totally useless, they basically just tell you to use their website and not give any specific guidance, and then when you've gotten the answer you need they tell you "we really can't help you because it's not ours". This app can't even be updated anymore, the only thing it does is let you check your balance online, which is probably fine except it doesn't actually give you any kind of a breakdown of your current balance as a percentage of your debt, or at all. There's no way to get a hold of any of these people to ask how to go about getting help with your debt.   I'm still waiting on my phone to finally get here, if I don't get this fixed I will not only go crazy with debt but also lose my home. I am seriously considering not making payments on it until I get this working. If you have a credit card with the Visa brand then you should know by now that it won't be an issue, but if you don't, I strongly suggest you get the iPhone. If anyone is interested in doing this, and/or has any advice on how to do it then I would appreciate it.

I have two computer monitors (one on each) and they are all great.  I am trying to find a laptop (with a good sound card) for a travel.  Now, this thing really is OK.  The only way to turn it down was to put a small subwoofer (I think) in the speaker enclosure and it makes the sound really dull. I tried to get an amp and the sound still is dull but I am sure that there is something else going on with this item.  If the sound quality was ok I would recommend the item, but now it is just too much money for a weak computer speaker.

The quality of the materials is the same as any Apple product, but the actual build quality is a bit weak.  The main reason I was hesitant to purchase this was that they are selling the keyboard separately, and as an aftermarket option, they're not selling a quality keyboard (I'll get to that in a minute).   But I don't know. It's my first Mac and it's pretty good in general, and I'm sure they have some other products that are much better than this.  I would have liked to see the keyboard come with the whole thing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this device because I had seen a video showing this device and being impressed I bought it.   First, I have to admit that it looks cool.  The design and appearance is nice.  It seems to do what it says.  Now on to the issues,   The power button works fine, it just has a weak click, if you hit it with your finger, it works.  However when I first got the device the power button was not working, I figured it out after a few minutes.  After a few days the power on button still did not work, I called the support, and they told me to buy a new one.  I didn't have one on hand so I just got another one that's been in my drawer for a couple years.  Even if you are not using the power key for anything, you can still make the button work.  If the power did not click, you could probably use the buttons on this device to switch the screen, as it has the same buttons as the Motorola Droid.  What about the battery life?   This phone doesn't last a long time, I went a month and a half without charging it. It should have lasted 3 times that amount.  Battery life is not that great because there is only a 1.5ghz processor.  Also the screen is too small, as shown in my other review,  I would have paid at least 30$ more to get a larger screen.  Overall, the battery in this phone is terrible.

The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is that it's a little bit on the loud side.  I wouldn't call it a noisy device but it is loud enough.  This review is very long, but I wanted to address the "hassle" aspect of using this thing.  My main problem is the batteries last about 8 months and at that point they must have been bad.  When I bought it I wasn't sure about the batteries. I got a case that fit well but didn't come with all of the accessories. I figured, what the heck, I'll go ahead and get the batteries out of my case and use them.  They were bad. I called to get a new set of batteries.  Customer service wasn't helpful.  Luckily, the replacement batteries worked great! The second problem I have is the size of the case.  There is a little opening for the earbud to fit through. I just plug in the cord and the case is huge.  So I would recommend getting the "Micro Case" or a smaller case or a different brand.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this from another website because it was only $10.00 and it was advertised to be the best electronic device ever.   Unfortunately, this device was completely unusable,   as i put the phone into the laptop bag and plugged it in.  I have purchased over 100 products from this website, and have never had a single problem.  What I would have liked is the ability to save the settings. I have had to repeat the settings multiple times.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad battery died with a very high amp draw, but at least I bought a replacement. My new battery is a new part from the seller, and the new part does not fit in the old one. If it is this bad, why did it not die on it's own, or was this just a terrible seller?
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a Sony CD player for over a year, and then a couple months ago I got a CD player from Amazon. Now it is very frustrating because I can't download new songs, I can only listen to the old songs I already had.   So I bought this item thinking it would be ok but now I'm very disappointed because I couldn't find a better quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a cheapo bluetooth speaker and a bluetooth headset and got the bluetooth headsets for free from the store. The bluetooth is very nice and it works flawlessly.   When I plugged the headset in and started it, I was very disappointed that it didn't recognize the bluestack! I asked the employee and he said I need to put in a card and they would do it.  What a scam! I tried to play some music and it didn... I bought it a year ago and this is the first time it is... It's so simple to do a simple things for just a penny more and a year.   Rated 5 out of 5 by David D from Works perfect! Bought for my wife for Christmas and so far so good! Very easy to set up!  I bought this bluetooth wireless speaker for my car. It's just as I expected and a very good value for the money.  It works great and is quiet.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So what's with the fact that the battery drains so quickly? I've had mine for a couple weeks now and I've used the wireless keyboard every other day, and that's it. I'll get some more batteries soon, but I'll never buy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the LG OLED television as a backup for a small television in my bedroom that is always on when I am at home. I don't even know what a TV is really for, but I know I need a TV in the living room and it was so difficult to find a set that had a built-in antenna. This was a fantastic set and was a lot more convenient than paying $1,100 for the set I was going to get anyway. Unfortunately, it has some issues. One is that I can't use the sound bar to listen to music when the TV is in a dark room. I just have to turn it on or off. Then I have to plug my TV into a soundbar to hear the music. I have a sound bar at home, but it has no remote and is on a separate channel. I tried the LG remote, but the sound is just too quiet. Then the TV says that it can't find the soundbar and turns off. I'm really not happy with this product but if it is a necessity for some I suppose it is good.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After receiving my XBMC box, I realized I'd been a bit hasty in purchasing the item. The XBAP is a nice idea, but the unit I got is unusable. The USB port on the unit is too low for the USB ports on my TV and monitor, so the connection can't be made. It also has a faulty component (the power button). The component will not power my television at all. The other problem is that the audio is terrible. When you turn on the power, there is no sound and you can't get sound from the internal speakers, the speakers in the box, or the headphones. I can't use the TV or audio on the computer to listen to music or other devices.   I can not recommend this product to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There's no way to be surprised or disappointed that the S4 doesn't use USB-C, but that's pretty much par for the course with a device that costs $600-800. If the S5 had a USB-A port instead of the "just plug it in" mentality, then it would be a totally different device. The S5 is so much more than just a USB stick. There are lots of apps and features to pay attention to, and while the phone doesn't appear to have the biggest screen or fastest processors out there, it's still better than just about everything on the market. The only thing I've ever liked about my Nexus phones is that I have one that fits my hand better than any of the competition, but I'm not willing to make that tradeoff just to have a small and not very nice handset.  Review of DJT's S5: It's a Good Phone, But... If you're a regular DJ, then you might have a hard time getting used to the size of the S6, especially if you have small hands like me. I really like the S7, especially the 6.4-inch display. I also appreciate that it's waterproof. As a DJ, I'd much rather have a larger screen than a smaller one that's prone to accidental touches, like the Note. On top of that, there's also a "S-Pen" on the side, which is useful for scratching tracks. There's only one really big downside: the S-Pen isn't waterproof. If you think that's a deal breaker, then this is the device for you. For everyone else, the S3 works just fine.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this to be used with my   MacBook Pro and I was really disappointed. The device has a small LCD display but is not bright at all. The built in speakers don't sound good at all and there is no USB port. The audio output is very loud and the device is very heavy and difficult to handle. If it were cheaper I would not be disappointed but it is so overpriced.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Dell laptop to replace a computer I got 4 years ago. This device was a waste of money. The main problem I had was that the battery never lasted, no matter what. No matter how much I changed the setting on the battery and changed the battery cable. The only solution was to return it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -I was hoping for better quality but I must admit that it does the job.   -I was expecting a better quality device than what I received, but it does what it's supposed to do.  So far:  -This is the first time I've bought an electronic device from a non-tethered website.  -It took me a while to realize it was not a charging device.  I have been using my old, cordless phone and chargers to charge my electronic devices (the one I got didn't have a power button so I used my own, old USB charger from my computer.) I bought this device and was looking forward to getting an electronic charger but this is not a cordless device. When you connect the device to a USB port, it only gives you a one-minute charge and it only works with a specific laptop model (the laptop's own charger doesn't work on this device). The device is small, and not exactly sturdy, but I don't mind having to plug in my devices and wait a few minutes before I get a charge. I don�t think I would have bought this if it were corded because I don' t use the usb port that much on my computer but it seems a good deal for what you get.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery is very unreliable when it does eventually run out (about a week). The keyboard can sometimes be difficult to type on. The only thing to really appreciate about this is the keyboard is nice.   For $200 (with an extra battery) I would have been happy with a keyboard like this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the     I purchased this electronic device for the sole purpose of having a remote control on the wall of my office that can be used to control my computer. This device is terrible. I have a Windows 7 and the remote is very poorly made. It doesn't come with a cable. I've tried it twice and had to call and ask for a new remote. I wish that I would of bought a good one but I had no choice. The other thing that was really bad is that the batteries don't last very long. I put a few dozen dollars into this and I'm looking forward to my death.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was so excited to get this thing.  I had a bunch of other people to play with it with.   There was some confusion at first because of the power adapter.  My guess is that this isn't a power adapter that you plug into a computer.  That's not the way to go.  But the thing works.  The controller is really good.  There are some other things that don't work.  It's like if you have a remote control for your cell phone and one day you decide to replace it with a better remote control.  And now you realize that the old one only has about three buttons.  Maybe if this were the first product you purchased you would've figured it out and got the better remote. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The best feature of the moto z2 is the fact that its battery lasts more then 10 hrs on a single charge.   However the bad part is that the USB cable is really flimsy, you should be able to easily bend it with one hand and the cable is made of cheap materials, the plastic looks cheap and has small nicks and bends,  The other thing is that if your phone falls on the floor in a bar the usb cable will become detached from the phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a really nice computer, but the battery life is just pathetic and it's got the biggest touch screen I have ever seen in a portable computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this monitor for a couple of weeks now. I have never had one that did not have lag before, this monitor is a complete disappointment, the lag is constant and very very annoying. The quality of the image is not as high as I would have liked it to be and I find it difficult to see details at the edges of a movie. Also the video refresh rate is very slow and choppy, I find myself having to go to another program every so often to watch a movie to get the full effect. Overall I am very disappointed with this device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     It was just ok. The quality of the screen is good, and it looks a bit nicer than some other tablets I have used. The keyboard is a little awkward to type on (although I find it useful) and the screen can be a bit hard to read in bright sunlight. The battery life is quite mediocre (I usually use it for around 6 hours per charge). I bought the tablet because it was advertised as being more powerful and was a lower price than some of the other tablets on the market. It's disappointing that it's so poorly built.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound quality is a little strange in terms of the frequency of the tones. They're not sharp and are way more like an electric guitar.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (This review is for the original Sony Walkman, which is a great product and a must have for any music lover.   It was purchased from a friend who had had several of the Walkmans.  It's a well made device, but the controls are very cumbersome.  My friend purchased it with the intent of using it in his car as a remote control for his CD player, but he can't get it to work.  I can get it working, but not the way he intended.  The control mechanism seems a bit fragile, and there are a lot of moving parts.  This isn't the best design, and the controls don't always work smoothly.  Other than that, it's a good, reliable, and good looking device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the G2A.COM for my boyfriend who is a computer programmer. He has a bad experience with other sellers on eBay. This seller has helped him get everything he needs including an extra game disc for one of his games, as well as some other items to finish off his project.   The only thing I wish was included was a charger.   Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, October 17, 2015  I bought this item to replace an older unit (not sure which) that malfunctioned after 10+ years of use  by Peter from St. Petersburg FL USA  Pros: Good service and price Cons: The charger cord was hard to find. Maybe because I bought it used. Other than that, this was a good value.  Review: Bought this to replace my older computer. The computer has been down for a month now. The old unit was slow to boot up and had trouble connecting to the network. This unit was fast to boot and has worked well in the past. The only issue I have had with it is the charger cord. I bought a used (and still very nice) cord from Amazon, and I couldn't find it anywhere. The G2a cord works well, but I had to have someone look at it to make sure it wasn't a defective one. Also, the USB 3.0 port is smaller than the old one that came with the computer. I'm not sure if this was included with the item or if I just got an old port that didn't work the way I needed it to. Overall, I've been very pleased with this purchase and I will be purchasing from again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main thing that is wrong with this computer is that the screen is tiny. The size of the screen can easily be fixed by changing the keyboard on the back.    Customer: The screen is fine, but the battery only lasted a few months.   Rating:  The screen is really small and it can get really hot when you are writing on it.

If   only   those   of you who purchased this   piece   know   how   they   work   or  they should   just   call   Best Buy   immediately   as this  is    a    major    failure   This  is the    least   good   thing   for   anyone   who   would   use   this  on their   computers.  I ordered this item and within 15 minutes it is trying to wipe my hard drive. The item is very expensive but I can only blame the fact that they were forced to send it back because of the poor quality. I tried to send my computer back to Best Buy for a refund but the computer was still in the box. I was not able to change the settings on the computer before sending it back and even after I sent it back it still tries to wipe the drive. I have a good hard drive but I have no way to store my data and it would take up too much room in my laptop. I hope this item is discontinued because the fact is it is very annoying to use and I don't recommend anyone buy it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am a novice when it comes to electronics, but after using this mouse for a while I can say that I would never purchase anything that came from Logitech again. I bought this mouse mainly for its low price point. I was happy to say that the mouse itself was good but the software and quality of the buttons were awful. The most common complaint is that there is no button assigned for the left click, so instead you have to move the mouse to the left side to do a left click. The software itself is also very basic.   The Logitech mouse software is incredibly basic. One button is assigned for each button, and you can assign the function of these buttons in the software. It is a very basic program with no customization options or settings available. It just acts as a plain old generic program that you would find on any of Logitech's other mice. When you have a very bad program, it gets a bad reputation, and this mouse has received it. I've seen worse software, but nothing compares to this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This keyboard sucks! I have been in love with this keyboard for a while, but i was never a huge fan of it. I have an old Dell K700, that was great back in the day, and this keyboard looks old and cheap! This keyboard has a very loose key feel when compared to the Dell keyboard, and the keys are much bigger and jagged. My Dell is also great, and I just can't help but be annoyed with this one! This one is just so bad i cannot bring myself to use it. It would be a lot nicer to get a full size keyboard that has a good feel to it!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's an ugly, slow device. There's a good reason why it's ugly: it doesn't do anything. The battery lasts a year.    The best part is that you can remove the battery from the device without unscrewing it.  There is a little power adapter for the power adapter and the cable that goes to it. The power adapter is not very powerful. I use a portable power pack and a phone charger to charge my laptop when I'm out in the rain.  The device is very heavy.  It gets the job done but is ugly and slow.  Review of DJ0268-04 Submitted By: Mike O. - Verified Buyer The sound quality is just good. The device can be used as a USB storage device as well. It can be connected to a soundboard and a computer, and can even be controlled through an iPad via an audio cable. I am very pleased with the performance of the device. I also use a DJM-900, which can be had from other vendors for less money. The sound on the DJM is similar to the sound quality of the Soundquest Digital DJ. The CDJ2000L and CDJ3000L are much better than the old CDJ1000NX. However, the CDJ4000 is much better, even if it costs more. If you are looking for a good USB storage sound controller, this is a very good option. This is also an excellent product to have for a beginner/intermediate DJ.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I received the AVR-VX3 to replace my aging AVR. I am very disappointed with the quality. The first thing I noticed is the very loose power cord. After I took it out I found the whole unit to be in bad shape. My initial guess was that the component was damaged in shipping and the unit was sitting in a box for a long period of time. When I took the unit out of the box I found that the components that are needed to make the unit work are very low quality and the component that controls the volume control was bent and not working. I returned the unit, and got the VX2, but I can't recommend this device at all.  A few weeks after I received this, my old unit began to fail. The power supply component was bad and no longer working, which led to it overheating when running the AV receiver in my PC. No more VX3. 1 out of 5, reviewed on Feb 27, 2013  Great product but... By Mark H on Feb 12, 2013 This is a great device, it is perfect for the price and for a good price too. Unfortunately the quality control is lacking, if I had known the quality would be this bad before I bought I would have never purchased it. If you're considering this unit I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it because the product is well designed and the only complaint I have is the power supply. There should be more quality control on these things, otherwise great product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a good thing.   The design and build quality are good.  The only thing that would make it better is the ability to charge with an AC adapter.  So far I have used it with my  Apple iPad 2, iPhone 4S,  iPod Touch 4G and my laptop.  This thing does NOT have USB ports but is easy to power off your devices via a wall charger.   It's a good unit, not great   It's a bit too loud, but I can live with that.  It needs a bit more storage.  When I run my iTunes library, it would fill up the disk a lot faster than my other computers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I would suggest this item to any one that has a bad or worn-out keyboard or mouse. For the money, this is a good quality product that performs well for the money. It is a little hard to get the mouse out of the box (you have to push a little with your thumb). The keyboard is a bit tricky to get out. If you use an old computer, and have a computer mouse on the same USB port, you can put a rubber band between the two (I used a pair of small black rubber bands), and it works fine. If it were up to me, I'd have no problem giving the keyboard a 5 star rating. But I am very disappointed in the mouse. It has some issues that need to be resolved: the left and right mouse buttons are too close together, making them hard to use and use in conjunction. I tried the "double click" method, and the left/right button clicks would not "click" the mouse, but rather the side of the computer, creating a delay when I wanted to click a button. Also, it is very difficult to tell where the left mouse button is, because the button is too close to the side where the backlighting is on. Lastly, the mouse has very poor grip. The backlight does not keep the mouse from sliding on a hard surface, and I am worried about it slipping off the desk and damaging the monitor. There was no need to purchase the mouse (or the keyboard) for me to have this problem. I would not recommend the mouse for someone who has a good computer mouse, or even a good mouse.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been looking for a small portable computer for the living room and wanted a wireless one. After reading a lot of reviews and comparing them to Apple products, I decided to go with the Apple iPad 2. It's very large, and I like its portability. It takes up little room in the living area, and it has a lot less buttons than the Toshiba Satellite A380. That said, there is a lot more noise in the signal, and the battery seems to last less time than the Samsung.  Review of DJI Phantom 2 Professional Quadcopter - Black Price:  $499.00 Model:  DJI F550M2-C2U-C My Phantom 2 is finally up and running after a few months of waiting. I have used this quadcopter a lot to check out potential places to go, and especially to find the best places to fly over.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing that's great about the unit is that it has a rechargeable battery. The problem is that the rechargeable batteries are too expensive for a low-level, low-powered unit. I've read reports of other users having issues with the batteries, and not all are as easy to replace as my first unit, so I'm back to my old standby, a flashlight.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got a new MacBook Pro this year. I'm very happy with it. However, a couple days ago I discovered that the Touch Bar only comes in one color -- black. Not the same as the other colors. I also noticed that it looks weird in a couple of apps: In Photos, the bottom portion of the bar isn't the same color as the rest of the Touch bar. When I swipe the bar over to the right, the whole bar is the color of the screen -- which is very cool. However I tried to use an app like Photoshop, and it doesn't work at all. So, I don't know if the Touch Bars are supposed to be different colors.   Apple is using touch bar "colors" to differentiate between MacBook Pro models -- and make it difficult to resell a previous model.  http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36165934 I am really really annoyed by the new MacBook. It feels like a MacBook Air, not a Pro. I bought a 13" MacBook Pro 2.5 years ago because I wanted to have a desktop computer that would be able to run games. My expectations were high for a portable desktop computer with a decent screen, a keyboard and mouse, and the portability of a desktop machine.  My expectations have been completely blown. I purchased a 2.0 GHz Intel Core i5 model and I have a problem with it: It seems as though all of the new software is broken and the battery life is awful. I can't run most of the software in the Mac Store and I get terrible battery life. The Touch Bar is supposed to work like a TouchPad on a MacBook and all of its settings are in the TouchBar. I tried all of my old software, but it does not work.  I have updated my drivers so I am sure it is not a hardware problem and I am very disappointed in Apple.  You can read my experience with the new Touch Bar:  I was so happy with the MacBook Pro with Retina display that I was very willing to take on the iPad Pro (a 5th gen iPad).  Unfortunately, I have been disappointed.  There are several apps that won't even run because the battery drain is too much.  When I get to the Apple Store to replace my device, I will not be replacing it with the 2.9 GHz Intel processor (which is on the 2 and 1

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use this mouse for hours and hours but it's a pain. It makes the cursor move in a straight line only to go back to a straight edge when you release it. And it has a light sensor which is great except it always goes on when you touch it, so when you hold it, it goes off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product worked for a week.   A few months after I got it, it started to randomly get stuck and refused to power on.  A week later I couldn't even get it to power up!  There were other parts out there, but I felt this one was a little overpriced.  I would like to see if there is a warranty.  There are some people with this problem.  Have you had any similar problems:  Have you had a problem with your Bluetooth speaker? 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a HP Spectre x360. The software is the worst I have seen in any computer.   It is not possible to use it, and I spent a lot of time with it trying to figure out what the heck it does. I have two people who know more than I do and they both told me the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard was fine but the "backlight" on the device was extremely faint and not very bright. I would not recommend this device.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Mark S from Poor Product The keyboard on this thing is terrible. The key switches are very loose and the "keys" feel more like a plastic plate than a key. The unit has an IR sensor in it, which gives it the ability to recognize when a room light is on, but only works when you are within about a meter of a door/window. The IR is not accurate, and if you stand too close to the device you might get a false sense that it is on.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The best part is that the battery is still good. I'm able to use it almost every day. My only negative thing is that I had to pay attention to what I was doing when the device was on. Sometimes it would wake up and ask for me to type in a password, and I had a hard time figuring out how to get out. It can also get into sleep mode, so I wouldn't be able to make calls or use other things like a computer. I would still recommend this device if you need an easy and reliable phone. I did notice a slight improvement in performance compared to my previous phone, but for the price I can't complain about anything. - November 3, 2012Worst Phone Ever!  Reviewer: jimmy-jr - favorite favorite favorite - August 19, 2012  Subject: Not a Good Phone I bought this phone after having a Nokia phone. The phone worked good until the very end where it would stop making calls and would be stuck on the "ping" sound. The only good thing is it has a great screen. I also bought a cell phone with a built in speakerphone so that I could listen to music. - August 18, 2012Not a Good Call  Review: It was good for a while but after 2 days the battery went dead. Now I have to use my iPod. I had also tried another phone with no luck. - July 10, 2012It was good to begin with but not anymore  Good phone for a long time I'm going to buy another one. It's very cheap and the battery works out.  A good little portable phone  You get what you pay for and this is what you're paying for. - May 25, 2012Good phone but has some problems  Doesn't last long I've only had this phone for about a month, so the warranty won't be of much help. I haven't used it for much in that time so it's too early to say much about it. For the cost, I'd much rather have something a little better quality than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone looks beautiful, but I wish I was able to buy a better one (not this one) as the buttons on the phone are not ergonomically friendly. It can't hold a charge and I have to charge it using the included USB cord. It is a shame that it's hard to change the settings on a phone because if it was just a simple case that has a phone and phone charger, it would be perfect.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main problem with this device is that the batteries die quickly if you're not paying attention or you're making a few mistakes while playing. Also, it's hard to recharge it because it has no port, only a 3.5mm plug.  The sound quality on this device was mediocre, not much better than a cheap phone.   I'd definitely like to try a better Bluetooth speaker, but this was okay for the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this unit for my new TV. I was very disappointed.   The TV was very bright, but it was very noisy.  It was also a very expensive TV, so I could not get it.  I returned it and decided to buy a cheap tv, which has worked better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had the first generation Apple tv for a while now and, in my opinion, it's a pretty solid package. I've been using it as a media center, watching TV, listening to music, and playing games. The only problem I have with it is the remote control; it's slow and doesn't have much range (in the 10-15 feet that I use it for). If it had a good remote, the tv would be perfect.   - Andrew - October 11, 2015 The only thing I hate about it is that the remote is too big for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So, I bought this a couple months ago after a friend convinced me to give it a try. I have no reason to believe it is any better than a simple bluetooth speaker that will play mp3s.   My biggest complaint was that the connection between the device and the radio was so poor.  The device is essentially worthless. I would not recommend this device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery is a problem, but if I didn't buy this one I'd probably get my hands on a cheap one.   It has a good range of settings.  You have the chance to pick the distance, speed, or other settings, but only 1 or 2 are really useful. The "Frequency" settings are very noisy and not very accurate.  The range is just right, but it is very fast.  As far as I know, this is the first time that a cheap device has ever been mentioned in this forum. This one's so good!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this one to charge my cell phone at the airport.   It only takes around 10 minutes to charge a phone at its maximum.  The battery has a limited life, but that's OK because the phone won't last forever anyway.  It does not have a case.  There is no way to use this with a wall outlet so you'll need to go with the wall socket.  I'm disappointed because I have used these rechargeable batteries for years to charge everything on my laptop,  I've bought batteries in the last year.  This one, I am not sure if I can trust it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am very pleased with the product that I have purchased. But the device that I purchased had a faulty LCD.   A very poor quality.  It was a pain to install and after the installation it failed to work.  In order to fix it I had to buy a new one.   Good Product but I need to get a replacement LCD for this one:  I purchased this keyboard to replace a dead one and I am quite happy. The keys are responsive and I have a lot of space to play with so I don't have to use the mouse often. However I can't use it at the moment because the LCD is dead, but I was promised a new unit, so I'm going to keep it in for now, as the keyboard is still good, but the LCD could be updated. Overall a good keyboard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - My wife has a very high tolerance for noise and it took her a long time to accept the sound of the Bose QuietComfort 35. It takes about 3 hours to get the bass right and it still sounds horrible! It even has that annoying "clack" noise as you turn it on! You don't need to spend a fortune on this noise machine; it's not that good. (Posted on 9/12/2014)  Good Product-Great Customer Service Review by Eric Quality Value The product itself is very good. It is a very quiet headset. It does a good job of blocking out the ambient noise in our car. I would have preferred a larger cup holder, but that is a personal preference. The customer service team at Bose was very quick to respond to my questions and to send me a replacement part. It really helps that I have a Bose account, because I was able to have a replacement replaced before I had to send the product back to Bose. I highly recommend Bose's QuietComfort 35 Headset. ( Posted on 3/13/2014 )  I love this product. Review by Paul Quality Value Bose products are always the best, and this is no exception. The quality of the ear cup and the headband work together as one unit to reduce sound leakage, while the velour headband is comfortable, and the ear cups are more secure and stay in place. The noise isolation on these is very high (better than anything I've tried) which is a good thing because the noise you're experiencing in the car, or at the office, can be a lot louder than anything you're used to hearing. It's not too loud, but not so quiet that you're getting any ambient sounds in the background. And if you don't use it while in the vehicle, the noise it makes is still very audible even when you use the headphones or a Bluetooth device. I really like this headset. I'm on my second pair now, so I plan to buy a third and a fourth. I like the price too. As it stands, the only downside for me is that the noise isolation can get worse over time, especially if it's hot and the car is filled with people. It gets louder over time and I don't like to hear people or cars around me when I'm using it. So you have to remember to get it after the car's been parked a while.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my old laptop. It worked well until I started using it. I had two separate problems. The first was that the battery seemed to be drained every time I turned on the laptop (which isn't good for me as I want to start my computer up every time and the battery gets drained quickly). I ended up replacing the battery because I knew that the replacement battery would be very hard to find and I wanted to be sure I got a quality replacement. The other problem was the screen went black whenever I turned the laptop on. I have a mac laptop (Toshiba Satellite 1520) and the black screen doesn't bother me but when my son's computer had the same problem I assumed I'd be back in a few months. That didn't happen (and my son ended up going out and getting a laptop with a screen that didn't have the problem, so I'm still without my laptop). I guess I can get used to this kind of computer and I can't complain about the lack of touch screen buttons. But I do wish that there was a way to turn off the battery and the screen doesn-t turn off when I'm not using the computer. I'm giving this product a 3 because the screen isn't as nice as the one on the Toshiba.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The worst thing about this is that it is so expensive that I feel like I am going to buy a new computer to replace it   I tried for a week to get a working cable to work and it is constantly breaking, as if a child is messing around with it, when my daughter is playing with it. I am in tears every time it makes a noise, or the USB port breaks. The first one came with a small case but the last two, no case at all.    Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I use a Dell Venue 7 and love the simplicity of the hardware. It does all I need it to do. This year my sister bought the 7 on sale and loved it, so now I got one. But, my device is so bad, it's a total joke. When I plug in my mouse it turns into a mouse pointer. My speakers get louder but then nothing comes out of them. The battery runs out quickly and I can't even listen to the music on my speakers. The whole time I'm trying to set a call to a buddy on my iphone I can hear a buzzing noise. I was supposed to buy a new iPhone 7, but I'm going back to my old iPhone 5.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:       I bought this to replace my old tablet (iPad) which stopped working last week due to a faulty microcontroller. I tried several apps that seemed to be compatible and found a few good options (it's worth noting that the last two apps I tested didn't work well either). But the first app I tried was this app. After trying to boot it up, I discovered that it had a problem on Windows 7 and that it needed to be upgraded to Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or Windows 8 (at least the version that came with my computer). After looking up the correct steps on the support site and getting them all mixed up (I didn't follow them, which is probably why the Windows update took so long), I tried to download Windows 10 and was informed that the app is no longer supported by Microsoft. I'm a total skeptic when it comes to buying any computer, but this is a very, very bad app, and I wish I hadn't bought it. If you're looking to replace an older tablet and the tablet won't power on with Windows 10 (which I suspect most of you are probably experiencing), you might consider this app instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There is only one good thing about this device: the quality of the parts.   If you don't want a tablet that doesn't have the best screen or keyboard, or can't use it well, then this may not be the best choice for you.  If it is your goal to use your tablet as a laptop, you could do much better than this, especially with a high resolution display and fast processor.  I do believe there is an improved model available by Asus, but they can't seem to find the right price for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a decent, sturdy, and relatively quiet keyboard (except for those keys that are not on the back).   I'm not too fond of its feel or the number pad - though, to be fair, I am used to typing on something so thick and flat that the numberpad isn't even really necessary.   It's still a good keyboard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a great device, but there are a few things about it that makes me miss the good old days. First of all, the screen does not have a "screen protector" which protects the glass from scratching. Secondly, the LCD display has a tendency to flicker (like in any LCD display)   I've only had it for one month, but it's already showing signs of wear from being on my desk. The most frustrating part is when I have to plug in to my PC to update my computer system. It has to be very strong to charge the device. I'm sure the manufacturers would be happy with the money that is being lost, but the fact that the manufacturers of a device like this put out a piece of garbage for over $600 makes me sad. This device should be called an "Intermittent Power Saving device" 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One word:   Out of this world!   I was very excited to receive this item. It is a real time saver. Using it during the day is the best part of it. I have to be at my desk from 6-8. There is no need to open up a browser window when working on something, you just have to log in to the computer. It also has an on/off switch and a battery that lasts for 5 hours. It's a great product. My only problem is that it's hard to get the computer out of the box and set it up.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have owned a Kobo e-reader for almost 2 years and I have never been disappointed. The screen, which is made out of a very flexible, flexible plastic is very good. The paper I have read through has always been in good condition. I can see the pages moving as I am reading. It's good that the battery is good but the device is a bit slow. I get about 20 to 30 pages a day which is a good amount, but if you read books a lot you may be missing pages. The battery only lasts about a month. I don't know if the problem is the paper or the battery, but I've been thinking of returning it because I don the Kindle Fire HDX which is much better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a wireless mouse on a whim to play games on my PC, but didn't want to pay a premium for something that only worked for a few games and never worked for me at all, so i ordered this one thinking it would be a decent replacement for my old one (my old one is a $100 wireless mouse), but to my dismay, this mouse has NO buttons, just a weird button you click to start a game, and then you have to hit the "fire" button for it to fire. it's not even close to as accurate as my old wireless one. i'm just hoping it works well on PC games, but at least i can get that annoying thing off my PC desk.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This phone is great in a few ways, but in others it's a real let down.    A couple of months ago I bought a brand new HTC One S, and after using it for a month I finally put in a call with my carrier about not receiving my service plan I had purchased from them. They told me that they only support their "current plan" for that phone (a contract that's been extended by three years), and couldn't transfer me to a new device. Then, after I spent more money on them than I had to (i.e., my entire phone plan plus an unlocked phone), I realized that they had also "upgraded" the SIM card for that particular phone. I'm not sure what they mean by that; for the rest of the phone, I've been fine. (I've been using a prepaid prepaid phone in the same room, so I've not had a chance to test their service). But for the HTC One, it's totally broken.

I have a computer and am used to replacing old electronics (computer, printer, etc), but these are old machines that have suffered the worst abuse possible (lots of dust inside, hard plastic, etc).

Easy to setting up but Does not work Well I bought this in hopes that it would last long enough for me to use my computer with a battery backup. The unit worked great for a few days but it didn't last very long. After two days of use, the buttons on the device started to get stuck and would not respond to my attempts to push them. I tried to reset the unit and then it did not boot up! So I tried the power button on the back and it did work but only for a couple seconds! I would recommend this to a friend but not for a long term solution.

Review of DJI Phantom 3 Standard Edition Basic Version - Red:  I have a few drones that I use, this is the Phantom 3 standard edition that you get with a usb cable. The flight controller has been super-easy to set up and configure. The built-in gimbal is perfect. It has a good range (2 to 10m) and good range-point control. The gimbalance feature is super easy to get set up. The only drawback is that it doesn't have a built--in flash. However I find that if you want to fly indoors, you don't need it.  the battery is not replaceable so it is a must to buy another drone.

The screen does not always refresh and if you don't use your fingers it will become very difficult to navigate, and the   buttons are difficult to reach on the screen. The touch screen does work when you do use your finger, but it's not a satisfying experience, and if I use a different device for music in the future this   will be a "No, thank you" 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is probably the cheapest, most basic camera, and I'm sorry, but I find it lacking.   It's very lightweight, and takes good photos, but the resolution isn't high enough, and there are no RAW options. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device was used to control my 3d printer. I did not have any problem until it stopped working. I had to start over after my third attempt, but I could not make it work. It is very hard to control. The cord was very short. The unit is not compatible with my printer, and I'm not sure that a 3d designer needs a device that is only able to control the print spool. I gave it three stars because it can be adjusted so I can set it to operate the spool in the middle of the print. It seems more difficult to adjust the print speed or turn the spindle 90 degrees and set the spools to go at the correct angle, but that is how I adjusted it in the factory. This is not a device for those who have a computer.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Chris from Not the best! I'm running a 4hr Print. My first two attempts were successful. However the third time I attempted to print a sphere for my "bluemoon" design, it turned out so bad that it has made me consider moving to a different printer/copier. I would be glad to use my new printer and this printer was not designed for this type of design. I bought the "new" printer to replace an old machine that had a bad bearing in one of the parts, and it is soooo much worse. It also appears that the "bronze" color was replaced with "red" because the plastic was just so dull. My machine does not even print a clear model and my model was supposed to be clear but they just decided to print it a color that was supposed for a green one. I have not been able to print the model the store had in stock because it is just not possible to control what color and how far you should move the printer. They have been good enough to give me some other model, which I have bought the last few times, but this one is not what I was hoping for. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this device thinking that I would like it as a tool to use with the power of the internet.  It has been a nightmare getting it to work with my computer because it will not be able to be used with a Windows 10 operating system.  I have tried a lot of things to get this device to work properly but have so far found nothing and have been stuck waiting for a tech person to come out to fix this and give me a refund.  If I wanted a $100-200 device to use as a simple and easy computer backup I would have bought a cheapo USB cord that I can just plug into a USB port.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's too bad I can't recommend this product. I bought this about 2 weeks ago for my wife as a Christmas gift. We have been very pleased with it. It was fast, very easy to use, and the unit is simple to set up. But after about 6 hours, the screen stopped showing any picture at all and has been unable to change the mode. We turned it off, took it apart, and found that a part was fried out by the fuse that connects the screen to the unit. It is very hard to tell where the fuse is located, but we are out $120 trying to get it fixed now. We will not be purchasing this product again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received a Lenovo notebook with a touchpad, a full keyboard and a bad screen.   It looks good on the outside, but inside its awful.  We bought two for two of us and they both work flawlessly but the second one is in use more than the first.  One of the two did freeze a couple times in the past year.  The other one has been broken for at least 8 years.  I'll get the same laptop from HP but they are way more expensive.  Overall, they are good devices, but just because something is cheap doesn't make it good.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this for a few months to control my vacuum cleaner. I could never get it to move the vacuum cleaner up/down like I wanted.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit is well made, but the user interface is terrible.   I am unable to use this unit to send emails on my PC, because the mouse pointer is in the middle of the keyboard and the arrows are on the left side. This will make it difficult to send email when my fingers are in a different place on the keyboard.  A more accurate representation of the mouse cursor in the keyboard would be nice.  My computer has no way to recognize what I want when I click on the mouse, which makes it extremely difficult to use my computer for email, and typing on the computer.

I'm new to electronic games and this little guy has quickly become my favorite. I really enjoy playing with it. I can play a few rounds of a game of cards and quickly move on. It also has some cool built in functions like an on-screen dice roll, a light show, and even an on off button.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had a couple of electronic devices for about a year now and I can't live without them.   The phone is great for calling or receiving/sending messages.  They are all good quality.  I don't understand how this device is made to be so loud.  It's very loud when I use it.  If you need to talk on the phone or something you should not use this device.  The charger is fine.  Other than the volume you can't go wrong with the phone.  Would be nice to not have to remember which way the button is facing when setting the phone to silent.   It's better than the iPhone.  - - - I bought the iPhone 7 and I don´t like the phone... I have to touch a lot to use a camera.  This works a lot better.  My son bought the phone and I must say I was a little bit confused.  Because I had to move the screen to activate it, I had no idea that I needed to touch the screen, it seems to be connected by the wires, but I don`t know why it needs to be touched. The only way I can use this is just by moving it up, down, and forward.  And because I only use my iPhone with it on my chest it is a little awkward, but it is better than using the phone on a regular cell phone. I have used the iPad for a long time and I would say it works the best.  As for the iPhone, for $50 it is worth every cent.  Good and loud, but needs a little TLC.  With the iPhone 6s Plus, Apple finally realized that the design for this device was not as well-received as it could have been. However, as a result of its redesign, the iPhone has gone a long way in improving upon its predecessors. This device is a welcome upgrade from the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 4s. But while the 6s retains a lot of the features of the iPhone SE that the 6 and 6 Plus share, a few tweaks (and some design tweaks) have gone a step further.  Like most smartphone makers, Apple has spent some time designing the chassis of the device to minimize the potential for bending and shattering. The phone has a metal body with glass panels on the front and back.  Despite these efforts, the design feels a little flimsy, and the plastic used for
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm a college student with a very poor eye for detail. I bought a wireless Bluetooth speaker in a bundle with an ipod. I liked the sound, and i liked the bluetooth.   The problem is the blu ray player. I have a terrible eyesight and it only takes about 5min per hour to read a movie (I have a reading speed of about 200 words per minute).  I had to buy a new blu ray, it's defective. I can't use it with my ipod at all because it's incompatible with my mac.  The ipod is so bad, I use it for watching video for homework. The blu ray has poor quality picture and the blu rays are very expensive. The ipods can't play music and I'm stuck using them as mp3 players. The only way I can watch tv shows is the ipod only. This company needs to come out with a better model of the blu-ray player with blu ray functionality.  I recommend you buy a usb blu ray and use it as a player and a blu ray reader.  A big problem with blu rays is the sound quality, I've heard people say the sound is fine, but I don't agree with this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had the computer for about a week, and the display issues are apparent right out of the box. I had the keyboard built by the computer's manufacturer, and now it's a hassle to get a replacement keyboard.   It's not that I'm against PCs (I have a couple, but they're not my main computers), it's just the fact that this is a complete pain in the butt when everything else works perfectly fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I used the app I was not impressed.   The app gives you a list of all the available contacts on your contact list, and the only people with a negative rating was the guy in my family who just wanted his number removed from the app.  In my book he was going to do it, but it took forever and it did not seem like that was the intention.  My family would also be in my contact list.  It would be really cool to be able to search the family members and add them in to the app if the need arises.  The other thing is that you have to wait a few minutes until the person does something you do not like and you need to do the opposite of what they do.  This is a pain, and is very annoying when you are trying to make a connection with someone you just met.  So yeah, there are other options out there but if you are looking for a connection app that can save time and frustration.  You would have to be a real moron to use this app as the developer states. 3.3
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It would have been cheaper if it had a back button and no touch screen. I hate that I can't type to save the trouble of setting the keyboard up.

It has had a lot of uses for me so far, but I won't use it as my only computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because it looked like a very nice product, but it was a nightmare to get working.

That's pretty bad and the warranty is worthless.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is just an ugly looking device, especially in a $150-$180 range. My only complaint is that the volume knob doesn't respond like it should, so the sound is very muffled. It is a very well made product, so that is a little irritating, but not something that will bother me in the long run. I will stick with my iPhone. I've also noticed the lack of a proper software update button.    More bad than good.  This has never been a good unit. I own a Samsung, and the Apple iFone 2 has a big advantage in quality and convenience. However, the audio quality is sub par, the screen is a horrible plastic design, and it's ugly. It's definitely not worth it, and Samsung has made no effort to fix the usability problems.  I would rate the review 4 stars if I could. But the fact is that I'm not going to buy one and it doesn't have enough advantages for me to get it back. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These are the worst   The LCD's are terrible   They should have just used a cheaper LCD and a better screen The keys on the keyboard are too stiff   I can't press them   If you want a cheap e-reader this is not it    Was this review helpful? Yes No  was not as great as I thought I had some reservations about the original Nook Touch and the Nook Tablet, so I was rather surprised to see how good they actually were. The Nook T3's screen was good enough for me to read a book, a good magazine, and a book on paper. The screen on the Touch was still good, but it had noticeable lag when scrolling. It would be nice if you could scroll through books without scrolling back. I'll probably buy another one for my daughter.  I don't feel the need to return the tablet, though it's definitely time to. I'm not sure if the NOOK T3 is actually worth $50, but for a new device it's actually pretty good, I'll say. The Touch is a little bit better than the NTC's, and that's about it.  has a good selection of music and apps to listen to and read, and it's more than a little on the light side.  a good price, and the ability to read books as PDF is the best part of the device. The only downside is that the screen is not as bright as some of my other e-readers (Kindle and Nook)  ... but still a good value, especially for a device that can be connected to an HDTV. . If you are an ebook addict, and don't mind not having much screen real estate on the device, then this is the device for you. I am a fan of the Nokton Touch. I like the ability of my Kindle and other devices to read my Kindle books on the tablet screen. And I like reading in bed without having to get up and turn on the screen. This device allows me to be able to read as much as I want on the Nooks. In fact, for me, reading is a big part of my life! It's fun, and is just as fast as an HD tv. It is pretty small for a Nook, but is still small enough that I can be in the house reading and can have the lights on. I can even take it
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this as part of a deal I got on a wireless USB device. The only thing I didn't like about the device was that it was on a little hard drive that you had to carry in your laptop case. The company I purchased it from offered to send me a replacement. I was so happy to get the replacement I sent them an e-mail with my return information. My replacement arrived two days later. The device actually works perfectly now. I never had a problem with the USB port on my laptop.   The Good:  I don't use the iPad very much for browsing on a tablet. The iPad just gets in the way.  When you need to use the tablet it is very handy to have a backup tablet with you.  This device is super simple to use and works perfectly.  Very well made.  A very nice addition to any system.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a new laptop because my old one started acting like it wasn't working.

When you try to use the touchpad it seems to not work. This is a new system from HP so hopefully they will fix the problem. Other than that it is a great laptop. (Posted on 6/30/2017)  Works well but has few problems Review by James Quality This is my first full-size notebook and I have to say it's very smooth and well made. I love how it's slim and light. The only thing I can say is that one time when I was about to put it on my desk to work on my homework, I noticed my computer was making a humming noise. My system is not from Apple, but it seems like there might be some connection problem with my notebook's USB port. I'm going to have to send this back and possibly buy a new one, as it has a good warranty, but if I have the same problem with a different computer I'm just going to give them my old computer and save a few bucks. (Edited on 8/22/2017, 2:14 PM) . (Anonymous) There are two issues I have with the ZBook Z500, the first being the USB port not being compliant to the standards of Apple's USB. The Z500 does not have a USB 2 port, and it's not USB 3 either (as I understand USB 3 is more efficient than USB 2). It's a USB 3 port that doesn't provide a USB 1.1 specification and doesn't support USB host. So if you want to plug in a 3rd party USB 2.0 card you are in for a bit of a wait and a headache because you have to plug your 3rd Party card into the 3rd USB port in the Z500 before you can see the ports, it also seems to be a bit laggy. This issue has not been resolved, so for me that is unacceptable. The second issue is that for the money I'm paying for the computer it's a really good computer, and for the price the only reason I can think of to not buy one is the lack of USB 2 ports. So for me I'd go ahead and pick one up, just be
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had the Epson Stylus Photo 7 for about 1 year now. I like it, it is compact, and it has everything you want in an electronic device. I bought it to do a report on how many people I had to show to a business to get them to buy a printer, and the report was just wonderful and very informative. The only problem was the paper quality when it came out, I got a really bad copy and was wondering if they would be able to give me another one after that. Other than that, great product!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am very disappointed in this electronic device. It will not even recognize a click sound to turn on or off the lamp. I tried a couple of different brands of "Lamp" light bulbs and found that these are usually dimmer or have a "click" sound that will turn on and off the light. I have a small electronic device that lights my garage on and the bulb came on but the "click", did not work.    Excellent Lamp, but beware:  To say that this is an excellent lamp is to understate the truth. This product is more like a "Christmas light" than a high quality product. That being said, it is very easy to install, and is very sturdy. It has excellent lighting, and there are plenty of settings to choose from.  To be fair, it has a built in switch (on the base) which will shut the lamp off when the "Christmas switch" is pressed. I installed this lamp a few months ago, with the only complaint being that the switch on the lamp is a bit flimsy.  The only negative I can say about this product is that there is no wire management in the wiring for it to be connected to other devices. Also, you can see the inside of the lamp when it is on. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a fantastic monitor and has many features, but the image quality is absolutely awful. I think the colors are very green and very flat. The image is very dull, as though it was recorded onto a DVD. This isn't a problem with the picture, the sound is very good and the speakers are amazing. The buttons for adjusting the volume and menu were very confusing, I had to read it a couple of times to figure out how to change any settings on the monitor, even the preset ones that are supposed to be obvious. The monitor does have a backlight, but if you are looking to use the monitor outside or in dim light, you should probably look for another monitor. I would never have gotten this monitor if it wasn't on sale, but it's an amazing deal and you get the monitor you want for half the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am a HUGE fan of my iPod touch and my old Apple computer, and I thought that this replacement would solve the problem of my old iPod not working anymore! I was very pleased with the sound quality, as well as the size of it. However, as soon as I plugged in the new iPod, I noticed that the interface is extremely sensitive to static electricity (you must not hold it very close, in my opinion). I noticed this about a month after I bought it, so I thought I'd give it one more chance to see if anything had been done about it. About the second time I plugged it in, I immediately heard a faint ticking noise (something I'd heard before, but I couldn't quite put my finger on exactly what it was), and my iPod just stopped working. I was super upset! I have now replaced the original iPod with this replacement, and it works perfect, so now I'm back to the old thing that I've been listening to since it came out! So, there you have it: an iPod that will last a lifetime, that sounds great, and that is the perfect size for one person (with a full size laptop).  Noise issues   The iPod touch is a great product but for the price, you can't beat it. There is a problem with the noise when you turn the volume up. I thought the problem had been fixed when I received the new one. I went into my iTunes music folder, and found a folder called "noise". The iPod still works but the noise isn't there. This problem has happened to me 3 times, so don't be too sure that the iPod touch will work until it is fixed. This is a very cheap product, so there isn't much you can do.  I don't buy this product anymore   This iPod touch was an amazing gift for my son. The problem with it, is that the sound is really bad. I am going to return it because the sound in general is bad. It just can't make up for the terrible sound quality. I don't like paying $60 for a device that has such terrible sound.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPhone is great.   It's the only phone I own, and I would never want a phone that was not Apple.  I love it.  It is easy to carry around, and it's easy to use.  However, the battery life is really poor for an iPhone.  With that battery, I can get two days of continuous use. However, with the current battery life, I will have to get two more batteries to keep it going.  The speakers are really poor.  This device was made for music.  What happens when you listen to music?   You can't hear it, or you don't think you can hear it. I listen to a lot of music. I have my music on my   computer, or my  iPhone. What happens if I want to listen to my phone?  I'm just wondering, because the speakers are so low, I don't know if they are gonna come through well at all.  If you don'st have a lot music on your iPhone, and you only use a phone when you have it connected to your   laptop, then this   phone is for you.  Otherwise,  it is just really cheap.

It can take up to 5 minutes to turn it on and off, and the "On" and "Off" buttons don't work correctly.  Even if you buy this for $35, it's still not worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the end, the SRS-80 Model 4B is an expensive and somewhat underwhelming toy.   The keyboard is very good, but its not that good.  The sound quality is average.  It has a built in speaker, but that speaker isn't anything to write home about.  Its a shame, because the sound quality isn't bad, it's just that its so loud.  I've owned a Model 1 and Model 2 and both of those keyboards had nice built in speakers.  My Model 1 had a better keyboard than this one, but I never used it for long, and my Model 2 was more comfortable and had a more enjoyable sound quality.  You could probably buy another Model 4 and still have a good keyboard.  If you like the Model 2, you might want to wait for the Model 4.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They have a nice remote and I like the fact that I can change the power levels from a knob on the remote, but the device has a great screen but the volume controls do not respond in a timely manner and sometimes I have to switch the device on the TV to see what the problem is. The device has two USB ports but they both seem to be for the TV only. I really hope I get a better remote.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned the product for about 2 weeks. At first I was excited to use it. When I first turned it on it took a few seconds before it started. The sound was OK, but not what I expected. Then the device started to show it's age. The battery lasted 1 hour less than I expected and there are scratches on the face. My wife even took it back for a refund after one use.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a Samsung smart TV and found the remote extremely bad: The voice recognition and screen resolution are awful. It's so badly programmed that I can't tell if I am trying to find the TV or the buttons on the remote.    "I got a terrible remote and it is a pain to use." - C. S.    "This is one of the WORST remotes I've ever used...and the voice recognition is terrible. I've tried 3 different brands of remote over the years, and this is by far the worst. When the remote worked fine before, the voice commands were great and fast. Now, when trying to search for TV shows, movies or shows, the remotes have to be in voice command mode, which is incredibly slow. I have to put in "command" for the TV to turn on, "turn off" for movie, etc. This is very annoying, especially since the remote has some nice features that should be standard. I would not recommend buying this for this price, especially if you are not familiar with the different remotes in the market." - G. T.  But I'm very happy with this product.  This remote is very user-friendly, easy to navigate and very easy to read.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a Sony CDX-1000 digital media player with a hard drive last year. When I played the first songs, I was very impressed by its sound quality. The audio tracks came through clearly and smoothly and the quality of the playback was very good. The soundstage was very wide and deep and the bass was really strong. I was also impressed by the speed and the accuracy with which the unit recognized the songs I selected.    This player has served me very well so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - The only good thing about this is that you can use it for anything but games. - The battery life is pretty bad, especially if you're using it more than a few hours a day. -   In the past I was unable to use a USB mouse on Windows 10 (no joy), so this is quite annoying. - You should have used a cheaper USB cable for it instead of the expensive one that you got. - Some of the apps you can run on your computer seem to have bugs that make them unusable - It takes ages to sync files on your device from one device to another. - It's really easy to destroy your phone when you use it and you're not careful.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for the kids (12 & 14) to use as a timer for making music.   They used it once, but it didn't go off, so the software gave the wrong time, so they went back to the old method and it's now been three weeks since they've used it.  This is a bad product, not very reliable, and the only reason I kept it is because the price was right!   My kids hate the fact that I am spending my time on this to make music instead of them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had my S2s for a year and I am very impressed with the product.   My only negative complaint is that the software crashes and the phone will not turn back on and is only on a 5% battery.  It was purchased to replace my iPhone and I'm very happy with it.   It's a good phone and it's all I need:  If you only need a phone and don't want a tablet, this will be a good choice.  I bought a black one, and it fits my needs perfectly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been a customer of Motorola phones for some time and I've had some really good ones. One thing that's bothered me with them all is that if you drop it on a hard surface or put it in a pocket while it's charging, it doesn't always charge and you have to wait up to two days for it to recharge. I recently took my new Nexus 7 tablet home from Best Buy and just got home to find the battery was dead! I decided to buy the replacement since I'd never had to return a Motorola phone before, but I don't even know why I bought the first one.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only reason i bought this device was that i have an external hard drive attached to my laptop that i use as a backup system. This device is NOT a backup device. For the money it's great for someone who wants a small external hard disk. But this device is no "backup" device. The drive is not removable, so if you plan on running an OS that requires an external drive, it might be better to spend your hard-earned money on a proper external drive.  by Christopher from San Jose, CA on 5/12/2012

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A friend had this on a back order but didn't need it, and I thought, "Hey, I'd hate to wait on a great product just to find out the USB is faulty". The problem is that I got a bad charger for the device, and now it won't charge at all. It has a bad quality-look to it, as if somebody just dumped it off the shelf on an overstuffed sofa.   It does not look like it would last, though it says that it can last 3 years on a label.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned a   Sony   CCD   camera   for almost twenty years, and   the   digital camera  is   a      d   to   it   in   my   hands   all   time.   On   most   shots   of   sports   or  special   applications   on the  screen  of   this   compact   model,   it   appears   that   some   pixels   have   faded away,    and  that   is   not   true   anymore.  But,  the new   CMOS   sensor   and  I.S.  mode   seems   more   accurate   now.  I am not sure   if   there   will   be   any   improvement   when   i  next   purchase   something else.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first model of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF5 had many problems. The screen was small, the viewfinder was hard to see in low light, the back was plastic with a weak lens, the AF system was sluggish, and the zoom motor was notoriously inaccurate. A few months after the release of the GF5, Panasonic launched the Panasonic GF1, which was a big improvement: the image sensor was bigger, the image processor faster, and better weather seals. The GF1 also replaced the AF mechanism with a very accurate manual focus system and a larger rangefinder. Unfortunately, these improvements didn't offset the problems I mentioned above. When the GH5 came out in 2013, it promised many of the same improvements but on a much bigger sensor (8.4 MP compared to 6.3 MP), a faster AF motor, better image stabilization, better weather sealing, and a new focus clutch, which let you manually focus in AF mode by pressing the shutter button without having to manually hold down the camera. As an added bonus, Panasonic claims the focus ring is now a little faster too, which is good news for photographers. However, the manual focus ring was still very slow and, because the AF is so good now, I can't recommend the camera for anyone who shoots mostly stills. The GH5 also improved the build quality, improved the battery life (a huge improvement from the GF1), and offered more features at an affordable price. The only real complaint is that the battery door broke in half while I was taking a picture with it. The camera is a great choice for anyone wanting a camera that's small, compact, lightweight, and has a lot of features, but the small viewfinder, poor battery life, and weather sealing don't help make up for it.   Pros: Excellent price; large sensor; fast AF system; weather sealed; good build quality; very small view; fast and accurate AF in AF, full-frame modes; better weather protection; longer battery life than GH5; good video abilities with the built-in mic; great battery life; high quality LCD; battery door washer still breaks, but not too often; good manual focus; very fast zoom with the EVF; many built-ins  Cons: Large size; poor weather sealing; no built-into microphone; only has 4 or 5-stop dynamic range  Other Thoughts: The GF5 is a solid camera that can be used for serious
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's very easy to program the keys for use in a way that isn't natural and can't be changed for future keys. After learning how to program it myself, it became difficult to use the keys in a "natural" manner, and this is why I am using a different keyboard. For some reason, the keys are hard to press while holding down the down arrow keys, but if you have more than two fingers on one hand, pressing all keys on the keyboard with a single hand feels awkward and awkward.   The bottom row is very small and the keys have a very short travel. The top row is the one thing that's still great about the keyboard.  by Dan from Fort Wayne IN on October 29, 2015
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's pretty lame. This phone isn't worth the price paid for it. I had to resort to using my iPhone 4/4S as my primary mobile device because the iPhone 4 has the same amount of features as this phone with only a little bit more battery life. I can't believe Apple made this phone! The screen is terrible. It doesn't really even have an image. I have to use my laptop. The battery life is horrible. The earpiece is not very nice. I don't like the fact that there are no buttons. It's all about the software. The buttons on this phone don't do anything and the buttons on the phone make the phone harder to use than it needs to be. I would only recommend this phone if you want a phone for your phone and don't have an iPhone or an Android.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was looking for an inexpensive and easy to use MP3 player that played my mp3s as well as my mp4s on my computer.   The player does what I needed, but I have had to re-flash it several times.  The players sound terrible with the "audio quality" that's provided from the computer with mp3 files.  Also, the computer doesn't keep a "file cache" of all your mp3 data, which is needed to play them.  In short, if you want a cheap MP3 mp3 player, look elsewhere.  Very satisfied with the product, it was very easy to install and works great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is soooooooo stupid   It doesnt come with the charger for the battery   Not sure how you can connect two batteries together if they don't fit   The battery charger has a big "U" that makes the whole unit sit on the end of a table   I can see how it would be useful if you needed to charge more than one battery   I have been using the Power Bank for a few days and I am very impressed! I do not want to give a very high review because it's so new and I can't imagine how many problems they've had with it. This product seems to be working well but there is a little trouble with the battery level indicator. The problem is that the battery indicator does not work. When it's at full charge the indicator says 5 percent and the battery is still too low. When the battery gets to 3.3 percent the indicator stops. This may just be my problem but it's not a good sign for a battery. It would be nice to be able to see the percentage in the display and it would make life a lot easier. The Power Bank is perfect and I have no complaints about it.  So far I love it. I have used it for a week, have charged 4 batteries at once and have been able to charge them back up with the same result. The first battery was at 3 percent after 3 hours and the second battery at 6 percent after 6 hours. This is what I am most excited about as I am a self sufficient person who needs a lot of power to run my home. .    I would recommend this item to anybody that needs a very powerful battery pack for their electronic devices.  in my opinion, I am going to have to take a few batteries, maybe all my batteries at least and go to a big box store and get a big one. because this thing is awesome and i am impressed!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new Dell laptop because my old one stopped working about a year ago. I tried the latest Dell laptop which came with Windows 8, but it had the same problem, and it ran like a dream! After the second day of use I noticed that the fan was running very fast, very high, with a constant noise. Then the power light on the screen went out. The Dell laptop then shut down after about 10 minutes of no power to the motherboard. The only thing I can think of to be able to get this thing to work is the power supply that comes with the computer. The power supply is great, but I think it would work better if the fan stopped working when the motherboard went into standby. But other than that, I really like the computer; it does what I want, is quiet, has a lot of space for my files, and runs so fast that I never get lag. I am going to upgrade to the newest version of Windows 8 after this, as I did with the old one. So if you want to get a new computer, buy it here!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from I have the 32-bit version but a 64-bit one is available. I have a Dell Inspiron 5000 laptop with a 2.5GHz Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of memory. The computer is running Windows 8.1 Pro (64-bit) on a solid state drive (SSD) with the 2TB hard drive. I installed Windows 8 Pro 64-Bit on the SSD. So far, the installation went smoothly. After the Windows installation is complete, you can install Windows 7 on the same SSD drive. My laptop has a built-in Wi-Fi, but a wireless adapter is available from my local computer store. I was able to connect to a local hotspot that I set up on my wireless router. I also bought a wireless keyboard, mouse, and monitor. The screen resolution of the monitor is 1920 x 1080. I got the Dell monitor with the 1920 x 1200 resolution. My Dell laptop is a touch screen. The touch screen resolution is 1024 x 768. I didn't notice any difference in performance when using the touch screen or the standard computer keyboard. I noticed my laptop battery life is much better than the old laptop and that I have less time looking for a power outlet. I would like to get the 3D monitor for Windows 8 if I can find it, but my Dell
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to use at work for printing out a couple of files I wanted to upload to a site. The quality is excellent, as is the print quality, but the device is very difficult to use with the ribbon cable (in both the hard- and soft-rivets). This also causes a lot of errors, because it is impossible to use the cable for anything else, even typing! I'm sure I can find another use for this device, but for $30 I would have much preferred a cheaper option (such as an Etcher).  Rated 4 out of 5 by Chris from I used this for printing documents on a Mac to give to a friend. I used it on a HP Compaq Elite Book 14 which is an 11.6-inch laptop. The print quality is good, but a little slower than an inkjet printer. It's not bad, just not the fastest.  My wife got the laptop for me. After playing with the mouse on our HP Elitebook she went out and bought a Macbook Pro. I had to wait until she came back so I could download the software and get this on the Mac. I use my old Dell printer, which is a LaserJet Pro 4255 (can be found at local store like Office Depot and Lowes). I used to print in.PNG, but now I need to use a format that will print better on a larger print surface. This is a good option, it will get the job done.  the cost is a little expensive.  was a great buy
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone works great, and the price is reasonable for a phone like this. But there are too many glitches to recommend this device. The only "gimmick" the phone has is that it runs a custom Linux OS called Tails, which I had not heard of before, and it's a cool OS. But it doesn't seem that secure - it's hard to use the browser and there is a lot of "trickery" to get Tails to work. I had the same experience with OS X, and this isn't really an Android phone, which is a shame.  Great phone with lots of hidden features The phone is very versatile with lots options. The video calls and SMS messages are awesome. The audio is good. I use my phone for many things, so I am happy with it. The phone can also be used to make phone calls on Tmobile with my friend and have a secure texting experience. This phone is really versatile.  "I have had the Samsung Galaxy S II for only 2 days and I am really happy with the phone. There is not much I could ask for that is not in the phone (no ads, great music, amazing phone features, great UI)."
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing has a good build, I have yet to experience a problem with it. It's an excellent product for the price, but it's not a must have. For the money, I'll probably just get a smaller one, because this thing is large for the battery.   Have the best portable speaker system! This is the ultimate speaker system to bring on the road. The sound is great, the battery charge time is fast, and they come with a CD-ROM and CD player as well. The CD's are the only way to listen to music on the trip as they are a bit low quality. Overall, these are the best things to listen on the way to the next city. I will definitely be buying more products from JBL  . 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have bought 3 different computers in the past 2 years for my wife and myself. One I can use with her, one is a toy and doesn't work as well as the other 2, and the last one we just received didn't work at all! So we are now in the process of finding another computer so we can use it as well. If you have a computer in your home that doesn't last a month, you're probably not using it well or at all. If your computer doesn't have problems, you probably aren't using it. The fact that you paid for this computer should mean that you can expect the same type of quality, but sadly these things don't always come out the way they are promised.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this thing for a while and it lasted for over 2 years.   If you are the type of person that just wants a nice keyboard and mouse, this is not the device for you.  This is an expensive "compact" laptop that lacks a good keyboard and some other features. The battery will last you 2 to 3 years, but don't expect anything better than the cheap clamshell. The build quality is really good - the laptop is built in the style of a laptop, not a tablet.  The track pad is okay - you can use it, but you probably won't be able to get very far with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought the iPhone 5 (yes, that was the model name, not just the product name), the case (which was really cool and easy to open, and very tough and durable - for the price, of course) failed within days. When I contacted AppleCare, they sent me a replacement case - and in less than 2 days, the same case was cracked and falling apart. They sent me another new one, but it was defective - again. So, I guess my question is - is it worth it to spend $700-800 on a case? I am very happy with the iPhone and all my money goes back into the Apple ecosystem (which I appreciate). And for the money, I'd definitely rather spend on an iPad. I don't see this getting any cheaper anytime soon.   The good: -   - Beautiful case   I have 2, so far. The case fits my iPhone 5 perfectly. The screen is a little smaller than my Samsung Galaxy S III, but they're about the same size. The design is not overly complicated. The only thing that annoys me is the lack of a micro-USB-C port. You have to have one to charge it - which seems like a very minor complaint.  I'm going to have to add this to my "fave cases"   You will not regret buying this case. The bad: - No micro-SD card slot   This is a very frustrating problem, but the solution is fairly easy: buy a microSD card - it's included! The case only has 1.6GB of storage - the one you get with the 6s, you can get 32GB, 32GB+ - but it will require a card with at least 4GB of space to install apps. I would not recommend this case to anyone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have used this device for about a year now, on a regular basis. I was initially a bit reluctant to spend the money for the unit because of the price, but I have found it to be an amazing device and highly reliable. The unit is very portable, as I can use it anywhere on the planet at any time. If you are looking for a good unit, look no further. You can always get another one, but if you already own one you should definitely get a second one. I have only had this unit for a short while, but have noticed that when my batteries die, I can still reach over to my radio and have a listen while I wait for my batteries to recharge. This is something I did not have to do in the past!  Rated 1 out of 5 by jlh from Very disappointed I used the radio for a few months on vacation and was very pleased. Then the batteries died and I have had to replace them twice now. Very disappointed. I think I have the only two batteries on the whole planet.  Reviewed by Bob in Atlanta, GA. on 07/08/2014.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new Samsung Galaxy S III last month, and am extremely pleased with the device so far. It is a beautiful device, and it performs as well as I expected it would. But the problem is that the "micro SD card slot" doesn't seem to be removable.   When the device arrived, the card slot on the phone would pop out. So I just got a new micro SD card, which now works fine.  Also, the battery is extremely flaky, and will stop charging.  It's hard to recommend an $200 or so device that fails on so many important features.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am writing this review on a brand new   $350   electronic   computer.   When I purchased it at   Best Buy, I was not disappointed.  There were a few scratches on the inside of the case and the LCD screen had some issues (I believe the LCD could be brighter).   The   USB port is fine, but is not a great port (I was only able to use it on my PC, so not the most ideal).  However, the sound card is perfect.  It works just like   the original   that came with my computer. So, for what   it's worth, I would recommend this   for the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had an excellent first-generation Nook.  I just had my 2nd one, and after a year of service, I had the screen completely crack in half.   The second problem was even worse:  The back cover came off, so I could not take the screen apart.  When I purchased the Nook, it was on sale, and I chose it, thinking I'd use it every week and return the other one for a good deal.  To my surprise, after having it for 2 months, the screen is totally cracked, and it has to be replaced.  It's worth the money to purchase the one that is worth replacing.

I lovemy Nook Touch,it is soeasy to use,- and when i bought it a few weeks ago, it's still working perfectly, the buttons work as they should, the battery is still good, and the price is much lower than other models. When I started having trouble with my Touch a few months ago, I went to see the online support section, and they gave me a replacement, but I bought the same model of Nook and bought it back.  This is a shame because I think the NOOK Touch is a great product and a great deal! I don't have the time to return the broken one. I recommend people do a thorough investigation before buying anything online, this should be a crime!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got my laptop, I was thrilled with the performance and the features.   I wanted to use it to learn to program, but since the batteries lasted only a couple months, I moved on to my next device.  When the battery died, I took the laptop to my local computer repair shop, where they put in a new battery.  After one day, it started making a humming sound and the laptop wouldn't turn on.  The laptop has since been replaced.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only problem with this is, when I first got it, I did not use it. My wife wanted it, so I got one. I went to my electronics store to find a replacement, and the salesman showed me a picture of his wife with the phone, with the ringtones on and all. I said, "No, that's just not gonna work for me!" He told me, "Just get a cell phone," and I thought, well, okay...but then I found out she's on her cell phone. That was a pain. I had to buy a new one (a $150 phone).   I have my phone on vibrate and it just vibrates to "Call". Then you can hear the sound of a call but you can't hear what the other person is saying. It's very annoying.  When I bought this phone I read the reviews. They were all great. So I figured I would give it a try. After trying to switch to a mobile phone I had used before, I tried this phone. My girlfriend gave me a $25 gift card to purchase this phone and I used it for a few days. This phone does not have a screen for the "call" feature. There is a small button on the top with a screen, so you have to use a computer to make calls. Then you have a little white box with a white LED light that turns on and off to show when the call is going to a selected person. It takes like five to six minutes for a call to go through. You have to make the phone calls from the computer. I have used it, and I have gotten a good number of calls, but not many people have been happy with this phone so far.   I think this is a very well thought out product, it's just a little short sighted.

For a very small investment it has everything you would ever want on a mobile device, including the ability to listen to music on a headphone.  I wanted a phone that could do everything I wanted, so I purchased one. The only problem I had was that the charging cable didn't charge. So I got another one that did.  But that's a very minor complaint compared to how much I enjoy the phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have never had a problem with the power button.   The problem I have experienced with this product is with the speaker.  The sound is too tinny for me, not like you hear on my iPod.  I think my headphones are a better speaker but I still get very little sound when I use the radio and the TV at the same time.  A good unit for the money is available but the one I have does not meet my expectation.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jim from The radio and TV are awesome! This unit is very good quality. The sound quality is excellent. The unit has been very reliable and it comes with a 3 year warranty. This is definitely a good value for the amount of power you get in this little unit. .  a very good radio, and a good TV, which is a must!  From the price you pay, I am giving this unit 5 stars. The TV/Radio are also outstanding products and the battery life on both units are outstanding. If you don't use the internet, and the local news stations are only on cable or satellite TV, you might find the radio too weak but it's certainly sufficient enough to receive the local stations. In all the years I've owned this unit, I've not had a single problem.    Rated 4 out of a possible 5 by kp4c from Good Value I was looking for a compact unit that could be set up anywhere and it is. I am not a "big deal" when it comes to electronics but I do use a lot of TV's and radios and the price point works well for me. I have the blue and the red and have not really needed the yellow unit. The yellow one has worked well but it is not the same as a full size radio. The main issues are the low volume and the speaker quality, not to mention the fact that the unit will turn off if the battery runs out, which isn't very good. The blue and red are not really "comparable" in quality to say the Yamaha RX-10 but I don't really think that there is a need for a better radio at this price point. I use a Yamaha RX10 for radio/TV and my RX10 is much better quality and I paid more. For what I pay I wanted a smaller, less expensive unit, the radio is fine but it isn't a "must have".
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product on a whim a couple weeks ago and I am quite disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery life on this thing is pretty mediocre.   You're basically gonna use the battery life to charge the phone, and then you'll have to re-charge it again the next day, and the phone won't work with a full battery because the charger isn't powerful enough.  I was only able to get through one day, even though I have a full time job that is very taxing on my battery.  In addition, there's no way to tell the phone when it's low on battery, unless you leave it in the case for too long. I would've been fine with just a regular battery, but this one is just a waste of space.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As mentioned in another review, my Samsung Note 4 battery was dying from too much frequent charging.   This time I was fortunate, I got a replacement.  I charged it to 60% with the cable, and the battery went flat and gave out on me within minutes.  There must be something wrong with the batteries that the Note 4 has.  But after the replacement battery was sent, the Note still doesn't charge.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a bad design, with several design flaws that I can't live with.   The design flaws include:  - The top-front button is difficult to press, especially on the smaller screen (I have a 2" laptop).   - A good deal of the design is done in chrome instead of silver.  -The speaker is placed on the bottom side of the device instead of above the screen.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great little speaker but the USB port is terrible for charging my phone or charging my tablet   I only use this for my iPhone   The speakers have a little too much bass for my tastes    The Sound:  I was very pleased with the sound, just as I am with a good HiFi or subwoofer.   A lot of electronic devices require a large amplifier to get the best sound quality, but not my phone.  When playing music, the sound comes through clear and tight without being overbearing.  I did have a few problems with the speaker, however.  First, the volume levels were slightly too loud for my use.  Secondly, the speaker is too small, and my iPhone can easily get in the way, resulting in some distortion.  Finally, my wife complained about the sound coming through the speakers.  After a week of using the earbuds for my phone, I changed to the full size headphones to remove the potential interference.  If you're interested in a good pair of headphones for your phone, the Beats SoloX are a great pair to consider.  The Bottom Line:  If your using your phone for music or podcasts, you'll enjoy listening to it through these earbud headphones.  For me, I find that I need a larger pair of earbuddies for using my smartphone for music.  They're great if you're trying to get a better sound quality for podcasts, but for audio for your device I would suggest another brand or pair of high quality headphones.  Overall:  This product is great for the price.  It's easy to use, and it can be hard to find good quality earboud headphones at such a low price point.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I bought a refurbished computer (the very same one from eBay). It came with a few issues. The power supply is not rated for 240v, so it cannot be used with the supplied power adapter. The display does not work well, and there is a strange buzzing/hissing sound when playing video games. The fan is very quiet when idle, but turns into a screeching whine when running full load (gaming, etc). The keyboard and mouse work fine, but I can't seem to get the system to boot up from the optical drive. The mouse scroll wheel doesn't move smoothly, so you have to use the arrow keys to scroll. The battery life is good, but that could just be because it is an old model with a bad fan. I had no problems at all with the power supply and the fan was quiet when running with the PSU. The only thing I can think of to be better is to buy an adapter for the 120v power supply so that you can plug it directly into a 120v wall outlet.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

This wireless headset has great sound quality, especially for the price.  But the audio quality is very bad because of the weak audio amp.

I can't believe you are still selling these crap tablets.  - Steve A. from St. Louis, MO   ( 5 out of 5) So, for the money, these are great! It is very easy to use. It has great battery life. You can use these for almost any purpose and are cheap enough to buy a lot more than you would expect! .  to be continued...   In other reviews:   The best tablet out there in my opinion ( 5 out. ) I have used one for a couple weeks now and it is so far a very good product. The only drawback is that the keyboard needs to be replaced once a year due to battery wear.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The key feature of this device is the sound. It is very good.   I would not use this with my wife unless she was at the same time.   It does what it was advertised to do. The battery life is great.  This will be my go to tool when I need to play music for the kids.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The computer is a complete failure. I paid the $100 MSRP for a system that would not start. I purchased a new one that has worked well for several months. My other computer has been very difficult to use. The monitor is a nice one, but it is so flimsy that it falls off often. The keyboard is very clunky and the trackball is a big fluke.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just bought the Apple Watch and I bought it because I had always wanted to have an iPhone with an Apple Watch. It's not the greatest.    However, I'm a sucker for the "Hey Siri" thing so I will say that I'm actually pretty happy with the watch so far.  I've been using it in the shower and I haven't found the notifications to be so bad that I want to go to the phone to get them.  However I'd have liked it if it had a screen like the iPod Touch   it looks more like a   iPhone   and I'm not sure that it's worth the $349 it'll cost me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery life is awful. You're going to need more than a day to charge your phone. I keep my phone at home with me, so charging the battery sucks and you're stuck with a dead phone.   I don't have the patience for this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    " I used my new Panasonic GF-W9000 for about 2 weeks. The last day, the battery went dead. The remote is not working properly and I tried to get on to the internet to see what's wrong. The unit does not have a USB port so the only other way of charging it is to have a laptop plugged into a powerbank. I thought this was too much of a hassle, but I will not be using this product any longer. Very poor design!  "
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First the device itself is ok, not the best, but good enough.   I purchased this item because the product specs claimed it would work as a digital camera, which is true but the quality of the pictures I got were not high quality (I am not an expert on this, but I would bet my life that it is the quality that has to do with how much is being sent to the camera).   This thing is so slow in capturing pictures and uploading them, it takes about 4 hours of just viewing the pictures and reading them, before I can even begin to analyze them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The "T2" is by far the worst I have used in years. The sound was excellent, the only problem I have had is that I have a stereo that is in a studio where the sound is mixed through the TV speakers, so the bass is cut off to the TV. You get more bass from my speakers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a NOOK Simple Touch last year for $40.   The touch screen wasn't very responsive, and I could not use the keyboard and I was forced to buy a $3 adapter to use the NOOK as a portable media reader.  My only good points are that it is easier to clean than a Kindle, and the buttons on the back are tactile and not just metal-ish.  I don't have a negative to give about my NOOK, it's a good reader, but it's just not for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I like this app, but the app is not designed for a tablet. I'm used to using a Windows 8 tablet, so the layout is different. I was using an iPad 2, and the buttons were all the same size and the screen was so tiny that it could barely see them. This app is a much better version of that tablet app because it has a larger screen. This would be great on a bigger iPad though. But I'm not a fan of this app on a tablet, I'll look for a solution. It was fun to try and put a game together, but for my purposes, I can live without it.  Developer Response  Sorry to hear you are disappointed with the app. We are working to fix the layout for tablets so that it can be used on all sizes of devices. Thanks for your comments and stay tuned for a future update to support all devices!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This watch is just a huge waste of time.   I really love the design, the function is nice.  It doesn't take up any space on your wrist when it is on.  I guess that is what is nice about it.  But the watch is useless.  To charge it, it takes three or four hours.  The battery life is just unacceptable for this price.  In fact, I have no idea why someone would buy this watch.  One day, it will stop working.  How is it so expensive for a non functional watch.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I used a wireless headset, I fell asleep within 15 minutes.   It's almost hard to believe that the headset wasn't made by a major wireless player like Apple, Samsung, Motorola, or Nokia, but a Canadian company that doesn't seem to be making headsets for anyone except a few niche, very specific use cases, such as those who play sports, who want to communicate with friends while running, who need to do their work while exercising, or who have no idea how to use voice or speech technology.  What's even worse is that the wireless headset is so poorly made that you can't really call it "smart" or "wireless" (since it's not really wireless).  I've bought a few products by other companies, and they all have features that are pretty much worthless for my needs, and these things have a better reputation than the Pioneer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First, I have a Nexus 4 and I've never used a USB keyboard. I bought this for my other tablet to replace the Nexus 10. This is a very good keyboard, it is very compact, and the size is perfect for my tablet.   However, I do have a couple of gripes:  Firstly, it doesn't come with the back cover; the one I ordered had a hole on the back (the hole didn't actually show up in the product picture)  I had to return it for the correct cover. This was the biggest problem for me, and I don't even have a nexus 10 with the same keyboard.  Secondly, the built in macro keys on the tablet are pretty useless:  The macro keys are not on the left side of the keys; the ones on the right side only let you move the cursor by 1 pixel in a direction. Also, the letters "C", "V", "S" don't show up when you use them.  Third, there is no way to use the left touch pad or the volume control at the same time:  I tried putting my keyboard on my tablet and putting my tablet on my desk and tried tapping the touch pad and volume control. It wouldn't work.  This is frustrating for me because I want a keyboard I can take with me to my desk.  And the keyboard was on clearance and the keyboard would fit, but this could be a different case altogether. Overall I am very happy with my purchase, even with the tiny problems.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I like the idea behind the smartwatch, but the watch itself does not do anything. It just displays an analog display of your steps. It has some useful information such as your heart rate and calories burned, but its not worth the price or the hassle of having to get a physical watch.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love the sound and it works good. It's the right size and looks nice. But it's no good for my job.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a KENWOOD digital audio player, but it has two issues: 1. The audio is too low, and I can't tell the difference between songs in the radio; 2. I found a couple of "random" clicks when listening to "Rocks Off", "I Was In Love With a Boy" and "All Your Way" in the "album only" modes. I think the player is just a cheap digital player with very mediocre audio quality.  Was this review helpful to you?  1 of 1 people found this review thoughtful. , September 29, 2012  Excellent! The only problem is that the USB stick comes with just two songs. The song is in an album mode, but in another mode the song does not play. A bit annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was not impressed with the performance of this keyboard. The software and the actual typing on this keyboard, it was not at all easy to use. I had to go through about 10 software programs to learn how to type. When I typed in a letter that was not capitalized, for example, I had trouble pressing the shift key at the right time to capitalize it. I also had to do the same thing for the uppercase letter and then press the shift. The computer was very slow to respond and was almost non-responsive to other people using it. The fact that it has to be put in sleep mode to save battery life is a bummer. I wish I could give it zero stars. If I had a bad computer that I can't use, I would probably return this keyboard and get a different one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this product to replace a broken remote that the previous owner couldn't get to work. This worked so good it was a miracle that it even connected. It wasn't so much the remote that didn't work but the fact that the cable that went to it had been destroyed in an accident and this new remote is so much easier to use. It does have one flaw in that it requires you to turn the power on to make the connection but that's not so big of a deal.  Rated 5 out of 5 by bbabcock from Works great, as it should, but, I'm getting old! It's my job to replace the remote control in all of the older cars and my only regret in buying this one is that I bought this at the same time as the remote, so I'm stuck on this one. But it works, and, in my opinion, is much easier on the hand than my previous one (which I still have). I have a 2002 GMC 1500, and I was really looking forward to this one, especially since it is so good. It has the power to do what the other one can do. I also have the AC adapter in case the power cord is a problem. If this doesn't work for me, I can always just use the old one!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item to install a new cable and did the initial set-up but there were a few issues when I went to connect the cable to the device. I tried several of the connections and after that the cable would not stay attached. I could not figure out why the cable was not connecting so I took a chance and tried a different one. After that, it finally connected and I got what I needed to.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great for those who like to tinker! This adapter is a very nice add-on, for those of us who enjoy tinkering around with electronics. I have a few of these, but had to replace my old one a few months ago due to being fried. The new one seems a bit more robust and more of a standard standard power-in style. I do have to say that the old one also seemed a little less durable, although it still worked fine (still plugged in and working fine at least). The original one was nice and simple, with just the right size wires. Sleek, simple design. The only negative for me is the fact that it is a different wire color, instead of being black. A few times, it would not fit into a socket and the connector would be very difficult to remove. Not a big deal, but a small issue.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My Sonico has 2 problems: The music is in the wrong place. Sometimes the music comes in the exact middle of the song. And it sounds just like some other Sonico's that I've heard before (like Mami-chan). I have the original and new music and I know this is a bad mistake since it's not even similar in sound quality. In a good way, the music should go with the mood of the show, which I'm not sure it does. Maybe it's just me, but I would be surprised if this would come as a shock to anyone, especially since I don't have a Sonico-shaped hole in my wall. The other problem is the voice acting, which is almost never audible. I really like this show, but if the voice actors want to improve their English and do a better job, it's worth a try.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have two problems with this. First, I think the size is great, but if I were to have my eyes out in public, I'd worry I'd get an eye infection.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's bad. It has a terrible user interface. It takes forever to calibrate and takes you a long time to calibrates. I had to go through three calibrators to get it to work. When you first start the device you have to calibritethe screen. It's not intuitive, the device itself has to be calibrated before the screen is set. It is very slow to get to the screen. There is no "turn on" for the screen on/off switch. I got tired of looking through the manual to figure it out, and having it calibrate my screen. The unit takes forever and I spent a lot of time trying to find things to do with my iPad. It does come with a charger but it takes forever when it's plugged in to charge it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this product because it has a built in battery which has been great for the last few years.   But one day it gave out and now it isn't charging at all.  My phone is the only phone that I use on a daily basis so I really appreciate that the phone still has a battery when I go out to dinner on a weekend.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace a defective and very expensive Sony VAIO laptop. The design was a hit with me as I am not one to like touch sensitive things and this seemed to do the job. However, I have only had it a week and the batteries are not really getting good use. The batteries are only two days old and they last a maximum of four hours with heavy use. I'm also having to charge the battery more often than I'd like because of the low charging rate. If you want to have a touch screen tablet on the go, this will work just fine. If a touchpad would have been better, I would have stuck with Sony instead.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First the good:  The screen is clear. It's bright, clear and easy to read. It is easy to hold up to the glare of an overcast day. The back lit button is bright and works well. The screen can be difficult to see in low light. But, the good is a short battery life that leaves the device dead in 2-3 hours.   The bad:  This thing is a monster.  The back facing camera takes poor pictures. But it also takes great ones.  In contrast, the front facing camera on the Droid X is terrible. I can't use my phone in low or dark light and it gives me no useful information other than where it is. The Droid X also takes a really long time to charge.  While the X has great cameras and features for the price, I wouldn't hesitate to get a cheap Android phone instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - I've had it for about a month now and its been running flawlessly. I use it to charge my iPhone when i go to sleep so i can check it during the day. The phone comes with a cable and some usb cables. The only thing I have really got to complain about is that it doesn't charge in the same way that other chargers do. It's much easier to charge this one from my computer instead of from my car or hotel charger.  It's good, but could use a little improvement:  (0/10)   A bit difficult to plug in, and it is very short. I haven't tested any games or use any other apps on it, and even if it was connected to a TV or monitor, the battery life doesn't seem much better than what i can get with my iPhone charger. Maybe because i use my iPhone most, but for the price, it should have better charging capabilities and better screen quality. - (0.5/10, not a bad product)    It's a good USB charger. Its a little too short for the iPhone 5s, but otherwise, it's good. I would prefer it to have the "dongle" but for it to be a USB charger, you're just paying for the USB cable. A bit pricey:  - (4/10   It's way more expensive than I expected. I'm using my phone most, so it's better to charge it with the charger than to try to go through a micro USB cable to charge the phone. - (0,5/5)  A little pricey. You should be able to find it on sale for less than $10. Good Charger:  (5/7)  - It's good charger, but if you already have a wall charger or a USB 3.0 device that you charge with, I don't think it's a bad charger. It is just not as powerful as the ones I've tested with the iPhone. This could be due to the fact that it has a 5 volt USB charger adapter, but I don' t know if it's just a bad iPhone charger or if its using a crappy iPhone USB adapter. This would be a good charger if you only have one wall adapter, or if you want to use your USB cable and a wall adapter at the same time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard on this phone is awful. The keys don't have the same bounce as the others on this model. There is a lot of slop on the keys especially compared to the others, and typing is a bit sluggish. I didn't like the design of the keyboard either, I had to take it apart to clean up the rubber dust and grease buildup. This doesn't seem like the worst design of keyboards you can buy, but it doesn't fit me as well as some of the others. This is a great phone for your pocket, I got it for $150 for the 32GB model which is great for my family of 4. However, when the price drops to $110, this phone might not be worth the money to you, even if it isn't as bad as the other models.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you have an issue with the remote, it's the buttons. They have been made smaller in the past, but they feel small and rough in the remote and just don't work the way they should. I was using the same one until my mom finally figured out how to use them, but the buttons are just too small and mushy to really get a reliable response. And it doesn't help that they are all very similar. One is used for power, the other one for volume. It makes me feel like I'm not doing anything right. If you want something cheap, you should go with a bluetooth remote instead. Also, while the battery is good (I use it for 20 minutes at a time), it doesn´t last nearly as long as a good bluetooth device.   The speakers are the real plus point of this unit. They are just the right size for a TV. I can't say that I have used them, since I've used my sound bar for my TV but my friend who does television has a sound bar and he liked it too. I wouldn't consider this a good TV speaker if it wasn't a good sound bar. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It would be great if I could buy this product at any electronic outlet for $19.95. It's cheap and works fine. I've used it at the gas station to use my smartphone. I bought the cheap plastic case just to protect the unit from being scratched. The bottom is cracked on the front but the case doesn't provide a proper seal to prevent moisture. The phone will sometimes fall out of the case when it gets wet, but I have a $20 dongle that provides a seal. Overall, I'm glad to have this for $4.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been looking for this since I got my iPhone. The price is right and the product is great. I used the remote to find my phone, the app works well, and it is the only thing I can think of on the market that would work like this. The problem is that the app is extremely buggy and not intuitive at all.   If it weren't for my wife telling me to have the app work in other countries, I would buy this and use it all the time, but with all the things going on in the app I wouldn't recommend buying.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main problem with the T1 is that it takes far too long to charge from a dead USB port. If you have a large laptop and you want to save some money, then you might get this. Otherwise, I would recommend looking elsewhere.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is one of the few things on my phone that is actually not usable. I have tried to use it on my   to make it more stable and not have this wobble. It has no purpose but to show the screen. This is the last thing you need on a phone. I've already gotten rid of mine.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product is not made in the USA and cannot be expected to have all of the features of a high-end US cell phone.   It does not have a camera or a microphone.  Its battery life is also very short.  I have had this for 2 days.  The only useful feature is the clock.  It is very hard to turn off because of the light on the front. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these because my first one, an RCA to TRS converter, broke.   It worked well in the beginning, but after that, it went to "hold-up" mode.  When I put more than four channels of audio into the converter, it would not transfer the audio.  I had to use a very low level of the stereo cable to power the converter and re-sync it.  This is my second one and I will only purchase this product when I need to use four or more channels of stereo audio.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this as a gift for my sister. She is the most picky and picky person when it comes to electronics, but she fell in love with this device and has never stopped using it. The device is great in theory and good in practice. Unfortunately, my device has been plagued with hardware problems. I'm disappointed with this purchase.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a great little device for using on the go, but I wish I could do this with a normal phone. I use this on my Droid Razr, a great phone in it's own right. When I want to make a phone call, I can use this, as the camera, microphone, and GPS work great. But, the voice dialing is awful, and I have to wait a few seconds for the call to start. Also, when I want my voice mail, I have a really bad time picking up the call. I can dial in, get it recorded on my computer, and then dial back in using a different phone. But the Droid Razrs "bumpers" let me hear and understand everything on my voice call, but the Droid phones "bumped" make it sound like I'm doing a bad job of picking up. So, unless I want people to hear me talking, this is a pretty big letdown. I do find myself using this when I'm away from home, and want to use a phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's just bad.  I bought two of these for my office because I want to control my computer with a simple remote and all I got was a piece of junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't know if it's because I own two other Apple devices that work great together or if it is just that I have had some issues with this. I bought a new unit after getting tired of using my old one so I figured I'd try the new Apple TV (a few years old) which works great. I had an issue with the volume controls on this unit not working right away. I'm not sure what the issue was. I did some research online and there is a possibility that the volume knob may have been installed incorrectly. It's a small thing and the Apple TV was purchased after my experience with this unit so I would assume the unit itself is more likely to be faulty. I got the newer model and was so pleased with the quality of the screen and its ability to get and stream movies with no buffering that I decided to keep it even though I have the old Apple TV.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this phone a month ago and it is so slow! It took about half a year for it to get my call to my husband who is now on an account for the first time. I called to ask for my money back but they said they cannot give me a refund because they can't do anything about the slow phone because they cannot tell me that it is not working!   It is a very poor value for what you pay!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item a few years ago, to be honest I was really looking forward to using the device. I love the sound of a sine wave and I love that it has a pulse wave input. It has been one of my top three electronics purchases. The device, however, has failed completely. After several years I can't get it to work anymore. I have tried hard to reset the device and make it work, but still can't find the button that turns it on and off. I hope to find a replacement, but it would be nice if they would offer a warranty on these.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device is a good device. There is no reason not to buy it.   Unfortunately the only good thing that I can say is the wireless range. It is just enough for my wireless router but is still not good.   Rated 3 out of 5 by Mark from OK I'm sure other reviews are about the same thing, but I have the same problem. I have a wireless access point on my home network. When I try to access the web, the web page appears to be loading but the connection is non-functional. When it does respond I can only browse pages. I can use the Internet to download an image but the computer doesn't respond to the download and the image file doesn't save. Also the wireless router is not compatible with this device, I can't connect to the router using a software program. The only thing I can think of is that the wireless chipset on this device doesn't work with the wireless access points. The wireless range is good. I'm happy that I bought this.  Review of DRZ400v3 - August 2014 I was extremely excited when I saw that DRZ was starting to develop a new line of wireless routers, and I can tell you that the new line is very promising. This one has the ability to pass your home network (without installing a wireless hub) directly from your home router, as well as connecting to a local WPA2 network. This was not a product that I expected to be worth the extra cost, but it appears that this was a good deal at the time it was sold. It's not very powerful, but for its size and size of the router, it works just fine. The software is not a fan of this device and, even when I manually configure a wireless connection (e.g., connect via a mobile broadband access point), it's still too slow to use for most users. The fact that this device isn't wireless is also disappointing to me. I had high expectations for this product. I'll have to consider this a "meh" product and not recommend it to anyone. - February 2014  A little too large for a HTPC I've been using a Dell Mini-ITX HTPC (1TB drive) since mid-2011 and have had it powered by this model of the DSSD. The previous model was an older model with an older (more expensive) wireless chipset. I needed a larger capacity HTPC to replace
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a cheap device. The audio comes in distorted, the screen is not large enough to read and the buttons are very small.   I got this in hopes that it would be a cheap little gadget that is able to run games.  This device is not for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a shame that the device has been discontinued for the good of all of us.   The fact that this is a complete failure from Apple is outrageous.  The price is outrageous, and the product itself is an obvious ripoff.  I'll be giving them a miss next time I'm in the market for a phone.     I bought two and neither worked as advertised, the one I bought did not even make the cell connection. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I'm a newbie to electronic devices, and i purchased a new phone today.   It works good.  The only problem is that the phone is extremely weak.  It won't charge on 2.4Ghz.  I can't wait to get another phone, but this one is just way too old and weak for my needs. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The "R" button toggles between the wireless and wired networks. The "1" button will connect you to a known wifi network. The device itself, while usable and powerful, lacks the functionality and flexibility of the "Wifi Connect" module which is a part of the Etekcity package. The only thing missing is the option to "upgrade" the firmware to an official firmware. Otherwise this is a great device for the price.    5 out of 5 Great little device! This unit can only be called an "eTekcity" product because of the etekcity logo on it's face. I am using this to do "Home Security" and have had a few issues since it's release. One of the first things I did after hooking this up was to switch from my existing "Netgear" wireless access point to this unit. I also wanted to switch my network back to my "Netgig" connection with WPA2. I found the unit to be a bit slower then my " Netgear " as well as some of the other "e-cigs" on the market. I have since replaced the unit with a "Astro-Lite" brand unit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the device with a hope for great sound, only to have my high end sound quality deteriorate from the first day using it. I have now thrown my device out and am looking for a replacement.   The product description was accurate, I was really hoping for a device that would be much better than the average $80-$100 soundbars I have bought over the years but this one was just mediocre, for a good price that's a bit of a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this unit thinking it was a high quality item but it has so many flaws.  1. The power indicator on the display is VERY faint.  I have to look carefully at the power indicator to see if the unit is on.  2. This thing has a loud fan that is blowing across your desk while the units power indicator is on!  The only other device on my desk that has a fan was a vacuum cleaner that also had a fan on it.  This is very loud and makes a horrible buzzing noise.  The unit needs a better built.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of my biggest mistakes with my current computer is the fact that I did not upgrade to Windows 8.   I am a big fan of both Linux and Windows, and have been for several years now, but I did buy the HP EliteBook laptop and the Windows 8 is a complete and total pain in the a**.  This is because the Windows is locked down by the manufacturer to the point that it is nearly impossible to use other operating systems than Windows on it (Windows 7, even though I want it to be supported).  It is possible to install any version of Linux such as Ubuntu, but it takes forever, and I can't really say that it's worth the hassle, considering the price I paid for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It would be very hard to replace this monitor. It doesn't get the job done. You can't get it to get close to 4 ms response time. The response time is not too bad on the slow modes and about average on the fast modes. This was a bad purchase because I've read so many good reviews about this monitor, but my experience with it is a big disappointment. I was expecting a 4 ms average response time with no blurriness or pixelization. If the average response times were about 4 ms then a 4 mHz refresh rate would mean the monitor was at least 80 fps or at least 25 mHz. It's not. It only offers 24 fps, which is less than half of the refresh rate of any normal computer monitor. In my opinion, this is a wasted money.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery charge lasts about an hour but the screen is so small the video can't be watched.   I gave it a 1 star because the camera can be useful but it's a useless device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the phone with a big expectation that it would work, but the problem is with the phone, not the box. I have had a number of different phones, including cellphones, and am very frustrated by this. There is no way to turn the phone off. I was able to use it for about 5 minutes by turning off the phone. I've been talking for nearly 2 hours and there is no dial tone or other message. The box will not open by itself, so I have to break it open. That's not very convenient. When you open it the phone is not in the box, but there is a piece of tape on the back of the phone which you have to cut. And there is something like 25 pages of instructions about how to install the phone inside the box without using the battery. I got it from a friend, and I don't want to return it to the store. I'm still waiting to see what this phone is all about.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In all honesty I was skeptical about this phone and all the reviews were about how bad it is. Turns out the people who wrote those reviews were the exact same ones who complained about the iPhone, so I was impressed. The only thing I don't like about this device is that it's so slow when it comes to taking pictures. And even though I purchased a high quality phone, it still doesn't have a good camera. For a phone to have great camera is amazing. However, the other reviews were completely true. You can barely use the phone with the camera on and you have to hold it in one hand like a small tripod to take a picture.   There's also one other problem with this phone, that can only be called "buggy". When you plug it in, the lights stay on for 5 seconds and then the lights turn off. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just received my new   Apple   iMac   in the mail.   It is very sleek. The case is very durable. It is heavy. I like the   buttons that are easily accessible in the lower left hand corner.  I love that it has the flash drive that is always by my bedside,   but the buttons that I don't use,  like volume and mute, are hard to find. I have read reviews about the speakers.  This is an excellent   value and a great looking   computer.  A couple of minor things would be that the  computer   drive   has a large plastic disk and that it   comes with   no power adapter.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm using my phone like a radio. I'm a music producer who likes to write tunes with vocals, and this phone works just fine. But the problem is, when I'm on the bus going from work to my apartment, I sometimes forget to bring my phone. It gets lost. And I don't want to go searching for it every time I'm in a new area. This phone is great in the beginning. But when you have to carry it with you everywhere? That's when I start to regret buying this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only problem I have with the T30 is that you need to power it up manually when you first open the box because the button you use for that is not a traditional button. The buttons are somewhat different. It is very convenient that this does not have to be done, but I wish I had gotten this unit when it was on sale. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product doesn't work as well as it should.   A friend of mine is a teacher and this laptop is so big that he has to sit on the edge of his seat to work on it.  He's also very picky about what he uses his computer for and isn't a fan of having to use the mouse.  The battery has some problems, one time he plugged the batteries in they just died.  If I could get this product for under $250 I would use it everyday.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a fantastic device. The best.   It is not the cheapest and the build quality isn't great. But it is super light, the controls are very intuitive and it's a lot of fun.  The batteries last a long time so the battery life doesn't really get much better. The main drawback is that the device isn't rechargeable.  You can buy a USB hub to extend the battery capacity and you can buy an external power source, but it still isn't a very good battery life system.  For what it is, I would recommend this device over any of the other "cheap" options. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I can't seem to get this product to turn on...I have had it for a month now and can't get it to turn off or it gets too hot and causes all sorts of trouble.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      I have had two of these little monsters for about 3 years now. I bought them as a joke when I was browsing the local electronics stores and decided to look around the "big box" stores.   They were selling them for about $50. I paid $45 for one, but still got a great deal!   The only downside to them is that they are loud and the battery life is pretty short...   It doesn't take long for you to go crazy using them for the whole day , but they are awesome!  I recommend them !
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned this product for about a year now.   My last one died and i wanted another.  It doesn't seem that the battery life is anything special, but i don't have much use for a tablet.  i bought this so i could read my email on my computer.  If it weren't for this i would have had to buy a new one from my dealer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's a little on the cheap side, but I'm not the type to pay top dollar for a phone.   The best part of the price though is that I was able to purchase a different model and a better screen.  I'm really happy with my decision to purchase this instead of another Samsung product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is so bad. I can't even use it and I use my iPad so badly! It's not even as good as the iPod Touch but not so bad to use.  "I love my Kindle, but my wife doesn't"   I can honestly say that my wife didn't like me buying the Kindle. But at $200 for a book, it was a good price and I bought it so that I could have the iPad as an entertainment device. Now, I'm not sure what's so bad about reading an eBook on an iPad, but that's why I had to try out the Kindle (and the Kindle is great). I was very impressed with the quality of the content. This is an excellent reader and a great value! I think I'll spend another $200 on another Kindle or my iPad. The only problem I have is that I'm unable to use a PC or laptop (I have a Mac) while traveling. I have the Kindle app and the tablet. If I had an iPad with the app, it would be perfect. However, the iPad does not have a keyboard and the app is very small and has no keyboard support. And that's the only thing that bothers me about this book. I bought this as a gift for my mother, but she didn't buy a Kindle. I'm going to use my Kindle for reading but if I'm going out to eat I'm using my iPad (unless I'm on the phone). It's really great for reading on the go, and it's nice to have a Kindle with you when you're traveling!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound was good, the volume was good. The control didn't seem to work well and the screen kept moving around. I ended up using my laptop because of that.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Nice and simple I like the look of this little device. It has been working very well for me. I use the volume controls on the bottom of it to adjust the volume and I set it up so that all the buttons are on one side of the unit. You can adjust the sensitivity on this little unit as well. A really simple device for the price that is very user friendly. I highly recommend it to people who are looking for a decent sound system.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These things need to be re-thought as they aren't reliable at all. I have a Sony A6300 with a very bad screen (even after it's been unplugged for a week), and a very slow touchpad. This device is the least stable I've ever had in my life. Even after charging it overnight it starts up randomly. I'm hoping for a firmware update that will solve these issues. I'll likely have to replace my older machine.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This device is a total nightmare and the price just blows it away!   The only way I get work done on my computer is to use the remote for the PC (my daughter has a desktop PC that she's got for a couple years) so I decided to purchase the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) and a wireless keyboard/mouse set (no USB device is included but the keyboard/mice are available). I've had the RDC since around Oct. 2012. I've used it to log into my office computer (for work) and to log on to my iPad, but this is the first time I've been able to access the internet from the tablet, which is the problem. I'm able to type on the iPad and send text messages, but the RDP doesn't have enough bandwidth to receive/send any text or other data over the Internet. Also, the Remote Display (also available) allows me to view my desktop computer from a phone, but only through a separate app on my phone.   I'm extremely disappointed in this device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought two sets of these to replace the battery/charger for my old Sony camcorder. I was amazed at the ease of installation and the reliability. I also have an old Sony SLT-A77 which I have found more reliable and longer lasting. The first couple of days I used it, the camera would be in the middle of a movie and would turn off. I turned it on again, it would turn on and continue to operate. It had only run about 1.5 hours, but had worked fine since. I do wish I had used the camera as a camcord recorder instead, though.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received this as a gift, but it was so loud that I wasn't even able to listen to the content.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this item, it looked like a good deal and was in stock. The only thing bad about this item is that you have to get a new battery every six months (but you only get about four) and the phone has a tiny screen. My phone is the same model as the one that came with it, so that's not much of an issue for me. But I do think it's really ugly and the quality of the display is horrible. But the device has its good points and I like that it does vibrate, and it has the ability to do video calls. It's just not worth paying $250 for something that's just a little worse than an old flip phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had an issue with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.5 and it would not start. I did some research, and it turns out that the issue is a manufacturing defect. It seems to be a common problem with Samsung devices. I had my Tab 2, 3, and 4 and the only thing that came up was that they all had the same issue. I also received a replacement, but I'm not so happy about the quality of the replacement. The tab 2.0 has no back button and doesn't show the time in any color.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had a new Samsung smart phone for a few weeks and like to use it on the go so when the device started to turn itself on randomly I assumed that it had become a "no-wake" device. The battery life was great until a week and a half ago when I found that the speaker was "ringing" every time the screen went black. I thought that I had just broken the phone but upon trying to remove the battery I found several small dents in the plastic surrounding the battery. I took it back to the store to have it replaced but was told that this was just normal wear. I have to admit that the phone is nice and I enjoy using it but I was hoping that it would have been better if it was manufactured better. I wouldn't recommend this device to anyone unless you are willing to accept that your smart phone will be broken down at some point in your lifetime.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the "Sleek" as an aftermarket upgrade for my iPod Nano. The new one works fine for me, but the "old" one isn't bad at all. I like the "new" one because it has the same size as the original iPod Nano but has much better screen than the old iPod Nano screen. My problem is that it doesn't have a volume knob, which is annoying as I was looking for something to replace the Nano's volume knob. I was also hoping to replace both the Nano and the new iPod Mini as well as upgrading to a Nano that is larger than the nano's screen (larger than a paperback book).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product is great and the quality is awesome. However, the power adapter does not fit the device and the power cable is extremely short. The manufacturer should really consider making a longer cable.  My favorite keyboard - even better than my PC!   I have two Apple computers and I use a keyboard with a lot of key travel on my MacBook Pro and my iMac. I was very worried when I saw that Apple was discontinuing the key-travel and I am sad to say that I was right!  Excellent product   A friend bought one of these keyboards and I wanted one to keep for my own use. I think I have seen them advertised at many web stores and am glad that I ordered mine from this website. The keyboard is very solid and the switches are great. I can type on it with one hand.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen is small (1.7 inches) and the keys are a little too big for my thumb. When using the touch pad, I have to tap with two fingers to get it to function properly. Also, the screen does not seem to be calibrated so that it accurately shows the lettering on my screen.      A little annoying is the fact that they make me press the buttons on my tablet to select items and then press them again when I'm done to go back to the previous item.  I have three laptops and two tablets. It's my main computer and the quality of my devices is very comparable.      I've been a big fan of Microsoft's products ever since I got Windows NT 3.1.  I also bought an Office 98 Workstations Edition PC, but unfortunately, the quality is not that good. I have not been able to get good quality images out of it, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The unit was very light, which was surprising because the price was higher than I had expected. I have been using a laptop for some time and now wish I had bought an iBook and avoided using a desktop. It had problems with the Windows software. I did not know there were so many other options. When it booted into the Mac OS the screen went blank, so I turned it off and restarted the machine again. I had to go through this again and the problem was still there. It also seems to have a problem booting and closing programs. This is a shame because it was my second system I had installed on the same machine. The computer's battery life seems terrible. When I turned the computer off the screen turned off, which I had not noticed before. This problem happened a few times. The battery is not easily replaceable. The keyboard and mouse seem to be made of flimsy materials. There is a light in the front of the computer but it is hard to see. The unit is light, so as I had suspected, I would not recommend it to anyone.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: sb-tech
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have two of these products and they just dont get any better than these. I am not sure what the difference is between these and the cheaper model, but they are just too light to stand by your side at all. I used to use these when I was a pro tennis player. The tennis balls on these things get so hot you could fry them by taking them off. I just get them and keep them for the little plastic parts.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for the kids as a tool to help them with their math problems. It's a good product but the little ball that you put in to help move the dots, was very sticky. Not a problem for me as I just wiped it down but I would not buy it again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have the new iphone 6.   It has some good features, but it is not as good as the iphones i used in the past.  It doesn't have as many features as the i phone 4 or 5, and it is a little slower.  A lot of people say it is slow.  The iphons will not charge on the lightning port.  Also iphonedes have a very bad battery life.  When I plug it into the USB port, it just dies.  I would be able to get 4 hours of use if I could charge it, but I have to charge it every night because my battery doesn't last much.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The product is great and very convenient. It came with the needed cables, but the one that came with it had to be changed because the one I got was not made of the same material (it's just plastic). It's easy to set up, has no issues at all, and is very secure. The only issue I had is that my iPhone didn't want to work, and there were other people around so it didn't look as though it was being affected (it didn't sound out of tune, it only made a little "tuff" noise and I tried to turn it off and on multiple times and it just refused to turn off). It was almost as if the iPhone was just having a bad day.  It is very good, but it is not the same. 1 of 1 found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I think they are overpriced. I think you are better off spending the extra money for something better (if that makes any sense). I have used them for a few years.   They are very loud.  Very annoying.  If you buy them with the headphones, it's like having a loud TV in the background.  The volume and volume changes are ridiculous.  I am not sure if these are made to go with these type of headphones (because these are really bad), but it's too bad that they are not made for this purpose.  This is the only downside that I found.  These are expensive and I can see how people would want them. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It would have been better if it was made in Europe as well, I got the model number for this as an EFX (European) but it was not in stock as it is in the US. The batteries are great quality but the quality of the battery is not the same as what I would buy from LG. I would definitely buy from an American company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is a very good product but not worth the $$ It's very cheap and i was not impressed.   In the first place, when i bought this, i already had an old keyboard and had used the one this had on it.  I would recommend against buying this.  The only good thing is that you can make one with this, but you're going to have to spend the same amount or more on the real deal.    This keyboard is not very good, so you have to buy a real keyboard if you want to use it

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I have been looking for the perfect wireless earbud for the past 6 years. I have been searching on all sorts of forums and trying to buy one with every brand of wired earbuds. I finally went back and bought the Zik 3.0. It's a good fit. It was comfortable to wear. I just wish it had the same sound quality as the other wireless earphones I have purchased and been disappointed. I had my Zik 2.0 for 3 years now and I'm very satisfied with the sound quality.  This product is a definite improvement over other wireless buds I've used over the years. If you want a really good wireless earphone, you will definitely need the ZIK 3.2 or the 3.5.   Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Wednesday, January 24, 2016  Great wireless ear buds  by David in New York, NY  Pros: Great sound quality  Cons: Only have two so far  Review: These earbubs are good and I like the fact that the volume is adjustable for each ear. I bought a pair for my daughter who has had other wireless headphones in the past. She loves them too. She's not big on traditional headphones. She thinks they're too light. This is a good product and I would recommend it to others.  with these i just got my daughter one and she loves it  Was This Review Helpful-I Recommend? Yes
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed about this was that it doesn't sound great.   I get a little bit of the high and low frequencies, but it sounds very poor for electronic music.  Also, the speaker is really low on the highs.  My other headphones do not have a low-end in the top 30%.  This is not an inexpensive headphone, so I expected much more than this.  I don't think I would recommend this over other headphones, though.   Style of Music:  There's not much to say about the style of music I'm most familiar with-- I'm the type of guy who like to listen to rock and pop. This does not do much to broaden my horizons, though, and I still wouldn't call this a "high end" headphone.  The bass is not very deep or tight, but the mids are much more balanced.  If I have to put down any of the headphones I own, it's probably this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a fine product with a very well designed case.   For an electronic device this is a very good option.   Review of DJI Phantom 3 Professional Quadcopter with Phantom 3 Advanced Vision Goggles:  I wanted to preface this review by saying I'm a long time DJI customer who has owned a lot of their products.  I purchased this Quadcopters as I knew of the advanced vision feature and was concerned that there was no way to integrate a Gopro and the Phantom 3 without going all DIY.  The Gopros are very compact and allow you to easily hold the camera on top of your head, or even strapped on with an attached arm.  It took a while to figure out how to attach the arm to the quadcopter and how to get a good mount in the right place.  My only problem is that I wish they could have included a gopro arm extension cable.  For me the camera and gopros work great together and the arm can be clipped on to the base of the gopron or attached via a gimbal for the Phantom.  Overall a good product and I would definitely recommend it to friends and family. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an overpriced junk box. If it came with a working USB charging cable (not included), I could easily get 10 hours of use out of this thing (even while charging it). The power adapter is extremely overpriced, and is not actually the charger, but rather the USB cable that connects the power adapter and the phone. I paid $6 for a USB power adapter that only lasts two hours of usage before it runs out. I had to pay $9 to get a new charger for the phone ($5 more, but a much better quality product). The charger itself is about as good as it gets, if not better, for the price. It was the only thing that would charge the phone quickly while connected to an outlet. I was able to download my favorite game while still using the phone (the phone has no app to download). The charging time is much better than the charging on my old phone, and the quality of the cable is much, much better (a couple weeks ago, my iPhone 5 still had poor battery life even with a $1 USB power cable). The only reason this box would not be a 5-star rating is because it can be hard to get the power cord (with the cable plugged in) in and out of the box without breaking it (especially with the power cable plugged into the wall and the port in the front of the case plugged in). Overall, if you don't need an external charger, this is a good value.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You would have never heard of the Fiducial brand of earplugs before.   They came in an unmarked envelope.  The box was so small I thought it was a junk item.  They are extremely soft.  My ears are aching.  One of the soft earpluggies was already broken in (after only 5 minutes of wear).  The soft ear plugs did not work well in this situation and I have tried others from the FIDU company.  This is my first purchase from Fidu. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen is flaky (not to mention its really hard to turn a dial without it falling off), the power button doesn't work, the camera works great for my needs, and the case itself is very cool but not practical.    Best keyboard:  I had to upgrade my old keyboard to an external USB/USB-C with a USB-C to HDMI converter to be able to charge and use the tablet at the same time.  This is awesome!   A little on the pricey side, but a must for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    " My first one did not have the problem it was suppose to. I ended up having to get one with a working camera and this one works fine. It is very simple to set up and doesn't take up a lot of room."  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item is extremely flimsy and I was only able to use it for a few weeks, at which time the battery ran down.   It is also only 1 amp, so it will not last as long as your standard power supply (like a wall adapter).   Another negative is that the USB port is a bit hard to find when you plug it in, but that's probably a small price to pay for not having to worry about trying to find the correct USB plug. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a very expensive "dumb" device for the price you pay. I own a K10 and a K20 and I can say this only gives a "thumbs up" to K20. It takes several seconds to change the video out from the built-in card. Then it is back to the menu to do a video update. The menu does not have any explanation of what each setting does.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this monitor as a replacement for my Samsung 25inch plasma. The quality and build quality were excellent. The picture quality on a big screen is not really good. It's like the picture is so far behind that you can't see the difference. The only thing that keeps me from giving this a 1 star is because of the monitor not being a plasma. That means you can still use that expensive plasma to play games. This monitor doesn't have that option so you need to go out and buy a plasma or get a monitor that does have it. Otherwise, a solid monitor for the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After using this product for over a month, I have to say it's been a letdown. It has never worked for me. I have tried resetting my phone, turning it off and back on multiple times without a single successful reset. It will not reboot without making a boot loop. The screen is always on when it shouldn't be.   It does have a built in flashlight but it has no batteries.  It will only last 4-5 hours before it shuts off on you. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So, I bought this item to do my research on an electric toothbrush. The product came in a little package which contained a brush, a lanyard, a cleaning brush, and an instruction booklet. The brush did not seem to be made of a good quality brush like in the picture on the box. The lanyards are only good for hanging them from a keychain but not for storing them. There are no instructions on how to use the brush. I also found a few other negative reviews on here that have a better experience with this brush:   This is a fine quality brush. It has been used and abused for many years and it works just fine. The handle will get dirty over time but its still a quality product. The "scent" is mild. I have a lot of other brushes that have more "sounds" or "sparkles" but this one doesn't.  Best Brush EVER  By: Andrew S. on 06/14/2016   I had no idea just how much I love this toothbrush - it cleans and soothes my mouth well - it is not too abrasive but not too gentle either. It's easy to keep clean when you brush - I used to have to put some toothpaste in to get it clean, but now I don't have to. The price is excellent too - it lasts a long time, is easy to use and I'm still a little in the process of switching to electric. I haven't been able to test the suction to be sure but I don' t think it's bad.   A huge plus: the brush is waterproof and washable. It keeps me from needing to put toothpaste on my brush.  in short, this brush is a wonderful value, I wouldn't buy it any other way.  ...  ( 4 out of 5) Excellent!  Read all our positive reviews!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I ordered a laptop from B&H online that was out of stock, so I waited to pick it up in store and I am VERY disappointed. The display quality and brightness were not great and there were some weird lines and artifacts on the screen. I thought it might be a power issue since I have a battery powered computer (in the office) and no problems, but the machine would go to sleep with just a few clicks.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm not going to rate this on its technical specs because it's a shitty, cheap, shitty thing.   When the batteries are dead, you need a new phone because there are no replacements in the box, the device's very thin, and the display is bad and looks horrible when it doesn't work.  You can take it out of the box and put it to your ear, but it won't work well.  There are better phones out there that aren't this awful, and are much more expensive, but don't bother, because they're a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i bought this i had only heard of the first one, the first in the new generation, that is, that it is good.   It took only 20 minutes to install, and i was up and running on the second day.  It has an auto shut-off, so there is no worry of it not shutting off.  But the sound is really bad in comparison to my old amp,  It really makes the sound so much tinny and distant.  I have tried everything to improve the sound, but nothing i could find makes it sound any better.  The only thing i can do is use my old poweramp i have from the seventies, it works perfectly fine.  In comparison the new one is a failure.  Don't waste your money on this device.  (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)  Rated 5 out of 5 by LuluCali from So far this is my favorite battery powered subwoofer. I've owned two of them now, and the first is a bit larger than the others, the 2nd one is smaller and lighter. The sub gets louder and crisper, the room is fuller and more open. I use them for rock, pop, blues and old school. They both sound fantastic.  Customer Testimonials
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You have no idea what a pain in the *** this is, and that's without the fact that you have to keep getting these in the mail, and keep changing batteries on the same battery (which is even worse).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is really annoying that after you put in your PIN and get a good response, the message changes, and it now sends a "please change your PIN" instead of the normal "Please enter your PIN..." message. Then the company says you have to call the company to fix the problem because they can't "get in touch with you to resolve your problem" (or something to that effect). I've been calling the company's support number several times to get this fixed, and no one has gotten back to me.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Thursday, July 31, 2010  Nice device  by Sean from Denton TX USA  Pros: Easy to use, inexpensive  Cons: No instructions included  Review: I used this to unlock my laptop, which is a Toshiba. I had no problems.  the only thing I can say is to put your PIN in and do not use the "key" option (it has nothing to do with it).  i got this from an office supply store (not a laptop store) and used the instructions included. I could not believe how easy it was to use the PIN.  a lot of users seem to not realize that it should not be the PIN that gets sent in, but the key.  The instructions are pretty basic. But I have used other products where the key option is always the right one. This is a good product and is much cheaper than buying a new computer.  it took less than 30 seconds, no fumbling around or trying to find the right key. I wish all the companies would print the right instructions on their devices so you do not have to read and try and remember a million different keys.    Was This Review Helpful No / NoThanks
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen is very nice and the sound is okay. There are other models on the market that come with a larger screen. There is not enough room for a phone and a camera at the same time on the front of the unit. This model has the largest screen and the best sound. But, this device does not have enough features for me. I love the ability to play games like Pokemon or Angry Birds but I do not use it for them often enough. I bought this just to get a phone, but I would not get this again because I could not use the speaker as a phone or camera at one time.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The touch screen screen is very sensitive and the buttons too sensitive and they are not really comfortable to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the unit to replace my old one (a Sony Vaio) and I would have to say the Vaio is a lot better and a lot cheaper. However, the touch screen is not as sensitive as it used to be, especially for the price. The audio is ok but doesn't sound like a proper sound bar (like a Sony) so I have to turn up the sound levels. The keyboard is fine but it is really hard to change the font (I was told it was impossible) and then I had to go to a store to buy a replacement keyboard. I am still using the Vaios but I won't buy another one from here because of the issues with the touch screens. The sound quality is also really bad. I was told that the earpiece is a special design but it has no earpiece and it sounds horrible. It is a really bad experience. Also, the keyboard isn't really a special keyboard, its just a normal keyboard. Overall, I'm not sure if this will be worth the money, because the VaIO is so much cheaper.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing that I can say about the electronic device is that it is great for the price but that is not the reason why I am giving it a negative rating. The problem is the way the unit works; the light is great and gives an excellent picture of what you are doing and where your hands are, but the way it works is if you try to turn the light on and off it will lock in a position that makes it extremely difficult to turn it off. Not only that, but after a couple of months of use the light will only light for about 5 seconds before it goes out. I was able to get a replacement unit and it works much better now but I am still on my search for a replacement as it is difficult to find a light that works well for the long haul.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I tried it, it was very annoying because it is almost like pressing a button. There are no markings so you can't see how fast you are moving it through the gears. It feels very clunky and cheap to have to press buttons to get something to work.   I finally gave up after having it for three weeks and it has started to have issues. It just feels bad when you have to do things very fast. It can be done with the remote but it can still be awkward to use.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great product! Works just as it should. Just buy a small remote because the one provided to me was too big to use with my tv. The only negative is that there isn't a way to turn it off but the unit is easy to replace.  I had a problem with my original remote control that was supplied to me, the buttons were too small for the controls and the one supplied didn't even work with my Samsung televisions. So I decided to try this one and it works just like the original one. If you are like me and buy the same brand but get a different remote, you'll be disappointed, just because you can only buy one type, doesn't mean that it's the right one!  You have to hold down the buttons, not sure why Samsung wouldn't allow you to change the direction of the buttons.  the remote control came in two parts, i don't know why, and that's a big problem as i want the remote to be the same size as my tv remote, but there is no way to control the TV from the remote. I'm hoping that this one will be better.  and the remote has the same problems as the original, the only thing I can think of is that the same manufacturer made both.

It is now on the 3rd day of usage and it is still running perfectly. The phone is perfect and I will be purchasing from them again in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's not that bad, but it does lack a few features. Most of the time the USB port doesn't work well and is quite hard to use. There's no SD card slot. I found myself needing to insert cards through a card reader, or buying a second computer with a built-in SD card reader. The battery life is also a bit short (around an hour on average, which is more than acceptable), but since this is a light and portable device, I can use it for a couple of hours on a day of work.  Product Rating: 4 out of 5-stars. -Brian C. (11/17/2014)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As a general rule, my iPod has had poor quality. The original version of the iPod is fine, but even with updated versions and the addition of video playback the audio quality has been lacking for years. I purchased a new version of that as a Christmas present, and the new version is just the same. The new version only has the stereo sound chip, but at this price I can get much better quality with more features at a similar price, so it's not a deal breaker.   Would you recommend this to a friend? Yes No Unsure
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the iPhone 4 when it was new and never got around to upgrading.   First, the screen is terrible.  And it's an iPhone.  There are better choices out there.  The 4 is also a pain to operate:  You have to hold it in your hand while opening apps, and you can only control it with a single button.  I tried to call my girlfriend's mom from my phone, but it wouldn't even respond.  If you want a better phone, you have to buy a better model.  In the future, you'll have to keep up with new technology, and upgrading is necessary.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My phone's battery died the first time I took it to a store to get a replacement battery.   The replacement battery worked fine, but the original one just died after a couple days of normal use.  My old phone only had 10,000 songs.  This new phone has 50,000.  The battery life is not good at all.  Not to mention the screen has a big yellow circle in it!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i was a kid in the 80s, i remember buying a small   computer (2.5" TFT and only 2Mbit) which came with a cassette recorder. i played it a lot and thought it was a good thing, because the recorder was really small and the sound quality was good.   The   recorder was bad. It had a bad tone (like your   teeth grinding on a toothbrush), and had a   annoying delay.  The main sound is a low-pass filter, and the high pass filter had a nasty feedback loop.  i was hoping the recorder would have a higher quality sound, but i was disappointed.  I sold it as a gag gift, and didn't buy another TFT computer until   2000.  This has nothing to do with my taste (I liked my TFT a lot!), but i wanted to make sure i was honest about my experience with this product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is an absolute cluster of flaws that needs to be fixed before the final product is released to the public.   I purchased the device with an intent to do a little research into what other people thought of it before purchasing.  To my dismay, this device has only one button to press, the "play" button, for what looks like a small device with a little plastic dome to it.  This button, as I said, is in the top of the box.  It is not an easy button to use, and requires a very small motion to activate.  I tried to find a video on how to use it on youtube, but the video was not in english.  While the first attempt to use the buttons seemed to work, the second attempt did not.  The button itself has a very thin plastic dome.  My first impression of the button, is the very thin "v" shape, but also the fact that it appears to require a lot of downward movement to activate it. This causes the unit to move around in my palm.  For someone that is used to a larger controller with large buttons, this can be a bit of a surprise.  Aesthetically, the button looks awful.  There is no backlight on it, which I find very unfortunate because it is only on the top.  Since it is a dome button, and it is on the back, it makes the whole unit look very small and boxy.  In addition, it does not have a nice shiny finish like a lot if the controllers have.  Overall, the buttons are so small, and poorly designed, that I have the feeling the unit is destined for failure.  However, I have no problem with the device in it's current form because I can return it. I will also be reviewing this item to see if I can find a better button for it to be able to be used more like a classic controller.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a very poor product. It works great for sending emails but it's very inconvenient to use.   When I needed to send an email to someone I was looking up the name. The system said the email address did not exist. I had to use a web based application to do the search which was a pain.  If I want to search for an address or person on the system I have to manually type the address and email into the search box. This is so much easier when you can do it from the comfort of your own home.  There's a very good web based version of the service that does the searching on a browser. If I were to buy a computer I would be happy with this product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I wanted a new portable radio so I could listen to some of the shows I love on the road but am just too lazy to buy another one.   When I got the portable radio I was excited to get started using it. I can set it up on the way to my hotel but once I get there it seems to be all clamshell.  Not very portable.   I want to thank all of you for your help and advice, it really is helpful.  My wife purchased this unit to help me and our three children with listening to the radio without us taking the kids to a large FM station (they are all over 6 months old)  The radio has been excellent, as expected, but with a few changes in our household (we are now 2 adults with 3 small kids, and an active baby), the radio just isn't working as well.  We have a radio on our boat and on a boat out at sea, so it really needs to be portable. I am hoping the replacement units will help with the portability issue. We are also looking into a bluetooth unit for the boat, and maybe even a couple of mobile phones to use with the unit on board.  As others have stated, the unit has a lot of great features, but not enough to justify its current price.   I'm just tired of being without the radio at work because my wife can't drive me to my desk.  If it only worked in my office or apartment that would be nice, but it still doesn't sound the same as it did before. The replacement units look very good, but the unit in my apartment doesn't seem to be functioning as it should and I have no idea how I'm going to fix it.  I have to ask my wife what the status is because she can't find it, it has been for about 10 months. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item to replace a pair of old (unwater proof) speakers that were just beginning to lose their sonic fidelity. I have been using a pair that I bought a few years ago and have been fairly happy with them, until recently. The first time that I listened to the audio from the new speakers, they were "loud" and not particularly musical. I listened a couple more times, and each time, they sounded just as the old speakers. I asked the audio technician why he thought that the new units were worse. He said that the components and wiring in the new model (with the high quality power amps) had been made with different goals in mind than those in the old ones. So the new audio components were made to do a little more, but as far as sound goes, it didn't seem to improve much. At any rate, the unit was broken and no longer available so I ended up taking it back for a replacement.    Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm using this computer on a tablet for school work. This is my first full computer. I got it for $100 off Amazon and I thought it would be okay until I started using it. First off the screen is very dim, the speakers are not loud, the keyboard is a little clunky, the touchpad is not good. It is very frustrating and makes the computer hard to use. This was a good investment for $300, but I will be returning it as soon as possible. I'm glad I got the laptop for school, but this computer is going to be a burden to me at home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first used this I wanted to love it. The idea of the touch controls was a great one, and it worked well when it was plugged into my laptop and a bluetooth mouse. However, after using it for a few days I realized it was incredibly bad. I tried different methods to make it work, the biggest was trying to use it as a Bluetooth keyboard with a Bluetooth mouse. The results were terrible. Even though I had a Bluetooth adapter for my laptop, I couldn't do anything at all with that. The touch buttons aren't very responsive or reliable. The USB port is also a problem, as my bluetooth adapter can't be used. And the whole keyboard/mouse combo is extremely limited. I've tried to use as a "wireless" keyboard with the mouse, but there's no way to connect to a mouse via the keyboard or the bluetooth. I can't even connect it via a USB port to my laptop. I'm very disappointed in this one, as I thought it was going to be a great addition to my home entertainment setup.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In terms of features and usability, the product is a definite success. There is nothing too fancy about the device, just a good design that works very well. The size is about what you'd expect from a cheap cell phone with a large display and it's not too heavy. The only major negative I have is that the screen does not work very well in some lighting conditions. You can still view your voicemail or messages, but there are times where you will have to check the screen or the menu to see what's going on. The interface is also quite confusing and difficult to use sometimes. I recommend this as a good way to get the hang of using a cell phone, but not something you'd use every day.  More
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone rang three times and I had to put the phone on silent mode three times (the app was a little hard to use). The phone came with a charger and the connection was not so good so I had the battery disconnected (which I had done before the first two times I'd called). I can't use the phone as it has bad battery life.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I tried to use the unit, it would not connect to my home network. After a while I realized that it had failed to get a network. A simple fix would be to buy an ethernet adapter.   I was not able to use it, even for a few weeks.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from The BEST wireless router. I use this to create a network for my home office, which was not already wired for wireless access, and that's what I wanted. It's great that it has the dual antenna for both wifi and ethernet, which is really handy.  Review of DJ-I AC2400:  The wireless router in my office is one of the many, and most expensive, DJ-i wireless routers that DJ-IT sells, this unit is a little more pricey, but not by much, it's very good and works very well. The unit comes with dual antennas, and has the ability to use both, and is very easy to configure. It can be difficult to install, but it's not impossible, the instructions are very clear, and the directions do a good job of explaining the options. It does require a little extra maintenance once you have it connected, so if you want to make it last a little longer, you could install a small LED light on the unit to let you know when it's running. The product is sturdy, but if you buy it for the dual antennas you need to make sure you get the right adapter. If you buy the adapter that is listed as a "double" adapter, it will only connect one antenna to your router, and if you use it for your two networks, you will be limited to wifi. If the directions were a little clearer, it could have been avoided.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone is very cool, and the price is great.   When I use this as my work phone, it's so quiet, that I think there is no one else around.  When it's in use, it does seem to be inaudible on the phone speaker, but I just have to keep saying it.  The batteries are low, so if it loses power, it would be nice to have something more stable.  They are too small, so I'm not sure how long they can be used.  I have the extra-long one, and I don't think it will fit in my backpack.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A year ago I bought this, and it's my favorite phone ever. It's a phone that fits in your pocket, has a great keyboard, and the battery life is great. I love this phone.   But one day the battery died, and now the phone only runs like 5% (sometimes less).   It doesn't have a way to fast-charge.   5/5 This is the best phone ever... Love it. Great battery life and it never goes flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace a crappy CD player with a decent one.  I am very happy with the device - it is very loud and does not hum. However, the sound from the built-in speakers is very, very weak.  When playing an audio CD, the volume is very high.  Unfortunately, if I want to play a mp3, I am forced to use the Bluetooth app - it does not play music.   A better option would have been the Ipod.  My friend bought it for me and it is also a great piece of equipment!    Rated 5 out of 5 by Lizzie from This little player is AMAZING!!!! I use my iHOS for my iPod, iPod Touch and iPhone. But the iHOP is awesome!! The best. There is something to every occasion, the songs are ALWAYS the same and the quality of music is AMAAAAZING. I can listen to it from my car with Bluetooth or my iPad or my iPod Touch. The Bluetooth feature is great for when I am driving, the Bluetooth is also great when you just want to listen without any Bluetooth device. I am so glad I bought one of these.  Reviewed by Jodie from I really like the IHOP Bluetooth player. I love the fact it has a built in speaker for audio. It's so quiet. If you have the ability to listen to audio from the vehicle with Bluetooth, I'm sure you will enjoy it. The only thing I have a little problem with is that it doesn't have the option to download songs to the device from a computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The best I have tried to buy! I have bought several from Amazon in different price ranges, and I find this device is better quality at a good price.   I have it in my car, and its working like a champ!   It is not cheap, but I have no regrets!    Noise Is Much Reduced From Previous Electronic Devices:  The sound quality of the B2 is very good. I was surprised to find that the volume on the B10 is a notch or two higher than the B8.  But the volume controls on both are not so great and do not do very well in comparison to the B-series.  For example the B1 (also by Panasonic) and B-1 (Toshiba) have identical volume controls, but the B3 (Panasonic) does a better job in terms of sound quality.  It is nice to find a high quality Panasonic device that offers excellent audio quality. I used the B4, B5, and B6 (Samsung) devices in my vehicle and loved them!  This is a nice improvement over what I have already been using in my home.  A big plus is that the buttons do not jangle or make noises and the plastic covers on the controls make them easy to handle.  In fact, the controls look very similar to the controls on the new I-Phones!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was a great product, but it has one flaw; it doesn't have a headphone jack.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have owned a few Apple products, and this one has had issues from the beginning. This is the first time I have purchased anything with such a wide range of settings. The settings menu for this is a disaster. The options are confusing, and it is impossible to find a specific setting I need. The screen is small and not very bright. You must use the external power adaptor to get any sort of battery life. The camera is not accurate in daylight conditions. It has poor flash capability. You are always going to get a lot of noise and not enough light for a good photo.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My first impression was that the sound quality is very poor and very high-pitched.

It's really small and will fit into a pants pocket with the charging cord hanging over the pocket.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     Rated 1 out of 5 by RON from Lousy design and cheap materials. I purchased these for a home theater project and I was disappointed. The connections are not the best. The connection on the front were a little awkward but not bad. The connectors to the two speakers have an interesting twist: one goes on the left speaker and one goes up to the right. When it connects to the left and right you're looking at a really tight connection. The other connections are also very tight but in my case that was because I wanted to hide the connection with a cover so I had to hide a part of the cable. One of the connectors is too short so when it connects it will hit your speakers and get lost. The audio quality is horrible, it is not what you want in a home audio system. I also purchased the cable with 4 different audio inputs but when I plugged it in it seemed to have a hard time connecting with the other inputs. One connection that seemed to work was the 4 port power. I tried every cable I could find to connect it but it is really hard to connect them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A terrible, terrible device. It has so many issues with it.   First, I don't know why a company like   ASUS is   producing these products.  The mouse button is made of very soft plastic and breaks after one or two clicks.  Not to mention it comes with an old, broken driver,  I don`t think it needs one to run it. The buttons have no sensitivity settings on them.  It has no USB cable that you can connect to the computer and it doesn`t even come with a dongle.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini a few weeks ago and really like it.   I like the size, and it looks very good.  I have also used a SGS3 for several years and I don't have any problems with this one.  Unfortunately, there are several problems with the device.  1) The phone cannot be charged with the micro USB port.  Samsung provides only a micro USB cable to charge the phone.  The connector for the micro usb cable is a bit loose and the cable needs to be replaced.  2) The speaker is barely audible when playing music or watching videos.  3) The battery seems to last about 2 hours of normal use.  4) The charging time is about an hour and 40 minutes.  5) The screen is very bright, but doesn't have that much contrast.  6) The device heats up after a couple of minutes of normal usage.  7) The micro USB and power connector are too close together.  8) The buttons are located on the wrong side of the device and are too hard to press.  9) The camera is not very good (fails to take a picture at night and does not record video.  10) The display on the camera is very small.

I am using it as a USB storage device because I can't afford a hard drive (I have 4 3TB ones but they are not fast enough), and the USB storage interface is not fast at all for large files.  I have tried to connect it to an external HDD and it is so slow it is unusable.  The only other thing I did was use a USB hub and my USB devices are not being used very often, and I can get no support from Lenovo.  For the price it is horrible, I wish the whole thing was wireless.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     "The only problem is that, even with a bad battery, the radio works for only a couple of hours before the battery drains and the radio becomes totally useless.   After several years of use, I finally replaced the radio with a better model (in the form of the old one) because it is more reliable, but in the meantime, I have to deal with the radio's defective operation.  I wish the manufacturers would improve the batteries for this old radio, as the batteries are really bad.    A pity because I really like the radio. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased a wireless speaker for my computer so that it could be used to play music. I use it for the same purpose. The speaker works ok, but the device itself is not great. The quality of the speaker is ok, which is good, but when you push the button, the sound is pretty lousy. I bought it for my office, so it doesn't matter if it works or not, but I still think that this product is terrible and I will not be using it.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Product, but... We used this product to listen to music in a small office, but had a tough time getting it to work reliably. It has good sound quality, but it took a lot of adjustments to get it to sound the way we wanted. It was easy to set up and the software is easy to use, but if we have a lot going on in the room and/or the speakers are a little too loud, it's a little confusing. The only problem is that it's just not loud enough for our office.  that's the problem with a product for a certain type of application: when you think you've made it too good, it starts to suck! The unit works fine when connected to a computer, but we thought there was some sort of issue, so we tried the one-button unit. This did not solve our problem at all. If you don't want a complicated system, try the wireless speaker, which sounds much better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the first time I use a digital camera, and the camera is not working at all. It takes only 1 second to take a photo and no sound. I have had the same problem with a digital phone, and it is even worse.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a horrible product and I'm sorry to have wasted my time.   I wanted to get my hands on a nice new digital camera because I'd heard so many good things about it.  After I paid for the shipping to order this device, I received a very ugly black rectangle.  It appears to be a "smart" camera.  The interface is poor:  My only interaction with the camera was to select a picture and press the "send" button.  I'm sure this would work for a camera attached to a computer.  If someone had just emailed me a picture instead of buying a $250 device, then I could have purchased a decent camera instead of a crappy piece of junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works well, but there are too many things that could go wrong to recommend it to a friend. The buttons do what they are supposed to do, but they aren't great, and the display is pretty much worthless. There are many, many other options out there if you really need a computer for basic purposes (email, internet, word processing, and so on), that aren't as difficult to work with as the Laptop. I'm sure this was designed to sell more of the LABORATORY SAVING STICK (which I did not need), but for a general purpose computer, the LAPTOP will do only what it is designed to do.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My girlfriend got this in a birthday present for me a few months ago.  I thought that the plastic box would have the same problems as the old one.  She took it out of the box and immediately ripped the protective paper casing and began dropping the things on the floor.  The light and buttons were a big disappointment.  When the unit worked it worked really well.  After about 10 minutes, the screen wouldn't work.  There were other problems as well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I love the size of this device, but the quality of the display is very poor and the sound quality is awful. I bought this thinking that it would have a higher quality display, but unfortunately it was not to be. I can also only play a few songs from my phone before the device gives up on me and I have to turn on my home Wi-Fi to get it to come back. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device on a whim and was disappointed in the short time I had with it. After the first day, the device would not power on after a couple of minutes. It turned on and would start recording the date and time but then the recorder wouldn't save the recording. After I sent it back to Wal-Mart it had a problem with it getting stuck in the auto record mode. No matter what I did, the unit would not record and would not turn on. I had to get it serviced at a nearby store and they fixed the problem. I then gave it a second chance and it worked like a charm, but it still wouldn't record. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound of the music is very good, but the volume is not. The sound quality is very bad. The music sounds very distorted. The speaker of the mp3 player is very small, so I use my mp3 and play it in front of the TV. The screen is not wide. I can only imagine it to be a great device if you are a big fan of big sound, but I am a big audio lover. The usb cord of the device is not long enough. This device was too expensive to be good for any purpose.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used to have a Sony PX-10, a great device for photojournalists. Recently, I bought this one and found it less than satisfactory. It takes too long to take photos and I have to press the shutter release several times in order to take a shot. In addition, the backlight flickers at times. The battery lasts for about 8 hours. It also has a built-in flash, which is a big benefit. I used it for about two weeks before I sold it. (November 2010)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound quality was fine until I got it running on the 4.5 watt it comes with. The power supply worked fine but the 5 watt one wouldn't go and wouldn't turn on the audio. I have the 4 watt one and it doesn't give me problems. The 4.1 watt one gives a buzzy sound that sounds like a broken buzzer. I returned that and bought the 4 or 5 watt and so far I'm very happy with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had a few problems with my Sony digital camcorder:  First, it didn't work well at all with the camcorders that came with the computer I bought it for. It would always lose data, sometimes the images were scrambled in ways that showed no information.  Then the cam would freeze up when it was in video mode.  I tried to put a disk in and it wouldn't read it.  Finally, I put it in the computer's floppy drive and was surprised to discover that the hard drive wasn't working.  The cam would only play back at about one frame per second.  It did the trick for taking pictures and moving the pictures in a file.   The only other bad thing about the cam is the sound quality. The camcord is a bit thick.  One time I walked into a restaurant and the sound went out.  When I picked it up and tried to play the sound again, it was still out. I think it's just a thin sound card. I'm sorry I got it, but it didn�t work so well.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a second one of these because the first one was too hot and the new one is too cold. I used the new and new, one night, for about a week. The first night it was really cold, so i put it away and had a friend heat it with a hair dryer. He said it was too cold, but i thought it was ok. After a couple nights it was warm, so I put it back in my room, which was too big for it. I noticed it was still too warm the next morning. I put the first back and the second one in the room, and they both seem a bit warmer now. I think I need to get a bigger room. It's probably going to be too loud at work and maybe I should get the AC/heater option.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I wanted a high quality audio device. When the salesman told me it cost more than a high end computer I thought it was a joke. I didn't have enough money for a computer but this one cost a lot more. I wanted to be able to record my friends playing games. I bought a few others but all of them have problems and I keep finding more problems. After about 30 minutes the cord breaks and the unit becomes extremely loud. After that I'm really disappointed in the product. I'm a software person so I had high hopes for this but I was very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (5/5) A very, very good speaker. I purchased a KEF LS50S (speaker) speaker for home theater to be used with my Denon AVR-250. It has been perfect as my main home theatre speaker and is great to listen to music. I am glad to hear a Kefel speaker is still produced! (5-stars)  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bob from Great sound and size for the money. I bought this system a year ago and have never been disappointed with it, but a few years ago I got a new computer and installed the original Yamaha receiver which I found quite a bit louder than the KEF. I have the SB-600, which is a much higher end system and very similar sound to the LS50. As it turns out, I was the right buyer in the end because the SB600 system was also a Kebler.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this camera and it has so much trouble I'm going to have to send it back to Best Buy, as I was not able to get any service from them when I called. I bought the camera on a Friday and received it Tuesday (not Monday as promised). The next day the camera had no memory card or cable for charging. So I had to get a store credit and pay $30 (plus the $30 store credit) to get it to charge and start working. I tried the camera in the store and they said it worked. So, I brought it home and it worked fine, until I tried to change the lens to see if that would fix it, but the lens was not rotating correctly when I tried rotating it, so I decided to send the camera back and get it fixed there. I went to the store Wednesday and they told me it was the same thing as the lens, so they told that store to send a new lens and send the other camera back (which they will also need to get corrected), so I sent both back to a different store to get them fixed. Today (2 days after they sent both cameras back) I got them fixed at a store down the street and my camera was working fine. Then the camera stopped working. Not the camera, but my camera itself. They gave me two different brands of memory card but couldn't figure out how to get the second one into the camera. So we had to buy a new memory card for $10 (plus $10 store credit). When I got home, the memory card was broken and I had one card left that had no power on it, which I lost as it couldn't be used to start the camera because it doesn't have the correct card inserted in it. So all in all, it took over a week of getting it to work on a rainy day. This is a poor electronic device that can't even get the right card into the device. You can buy another camera and a different card and it will work perfectly. It's a shame as it's very good for a first timer like myself, and there are many reviews on YouTube for it. This camera is a total waste of money and will be returning it to Best Buys.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item, thinking it would be a good replacement for my broken iMac, but the iMac came out with no problem. I was really pleased when I plugged it in, but, it had no sound. I looked online to find a replacement and I found a website that sells these for about $100, which isn't bad but the sound is just terrible. This product has no sound, no light, and I don't know how it is going to hold up to the abuse that iMac users can inflict on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is by far the worst phone I have ever bought. I have had it for a few months now. It is VERY slow. I would say it is a slow clunker when it works, but then again, that is just me. I wish I could give it a 3 star rating, but I can't. This device is so slow to respond, I can not tell it is off. It just doesn't do what it is supposed to do. It takes longer to get a message to your phone, and more time to actually get it. It also takes more time and energy to have someone call your number back than it does to pick it up. I am a business owner, and this device is costing me money every month. This is a total disappointment. It's worth every penny.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The thing is just okay. It worked great for a month and then I accidentally left the device on while I was on the phone. Now it's dead. The thing is I bought this as a "great buy" but it was a bit too expensive. The battery is not as good as it could be but I was using my iPad and that is how I got this unit to work so I don't regret it but it would have been nice if it lasted more than 6 months.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was looking for a way to watch my TV on the go, and thought this was it.   It works for the most part, and is more than just another cable box. However, the remote is terrible.  While I use it to access the remote on my computer, it doesn't offer a standard keyboard for the remote's function.  I can use the remote to search for programs on my TV, but that's not the case.  Also, there is no way to change the channel if it's not a live one.  If the remote could accept a standard layout keyboard, I'd be a happy camper.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This keyboard is good for casual use. I really wanted something more professional but decided to go with the Microsoft keyboard. I find it to be quite useful for typing notes and emails. The biggest issue I have is the fact that the keys are quite low to the surface.  I'm not going to get a mechanical keyboard and then play games.  My only other issue with this keyboard is the touchpad, which is the worst I've seen from any gaming keyboard.   Pros:

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This keyboard is terrible!    It does NOT work well.   I tried many different keys to fix this keyboard but the keyboard is a horrible mess. The "keys" do not work and some are only partially functional. I can not even press the "1" or "9" button. My best guess is that it is faulty or something else is broken in the "row" of the keyboard.  I have two other keyboards in my apartment:  I had my laptop for a few months and it had no problem switching to Windows 7 when I connected the laptop to the PS3. When I moved my laptop to my desktop PC and connected it to the new computer I had a problem switching windows. I was able to switch from my laptop screen to the desktop computer screen but then when I tried to switch back to the laptop screen the keyboard on the PS4 did not recognize the PS keyboard and the keyboard was not recognized on my laptop at all.

I can't speak for the sound quality as the speakers are so small I couldn't really hear anything. I used the speaker on the phone to check the phone for no charge. The sound was muffled and I couldn;t even tell the phone was there. I've ordered another one but it's going to be a couple more months before I actually use it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the worst things I've ever had to deal with:  It came with one of these:  I had to buy a new one because of poor quality.   The screen was flakey and not at all crisp. The keyboard was a little loose in the center of the keyboard, and when you pressed the key it wouldn't turn it to the right direction. I used to have a Dell laptop for years but decided to buy an Apple to save money and to save the hassle of buying a new laptop every year.  I went from Dell to Apple and this is the worst thing   I've had to do to get a new keyboard.  Apple   For some reason it didn't work right in my laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing good is the wireless.   I got the Bluetooth and didn't have enough time to use it at first so I've tried it a couple of times now.  One is that the phone's voice-activated system is a little jittery and I get the occasional "no such device" message.  I'm sure that will go away with more time.  So I gave it a "fail" for that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have always been on the fence about the Sony mp-3 player. After having a couple playbacks and listening to the music on the CD player in the car, I thought, "I'll try it this time". I opened the box, and a few minutes later my phone rings. It is a friend, trying to sell me a CD from their favorite artist. I tell him to hang up the phone, and play the music.   Then after a few songs, it starts. It sounds as if the sound of the cd player was cut by the speaker. I have had a few mp-1 and mp-2 players, but no matter how loud it was, I never experienced that problem. Not to mention that I had heard it was a Sony. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm not an expert and I can't comment on the software, which is based on MS-DOS. The device isn't much better. I'm writing this from a Windows PC, and it appears the screen shows an 80x25 grid of colors. The program doesn't look too bad, though it looks like it might be a program for playing card games. The graphics are nice, but when you try to display the grid on your monitor, it's very hard to see it. The "color" aspect of the program was actually more fun for me than the program itself. I was more concerned with how I would get to the grid to play cards than how I could use my computer to play the cards. It's a fun way to pass some time, but it's a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The electronic device that came with the purchase has a great sound but the sound quality is mediocre. The sound is okay, but it lacks a lot of depth and clarity. The volume has no control but this is not a problem because it is a good price for what you get. The controls are easily accessible and easy to use. The battery life on this unit is only about 2 hours and a half or 3 hours which is okay. The only reason I gave this a low rating is because I was so disappointed that there is no way to add a battery in the back. I will not recommend this product, and the person who provided the product will be receiving a refund.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this device, I was a little concerned that it would work for something other than my laptop computer. I'm usually working at home and this thing has enough juice to light up my whole office. That being said, the power cord is hard to manage so it's a pain to get the thing running all the time. The only time I'm actually able to use it, I have the battery cover off so it doesn't get hot.    Pros: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is a good, inexpensive, easy-to-use, compact computer that will give you some computing for the price. The sound is pretty good, too, although it is definitely more of an entertainment device than a work device. If you really don't care about video-editing or audio-editting, this is a great little computer. I have the 32 GB model with the 5 1/2" floppy disk, and it's nice having that much storage to work with. I am not an artist, so this isn't what I use this computer for, but it's a nice, small computer that I can use to play games.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I love my old laptop, and my new new laptop works great but I was so disappointed about the replacement battery. The old battery was the same price as the new one and last for about two months but the new battery is cheap and doesn't last nearly as long as the old one. I had to buy another battery and now I have to replace the entire laptop.  Good for general purpose work:  In my day to day work, I'm not going to be using a laptop to do anything heavy lifting or gaming, and so I'm happy with this for those types of tasks. The keyboard is a little stiff for typing on paper, and the trackpad does not feel like it is doing its job well. The size of the machine is also a bit cumbersome, but this does not affect how useful it is for what I need it to do. We hope you find a suitable replacement:   There are a few places around the Internet that sell the same old model of this laptop, but I got the newer version and I'm very happy with it. I would like to see Dell come out with a more portable version though as I'm kind of lazy and don't want to carry a backpack everywhere I go.  to find out if you could get the same replacement battery for less money at your local electronics store.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the 3G phone from an electronics store to use for the first time.   The screen quality was subpar and the phone was very hard to use.  The phone had problems with reception and the data quality was bad.  I returned the phone to the store and exchanged it for another model but the reception problems remained and the quality of the data was not better.  This is very disappointing for such a low cost.  A customer friend who had used one of these phones said that there are better models at half the price.  You will not be satisfied unless you spend $80 or more.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this as a gift for a college student. The device is a bit big and awkward to use.   Unfortunately the volume knob and the power button don't work at all.  This is a problem on all my other digital devices too.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best buy so far. I am an audiophile so I'm not sure why the review is negative.  The best price ive seen in years! I like the built in speakers, and also use it as a music player while traveling.   Review:  A little over $100 and it comes with some pretty decent features: 1) A full size USB input for external devices like USB thumb drives, MP3 players, and etc. 2) Built-in speakers which can be used in a pinch to play music without external speakers. 3) USB-A connectivity for the music and media, with stereo 3.5mm output. 4) A headphone/mic jack for external use. 5) A 5.1 audio/video output for the desktop speaker.  I also have another device (Samsung S-series soundbar) that I also use to watch video while working. The included cables and case are very handy, but not quite as helpful as the soundbar.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this thing it was the most expensive thing I had ever bought.  The quality was horrible.  In a nutshell the battery did not last the battery life of the device, but this is easily fixed in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm so glad I didn't buy this!   The only way this works is if you're watching a movie.   As the reviewer said, the sound is very muffled, but the quality of the picture is bad.  The picture on my 4th generation   iPod nano (5th gen) is very bad. The sound is terrible.  I tried using this on the phone by using a phone app that is a port of a music player that I have that also plays MP3s.  It works fine, but just don't buy it!  The batteries are also too small and the charger is made by a Chinese company!  You need to get a USB wall charger that has a large capacity battery in order to charge it properly. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product when I was in college and have been using it for years. The problem is, its too bulky to fit in my bag, and the battery never lasts more than a few days. The only way to charge it is by plugging the phone in to an AC adapter. I wish the battery was smaller and I would have given it zero stars.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time I bought it I was excited to get a device I could use for watching movies, since the first one was bad, but the second one was no good, so I just kept the first, which works fine for watching TV and video games. But it is annoying to be able to play video games on the TV. It is very simple to set up (one button to turn it on or off, another to adjust the volume and mute). The only problem is that after watching a movie or game, it constantly wakes up the device every time it wakes up from sleep. When it finally gets to sleep it has to be turned off to save battery. This is not a real problem but just an annoyance. Also the power button is located in the upper left corner (where the mute button is) making it hard to find when looking at the TV screen. I have not found the same problem with the second device, but I bought the second because it had a volume knob, which is very helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen does not look too great. I also got this to replace an old Sony Vaio laptop and the Vaio has the same problem as the Sony laptop. The buttons on this laptop just have a bad clicky feel to them, making it feel like you are holding a plastic box instead of a laptop. It has a better keyboard than the Vaiuos though. I don't really like the buttons on the laptop. I wish the keyboard was a bit better and the mouse better but for the price, it is a good buy.   Excellent:  The most expensive item that I bought for my son but the product is just as good as the others! It is a lot of fun and it has lots of games. If your child is going to be playing video games for a lot longer, I would buy him one of these as well, but you could just get a video game console, controller and a couple of controllers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone works well and for a very good price, it is just a bad experience. It's only a few months old and already a little bent and the batteries are beginning to fail in a short time, and it's pretty hard to get the phone to even start up from a dead battery.   In the beginning, when you buy it, the price was great and I expected a lot from it, but after a month, the phone was no longer getting hot enough for it to do anything, and I could not use it for very long.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device expecting that it would be a good device with some cool features.   It was only when I had my new one for a week that I found that it didn't work right.  The phone was not registering correctly, so when I tried to call a number, I would hang up.  Then the phone would go to voicemail so I would have to get the number and dial it.  I'm going to buy a new one.  Pros:  - Price  - Good looking   Cons: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I had been looking forward to purchasing this product, and i really hoped that this would work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There is no comparison.   I really wanted the Samsung but the cost and quality of the iPad Mini was just too much for me.  It's a great product for those who like a good device but don't need the whole computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product is extremely bad.   I have owned this for over two years now.  The phone is not very reliable at all.  I call it a "dumb phone." I've tried to call my wife to explain why the phone never answered, and every time I would hang up.  It was a good purchase because it was cheap.  Now, if I were on the budget, I would have just bought a cheap cordless.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is a bad device. When you plug it in it has no sound for the first half of the session. Then after that you hear a good quality music. If you use it in an environment with bad reception it is a very loud speaker. When I use it on my car stereo I put headphones on. For a good price its a good device but for me the quality is low.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this thing in a hurry, as it was on sale. I am a musician and use it to record my guitar. I found that it sounded really good, but it is really noisy. The sound is great for recording, but in real-life, it's very annoying. The noise is also making it hard to record in the shower. I will never use this as a home-computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The batteries are cheap and the charging time is bad. I had to pay $9.99 for a battery that lasted only about 10 hours.   I am looking for a new e-reader because I got rid of my Kindle Fire.  I purchased this book for a Kindle in December. It has the same problem with the batteries as a Kindle.  In short, I hate to give a bad review about something but this e-book is a pain to read because it does not have the same quality as a $100+ Kindle. It does have some great stories but they aren't good enough for a $19.99 price tag. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had the e-book reader for a little over a year now, and this is the last one that I have purchased.  The reader itself was fine.  It worked, it was fast.   My only problem was that the ebook reader's battery died within a day or so.  I tried to return it but when I came back to the store the owner told me that I had to purchase a replacement e-reader.  Then she went on to tell me that a couple of people had complained about the same thing and asked for a replacement.  This kind of attitude makes me want to return all my e-readers and I would prefer to buy them elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the tablet at the same time as the PC.   In a way I was lucky in that I already had a PC, but I still wanted the tablet.  It's an incredibly useful device, if you like to have multiple applications running in the background.  However, there are a few bugs in the device itself which I didn't have a good solution for, the biggest one being it's poor battery life.  My advice to other customers is to be patient and be patient for a better product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this keyboard to replace my older IBM Model M keyboard. I used to use a Model M and it has been a great keyboard. The keyboard is easy to type on, but if you use it too much it becomes a little scratchy. The keys are not as easy to hit as an IBM Model F, but they're certainly better than a Model N. As with most computer products there are many good and bad features. For the price you can't go wrong with this keyboard, but I would not hesitate to pay more for the Model N if you need the full array of features.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a bad experience with the ipad mini. I have it for about a month and it breaks twice a day on a 2-3 day trip. the first time it broke the screen went bad after about a week of using it, then it had to be replaced. I had it for less than a year and it is still broken. The ipad is a pretty nice gadget. I got it for like 3 bucks, but you get what you pay for.

The   screen   is   low resolution and  is useless in a  environment   where   people don't use a  high resolution device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The Samsung KI818 is one of the better things I have bought.   I was considering buying a Samsung T621 at the same time, but since the Samsung T620 has an 8" screen I couldn't justify the cost (plus the additional cost of a bigger mousepad).   Once I got the T622 I thought I would try the KI808.  The problem is that the K-I808 is much heavier than I expected for a 7" screen.  I didn't realize it until I tried it.  But I have a good deal of experience with laptops, so the weight wasn't too much of a problem.  However, the weight is really annoying.  It also is a little small to get used to.  Also, the keyboard is too big.  (It would be nice to have a backlight on it, but at least the keyboard stays on.) I also didn't expect the KII818 to be so responsive.  Even though my laptop has a fast 2.4 GHz Core i7 and Nvidia 965M graphics it was laggy.  Not laggy, just not responsive. There is no "noise" to be had, so I have no idea how it is so good in real life.  Finally, it's a bit too noisy.  My wife told me not to use it in the office and use my laptop.  This was true, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  Since I will be doing most of my reading and writing on this tablet, I decided to do the research for some other good choices. I found the Kindle Oasis, Kindle Touch, and Kindle Paperwhite to be very good choices, with the Kindle Touch being my favorite.  If I did not own a Kindle, then I would probably choose the Kindle Paper white, but the Oasis has an advantage in being a larger screen.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The main issue I have with this device is that it is extremely loud at times. It's very distracting on the bus or in a crowded mall.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is not worth the cost as most of the people that bought these for their families have complained about the quality of the product. The electronic unit and the cord are cheap.   My mother who is a diabetic requires a device to monitor the glucose level in her blood.  The meter itself needs to be replaced every year or two as it loses its calibration.  To keep the cost down I purchased the device on sale only. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the first things that came to mind when I tried the phone is that it is large and heavy. The phone itself is very good.

The only real gripe I have is that the screen is very low resolution. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got a few of these from a dealer who sold them online.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This product was delivered to my address by USPS. The shipment took 2-3 weeks to arrive. The device was delivered with a "C" on the front, but the front "A" and "C " were switched. When the box arrived the back of the "A " was not properly sealed. The box had a hole in the top with a sharp edge. I did not have any problems with the phone itself, but when you plug it in the device's screen blurs.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've bought a lot of electronic devices, many of which work well and have good batteries.   When I purchased this particular item, I bought it at full price because the warranty is so great.  When the item arrived, however, it was dead and the warranty had expired.  So my $100 investment was destroyed in an instant.  Now, I am back to searching for a new product that has worked well before it breaks. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - When I bought this phone, I was a bit disappointed in the performance. After two days of use, I finally started to use it. I have had a good experience with my Galaxy S5 so far. The phone is a good size and is very well built. The screen is better than expected and has a good contrast ratio. The sound quality is not too bad, it is a little noisy, but not to bad. Overall, I am a happy user.   The device I bought, was the Nexus 6 and it is pretty nice too. I don't like the "no home button" thing, but I'll get over it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had my Taurus for a month and it is my only electronic device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My only gripe about the iPhone is that it has not evolved much over the years and is still stuck with the same set of features.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this for a wedding gift. I thought I would like it for the price but I was disappointed to find that the device is made of flimsy plastic.    I would not recommend this to my friends or anyone that would like to buy an electronic device. Rating:  1 out of 5.   Rating is for an electronic item only:  I recently bought a Kindle e-reader (Kindle 3G). After reading the reviews I was looking forward to this electronic device which I had read about on a book buying website. I have a problem with this book reader. As soon as I get home I read the reviews of this book device and am not pleased with the way it works. The battery does not last long. I would think that for the amount I paid for it that the battery would last 2 or 3 days before the battery dies. It is also very flimsy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I got the phone, I was expecting it to be better, but it didn't. The phone can barely hold a charge with normal usage. There is no way I can use it unless I charge it nightly. I use it to listen to music while working and I really don't want to keep charging it overnight. And no matter how hard I try the phone does not show up in my phone directory. I have to search for the phone and even then I can't find it. I hate this phone!!! - Richard  Answer:  If your problem is that you can't get your hands on it: you can probably get a warranty replacement. I've been using this phone for a while, and it's been very reliable. The battery's performance is pretty good and the sound is surprisingly loud for its size. I'd rate it as a 3 out of 5. However, it seems a bit slow for my tastes. - David  Question:  How to stop the ring when I wake up on a long day? Answer:  I have the problem on a Verizon model XT1021/XT1023 (AT&T, but still on Verizon) and I think I might have a software issue. In the beginning, when I started using it, I couldn't wake it up with a single press of the power button. But the ring went away after some troubleshooting and now I can wake it when I want. I don't know if I'm having a problem with the phone or not. If you happen to have this problem too, I'd appreciate any advice you could give me to help me solve this problem.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have owned the "Mighty Mouse" for almost two years now. It is a very good mouse. I would buy this one again if I could afford another one.    I am very pleased. The mouse works well, has a good feel, it doesn't slip in my hand. It's comfortable to type on and works as advertised. It makes it very easy to play video games.  , I'm a heavy PC gamer with a good gaming PC and this mouse is perfect. The light weight is great and the scroll is great too.  I'm also not a keyboard user so I needed a mouse that could work well on either keyboard or mouse.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was so excited when my friend gave me a new iMac but all I could find was a bunch of bad reviews on it so I couldn't really be 100% happy with it. This iMac didn't do any good at all, the screen is so blurry that i have to turn the brightness all the way down. I could barely find my files on my computer and when i did i found them all unreadable. i was going to return it because the price is too high but since i bought it a few months ago, it is now my best friend. I wish that it came with the extra memory i need.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Tuesday, March 03, 2010  Bought this to replace an old Mac mini with less RAM. This was my first computer and I have only had it a month. The quality of this computer is better than my old Mac Mini. The iMac looks more appealing than the mini. I am on my 2nd year of owning a Mac. This computer has proven it's worth and is by far the best I have had. The build quality and user interface are superior to my Mac Mini, my old PC and my main PC. The video is more than good enough for gaming. I also purchased a new HD cable for my camera for a better quality picture. Overall the build quality is superb and it is the best computer I have ever owned.  and the best!!! I bought this to change from my mac mini. The computer looks and works great. It doesn't have the best processor but the memory is fast and the memory in my PC is just as good if not better than the Mac mini. It is a great computer and the price was great!  was this review helpful to you? Yes No Friday, February 13, 2010
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The computer was not even working properly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only good thing about this thing is the fact that it makes phone calls (no dial tone, just voice).   But, I cannot get past the fact the call function does not work with my iPhone!   My iPhone has two SIM cards (GSM and EDGE), and I do not want to have to buy new SIM cards for both my phones just to make a phone call, and it is a pain to get to this feature on the main screen.   In addition, to make phone calls with it, I have to use my iPhone's speakerphone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The touch screen does not work well on this device. I had to put the battery in the charger twice, to get it to charge. I used the same method as everyone else, to plug it in. This is one of the worst touch screen phones I have ever used.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this on the basis that I use it with a PC and wanted a keyboard for when I have a desktop PC. The fact that you can't use your thumb and fingers as I was hoping for makes me rather disappointed, and it is so easy to accidentally remove the case! The only good thing is that you don't have to take the case off when you don.t want to, and the keyboard is small enough that you're still easily able to use it. Overall, this is a very good keyboard, but it just doesn't measure up to the keyboard I got with a Mac mini (I got an extra one for Christmas!).
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a cheap, Chinese knock off   device from China. The LCD screen is extremely small and the buttons are very hard to press. Also, the speaker is a real sissy. It's very loud and gives off a little noise when you hit the button. If your looking for an    cheap   knockoff   with a built in speaker and decent sound quality, look no further than the YYE.  Good design, but a design flaw:  This is a decent looking device, with a well thought out design. However, there is one flaw. It has a USB port that you can plug in any keyboard of any kind to play games and type. I really can't recommend it. It works fine for gaming but the sound of the keyboard is not very good. I just plug in a USB keyboard to it and it works just fine. The problem is that all keyboards have the same problems. It is also very loud. It would be much better if the device had an internal speaker. There is a small light up keyboard on the back that you may want to add, but again it would make it louder. I am looking for a new device to use with my phone so that I can get back to what is important, playing games. I also have a Windows phone and the sound is much better there. For now, this device will work well.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      A few years back I had an old Dell computer that I loved and could work on all day. The computer was also extremely reliable. The last of its kind, it came with no software or drivers, not even an internet connection. It didn't even have an LCD monitor or floppy disk drive. One day I saw on a sales flyer that my Dell would soon no longer be available, and had to be replaced by another one. I was very sad because I loved the computer so much. After a couple days of online searching I found one with only 60 days of use left. I called the number listed on the ad and was told that the computer was being serviced, but would be back on line by the end of the week. I told them that I had heard the same thing about a few others on the website, but that the quality had dropped. So I told the salesman that I would like a full refund and would like to see the computer before he sent it out. The sales person laughed, then said "you won't be receiving your refund because we don't do refunds." I told him I thought he was kidding, because I had seen several other Dell computers that were just as good, and I had no reason to believe that this one was any different. But he insisted that it was. So now I am stuck with a very slow, buggy, broken computer for the rest of the month.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The item I got is the best I had but I was expecting a much bigger one since this is only the second time I bought an amp. First one wasn't so bad but now it's no longer working. It's still very good. But I'll probably be using the small one.  So disappointed after getting this item. I got it about 2 months ago for the holidays. My wife gave me the original model with a battery back, but I didn't use it. I was so excited to get this one, it came fast, and I thought I'd get a little something extra. I'm really bummed to say this, it's a really nice amp, but there's something wrong with it. Maybe the capacitor's not working as well as the first time, maybe it's just the fact that I got a 2nd year, but it is the worst amp I've ever owned. It makes a very good sound but for the price and what I was getting I expected more. ...
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this for my husband to listen to the radio without ear buds.

I have had my iPhone 6, Samsung S7, and LG G5 for the last couple years and nothing has been as loud and as loud as this. The bass is also a bit loud and it's an electronic device so I have no complaints at all.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mabel from Works Great I purchased the samsung s7 edge for my daughter for Christmas. The samsung has great battery life, a very good camera, and a beautiful screen. I found the only issue I have is the speaker. It was so loud that I would need to turn my car's speaker down or my daughter would yell at me. So I have a couple adapters on my car for this problem. The only complaint is that the cable is so short that it gets in the way of my car stereo, which makes the sound terrible. The battery lasts for about 10 hours so I am pretty happy with the purchase.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was extremely happy with the features and design of the Echo. However, the batteries that are used in the Echo seem to last only 4 or 5 months. When I bought the Echo it stated it had 6 months, then it became 4 months. But the batteries on mine are about 5 months old. So I'm hoping I can get a new set of batteries and still have plenty of battery life for the next year.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I have been using this computer for two months now. The only problem I have found is the touch pad which can be tricky to use. This is a good computer. However, I'm not sure how much longer it will last as my wife has bought a new computer, which also has an X-5500.  Have used for more than 3 years - excellent computer. Used for work (i.e. CAD) in my office, and just about everything else. Love it, and the fact that it comes with two cables instead of one. It is a little pricey, but well worth it. Only thing I think could have been done better is to include more hard drives in the box with the computer and a memory card instead of just one.  to many options to configure and the mouse/keyboard are not in the same location. .   If you are an engineer, engineer, or even just an enthusiast with a computer (like I am), then I think you need this computer. The hardware in this computer makes it a lot better then any other computer I have had. I know people who have had to buy a new machine for the same things and it seems the X-5600 is made to last a long time. This computer is a beast, especially if you have a lot of programs, or graphics, or music. Also, if you use a mouse, this one is really good (I have a Logitech G600). The keyboard and mouse are really good as well, so it is just a matter of finding the right program for it. Overall a great computer for the price.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item could have been much more useful to me if I had known about the battery life. I have to plug it in every day for several hours, but then I have the worst problem of the two problems I've had.   The USB ports are not labeled on the box.  The port that came with my tablet was labeled.  I have yet to see any documentation on this item. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really wish my phone was as good as the one I got from Motorola.   However, I think the screen is not as bright as other phone I have.  My only other gripe is that the device never boots when I try to use it.  In fact, it doesn't recognize a keyboard input. It's not a big deal, but I wish it booted faster.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have two of these on my computer and can't use them.   No good response for the audio issue.  I'll just use a USB drive and save them on it.  The noise is just awful.  It's just not a very good product.   This product deserves a 4.5 stars. I have been looking for a good audio quality portable hard drive to back up my computers. I was happy to find one from WD.  They are portable and inexpensive.  These are also very large capacity drives and the audio quality is wonderful.  If you use them frequently, you should buy the 4 GB version.  This is the perfect drive to use to backup your home computer.  All I can say is WOW!!!  #1 Buyer Beware:  I have just used the drive that I got in the email. It works fine, but there is NO audio. No sound. NO NO NO. No no. The sound just sounds muffled.  Now there are many of you reading this right now thinking that I'm stupid or that the sound must be bad. It doesn't sound horrible. I had the same problem as you in the beginning of the year when I purchased an old computer. I thought that maybe there was something wrong with the sound card or something. After using them for about a month now, I'm coming to the conclusion that this is a problem with the drive itself.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product to replace the hard drive of my Mac mini.   The drive was a great hard drive for a reasonable price and a large amount of storage.  It failed after a few months of heavy use.  For a few hundred bucks more, I bought a 1TB external hard drive.  When it failed, I returned the device and spent an hour trying to replace it and had to send it back for repair.  A couple of months later, I got a call from Apple support saying that the failure had been corrected, but that the drive had suffered some irreversible damage and that I would need to ship it to Apple to be repaired.  I called them back to confirm and they said that a technician was going to be out later that day. When I showed up that afternoon, he gave me the bad drive (which, if you look closely, had damage to the metal contacts in the metal housing) and said he couldn't fix it because the damage was too severe to be fixed without removing the hard drives from the computer.  While I was waiting for the technician, I started researching whether or not an external hard disk drive could work for this particular situation.  After some research, I found the article: External Hard Drive Problems for a Mac Computer   It was an excellent article that answered all my questions and helped me come to the conclusion that an external Hard Drive was the way to go.  The repair quoted me only $70 in parts.  Unfortunately, it was not what I wanted at the time.  So I called Apple and they offered to give me a brand new computer to fix the failure for free.  What a great way to deal with the situation that I had, and what a waste of time. It didn't take long for my Apple Mac Mini to be back up and running.  If I had known the hard disk I purchased was defective, I wouldn't have bought it.  Update:  It seems that a lot of people have purchased their Mac's using an external drive. In fact, according to Macworld, Apple has sold over 300,000 Macintosh Performa/Pro models that come with external hard drives.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item as part of a kit that included a power adapter for my   PC, a monitor, a keyboard, and an   cable.   It was not what I expected.  It took a bit to get started (a couple of weeks), the power adapter had to be  connected first, it would sometimes be  plugged in then unplugged.  I had to wait for it to charge, and sometimes it would start, but then not power the system on (i.e. the system would not turn on) then it would get back to power up.  The monitor was bright enough, the keyboard was a bit on the small side, and   the screen could be difficult to read on when viewed from different angles, but I will use this  in the future for other purposes. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am very sad to report that I was very, very disappointed with the new Dell XPS 13.   It seems the engineers who made this computer are doing everything they can to keep the costs low (and they're probably right about that), but as the old saying goes, the more you cut, the less you get.  I've used an old iMac with a Retina display for a long time, and I'm used to having a computer that's so powerful it has the potential to do anything that can be done with a modern graphics card.  With this computer, the computer is not even remotely capable of doing any of the things that I'd like to do with a computer.  The biggest problem with this computer is that it's slow.  If I want to do any sort of editing, I'll use Photoshop instead.  Even when I run Photoshop, it's painfully slow. The thing is, it doesn't even have a decent integrated graphics card, so everything looks grainy and pixelated.  It's a huge pain in the butt to use.  Now, the good part about this computer though, is that you get to take advantage of the power of a Retinal Display without needing a full Retina Display.  This is one of those devices that just doesn't have the guts to run Photoshop or any other image editing application. The best you can do with this device is to put it into an external monitor, so I can use it as a normal laptop when I'm working on my iPad.  But it still costs more than any iMac, so it's not exactly something I'd recommend to people.  Pros:

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It seems that my Dell has only been working sporadically ever since I got it. If I leave it plugged in the unit just goes off. It's not that it's a bad device by any means, but this could be a software issue and I hope that's the case.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a new  Macbook Air and I really didn't enjoy using it. I had no trouble finding it's physical location on my desk, but for some reason its operating system doesn't work very well. Even if it was just a problem with the operating system, the keyboard and touchpad are very annoying to use. When you enter a character using the touchpad, the whole page jumps to the next line, which is the opposite of how I want to type. You can change the keyboard to something similar, but you can't easily do that while using the computer. The screen's auto-brightness feature is a real letdown. After setting it to "normal" brightness for the first time I found that the screen went out and wouldn't come back. I have a small blind spot but the screen still doesn't seem to have the sensitivity to my touch that I want. It's a shame because Apple makes such great products.

My laptop had been in the same house for several years, but the power adapter just kept failing. I gave up on the device, and ordered the USB cable, but now the computer won't boot, and the USB ports won't work. My other computer is ok, but just won't power up.   I had to get another laptop just to use it with the old adapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It was a good unit. I was looking for a good replacement for my laptop when I decided to purchase a replacement, and the specs match perfectly. The problem is that it only has one ethernet port. I use an ethernet cable on a regular basis, and it doesn't support it on the XPS 13. If I'm not using the laptop much, I won't miss it at all. It's a great replacement for a lot of people, and if you're looking for an entry-level laptop that's good in the office, you can't go wrong.

I bought it for the price but I'm going to have to buy another one. The battery compartment is supposed to be the same size as a normal battery compartment. This is a problem with most of the portable products for the cheap price. The product itself is fine, not too heavy. I'm giving it 2 stars because it is still a very cheap device.  Rated 5 out of 5 by RaveyRee from Perfect size for a lot of uses. The size of the device is great. The fact that it can be charged on a wall socket is awesome as well. The only flaw is the battery indicator light is not a very good one so it is hard to know if the battery is low or high.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad device is not something that you should feel bad about. When it breaks, you're going to have to buy a new device and it's not that expensive. A bad product is one that I have to return because it does not work, or the sound is subpar, or it makes a funny noise when the battery is low. I know, when you're broke and looking for a cheap device, you might look at this as a cheap one, but this is NOT a cheap item.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, the design of the screen was awful. There were no buttons on the side, only the power button, and the other buttons were all on the back and I didn't use the buttons anyway. It was too hard to reach the buttons. If you could hit it, you'd have to get in your way of the display to hit it. It's like they didn't even bother to add the back button and just left it there.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Joe S. from Better than expected Very impressed with the display, it has excellent color contrast. It is more than adequate for playing games (even on the highest settings). The only drawback was the software required to use it. The screen has to be connected to a computer in order to run. In conclusion, it is not a phone but a PC (not as good as my HP) but with the included USB-C to USB-A cable (you need a compatible USB hub to use this in a desktop), it's a lot better than a phone and much easier to use than a laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is hard to find good battery life, especially for my cheap android phone.   I use my phone all day, but sometimes I want to check emails or text, and my battery dies. I have a small budget, and i need to buy new batteries every couple of months.   It is difficult to find a good quality battery for my laptop:  This is my second battery from this site, but it's the only one I'll be keeping. My laptop is getting very old and has a tendency to overheat.  I'm using a Dell XPS 12, and it's a nice laptop for the price, but the power cord is difficult. It's always pulling hard and not staying connected when it's hot, even after I turn it down to 40% or 50%.  I bought a cheap 3S battery, but I've always had problems with it, it doesn't last.  The one on here seems to be of better quality and I don't have to pay for extra batteries like I have to with some of the ones I bought from Amazon.  This one is going to be good for a while, it's one of my cheaper batteries and it only gives out 1.5V/3.6A and it lasts pretty long on the Dell.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This monitor does everything that you expect from a monitor and more, but it has a problem that makes it look like crap and is an absolute pain to use. The buttons are not responsive, the connection cables are all made of metal (but the monitors have plastic) and the screen has an awful color reproduction that makes colors look "off" even with a calibration screen. I know that the issue is that the monitor has a "high-sensitivity" color panel but even so, this monitor is awful to work with and I wish I'd never bought it in the first place.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from A Good Monitor for the Price I got this monitor for my Mac Pro and I was able to use it very well with my setup, but one issue I found is that it does not auto-focus when it is set to monitor a window that is over 100 pixels from the top or bottom. I can easily press the button to focus, but when I move the window to the left or right the screen goes to the top of the screen.  the only way to fix this is to buy a dedicated auto-focusing cable for it to plug into. : I have a mac pro 3.1 macbook pro with retina that also has an external display (a 27" tv).   The best thing to say about this monitor   is the resolution.   It looks great on a 1366x768 monitor (although I think the colors are a little different).
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first one we had was the Samsung   and it lasted for several months before it quit working.   It worked pretty well, but it got in the way of our computer and had to be replaced.  It was not worth the price tag, and had very poor quality of build and design.  We found out that the replacement Samsung  is just as bad, but you will pay more for the better design and build quality.  Note:  It is possible that if you get a bad product it could be an expensive one, but if you buy the wrong one, you will have to replace a lot of it because the quality is poor and the design is questionable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It takes a while to figure out how to turn it on.   My device is defective - the power button is on the opposite side from the keyboard, so it takes two clicks to turn on the device.  I tried switching it so that it's closer to my computer, but it won't change to the keyboard unless I press the other side.  Another minor point - it's not a good idea to use it for typing at the same time the mouse is used to click and scroll in Excel.

The aperture is too shallow, it doesn't have any metering or a manual control, and the LCD screen is just small and lacks contrast.   The following was written by a customer:  This is a good camera, and I love the automatic mode. I have had mine for a few years now and it does an excellent job of capturing bright and dark scenes in a low light situation. However, the auto mode does not do a good job of taking good, clear pictures of the action. With this camera, I take pictures of my dog and then look up and down the street to try to figure out what is going on.  You have just reviewed one of the best budget point-and-shoots ever!

But the speaker is loud and I can still hear the song. So I guess my review is that a great value is not worth a bad product.

But the adapter works so slow that the audio is cut off after about 15-20 minutes of continuous music. It also has no auto-play on and no sound indicator so I have to play it twice (the first time it plays fine the second time it doesn't). I am pretty frustrated with the audio quality. I paid less than $40 for it but I don't want to listen to music on my tablet or laptop so I will be keeping my money for something else.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     The battery would not hold a charge even at full charge. The device was just a mess to use. I tried it for 30 days straight and it would randomly crash with the volume turned down. The instructions say to use it every night with the device on, but it wouldn't do that. The best thing I did was unplug it every once in a while and try to get some work done. This is a terrible product. I can't recommend it.   I purchased this item to replace a broken phone, but I'm disappointed. The phone I had was also cheap and unreliable, so it was a no-brainer to buy this item. After using it for 3 days and experiencing constant issues, I decided it was time to purchase a new phone. It has no storage and no memory. The battery wouldn't hold a charged charge even when I used it for a month. The interface is extremely sluggish. The camera also has poor battery life. It works, but is not great. I'll only be using this for emergency calls, but after 3 days of using this I think I'll go back to my old phone. I am very disappointed with the product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a pretty good product. The sound quality is not what you expect from a speaker system. I have one that sounds better than this. That is probably due to the fact that it is a Yamaha. It does not have the same kind of "boom" that a Yamaha speaker has. I like that it has an auto-on switch (even if it did have a switch, I think it would not work as well as this does), and the volume controls are also nice. The only drawback I can think of is that the button for the auto-off is very small. If it was bigger I would have liked to be able to turn off all but the most demanding music and movies. Overall it is ok, and has a good volume range. It is also small enough to carry around with you. The volume is adjustable, so it can be as loud as you want without having to turn it up all the way.  Style of music:  The best is the music I have played on it. The guitar is really heavy, like a real guitar. It also sounds amazing, even at low volume. It has a nice low end that gives me a lot of clarity. Overall, a good, good sound.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After reading reviews of this product I can honestly say that this device is a complete failure in almost all categories.   A $50 device is $50.  You can't expect a high quality product for that kind of money.  The sound quality is subpar at best.  I bought this device for a friend, not expecting anything special.  He wanted a portable device to take on the go so I went with this.  This thing barely played music at all.  It can't hold a charge at all, the battery is almost completely drained after an hour of playing.  Overall not a good purchase for the money.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed is that the keyboard is quite big. There's no way I could type on a touchpad in the tiny windowless compartment, so this must be some kind of laptop keyboard. I'm not used to it but the quality is very good. I found the touchpad to be great.   One problem is that I use a lot of internet and instant messaging programs: Microsoft Word, Facebook, Google Docs, etc. When you have a lot going on, it gets difficult to move back and forth between programs.

The keyboard was also very very very bad. The keys were very very stiff and scratchy, and the keys were a little too close together.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You get what you pay for.   It is a great device, but it needs updates on all the buttons.  They need to get rid of the one-touch down.  There is a little stick on the screen that holds it in place, but you can't press down on it to go home.  The screen does not auto-power off when you are not using it.  I would give it 5 stars, but the battery life is about 1 hour, which is less than a good charger.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My friend bought me the X1 when it was first released. I found it extremely flimsy. It was pretty good until you got used to holding it and then realized that your hands were never very free to do anything else. The X2 was definitely better, but the X2 still felt like it wasn't much thicker than a $20 paperback book when in fact it is considerably more expensive. A little more plastic should be expected, as with most electronic devices, but it's still a pretty bad investment.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this I was a little concerned as I had had the same issue with my iPhone 5s. The device itself is very good, but the charger cable does not work on the iPhone 5. Also the instructions for plugging in the device are not well written and you have to get creative if you want to actually charge it. The price is right, but just be sure you have a car adapter to use with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The Samsung Galaxy Note7 has an absolutely terrible screen quality. The back of the phone is totally glossy and has a dull red color to it. The phone is not waterproof (I didn't notice it when I initially took it out of the box, but it's very obvious when you first open it) and the device is completely unresponsive to touch, even though I put my finger on a spot on the screen. It's really annoying when the phone will just turn itself off if you put your finger on something. The screen is so bright that it makes reading on a white background a pain, and it will constantly be shifting around between a dark color and a white color, which isn't a good thing. I can't use this as my primary device, so I'd like to see Samsung replace the screen with a phone that has a good color balance, doesn't glow in the dark, has a brighter backlight, is waterproof, is responsive to touch and has low input lag. I will probably never recommend a Samsung phone again because of this screen.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It worked fine for a couple of years. Then one day it would stop working. It had no power. The battery would go flat.   I tried everything in the world to get the battery to stop working and nothing worked.  The company's response:  Well it seems like you have an original Apple I am sure that it is in good shape and will be repaired and returned to you.  This may not be the first Apple I have bought, but it is the most disappointing product  I've ever bought  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first started using this, I used it for the entire day without any problem. I then tried to use it to listen to the radio, which didn't work because the power cable was too long.   I then bought a longer extension cable, and used it this weekend to listen back to the AM Radio. It works well but the wire has a slight resistance.  I then bought some extra wires, and I am sure this is only a short-coming, because it worked for the radio.  This is a nice unit and I can't find anything wrong with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had this for over a year. It was okay, but then came a major downfall in the form of the microUSB charging port being incompatible with my iPad. The only way I could use the device with the iPad is to turn the iPad on with it turned to airplane mode. The USB port also does not allow for the USB cable to be plugged into a computer through the USB port.    Review of DJI Inspire 1 2 Review by Paul I just got the Inspire 2 and it's awesome! I am flying and filming and everything is awesome. The one issue is that it is a bit heavy at 300 grams. The first thing you will notice is that the DJI camera is on top with the remote on the left side of the top plate. The second thing is you need the box to mount it on a drone and the box is a huge thing and it makes the whole machine hard to use. Once it's all setup on the box its a great device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit was so slow that I thought I had broken it, the unit could not load a game I had purchased and even after a week of use it wouldn't work, so I returned it and received a much much better unit from another manufacturer.   I will never buy a Sony product again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's really the biggest fail of the year.   I don't know what happened, but the battery died in less than an hour with the keyboard on.  I had to get it out of the computer so it could be replaced, and the replacement battery was half dead as well.  The USB ports are useless, and they have no protection against the computer being turned on accidentally. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've been using this speaker for a few months and I'm very disappointed. I can't stand the way the woofer is made. The sound quality is terrible and has no depth. The volume is also too low for a music system. I bought the sound bar for use with my computer and the sound from the speaker can't be heard over the sound effects on my computer. This is a very basic unit that should not be used with a computer system. The subwoofer unit does not produce much bass either. The quality of the audio components is not enough to justify the cost of the unit. This speaker is very low quality. I would recommend that people looking for a computer speaker go with a speaker from another manufacturer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -   I'm going to start this review by saying this is by far the worst product I have ever used, and that I have tried several of these before and they have all been pretty much the same. The problem is it can't connect to your phone. When you try to connect it to your iPhone or Android device the thing hangs up every single time, even when I get to an internet connection I have problems. So you have a phone that you want to use but you can't because your battery is dying.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The best thing I would say about this speaker is that there is very little heft to it, it is very small and very light and very easy to carry around. The only real negative I would give it is that the battery lasted about three or four hours and then I had to replace it, I would recommend getting a replacement battery from Amazon though.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery life is fine until the battery dies.   I also found that the button that sets it to standby was poorly implemented and hard to use.  I used to set the phone up for overnight use and I would wake up in the middle of the night and find the screen blank.  Even in sleep mode you can't use the button for a couple hours.  This has been an issue since the first iPhone came out.  And in general the battery life sucks.  Other than that it's okay.  There is some lag in the camera, but I don't see that on my tablet.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my second Samsung. The first one was a Samsung Galaxy S3 Edge. I have had it for 4 years, worked great then the batteries started dying. After reading the other reviews here I decided to try another Samsung model. This is a nice device but I will try a few more Samsung models next. It is just not very practical as a laptop replacement.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device works, but the way the battery dies makes you think of an old transistor radio. When you first get it, it works and you can use it for a few months or a year before it goes dead. You don't even have to charge it up because it comes with a USB plug. That is why it is the #3 most useful gadget in my room, the only one I use almost every day. I have used it to connect my MP3 player to the TV for listening to music and to charge my cell phone. I use it to control my TV, to check the time and to make phone calls from the computer. I've bought two, one for my bedroom and one for the kitchen.   I wish it had a removable battery or a separate power source like a portable charger. I can plug it into my laptop or my phone when I'm working at home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They should be using cheaper components. Not only does it fail in the middle of the night (and I bought it to have to take it back in and get a new one)   But it also doesn't support all the features that I bought for it:  The micro usb port was broken, and the battery was leaking. The bluetooth connection is the only thing that still works; so I had to buy a new cord and bluetooth device   This was all while using it as a mobile phone, as well as my phone.   The battery lasts for a day before giving out. I've had to wait days for them to replace the battery on my other phone; and even then, the phone would randomly reboot itself.  The bluetag is terrible, and can only be used on the phone when the phone is in your pocket:  I didn't even realize until later that the Bluetooth icon for my phone had been switched to another icon (the text-to-speech icon) 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only con I can think of is it doesn't take up a lot of room, and if you don't use it, it's just another phone. I'm getting the Blackberry Passport now, but I want to keep a lot on the go, and this just won't fit in my pocket.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There is a small amount of software that should be improved to make the device more user friendly. The main problems are the high price, the small screen and the fact that you have to use a USB cable to connect it. I think it is a good device for the price. I would have given it a 5 star rating if not for the fact I have to plug a cable in to use it. But for the $80 it's a great device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a chance to own an Apple iPad 2 about a year ago. I am a very frustrated writer. I do a lot of writing, and I don't want a new device just for writing.   After purchasing a couple new iMacs to replace my aging Macbook Pros,   The   Apple   iPad   was so disappointing that I sold mine and bought a Samsung Galaxy S III.  The screen was so small and the trackpad so difficult to use. I was disappointed in both   product and Samsung.  After reading many other reviews   on Apple, Samsung,  Apple is not helping their   customers.  I bought a refurbished unit from an Apple Authorized Reseller and it worked perfect for the first few months. Then the screen and trackpad started acting funny. They sent a repair guy out. They told me he was out on a long business trip.  They said the new   units were being built and that I should just pay for the ones that are defective.  It took a month to get them to fix it so I bought another   Samsung   from a different retailer and that worked great.  If you are considering purchasing an   iPhone   or a Samsung  Samsung, just don't.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a bad device. I bought this because of the low price and how durable it was. It has a few defects, but otherwise, a good price for a low quality product. First, there is a plastic ring in the bottom of the device that can catch on the floor and damage the device, or leave a sticky residue. Second, the battery life is terrible. It only gets 5 hours of use out of the 1 hour charged, but that is probably because it is a battery powered device, not a battery charger. The charger can only charge it for 30 minutes at a time, which makes it too expensive for me to use. The bottom of this thing doesn't line up with the side of the box or it will come loose. I don't know if it is because of manufacturing or because the manufacturer doesn't know what a consumer is looking for, but you will probably have to buy a separate cord to plug into the device to get it to work. All in all, this is a cheap piece of plastic that you can buy, but don't bother unless you want a cord.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have always been a lover of Apple products but my recent purchase of the iPod nano just seems to be a waste of money. I am an avid digital photographer and have bought several other Apple products that have performed very well but not the iPod. I did my research and the latest generation of the nano is no longer offered with the nano included. It is also not the first generation nano but a new model. What I was looking for was a portable music player with decent sound quality but only a 3 hour battery life. The iPod nano seemed to be the perfect solution. However, I had to get another one after receiving the first one and the batteries last about 30 hours before they have to be replaced. I'm disappointed with Apple and this company. I have heard that I can get a refund, but that's all I care about because I can always find another iPod.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dan from Great little player This is a very well built player that has great sound quality. I just bought one to use with my video camera but the batteries lasted much longer then expected. You can't beat it for the price.  The unit is a little bit larger than I expected. I would recommend that you buy a case for it as it is fairly bulky. But it performs great. It has a built in mic and the battery life is very good. I do recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice quality portable player to go with their video camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this gadget to replace my old laptop in April 2015. It was not very reliable. It would freeze up after a week and a half of use and would only run for a couple hours.   The first time I used it, I put my son to work and the laptop wouldn't come up for hours. This time, it turned on immediately. My son had to shut it down and reboot. That wasn't smart because the thing was getting hot and it was making the old laptop feel outdated and outdated. I've since bought an iMac and have gotten the same experience with it. It's not very good.

She is not a phone person so buying a phone that is supposed to be reliable has been a bit of a challenge. The phone arrived and she is using it for a few months now. The device is very solid. The audio and picture is not great but it works. I have a cell phone at home but this is my first computer so I'm having a difficult time comparing this to a new phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     If I could give this an A/B it would be a 5 star. This is a quality product at a very good price. I am in the process of replacing my old phone with this one and I'm very happy with it. However, I am disappointed that the screen is not glass like my iPhone 4. It's not as slippery, but it is less durable (you can bend it). The size and weight is just right for my needs. I can't speak much to the sound quality, as I have no use for speakerphones. However this is not as loud as my iPhone. In addition, I have only listened to a couple songs so far on it so I have not done much testing. However my older phone had a better speakers so I can only assume that this phone is not that great. The app that comes with it is a little clunky, but that's not a bad thing for someone just getting into digital music. Overall, I like my phone and don't want to replace it because of my disappointment with this product.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This review is for the "CAT5" (CAT/5) cable and the connector that comes with it. I bought this to plug a digital camera into the computer I use to do my research for a job. The connector is very thin, and doesn't match the size of the other parts that go in the digital camera. I didn't realize this until I got it to work, but when the camera was set up in the computer, it would not let me plug it into the camera, as there is only 1 "A" in the cable (which is not used by the camera), and the camera's battery was not plugged in (not sure what this means).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love my new e-mail application. I've been using it for over 2 years now and love it. It is very simple and works well. Unfortunately, the e-mails it sends are terrible. It won't send emails with subject lines and other formatting things that you expect from e-Mail programs. It just makes a jumbled mess and sometimes the attachment is a plain text file. It's frustrating because the email program I use for e-Mails is far better than this one. I bought the other e- Mail App and it just made it worse. So I switched to e-Email. But after 2 years of using it, I want the original e- mail. This app is great for simple tasks like updating a resume but it doesn't do anything for my daily life.

I bought two because of the price, but if I am ever given a mission to carry one, I will only use it as a back-up. A simple, but lacking feature, the small size and light weight.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     It's pretty, but that's about it. This thing is so small and the software is very limited.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used my iPhone to listen to music, but it is too weak to drive my MP3 player at all. The buttons, the volume knob, the display, and the battery life is about what you expect from a $100-200 device. The music player and phone app seem pretty useless. I have the same issues with my iPod.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I would highly recommend the device if you want a simple way to watch movies from the car. However, you have to wait until it's charged up, because I noticed a short time after I plugged it in the unit became very hot to the touch (I'm thinking about it at night after a long day, so that could be a problem). Other than that, it's a great gadget that just works.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased two Apple Watch Series 2 watches. The first one lasted only a few days after a single charge. The second lasted three weeks. The watch has not kept the time. It needs a battery replacement and a second watch with longer battery life. I would have been better off with a standard watch that had a longer battery and a GPS.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (5/10)   I had a very difficult time finding a way to connect my iPod (and I have had some serious difficulties finding the right cables in the past) to this device. I have a lot of gadgets and was hoping this would work. I plugged it in to my computer with my cables, but it wouldn't recognize it at all. It just keeps rebooting and rebooting until I connect it. I think this could be a good device for a teenager, or an older person, if they have a really limited budget, because it has a ton of music on it, and a lot more than just your average music player does. It's not the best looking device, but the color and design make it more appealing. I just don't think it's worth spending $60-$80 for it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The most frustrating thing about this product is that the remote is just a normal TV remote. It has a volume control and a skip back button. When I press the skip back, the menu pops back up, but not the video. This remote control is useless and needs to be redone, as it's really hard to navigate the menu to get to what you want to watch. This thing just can't be used. I have to press a button to access a "list of movies" and then manually go through all the titles to choose the one I want. The volume control doesn't really work because when I get the video playing, I have the volume down all the way and have to re-press the button in order to turn the volume up. This is another reason why I gave the X1F a 1.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This piece of junk is a waste of time and money. If you're going to spend money, buy the real thing    Reviewer: dannyp - favorite favorite favorite - July 16, 2009  Subject: Bad review, but that's the way you write about reviews... As always, this is a pretty good, good quality recording. I do have a few quibbles. First, it's a shame that the guitar has no tuning markings - I would have preferred to see a "T" on the first string. The second is the guitar sound (the same thing is said about the CD). It sounds really good, but it's more like a transistor radio or some other small instrument. There is no way that it could be played on a bass- it sounds like it would be overdriven at best. - July16, 2009Bad review,  Review: No Sound to this at all! The audio quality is very poor here, I couldn't tell the songs from the intro to the actual tune! It has no musicality at all, and the guitar player has no taste. The only way I can say this is good is that it is for the most part an enjoyable record!  This is one of those songs you should be playing along to when someone comes by and asks you to play something on the guitar, if you have ever tried to play one. - May 11, 2009No Sound to that at all
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device, my first laptop, didn't work all that well when it came time to upgrade. The processor had a bit of a hard time starting up, so it could be a bit slow in the beginning. I'm fairly certain this was a design flaw with the hardware. The sound was very lacking when playing the games in the library. It's a very good product for the price point, but I wouldn't recommend it as a general purpose laptop. If you're on a budget, you'll probably be fine with this, but if you're looking for a high-end device for gaming and/or serious productivity, you're probably better off with something like the HP Pavilion dm1-2020 or Dell XPS 12 for more horsepower and support for better software applications.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the worst things I did in the past couple years was get this device.   I had a "good" Sony Ericsson for awhile.  The problem with this device is that the touchscreen is so sensitive that when I try to tap it, the screen literally flashes.  You can't do anything on the screen because it's so sensitive, and sometimes you can't even read the letters on the keyboard because the screen flash too quickly.  I don't understand how this thing is worth $50, but it isn't.  Posted by Chris at 11:28 AM
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is just a basic, underpowered unit. Not much else to say about it. It's a good product if you're looking for an inexpensive MP3 player. It does a good job of getting the files you need and a good bit of compression, but a little too limited in the storage capacity to be useful. For what it's worth, the product is well made and is not very heavy at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing that really irks me is that when I turned on the thing, it would go to sleep. It kept switching back and forth from sleep mode to hibernation mode without letting me know when it was actually awake. The phone also wouldn't wake up when I started to go to a friend's house, so it was just sitting there looking like a dead mouse.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The quality of this is not on par with a $100 USB hub. The connector was loose and the cable was poorly sleeved. In addition, the software interface was horrible for a device that cost $150.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received a defective ipod that was so hard to set up that I had to return it. When I went to return the ipod, it was packaged up with a $30 gift card (it had already been purchased). When I called to have it refunded I was told that I would have to pay return shipping. If I did not have that money, I would not have received the ipad. The return shipment arrived, but it was broken. I was given the option to send it back or send a new ipod as long as I paid return shipping fees. I chose the latter. I also received a $25 gift card and a $20 gift card, which I thought was just a one off gift.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A horrible electronic device. You should stay away from these.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If I could give the product 0 stars, I would.   There are a few things to be said about this product, including some of the poor customer service I received.  The product arrived broken, I called to complain and the agent said "I'm sorry, but the product is not damaged".  When I brought it into the repair department, the supervisor told me she wouldn't get involved until the product was fixed.  I finally got a refund and received a brand new one, but that was only because my store told me I needed to return the broken one.  Another customer reported that the unit doesn't recognize her credit card (or any kind of card for that matter).   I contacted the company to find out what the problem was and they said they would send me an "in-box" with all the information needed.  After getting the information, I sent an e-mail stating I would need to send the card to be activated. They told me that I couldn't send it by e- mail because the machine is not in my home and I would have to come down to the store to get it. I was then told to send it in the mail and wait for a pickup.  I ended up taking off work to come in to have my card activated. The machine does accept credit cards but I was never able to make a purchase with it. The repair department claims the problem is the battery and the cable that runs from it.  They told my phone company that the phone was receiving a signal, but it couldn't be picked up on any phone in my house.  It does not appear to be a problem with the phone.  On a side note, I was told they could not accept a return or refund.  When calling the company, they said I had to pay shipping for the faulty unit back to the manufacturer.  Since I am a new customer and did not receive the product I paid for in a timely manner I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and a small business association.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this computer for about a year now and I have used it for work, as a hobby and as a reference to work and how well it works. It's an awesome system and one of the best in it's category of productivity devices.   The only thing it really suffers from is the battery life.  It will run for a couple of hours for what it is, if you have nothing to do and get it done, or work for a few hours before it is needed again. The only reason I bought it was that I want it for my own use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's hard to say if this has the quality of an iPad or even a cheap netbook.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing has been in my life since I was a kid.  I'm about 40 now, and since I've been married (long time), and I've had 3 children (and a fourth on the way) it's been in the house the majority of the time.  There is always the risk that it will go berserk.  Sometimes it does, and when that happens you'll feel like you are back in the dark ages.  The biggest problem is that, due to a design flaw, it won't power up on its own.  This is a really annoying problem because you have to have a screwdriver to turn the knob on the back of the thing to allow the thing's batteries to recharge.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the G4 version a few days ago and I have to say I'm not impressed with it. The keyboard is awful. I have problems with it's touchpad but the touchpad itself is really slow, it moves too fast for me to be able to use it well. The trackpad is pretty much unusable though, there's too much interference when I try to click anything and the gestures are pretty useless. The whole thing is like my iPad 2. It's not bad by any means, but the hardware is just not very good for what I need it for. If they can make better keyboards and trackpads, that would be great. Overall I'm giving it 2 stars as I don't think they have really thought about what they should be doing. But if you really want a cheap mobile keyboard that can use Apple's keyboard, I guess this is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The batteries die after about a year. This means that the device isn't very rechargeable and is going to waste battery power.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is an amazing device that is very easy to use. However, the product does not seem to like the original batteries that came with the item. It seems to die after a while after using it for a while.   I ordered 2 of these and the first one died and the replacement one didn't hold a charge long enough. The replacement ones would hold a little longer but the first would die after using for about 2 months. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So for the most part, I got the same feeling I got on the first day.   It doesn't seem to like the first power-up, it does not like any power it's given for several minutes and then it doesn't like any more, even a light touch.  The second day was better.  At the end, I found the whole set with its extra USB cables and power cables and all its different things in a box that was too heavy and didn't quite fit in my pocket.  It took me to my local electronics store to get it replaced.  So far, it's been great for me but it still leaves something to be desired.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am new to this world of gadgets.   This is my first electronic gadget, so I am a little rusty on the ins and outs of electronics.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In my experience, the Zune does the best job of integrating music with my current set-up. The Zune has good support for media on-the-go, which is a necessity for my lifestyle. The software is not a problem, but I'd be wary about getting the Zunes on sale. I really think this is an inferior product by Microsoft and that they should have continued making the Z-Sonic instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this in hopes that it would help with the fact that I have extremely bad eyesight. I would like to say that it does help with that (as well as my other eyes), but only after I was using a computer for a couple of weeks, so it is not a long term solution. It is still quite expensive, but so much better than the computer that I could not live without. I had to get a magnifier/screen magnifier just to see the letters on the screen... it's so tiny and I have to look very closely to read my emails and letters.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This thing works okay but not great.   I use it for my iPhone and it only holds one battery charge.  After the first couple of days of not using it, the screen had started to turn white and then black.  This was an early version.  One of my friends told me about a better device.  I got it and have had no problems.  A friend that has the same brand had the same issue.  My advice is to purchase a newer model.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I've bought several of these and I've had to put them back at the first sign of problems. I bought it as a joke. It is a good idea in theory - you can play it by a light in your house. You can use it for your cell phone, but it can't take a sound. I use it to play my ipod or my ipad. It can't play the music off my ipods. It cannot take the sound off my cell phone. I'm sure it could, but I wanted to have music on my ipoda, so I would have music playing for a good walk. But I had to return it. I also bought it to use as a portable speaker for my iPod (I have the iphone 4s) but since then I have not been able to get it to work. And it does not have an ipod mount (I don't know why) so I can't mount the ipod on it. In fact the ipods and iphones won't work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love my new   iPad. The battery life is excellent.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge is the most beautiful phone I've ever seen, but it has the worst screen on a phone I'm aware of. The screen seems like it is made from a thin plastic sheet that has a thin layer of reflective coating. When the screen becomes dark, the reflection from the reflective coating is so vivid that it becomes hard to distinguish from the phone's glass screen. The phone has also experienced other problems. Some people have reported that the battery life is less than usual, and Samsung has been working on improving it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit works fine on the first try but after a couple minutes, the device just won't connect to the Internet. I have tried resetting the router, removing the battery and resetting again. Still not connecting. This is definitely not worth the money, and a total waste of time.   It's ok but, not for the long haul:  My brother-in-law bought a router (the DIR-871N), and we installed it in his house with my blessing. It's been good. But, we're going to move to another house soon, and the new home will probably not have broadband, so he's looking into a Netgear AC1650 router (model AC1645) that's advertised as a multi-room device. He wants to be able to access his home and office on the go. My advice, get a multiroom one, or buy a NetGear, which I haven't seen yet. The unit does the job and my brother- in-law is going to keep it for a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have an iMac in an ultraportable case that has a built-in Apple keyboard and a non-USB headphone socket.   It works well enough, but it is very un-optimized. The built- in Apple keyboard is very sensitive and almost too sensitive for my taste.  It is very hard to click on keys, you need to press very hard with a stiff object to get them to register on the keyboard.  A single click from a rubber mouse would register a key.  I've never had this problem with an external keyboard or a mouse.  On a tablet, the touch screen is very touchy and sensitive. It has no noticeable lag, but the touch pad is very mushy (you could say it's a touch keyboard with no keys) and can be very annoying to click buttons on.  This is not a very good use of a tablet.  (The iMac has a slightly better built--in keyboard. The keyboard is too sensitive and has no keys to click.)  The built in headphone socket can't be used, the built- ins aren't very robust, and it has a really low volume.  To make things worse, the headphone jack is so small that you can't use headphones with the iMac (but a couple of good headphones work with it).   These are all features I would normally consider "good", but are a huge disappointment to me.  The iMac works well for basic tasks, but is totally over-powered and clunky for any type of entertainment.  For a computer this expensive, they should have used USB dongles.  Update:  The "Booting" button isn't working for me anymore (or maybe it's just me, but I cannot type any longer at all). I have found that if you hit "Start" to start up your Mac, the "Start"-button is not displayed at all.  Note that when I do get my Mac back, it seems to be fine.  There are some good posts on this topic on reddit:  http://www.reddit.com/r/iMac/comments/22pjnj/the_macbook_pro_should_be_booting_up_to_you_instead/
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's really great. I really like the fact that it's a USB and can be used to play music off of a USB. It's also great for charging a phone. However, my biggest problem is the fact there's no audio output jack. I purchased this primarily to plug in to my iPod and play my music. However the headphone jack is also provided, so the only way to get music out is to take off your headphones and plug into the USB. You can't even get an audio signal from your computer to the headphone if you're running on the USB port. I also have a Sony headphones, but the jack has a much larger diameter and my earbuds can't get plugged into them if I'm not using the USB adapter.  Would I purchase it again: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very pleased with this product but not a very long time. After it was installed and working properly, I found that the buttons do not go back to home when pressed. The button that goes to home was moved to the left of the button I was using to turn it on.   When I pressed the button to turn on the unit, I did not have a continuous power on. I could not power it on to turn off the power. The light flashes but there is no light on. When I switched the unit on I had to get the power supply out.  So this unit is very simple and easy to use but the buttons cannot be used to turn the power back on. The fact that this product is very inexpensive is very nice but the simple use can be improved. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I'm not a big fan of the idea of the E5. It just doesn't seem that powerful, the batteries do seem to run out quickly and it's bulky to say the least. The keyboard is also extremely poor.   It would be a lot easier if the keys were just a little bigger and were separated by a separate membrane. It's very hard to type with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only positive thing about this is that it is small. When it's not in use, I don't want it on the table in front of me. If I wanted to use it, I'd have to take the case off and hold the button. I have no desire to use this thing in a crowded environment. The build quality is terrible. The battery is a joke. I replaced the battery in it a few months ago and it was already dead.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is the same as the other one I bought a long time ago, a cheap plastic one. Very low quality. The "button" on the bottom doesn't work. I have to stick my finger down through the bottom so it doesn't press anything, but that's it. I bought the "old style" version, the ones with the two buttons. One is for "power", the other is for the "stop" button which doesn't do anything. This one is cheap plastic.  Review of DJ0270-063 Submitted By: josh k - Verified Buyer I was pleasantly surprised to find this receiver at a very good price, I've been using the older style in the past. I had purchased a Pioneer RCD-RX, and it would not recognize the new receiver. I am happy to report that the Xone X1 has not failed me. I listened to the X1 using my previous unit and did not experience any problems. I will give the X One Xone the benefit of the doubt and assume that I was receiving a defective unit. I was, however, very satisfied with this purchase and will be buying more from this company. Thanks!  My new favorite! Submitted On: 02/12/2008 12:01:34 PM PDT

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I bought this a few months ago to replace my iStick 75w. I loved the sound it made and the quality of the material. Then I tried to charge it and the battery quit. I gave it a shot for a few days and finally it quit again. The company I bought it from replaced it and it was good for a year, I thought, then I went back and bought the iStik 75w, which works flawlessly, although the battery can go dead before the i Stik is done charging. I'll buy it again only because I just received it from the post office.   I received my order yesterday (6/25) and it's already done shipping. I put it inside my iMac and it doesn't appear to be leaking, but I'm not sure, I don't like to be careful when placing items in my i-Mac! I have two more iSticks, but the quality is different so I won't buy them again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product worked fine for a year or so. Then the screen went out at work. This was not an emergency situation, and I was not calling customer support.   A friend who had just returned the phone called customer support, and the sales representative said that the phone could be returned to a local Verizon store, but the customer had to pay a return fee, which the company would pay. The call ended without a solution.  After that the screen kept turning off, so the battery was constantly draining.  No matter how many times I restarted the phone (which takes the battery out of the phone and places it in a new one), it kept turning back on and off and on.  The sales rep also said that it could be the phone's fault (a dead battery). The salesman said that they were sorry, and he had a warranty on the phone for about $400.  When I said that was only $50 less than buying a new phone at full retail, the salesman said he would get me a new product, but that I would have to pay $600 (including a deductible).  I was getting so frustrated that I asked him to not give me an answer.  Customer service is great for the phone company (Verizon)    Was this review helpful? Yes No
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's pretty cool to play games using a phone. However, the screen is not very bright and it's rather blurry. The phone isn't that bad compared to other cheap phones (even though it's too cheap to be useful). I'd prefer a big, bright, super-bright LCD screen.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this to replace my old keyboard. The keys were difficult to type on, and the new keys were too close together for my comfort. A few weeks after I got it, I noticed the keys would jump around so much I couldn't work my fingers well. And the device's buttons were too stiff.    Good but has some serious issues:      Good, cheap, and functional keyboard with no issues whatsoever. The only issue I had with it was that the keys start to stick to each other a little bit. I just have to go over to the corner of my desk to type and keep them straight. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As someone that likes to travel with a pocket computer, this is definitely a deal breaker. The fact that there is no software available for any reason is also a deal breaker, even though a full OS may be able to solve this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The price is right, but that little bit of dust between the casing and the inside of the device, that you have to clean, is a deal breaker.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It works, and it sounds great!   A few bugs here and there.   But, I can't say that there's anything wrong with it.  The only bad thing that I had was, when you insert the CD that the audio didn't play properly until I restarted the game. That would be the only negative.   Rated 5 out of 5 by johndoe from Awesome I've owned about 10 different consoles and PC's, mostly PC's. This system, along with the 360 and PS3, are the best I've ever owned. Not only does this system run well, the sound is amazing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I can get more for cheaper, and the 3d tv is good, but I just really like the ps4's sound and that's all I really care about.  Review Summary:  This is a really nice unit. Good sound and screen. It also works really well with an ethernet cable.  It's also a very light and easy to carry in your pocket. The Good:  The sound is wonderful. The ability to get 3d television is a nice feature. The console can be set up with different games on a DVD.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device is good but the price is not.    It has a problem: I bought this to use with my 3D printer and I've had no luck. I'm using my printer to print some prototype designs and I get a constant error. When I press the hot switch it turns on the printer but I'm getting a "failed to connect" error. I've tried resetting the printer and turning it off and back on but that's the only thing I can get it to work. I hope someone will help me as the price of this printer has increased considerably since I got it.  Works very well! Bought it on a whim when I couldn't find a 3D Printer. I haven't had any problems using it yet. It was a good price and works great!  Good Purchase Received the printer within a week of ordering, and it's actually a very good machine. The only thing is that it has a "backwards" setting on the control panel, but I like the forward/backward one. The printing is very fast, and I can print a very large model with little trouble.  and very good price! It's been a great purchase  Failed to upload model I used my new printer to make a small wooden toy for my son, which I had made up in Blender. After printing and mounting the model on the bed, I noticed the model was missing the right bit. I followed the instructions for the missing bit, and the model came out fine. I could not get the model to print, as I expected to. I opened the file in Gcode editor and used the "U" key to erase the bit and then re-inserted it. Nothing happened, which was strange as I was able to use the "J" key on the Gcode program to change the setting on how many threads were used (10, which seems to be the default) and I noticed that when I re-printed the model, I got the same error. It turns out I've left the machine on while I used the printer to take a photo, and when I shut the machine off, the file was gone. I was very worried about this and am a bit miffed that I missed it!  on the "Failed To Create Model" screen after re-using the missing piece. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As you can see from the photos, this unit does not appear to be built well. It's just a bad looking box with no features and no functionality. No buttons, no power on/off, no display, nothing. When you turn the switch to turn it on, you have to push a button on the top of the unit before the switch turns off. It also takes too long to turn on or off and turns on too slowly to be useful.   I have to turn this thing on all the time now and I am only using it when my TV is out.  I am so disappointed with this unit.  My Samsung LCD TV works better than this device and for about $40 less.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an awesome product. You really can control the volume with a few clicks. However, the sound quality is not as good as some other audio devices I have used. I purchased this to add some punch to my Yamaha music system and it does what it's supposed to do. The only con that I have is that the battery is not very long lasting. It would be much better to have an AC adapter to use the unit as a power source.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very nice audio I have this in my Yamaha RX-V8R. It works flawlessly and is super loud and clear. I also used this to drive my Yamaha SP-12X. It's extremely easy to get this set up with my receiver. ,  ,,  ,,,  I'm not one to use a subwoofer for music because of the lack of bass but I found myself using it for movies for its huge sound and volume! So far, the only problem I have had is that my sub is loud in its own right but it still works best with the subwoofers. It is so loud that it will not be able to drive the amplifier properly when the receiver is powered off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works for the most part. The speaker comes on but the sound is weak. The backlight doesn't work either, it is on or off for me. The software that comes with it is horrible. If I am trying to use a game, for example, it can be very difficult. For me, the sound in a game that has music has a much better quality. For a gaming device, I would get another unit if I had the cash.  Posted by Michael B in Mobile Gaming at 12:14 PM
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to go along with my iPod Touch 5G and had it for about 5 months. After the first couple of days it started acting up, making my iPod unusable.   Then after a couple of weeks it just stopped working completely. I am very unhappy with the product and the customer service has been terrible. It took me two phone calls, which I was told to be polite and courteous, to get them to acknowledge that the unit may be faulty, and that I should contact Apple.  That did not happen until after I sent them a second, very detailed, and very honest email.  The problem was not the product itself, but that it was defective. The fact that I had to send the defective unit back for a replacement was unfortunate, but I was under the impression that the customer care department was there to help.  After two phone call and two emails, I called a second time because I didn't understand why my email was not being responded to. I asked about the quality of the phone support and they said that they had been unable to respond to my initial emails and that they didn't know where the defective part was that I sent. They said that the part was sent back to Apple, and not that they were sending a new one.  The only thing that made me feel better was that the replacement was very well made.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (not kidding!)   I am not a fan of this company. I purchased a new Samsung 4.1" HDTV a few weeks ago and received it only 3 days after ordering. The TV is ok and I've been happy with the TV and the service. However, the cable TV that comes with the television was crap and the remote was bad. I'm not gonna call to complain or anything but I have a friend who has this exact TV and also has to send the remote back because of the poor remote. And she hasn't even had a chance to use it yet! I don't blame the tv company at all for this but I hope that when the remote comes in the mail it will be better. Also, the HDTV is fine and works fine. I can't see how it's all connected in the same box so that makes no sense.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound on my iBook is not very good. It's the exact same as my old iBook from 2004. It is not the worst sound on an iBook (though the sound is better than what i'm used to).    Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from A Good Book I bought this book on recommendation from a friend (who owns an iBooks). He said it would be a good book to show students how to manage their Apple iBooks library. This book is not bad at all but it's not really a very good book either. The layout is not that user-friendly and the information is just not very well written and the author tries to make a very complex subject (iBooks) sound like a simple subject (bookmarks) by explaining that all iBooks are organized by bookmarks but in fact iBooks has no concept of bookmarks. I found this book difficult to navigate and read because of the very small font and the formatting of the book. There is also a huge amount of information in the book about using the iBook library but nothing on how to use iBooks.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This keyboard is so cheap!   It can only be used by people with extremely poor eyesight.     Rated 1 out of 5 by John from Disappointed in this product I've purchased this keyboard a few times from different computer vendors but I am disappointed in this device. I have tried to install it in a laptop computer but it is only a very weak keyboard with a mouse port. I could only use it as a keyboard for reading a document on a laptop. I am a software engineer, and this keyboard is clearly meant to be used to enter commands into a computer without any typing on the computer. This is disappointing because this keyboard was advertised as being "high quality". It is disappointing that my money would be used on a product which does not meet the promise it made. I would recommend you get another keyboard from a different vendor. I bought this for about $50 and it is disappointing.  by Mark from Washington DC I have been using this keypad with my computer for about a year and a half. I use it for writing documents, web pages, and programs in word and notepad. It's good for writing articles that require a lot of words, like a textbook or something. There is a lot to this product and it's difficult to get to know where each key is located on the keypad. The fact that it's a keypad is a plus though, because there's no physical keyboard involved. Also, the color and style is nice. The only thing that bothers me about the keyboard is that the rubber grips on the side are difficult to grip. I think it's pretty simple to hold it in your hand and it looks good. Overall, the keyboard itself is not bad. The typing is fast and accurate.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After I bought this thing, the first day of using it, the display on the watch said that it was "on," but when I went to see the display, it was off. I thought I was being really clever, but after calling back the company to get a replacement, the lady on the phone said "it's a warranty issue," and then it came back. No way to fix this, I don't understand why they still sell it as an "Android Watch" and call it "Android Wear".   Noise issues:     The noise issue, which is why the watch comes with a case, is a bit of a joke. There is an "always on" noise, when the phone is ringing. That doesn't happen to the watch, but when the watch is on it rings constantly. I'm not sure if it's normal or not, but if this was a more powerful watch with a higher output, I could live with it.  It has a low screen resolution:  I own several Android Wear watches. I've only had to charge one, so I'm going to give this one a good review. However, in order to review the other ones I own, I'll have to buy some of those.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was so excited about the product. However, I have to say that it works great for my job, but not for my lifestyle. My boss is a really strict person who likes to listen to music while he is on the phone with someone. I find this not a problem, but when I go to the other side of the office with the Bluetooth earbuds in I can't hear the other end of the call. The Bluetooth works fine, but it does not replace my wired earbud and I find it hard to hear what is going on in the other room. It's not a deal breaker, but I can see why people might think that. I got this for Christmas, but will wait till next year before buying another.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had this thing since it came out in the 90's, back when it used to be the most expensive thing on the planet. I loved it back in the day, until I noticed that the buttons just wouldn't work in the early days and I ended up having to use a real mouse. Then I got the newer version of it and it just doesn't do what I want it to do. It can't even load.EXE files on my Windows 7 machine! The mouse buttons work, though.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product should never have been released into the marketplace. My first problem was with the fact that they sent me a replacement device, but they told me that I had to return the product and pay for shipping and handling. I could tell that they knew it wouldn't work and that they were not going to make any money on it. This is a $3,000 product, and yet they can't even get the basics right? My problem with the device is also that it doesn't show the battery status when the battery is low. The device has a lot of power but I don't see that it has the battery indicator lights in the menu. It also uses 2 AA batteries which means a 2 year replacement on the batteries would not be covered by the warranty. If this is the case, then they should not be selling the device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing is too big and I wish the speakers were on my phone and not on the tv. The problem is that you can't do anything with it without putting it on the stand. If it wasn't for the TV, I wouldn't have a problem with this thing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was a waste of money. You can buy a more expensive version for $50 and this one is just a fancy version of the old computer. The display is bright, and the mouse works but it doesn't have the sensitivity of the latest models.    It's a pretty cheap monitor but if it's not an upgrade to the other monitor, it's a waste.  1/5 I really liked this monitor. It was bright, easy to use, and had decent input lag. The only problem I had is the mouse. It is too sensitive for my liking. But that's just a personal preference. I'd give the monitor 4 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really like the sound of this phone but the battery life is pathetic for the cost of this product.   The phone is awesome in all other ways but I have had to replace the battery every 2 weeks now, and the phone is so slow and annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device was a bit pricey, but well worth the cost.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the product and it works great except it doesn't have a power button but there is a small button for a light and this is the only feature on the remote.

I have no way to charge my cell phone since this product is an accessory.   I would recommend the products only if you absolutely need it   One thing I have learned from using this is not to use with a charger and not with a battery.  Because the charger does not hold a charge in the battery, the battery will be dead after 5 or so tries, and if you don't have a charger or battery, you will need to buy a second one, or use a USB charger, and/or buy a battery that can be replaced, which takes a bit longer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device to record podcasts on the go (which is the purpose of the device). I was really excited when it came and I was able to record a very nice quality episode of the great American show, Parks and Recreation. Unfortunately, I purchased the wrong model, which is much more powerful than I was expecting. Once I started playing with it, the sound quality dropped considerably. I ended up recording a good portion of the episode in my car, in an area with little power (in addition to having no Bluetooth). Overall, the device worked just fine for the most part, but I would only recommend it to people who really love podcasts and want to record on the move.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works and the charging is ok, but the phone gets very hot during charging which means it's very difficult to use for extended periods (especially on a crowded subway or train).   Also, the phone's screen is slightly larger than other phones, so I sometimes feel like it's not wide enough for a person with a medium-sized-ish hand.   The only real positive thing I can say about this phone is the price, but you need to take into consideration that it's still a Chinese phone and not as good as a US phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are a couple things to get out of the way. This device is a piece of crap, and I have been using my computer for years without a problem. I am on my third iteration of this "fix" - one of the worst. The first problem was the hard drive that came with the computer was not even compatible with the current OS. I replaced the harddrive and went with an SD card. The second problem is the user interface. It looks like a poorly put together computer. Also there is no way to switch between languages, so if you go to english it will translate to "this thing just does not work." I think I am going to buy a whole new PC.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace a broken Bluetooth speaker (i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB HD, Windows 10). The audio quality is great on both music and phone calls. It has a built in mic so I don't need a headset, which I love. The only thing I don;t like about this speaker is that the sound isn't very clear when it is off (no echo or bass). However, this is only an issue if you are in a busy, noisy environment like I am in the morning.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm sure you can guess the story.  I bought a Kindle and I love it. I use it for all of my reading and watching media.  The first time I used the screen was wonderful. The second time I ran a virus and there were no words on the screen for about a minute. When I returned to the computer, the book came up on the page with a picture of the back cover. I just left the screen off and tried to continue.   After that, the problem went away.  My only problem is that it takes forever to write a paper book.  No one in the office seems to think that Kindle is the answer.  This device is great for reading books but it takes ages for me to write paper books.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     "They took forever to ship it."  Review for iBlip:   (   )  I'm a total music geek so I was pretty excited to get this. I was not at all expecting the iBlips to be exactly what I was expecting them to be. I received the iBoop last Friday, and I'm sure I'm not the only person who's noticed that they're almost a bit louder than their smaller brothers. As soon as I plugged it into my computer, my sound quality was way better, even though I'm a laptop guy. I've been playing the iMuggs, and they're not nearly as loud as the iblips. So I'm pretty sure it's the volume control that's a problem. I can't really tell which is the problem though, because I can change the volume on my computer through Windows 7.

I was wrong.  It's too boomy, and the bass is extremely thin and distorted. The bass does get better after a while, but it's only in a big room.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After my first one broke, I gave it away.   It didn't have a "battery" or anything like that, and it still needed a full charge to work.  This is a terrible product.  I was lucky that my replacement came within 2 days.  The whole thing is very "cheap" compared to Apple products. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When i first got it I just didn't like the looks of it and thought it was a piece of junk. After my wife was able to use it she liked it alot better. Also, the buttons do not always register clicks correctly. It's easy to program though.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I would have to say that the audio quality was great! I was able to listen to music or podcasts. It was fast, and the battery lasted the entire night. Unfortunately, the connection between the device and my MacBook wasn't the best. It would sometimes not switch the device on correctly, so when I wanted to listen in the evening, I would wake my MacBook up to find it had a lot of battery life left. If I had the opportunity to purchase a replacement for my iPhone, I think I would get this device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received this device and I must say, this was a complete disappointment to me. I thought it would be an excellent piece of music, but it is just a piece of plastic. The volume control is just too sensitive and the sound quality is pretty poor. I don't know what I expected from a $200 device, but this isn't it. The only thing I liked was the ability to play MP3 files through it, but that was about it. I'd give it 1 star, but I can't.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Product Quality:  I bought these speakers because they looked similar to the one I used on my iPod Classic and they sounded amazing. The sound quality is better than the iPod speaker and the quality of the sound is excellent!  If I was in the market for a replacement I would buy this speakers.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my aging Philips tv. However, the sound quality is very poor. I have a Philips tv but this is way worse than the old tv. It does not have that "old-timey" quality I had remembered about the tv, and it sounds like a radio. It is not a bad tv but it's not as good as I remembered. I recommend only the newer models.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these on a whim and really couldn't be happier with them, they look pretty good on my wall, but they're really small and awkward to use and I'd give them a 2 out of 5 if it was a 3. If I had to give it a higher rating they wouldn't be so small and cumbersome to use.   Good for small jobs, bad for big jobs:  This is a nice little work box. Its good for little jobs but you could get a lot more done with a proper hard drive.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Not the best I've owned!   I bought two of them in the hope they would last a long time.

I have yet to find a better replacement, as these do not hold up to the abuse of a teenager. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this phone for $50 off of a groupon. It's a nice looking phone with some features. I have been a fan of all BlackBerry phones and have been using the BlackBerry Playbook for a few months. This one has issues. I don't use email or anything and use the BlackBerry to message with the Playbook. The screen is not the best in quality, but it is not bad. I've read reviews that say this phone does not have a removable battery. Not true. I use it for email and messages and have no issue with it. However, the battery on the BlackBerry is a bit large and not good for extended use. The battery life is also average. My main complaint with the phone is the lack of a headphone jack. This phone does have a small pocket in the back. However most people I know use headphones on their phones. It would be nice to have a headphone port on the back like the Motorola Moto X, but then again there is a little space left. I know there is another Android phone that does not include a headphone option, but this is still a good looking phone and it does what it was intended to do.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is extremely cheap, but it has a faulty LCD display and the keyboard does not work.  I can use my iPhone 4 as a monitor for the unit and get through the day, but if I use a computer as my main screen, it is impossible to switch between the two.  The screen is bright, but there is no way to see the entire screen unless I put it on a wall or in the bedroom.   This is one of the cheapest I have bought but it does nothing but show the time.

It arrived in good shape, and the box looks good. I've played with the remote, and it works great for my needs. I don't like the screen-lock function. I know it's better than nothing, but I don'st want to lose control of my TV. I like having two remotes (I'll never have enough to keep me happy, I'm sure), and the remote looks good for a remote. This remote has the same buttons as the old one: 1- Volume 2- Menu 3- Brightness 4- Power 5- Volume Up 6- Menu Down (This is where you hit the "down arrow" on your remote, to skip to the next menu.) The first thing I did was to change the menu to the new remote. (It's also a great remote, but it's the same as the remote my Apple IIc has.) The second thing I do is to get my old cable for my TV (not cable from another tv, but cable from my old one). You can't get cable from other TVs. And the last thing I changed was the channel guide on my Apple remote. The one I bought came with the guide, but the new one does not. But, the first time I tried to change channels, it took me to the guide on the Apple remote, so I've been able to use the remote as a guide. Overall, a good buy for a beginner like me.  Reviewed by Mike O. from Good purchase and service Good little remote, worked well. It's been hard to find the right remote in the past, but this one is good. Easy to use and looks good with a nice, dark finish. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My   MacBook   could only be used for the internet   at night   (and only when   turned off the wireless)   When i purchased it,   i expected   a solid performance, but   that was not the case,  i could   not play a game for an hour, and   when i put in my phone,  the   volume buttons would go up or down and the power button would   be on.   It was not until i purchased a second   unit, that i discovered the unit would   reset itself when i left it on a desk for 10   minutes without turning off the  sound or turning off   the wireless,  but i could still use it.  I have also had the chance to play music for   an hour on the computer in a movie theater.  And i am not even   high school age!   The   battery life on this   thing   is terrible,  when  i am only using it for  i  the Internet   on my   iPhone   but it still   runs out of power very quickly.  If  i could have only used it for the Internet, i  would have not purchased it. I don't know if i will   buy another one   from Apple   because   it is so bad   and  its   no fault of the  i product .  So if   you are thinking   about purchasing a   Macbook   then  i suggest   waiting and not getting one until you have been a customer for a  long time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have to admit that the design of the T1 was the only thing that annoyed me about this product. I love my T1, but this one has not been worth the $40 I spent on it. The buttons on the front do not always get to the correct location, the USB cord is too short, and the USB port is located on the side instead of on top like all of the other T1's I have had. I have a good idea why the manufacturer did it this way, but I wish they could of put a bit more time into the design.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My device works great with my cell phone and I have had no issues at all, but I do not understand why so many other reviewers report the exact same problem   The device is well constructed and is a pleasure to use, but the display was extremely dim and in the dark, especially when you want to do a quick read on a map.   In my opinion, it would be very easy to add a way to turn the display back on if necessary, but for the price, and for what it has, I think this should have been an optional upgrade. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first electronic device I purchased was a Korg MS-20. I tried it out and it sounded better than any digital I'd ever heard (and I listened to lots of digital). I had it for a few weeks, but the digital quality is not what it was supposed to be. The digital has a low-level, distorted sound when you're playing, it makes the instruments sound like they have no signal. And it is very hard to hear the individual notes. The second electronic device that I purchased from Korg was a Prophet 5, a much more expensive synth. I don't really like the sound of the Prophet 5 as much as the MS-10, but that's not really my fault; my main problem with the Prophet-5 is that when it's hard to get any sound out, it doesn't even sound like a synth; it sounds like an ordinary keyboard. So, I decided to try and go back to the MS20. The MS20 is my main synth and I love it. The sound is so rich, so full, so warm and so very much fun. So after a month of using the MS10, I purchased the MS21. But when I plugged in my MS20 (not plugged in with any batteries) to test it, I just couldn't hear the sound out of it; the sound was so poor, I didn't know what was going on. That is until I plugged my MS30 into the MS30 and it just sounded so much better; now it sounds just like the MS40. So this is a good review to tell people about how Korg made this bad MS10 sound so much good.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     If you really like the product, you should buy it.   It doesn't work well for me. The battery life is pretty poor.  After 3 days, the radio is almost useless.  It will still have most of the channels, but some will be out.  And the software has some annoying things.  I bought a cheap one off the internet.  The battery was still full when I bought the replacement.  So I'm not sure if the one I bought is any better.  As long as the battery works well and has enough power, I don't know what's wrong with it. It's like they took everything good about the cheap unit and put it into the new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I love the sound of the headphones. They sound amazing. Unfortunately, they also suck. I've tried three headphones and this is the worst. If you get these, expect to be completely underwhelmed, and you'll be able to get better results from a higher quality pair. The bass is weak. The highs are mediocre. The mids are weak and lack power. The treble is also weak, and the highs do not sound good. The best I've heard on the market right now is the Sennheiser HD650s. They are far superior in every way, save the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was a little skeptical about purchasing the Samsung Galaxy S5 for my wife after reading the reviews. She loved the last one we had, so I figured why not. I tried to set her up with her old phone for some kind of new phone experience, and unfortunately, she was a bit confused because she had no idea what a "phone" was. It was a pain trying to make sure she didn't use the S5 as a camera, for example. Then, after all that, I finally gave her the S4. Then the battery quit giving out. The S5 is great, just not for my woman.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is not a great tablet. It is small and looks great in the picture.   When I looked for the tablet I was really disappointed.  In the video it showed that it has a great camera but it is way more expensive than the other devices.  It is hard to play back a video on the screen.  The buttons are hard to press.  Even the display can get dirty.  So I really think it is expensive for what you get. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because I want to be able to play music in my car, which is almost always in the car. The sound is not bad but it is a little less bass than I was expecting, which I don't understand why a subwoofer would be so much less than a regular sub. The speaker's volume control is a bit difficult to use and it seems that the buttons on the remote are slightly on the far right (which is the buttons used for volume control on the car). That makes it hard to see which button you are pressing on the remotes, which makes it a bit hard to keep them focused on the buttons at first.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a great device but the only problem with it is that it can get hot in a short period of time even when the screen is off (not enough for you to know that something is wrong). And that's not really a big deal, it's a screen that is meant to be kept hot so that you do not burn yourself on it (the backlight is supposed to help with this) but that's what made me buy it, I needed a screen to keep at a comfortable temperature. I bought this a couple of years ago on a whim because I don't work with a computer a lot.  I also bought a 2nd one for my son   The backlight and the battery life are excellent.   I like the fact that my kids can't turn it on and off, if it gets too hot, it turns it off.

The only thing I didn't like about it was it's USB port which I thought was just as bad as the case itself which is very flimsy and not something you'd use.  I hope they fix this one for a lower price.   A great deal:  I have been using my new Voodoo 5 for a few days now and so far I have a very smooth and very easy-to-use interface. I am using the computer to stream a very large music collection. Everything plays beautifully on the computer. The software was very easy to use and was very intuitive.

It has been great for the most part until the current tv went kaput. Since that time I have had to buy a new tv or pay to buy the old one off ebay. The new tv is horrible, and not only does it constantly go out on me, but it has the potential to do the same to my older one. After trying everything to get my old tv back online, I'm out of ideas. It is now on a power cord and a power strip, with the old power cable still attached to it. I bought the smart tv 2 years ago to replace my old set which had a much better tv. This new TV is a joke. I will probably have to replace it with an older model. I can't say enough bad things about the smart tvs. They just have no merit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this product on Amazon (they were a few dollars off) and it came in an odd cardboard box that was hard to open and didn't come with an instruction book.

My iPad mini 3 broke the next day  I had it delivered in under a week to no avail  It's also a lot of device to take care of,  It takes a lot to turn the thing on.  It looks a lot like the old Nokia phones.  After about an hour of tinkering I figured out that it's because of my connection.  I got it connected to the internet  I turned the bluetooth on it and it worked  My tablet will now sync and play all of my music,  I still have some music that it won't play  It has no other use other than a small computer.  The only thing I like about this is that it gives me a small device that works when I need it to.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tod from I'm back. I used to be a music fiend but am finally back. It's been quite awhile since I've used one of these so I've been looking at a good bluetooth device that I can use on the go. The  iMac Pro just didn't cut it. I wanted to be able to use my  iPad but was forced to use something else like my   Motorola   phone. This device solves the problem. Now I can listen to my music on the fly with my laptop on my desk. It has a nice battery life and has great features like having it sync with my iPhone  and play songs from my iPhone's library.  Now I am a believer in bluetooth.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "They're broken, not only do I have to call a professional to have them fixed, but the repair man is a complete jackass. The problem is the batteries! I put one in on a low wattage battery, and it exploded. After replacing the battery the light was fine, and the problem was gone.  The replacement battery is useless. It doesn't even charge! Now I have lost $300 worth of light, in an already bad situation. So I will return the light. I don't know where the light came from anymore, but it needs to be returned to the stores."  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    " I had to return the samsung galaxy s4 to samsung after it died in 6 months of use! It took about 2 weeks for it to go back to normal. Now I can't buy a new phone or use my samsung s4 anywhere! The samsung Galaxy s4 is a very nice phone, but I would prefer my phone not die like this after 6 months. The warranty has no value and you are left with no warranty if something happens to your samsung smartphone. "
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this as a Christmas gift for my parents who were away at work. It worked fine for about a month then I lost the charger, which was unfortunate since I already had a set of 3rd generation chargers on my desk. They are no longer sold so I'm looking into purchasing a new set.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product with a low expectations. It is not an electronic device, but a device made of a plastic part, which doesn't make sense in terms of the price. It seems that the manufacturer doesn't want the potential consumers to have a good time with this device, because you can't get any further with it. I bought it at a small electronic store, as it came at a bargain price. The quality of the product is not the problem. It's the price that is a problem.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound quality is bad and the microphone is very poor, making it very hard to understand the speaker. Also, the camera has an auto-focus problem that makes it difficult to focus on the picture. The USB cables are poorly rated:  While the USB ports and connection are easy to use, the two USB ports are difficult to connect and disconnect. The cable itself is a piece of junk:  The USB cable has a small plastic connector that is designed to work with most type of computers, but it's not compatible with many Mac models. I can't even get the laptop to recognize my computer.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have an old digital clock that I bought from an electronics store several years ago. I use it every day to keep track of the time for my small company. There is a problem in the back right corner.  The device is perfectly fine, as I have checked and checked on it. But there are two pieces of the clock that are a little bent.  One of the pieces has come apart, so that it is a bit loose.  I went to the store and spoke to a clerk there, and he said it was a common problem with analog clocks, and that he would have the clock repaired.  Unfortunately, when he brought me the clock, it had one part missing, so I went back and got a new one.   After that, I got one with one part broken, but still functioning.  It is not cheap, but for a small business, it makes a lot of sense.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this monitor to use with a   PC which doesn't need it because i have a very small one. This monitor does not have the resolution I need to use the PC with it so i will probably go back to my  PC. The monitor is very very flimsy and will break at the slightest touch. I have never had a problem with this monitor. Pros: - Great resolution. - Fantastic picture - Not heavy enough to be heavy handed (if it does come in a box) - Very lightweight Cons: - Poor quality, if that is possible.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a sony sx1000 for my son in law to use as a phone at home, and we all love it. He has been using it since it was received and hasn't had a single problem with it. But the first couple of days the phone was dead and I checked all the settings and it was fine. I called sony and they said they had no idea what was wrong with it and could not give me a return code because it was a refurbished product. It has been about 2 weeks and the phone is still dead, I called the service line and they sent a tech out to get it, but when he came he found out the problem and gave up and told me that I needed to call them back and ask if I can take it back or what. I am so upset with the quality of products this company puts out and I am not even buying another sony product. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As the reviews say, there are better products out there (especially if you're looking for a very cheap tablet, like this one) but this is just way overpriced.   This thing costs $150 and is a complete waste of money if you want a cheap tablet. I bought it expecting to just use it to take notes while doing a presentation but I ended up using it for 3 hours per day and it just became a chore to use.  It does have some cool features like handwriting recognition but if you use it that way, the writing experience sucks.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These are a big improvement over the cheap, flimsy, flammable, bad-quality, unreliable, flakey, broken, noisy, and so-on-and-so-forth crappy USB-C-based accessories that we have come to expect from the manufacturer, and the "good" ones that the manufacturer's are adding to the marketplace.   However, I did find this particular one to have issues with it:  A bad connection to the cable with the battery connector, and a bad connection between the battery and the connector, is what makes me not use this charger much at all. I wish it was just an USB-A cable; that would at least be good.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad quality piece of hardware, I use to have an HP PC which I used to have. However, I used a cheap Chinese version and the PC didn't work properly for more than one day. I bought a good one which I use now, but it's the same problem. I have two of the USB to LAN adapters and use it with both computers at the same time, and one of them gets hot and the other one doesn't. I don't think it has any performance, but I still want it because it's small and easy to transport. The other thing that's bad is that the power adaptor connector is too big to fit in my laptop. I could use a cheap one, but if I want it to work with my laptop, I need a smaller power connector, that's why I'm not giving it five stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been on the internet researching electronic devices for the past 4 years or so, but all of them have come and gone before they were finished.   A few weeks ago I purchased the   Sennheiser Wireless Studio and found that the quality was the worst in a long time.  The sound quality was horrible and the microphone was almost impossible to get through. I did not give it another chance until I was told that I had to give a refund because of the problems.  I would not recommend this product at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this about 2 weeks ago and the only thing that I'm able to do with it is to play music from my iPod.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this to replace my old one. I bought it in a hurry because I needed one for a party. But I had a hard time getting the cable to work. The cable had several pieces that are broken. After several tries I got the one that worked, but it was still a little weird because the sound was too low for a lot of the stuff that I listen to. The buttons are very easy to press, but the sound is awful.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I first got my iPhone I was thrilled at the ease of use and the beautiful phone, and I use it often and love the interface. I do, however, have to say that in addition to having a very slow, clunky and cumbersome process for syncing the contacts, I have the habit of doing my contacts in iCal. That's my excuse, not a real explanation, but I really miss syncing my phone contacts through iCloud.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this as a birthday present for my 8 year old son. He absolutely hates the game, and his father is very upset about it. If this were a PS4 version instead of an Xbox one version, I could forgive it. But, as it is, he won't touch it, and my Dad says the game is worse than The Sims. I was disappointed to hear my expectations were low, as the gameplay is decent.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm very disappointed with this device. I ordered a phone case to protect my Droid X from damage. After installation, I noticed the phone was not functioning properly. After about two weeks of use, the display is completely dead.   The battery did not last more than 6-8 hours on a charge. I would recommend this to a friend, but I'll just buy a different phone case.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The most annoying problem is that it is too expensive. The only other problems is the lack of a removable battery, it's slow, too heavy.  Great little device!  I've owned several of these but this model is definitely the best. The unit is very lightweight, great battery life, and the camera is very quiet and has a good quality viewfinder. Highly recommend. . I've owned numerous Panasonic products, and this is the best one I've found yet, in fact, the best Panasonic camera I've ever owned. I was also happy to see Panasonic put a 2nd camera into this model, a smallish compact camera with a very sharp and clear viewfinder, very handy for taking photographs on location. The built-in battery lasts for a couple of years, with good battery life. It's also small, so is easy to fit into a pocket. A must have if you want a quality and good quality camera at a very affordable price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's been like this for a year. The screen has changed a lot since the last update and the keyboard, while better than most of its peers, still isn't great and has problems with some of the most common functions and options. I wish the battery life was longer, but that's about the only other bad thing about the keyboard. I'd rather pay $50 for a keyboard with better options that can perform more functions.

I'm running on them all the time, and they still crack and break like a cheap plastic wristwatch. And they're loud. I can't listen to music with a big loud piece of plastic on the earbuds.   If you can live with that then I'm sure these won't be a dealbreaker for you.  Style of music: Rock, Country, Pop, Jazz

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The headphone amp is a great little amplifier for portable devices.   I really don't understand why some people do not have good headphones but don't need a good amplifier.  My favorite brand is DUNS and have had the Z5 for over 2 years now.  They are loud, clear, and have a great frequency response.  This is my only complaint is that I have to replace the battery when the unit dies. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this device for a couple months and did not like it at all. When I switched to the iPod 5 I bought, it was great. I am a heavy smoker and I had to give up cigarettes completely. I will not use this product again. I have also used a portable radio that I am still using to listen to music and talk on the phone. I like having the radio in my pocket. This unit was extremely bulky and I could not use it in any situation. I ended up returning it because it was too bulky and too difficult to use. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item for my husband because I was tired of the plastic that was used on other devices.   The thing that bothered me was the fact that it was a 2 pack of cables!  I guess I should be thanking the company, because they were generous enough to put 2 cables in.  The only thing is that I have a USB cord which I would have loved to have been able to use it with the cable but my husband just didn't like using the cable to control this.  He is a software engineer and doesn't need to use this device for many years and I want to let him have it for at least 1 year.  My husband says the best part of the device is that it is small and very portable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used the Nixie tube, but did not like the small size and the flimsy plastic casing.   It is great for watching TV, but would not do much more for my money.   Rated 1 out of 5 by Biscuit from Don't buy it if you like big screens. We bought this to use on a large screen tv. The tube is a bit too short for my tastes. I will be looking at the new Nixies instead.  It does the job and you can see the color changing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a good phone, but...   I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that it's plastic. That means that it'll scratch easily and is prone to getting scratched if you drop it on the floor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     It was a nice device.   I like the ability to make calls and do voice mail, but the design is not so good. The speaker is on the back, which is convenient, but it's a very small speaker, and the audio quality is bad. It doesn't sound nearly as good as a standard phone speaker, nor does it sound very good at all. If the speaker were larger, it would be much better. The volume adjustment is poor too.  It was nice when I bought it, but a little clunky now, because it's got a built-in keyboard (instead of a phone-like thing) that I get tired of having to adjust. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a piece of junk!   I used to love my old Sony Walkman, but when this little guy came out in the 80s, I lost all respect for the company who made this thing.   The playback buttons don't work.  Yes, the speaker plays music, but the headphones are made for someone who has a hearing aid.  The battery life is terrible.  After a few hours, I had to wait for the charging unit to charge it up. I could never get it to charge on a single charge.  If you're on a budget, this is an ok item for a small price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using my new iPhone 4 for the last week or so. I'm a heavy user of wireless webcams and iPhones, and this one just can't seem to keep up.  I use it for my daily work, and it seems to work fine, but then I look up, and see a small pixel right here on the upper left hand corner. It looks like a bit of a smear. I have not noticed this at all when using my old iPhone 3GS. The only good thing about this thing is the camera is really good. I don't really understand how Apple can call it a'retina' device when there is a smear on the screen.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      I have this model for about 3 years. First one that didn't have a power button. It was a very frustrating experience.  Second one that did have a button but the second one had a really annoying buzzing noise. I couldn't find any info on this device and had to go to the store to find what it was. It turns out that the noise is caused by a capacitor. It's a good idea to check to see if the unit is properly grounded. I've been through a few units and have had this one for about 2 years and I'm still having the same problem. It seems like every time I use this unit it loses a little bit of battery power. I'm almost positive that the capacitors aren't getting enough power to keep them going. I'd rather pay a little more and get a more powerful unit. I'm not sure why the factory made the capacitor but now it's just bad design. I hope that they can figure out a better way to make them but this thing still has to be the most annoying thing I've had to live with in a long time. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad electronic gadget is one that does not function properly, is very expensive and/or fails quickly.   I bought the first version of this item about a year ago and have used it ever since.  I had a good experience with it, but now the screen is bad and doesn't read anything.  This thing is so heavy, I feel like I'm not holding anything anymore when it's not in use.  The buttons are annoying.  And the battery life is pathetic.  One of the batteries is dead on my latest one.  So when I read other reviews of other users having similar issues, I can't help but think there is something wrong with my unit.  It's got a bad reputation.  If you're looking for a cheap electronic gadget to fool people into thinking it's a working device, this one's not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device works great for my needs, I purchased this to use as an air mouse for my PS3, I have been able to find a mouse that works in this manner, so I am very happy with this purchase, the only thing I wish it had was the ability to connect to multiple joysticks for each hand, which would have been great if it were around for an easier purchase and setup.

I'll try not to buy another one after this one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently bought a Kobo Aura. I was so happy with my purchase. I have not had it for very long, so there is still plenty of room for improvements.   Pros:  1. A very well designed and constructed notebook. It is thin and light. 2. Good touch screen. 3. The battery life is very good for the size of the notebook. 4. The cover holds the notebook very well. 5. The included hardback book is quite a nice option for a back-up. 6. This notebook works great on both PC and Mac. 7. The e-ink display is very readable.  7. I love the cover. I've already used it to store my business cards. 8. There are plenty of ways to display your notes.  Conclusion:  I was looking at other options for a tablet for a long time, but was disappointed with the lack of screen space. My goal was to have the largest screen possible for my reading and writing needs, but I had to settle for the Kobo's screen, which is fine.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was my first set of earphones and they just work perfectly.   It's not loud.  I was hoping they would be more loud. But they are loud. And that's the main thing.  It sounds like the music is coming out of the speakers and not my headphones.  This doesn't last very long.  But it works.  They do a good job of blocking out any background noise.  For people who can't hear the music well or don't like to wear them at night, I'd recommend these.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Mark from Very unsatisfied! The unit was used for a few weeks. I have a small car with a 4 port stereo and this unit was not able to connect to the stereo because it has no input for the aux input. The stereo has no aux input in the unit so it has not been able to communicate with the unit. The sound quality is very poor.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the first things I noticed about the device was its very small size compared to the other wireless chargers. It was a very small unit and the only way I could keep my laptop charged was to remove the cord completely and place it face down on a flat surface. I would rather have a cord that goes around my laptop or at least one with a longer cord.    I purchased the Apple Magic Wireless Charger for my Apple MacBook.  I love it   I also like that it is compatible with the AirPods.   The Apple Magic is small and the cord is very short.  It does charge my MacBook fast. It does not make charging the iPad possible without taking out the iPad.  The only thing that I could complain about is the very small cord. If you need a lot of power, get a longer cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased two of these at the same time for an outdoor project. The first one worked perfectly. The other one had a couple things going wrong, one that turned on by itself, but didn't work. The one I got just a couple weeks later had a dead battery, was dead on all sides, had to be replaced twice. The battery was also completely dry, even though it said it was charging. That is really stupid.    I have a few problems with this phone: 1. It doesn't work properly when the screen is off. The contacts on the contacts list come back when the phone is turned on. They don't when the device is off (as they should) 2. The speaker doesn't get loud enough when there are background noises playing. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received my first phone call from my cousin who lives in New Jersey (thanks to the new cell phone towers in that area). I called him to ask if I could call him on his home phone which was at home, as I was out of service with my home phone. He answered the phone and started telling me how nice it would be if he had this new phone that he had just purchased and wanted to make sure that I called to tell him about it. When I asked him why he didn't call me and get the same information from my aunt, he said that it didn't work. I informed him that I would get a call back within 3 hours and that he can cancel my contract if he didn´t have a working phone.   He told me that he couldn´t do that and that they could not help me with this because of my contract. I told him that that was not true. He told my aunt that they wouldn´t help him either and that it wouldn´ t work.  After several more calls with no help from either company, I called a different cell phone provider and was connected to a person who told me they would try to help me. They told me the same thing that my cousin told me. I ended up canceling my contract with the old company on July 23rd, as my contract had run out and the new company wanted me to sign up for another contract at a higher monthly rate than I was paying with AT&T.  A couple of days ago I got a phone call telling me that my current cell service provider, AT& W, will no longer be providing service to me.  I have had AT&W service since 2001, when I moved from California to Texas to work in an airline maintenance facility in Amarillo. When AT&H moved from my area to my new location (the state I now live in), they replaced my old cell phone with the AT&N one.  Since then I have been getting cell service on a 3G CDMA card.  AT&F (the company that replaced AT&TW) recently replaced my 3G phone with a 4G phone, the LG V20.  LG does not have a CDMA carrier yet, so I am stuck with an obsolete system.  My aunt's current contract also is ending soon, and she has not been able to find a new provider to switch to. The AT&Y plan is too expensive
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are too many problems with this device. If you have a good problem-solver, this is one of the best solutions on the market.   The key is to have a working charger, since it is powered by two AA batteries, they're the only ones that you'll need.  The keys are all in the wrong places, which you can easily fix by putting the correct key into each hole, then turning the device.  This is a very good device, I love the design and the build quality.  However, I'm not the only one who has problems with the keys. I have had a lot of problems with my charger, so I just ordered a new one from Amazon.  But, I recommend the one from Radio Shack because their parts are a lot cheaper.  And, I will be returning to buy a new charging adapter. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is good quality for the price. However, the product is poorly made, which makes it very easy to break apart. I had to purchase a new unit because the old one did not support my home wifi.   Nice and small, but still too big and clumsy for daily tasks:  This router is small enough that I can put it under the bed in my bedroom, but it's not light enough to easily go out and about on the couch or in my car. It's too big to hold in the car, and I've had trouble getting it in the front seat as it tends to fall out the back. And it's too bulky to make it easy to plug in and plug out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this to have a desktop computer in my office but this does not work. If I go to a web site the cursor stops working and I can't print.  The problem:   I am a software developer, and the problem is that the computer is not recognized by the operating system. My office is wired in the same way as a normal computer. This means that the keyboard and mouse work, but everything else does not.   I have tried all of the settings you are supposed to try on your computer before buying it. I tried resetting the BIOS, but this did not solve the problem.       This problem is with the operating systems on the computer. The USB cable should be an integral part of the computer, and I was under the impression that you needed a PC for computers, not a USB keyboard and mice. This is a very frustrating and unnecessary problem. The computer is so powerful and well designed that it should be able to handle it, if you plug it in to a monitor and use the keyboard/mouse.   The computer has USB ports, so the keyboard is very easy to use. This will be a big problem for me to have to take it apart for repairs. I will probably just get another computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm an old timer. I owned a Commodore Amiga in high school (1986) and bought a TRS-80 Plus on my way out of the high school. I've owned computers and used them throughout my life. I'd have thought I knew how a computer worked, and it didn't matter. I thought the Amiga was just the computer equivalent of a telephone. After getting it I found it hard to operate at all, and was frustrated by the poor keyboard. In retrospect, I was a bad decision maker and I didn't get into Amiga games, and I only saw about a half dozen or so programs. I also was a big fan of games from the 80's, so I wasn't really all that impressed.   The TRS 8-bit machines have always had their flaws. The software and the hardware are just really bad.  I had a really hard time playing the games I did play on them, and the keyboard wasn't very good either.  The Commodore Amigas were very powerful for their time (they had the fastest disk drives of all time) so it really didn't take long for me to figure out why some game cartridges didn't work on my Amiga. I'm still trying to get the Amiga-S to load.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the original NEX-7 in 2005, had a problem with it for a while and now I just received the new one. I am disappointed in this one, I bought this because it seemed like the NEX system would be more stable. I was wrong. The camera feels like it is falling down all the time when in use. The grip is too large and the buttons are too hard to press. The buttons are also very hard to find, the one on the rear left is the shutter button. Also, it seems as if it can get hot too fast. It is so hot, that when I take a picture of my face it actually burns my skin. This was a huge purchase for me and now the N7 is just a disappointment.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Superb Camera. Just as good as the N9 I recently bought this NEX7 for photography, it was on a sale and I bought it immediately because of it's fantastic build quality and handling. After using the N8 a lot I started to get more confident with the NX7, the N800 is great in all aspects but in the photography area, the build quality of the N6 was amazing, the ergonomics of the back of the camera was just as good but the controls of the shutter speed were much more intuitive. After shooting the N850 for a few days, I found that the quality of images and features were exactly the same between the two, the quality difference was in how much you actually need it. This camera has a number of features that are just as great on the N750 and the N900 and the control is fantastic. So now I have an N850 and a N9 on the way. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and will buy the N950 when it's available.  Reviewed by Brian C. from A bit too expensive and you can't go wrong with this camera...... It is a good camera. The only problems I had were: 1. It's a bit too much. I really thought I had the N930 until I got it. When you start out with a N930, you buy the camera with its battery and SD memory card and the included case. Now you pay about $200 more for that. This is too much for the camera, as well as the accessories you need. You also need to buy a lens for it as well (which I don't mind

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound is not great at all, but that could be due to the fact I bought a "non-rechargeable" USB port with this one, so no charge. I had to buy a separate power cord.   When you turn on your keyboard the sound starts playing immediately, but when I type a letter, it keeps playing without pausing until I hit a space or start typing.  There is a tiny little gap in the middle of the unit, so the cable does not work with a USB adapter, but it is very easy to plug it into my laptop and type. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The design is great and the device is easy to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this watch as a Christmas gift for my husband who enjoys sports. It arrived on Christmas Eve in perfect condition but unfortunately, it broke after a week and a half. The back of the watch is not waterproof, which was a big problem because it is my husband's favorite watch. We had to have the back replaced on his watch. I had an old one for several years so I figured I'd give this a try and am so glad that I did. The watch is good for the price but the design is bad. I bought the watch as my husband wanted one but this watch is poorly designed, it is very thick. The lume that came with the watch worked pretty good. If you look at the watch from the side, it appears that it is more bulky than it really is. The battery compartment is also in the back so the battery needs to be accessible. This is a good watch for those who like sports but you should definitely buy the new one that comes with the battery compartment.

There are two other items included in the set that are both DVD players so I'm not sure if I would get this item again unless I upgraded to a more powerful model. Overall, I am very pleased with the unit and the sound quality.  Customer Reviews Rated 4 out of 4 by JG from Excellent audio. Does not get a lot of attention, but it's just as good as the much more expensive models. It is a bit larger than a good set-top box (like my Tivoli), but it still fits inside of a standard TV cabinet. The built-in optical digital tuner is a nice bonus and gives you access to more than one channel. The unit will auto-detect your stereo setup, so if you're in a two channel home theater, you can just use the CD players. The video quality is quite good. It's not the highest quality, but a good start for a system that is priced very similarly to the other brand-name products.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love my new ipod, it has everything needed and more.   But, I've been looking for a way to listen to my music on a train and this is not it.  It's kind of cool to be able to listen on the train but the quality is bad.  I've never had a problem with the ipod or my other ipods before and now this one has a crack on the glass I have no idea how to fix it. I'm going to try but the thing just looks like the glass is breaking off of it, not really great.   Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is so very small!   I've owned this screen for a couple of years, and have put more hours on this screen than I have on any other screen on a laptop.    When I bought this laptop, I assumed that I was getting a quality device, and that this screen would be the exception to the rule.  As it turns out, this is the exception for this laptop. There is nothing about this screen that makes it a worthwhile purchase.  #8 - Samsung - 9.6 inch touchscreen - 11 hours, 50 minutes, and 17 seconds.  "In the last year, the laptop industry has faced two large challenges: One, the size and cost of the new MacBook Pros has left many customers scratching their heads about the merits of touchscreens. And two, touchscreens have gotten awfully slow."  "The Samsung 11-inch Chromebook 2.0 has not only survived the harsh testing of the market, it has done a better job than any other Chromebook of getting me through the day." 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The thing with the K-50 is that, as expected, it's just a cheap device, lacking many of the features I look for in an audio device, like a balanced connection, external speakers or a high-quality tuner. And it just doesn't sound good - and as I said, it is quite loud. It's just not my cup of tea. I think this is a decent product, but, at $50 and in the wrong size of case, I wouldn't even consider buying it.   I have a K-75, which I really enjoyed. But it's also a cheapo, so I went for the K50. As for performance, I was pretty satisfied.  In the main, there were not enough improvements - but that's what makes the K40 sound great.  The K-70 sounded very nice. It was really loud, which is a nice feature, but not the main feature.  So, if your money is tight or you just don't like expensive audio products and you're thinking about this product (or any other one), you might want to look at the K70 instead, since it is less expensive.

It does get a lot louder then the last i had but not as much as the new one. It did work for the first week then I had to reset it. I wish i had waited till it was more popular to buy it cause its a horrible idea to buy a device just to hear it play and listen to it because it does not.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this e-cigarette in the mailbox for 2 months now and I have not been very impressed. The first problem was the battery. It didn't last 3-4 weeks. Then the last problem is the taste. You could not taste the e-liquid in it. I decided to give it another chance. I have found a brand called Vuse Vapor in a different area. It has the same battery, but it has a more consistent taste. I would have no problem with this electronic cigarette at all, but I won't be purchasing it. You will need to find another brand.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the first things I did after I got this was to remove the battery.   This device was on sale at the time and it's a terrible idea to let it go into the battery when it's not in use.  So now I have to replace the battery and get a new one, which is more than I paid for the device.  Another problem is that the battery is difficult to replace because it fits too tightly in the device and you need to be careful when removing the battery from the device since it will be difficult to remove.  The best feature of this device is the built-in light and the fact that it has a built in speaker. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was impressed when I picked up the M&T Taper in Black. It's a quality device, has excellent reviews on Amazon, and the build quality feels really good. It also has a built in microphone for the speaker and an internal speaker for the microphone.   However, after two months of use, the speaker is always on and I can't get the sound any better. The microphone on the other hand has been an annoyance for the past couple months.  When the microphone is on the microphone constantly picks up all the ambient noises from the room. There's no way to turn the mic off, and even if I could, I'm sure it wouldn't be the only problem with the microphone itself.  If you want a great portable speaker, you will have to give the MTS a go. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing I found very annoying is that you have to remove the case from the box to install the device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product because it's the only device that can play high-definition audio and still work on my laptop (and my TV). But it's so expensive. The cable was good for the first hour or so, but it has so many tiny parts that it doesn't play the audio properly. I can only connect it to my laptop's headphone output, which means I have to turn my TV off. The screen is terrible too. The only good thing I can say about it is that it does charge my device at the same time.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the e-book on a whim. The book is a fun read with a lot of information. However the author doesn't seem to have taken proper care of the book. I am very disappointed as the pictures, tables of contents and information are all outdated. I'm sure the author has a great amount of information at hand but this book should have been updated to reflect the current technology.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good e-Book with many interesting concepts I was drawn to this book due to my interest in a lot different things. One of my biggest interests is the way human societies have developed over time. This book does a very good job of explaining the big-picture that humans developed by creating their own laws. For example, most people today, I believe, would agree that people should be allowed to have their own property. This is how we became the civilized people that we are today. It's a very interesting way of thinking about the world. Another idea in this book is how a lot societies have been structured as systems of trust. I believe that this is a very positive thing. For me, personally, I like how this concept relates to the way we see people working in a business or a relationship. This isn't to say that it will work for everyone but it can give insight into what makes a successful relationship. The idea of this concept is very relevant to the relationships we form on a daily basis, especially if you are going through a rough patch. I thought the discussion on the different types of relationships was very well thought out. One more great way to think about this concept. The way relationships are established in this world is through trust and this book gives an overview on how trust works in a relationship and how to establish it correctly. It was a very insightful read. I hope that this book helps people with their own relationships. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the most awful piece of junk ever.   The screen is made of plastic and is very weak and flimsy.  This thing is worthless.  A broken screen is one thing, but the whole system is a waste of money.  I paid $200 for it, but it is just garbage!   If the company had simply bought a screen from another manufacturer, I would have been better off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It looks nice and works, but I bought a different device because it was cheaper.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Sound, great Value I use this unit with a Tascam DR-05MK2, and I must say the sound is great. It's really great for a $30.00 unit.  that's why i bought it! you can get very good recordings even though it's a little noisy, but you get what you pay for  Good Sound, Cheap Price! I use these with the Tascams D1 Pro and Tascmam DR5, and have been very pleased with both. The unit sounds great on both systems, and the only con I have is that it runs off the batteries a bit fast, so be sure to have a way to keep the battery charged. But for the price point, I'm sold!  Great sound and price for a good little recorder I bought one for myself because I wanted to get some sounds but also wanted the ability to store the recordings and have the option of exporting them. ,

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem:  I use this for a hobby of photography and music editing. When I got the unit, I was pleasantly surprised. The image quality is good. There is only a tiny bit of noise, but that isn't too bad. The noise is very faint, but very noticeable, so I know my gear is working correctly. It seems as if there is some kind of noise reduction on the image data from the camera, so there is the slightest bit of slight noise on the edge of the image, but I don't notice it. The sound output is very good, it's easy on the ears, and is clear and crisp. The only issue I have with this unit is that there is a faint but constant hum that seems to emanate from the speakers. I have no idea what it is, but it is noticeable in loud places.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a poor device. I bought this for my daughter for her 16th birthday. She loves it but she will not use it because the sound comes out through the front door of the house, so she doesn't have to listen to the noise all day. It is a great idea for my granddaughter and my dad but not my little girl.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really liked the idea of the "GIF" format, but the device itself is a total disappointment. It's just not very well designed and the software can't even figure out how to load it. It uses the built-in flash like a DSLR (if you use a slow and non-touch sensitive lens), so you'll want to crank up the flash a bit, which results in grainy photos that aren't too exciting. The "Gif" format is better than GIF but still far from ideal (and definitely worse than other file formats). I've seen many other people with the same problem so you can't really blame them for it, but it's the first camera I've owned where I have to constantly switch between my phone and the camera. If this thing is going to be in my bag the entire time, then I really hope it gets better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this phone for only 2 months now and my issues with it include: 1) The phone can't handle 4G on T-Mobile. T-Mo is using the same network that Sprint used (GSM) and this phone can barely connect to the network, even if you're on a 4G network. TMO says Tmo will eventually support the 4G so I'm hoping the issues are related but it just doesn't seem like they're going to fix the issue. 2) The earphones are pretty shitty. I can use them but I don't like how they vibrate the whole time, especially when talking on the phone. I'm using a cheapo headphone that you can get off eBay and that works well but they don't have a quality that I'd call good. 3) The touch-sensitive screen is pretty crappy and doesn't allow for a lot of control like on the iPhone. My friend bought a Tmo phone and the TMO phone isn't even on his carrier yet but he uses it for his iPod and he loves it. I'd love to use it for music but it feels so much like a cheap phone that you end up getting used to it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a brand new Sony XBR-CX950 last fall, when it arrived in the mail, I thought I had done something wrong. I thought the picture quality was poor, the buttons were difficult to use. I tried several different remote buttons and was always frustrated.   But, after some time of using it, I've had some good times. The remote buttons are very good.  There is no lag and very smooth playback.  The sound is very loud and clear.  As far as the picture, this is one of the better picture quality remote controls on the market.  I do use this for my   TV and my computer, as I use Sony's remote for these two devices.  If I wanted to use the XBR for the television, I would buy a brand-new XBR model, or use a cheaper Sony remote.  This remote is a good buy, and I think the price is worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It does not work very well. You need a special USB cable to connect the two to your computer to connect it to the keyboard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In no way was I disappointed with the quality of this camera. My first impression was that the design of the camera body is somewhat cheap.   The bottom of the front camera area has three small holes that are designed to hold the lens cap, but I am not sure if these are there for any purpose other than to hold a lens cap.  I found this design very strange since there are no other screws or metal on the camera. I also found this area of the body very difficult to use because it is quite shallow and the screen is very small.  The battery compartment is on the bottom left.  When I tried to use the camera, the battery compartment became a big mess.  All the internal parts are very small and there is no support for them.  After I removed all the internal components, I found all the buttons and switches to be broken.  There is one switch on the front that I found to be a real challenge because it has to be turned all the way to the right to turn it on.  This switch has a strange design, too, and there are many different parts on it. I did not find this problem to be as much of a problem as some other reviewers have mentioned.  Although I found the design strange, I did like the fact that the LCD screen is not made of plastic.  It has an almost metal look to it.  In addition, the back is made of metal as well, making it very strong.  You can open the back of the unit by removing three screws, and when you get to the LCD you have to remove another three screws.  Once I did this, I had all the screen parts off the camera which allowed me to find all the batteries.  If you need to change batteries, the LCD has a built-in charger built into the unit.  Most of the other batteries that come with the camera are the same brand of batteries as in the Sony camera but are much cheaper.  But the fact is, I am very happy with the Sony a3000.  With the exception of the battery and the LCD, the a3000 is exactly the same as the Sony.  Some of the design problems are minor, but they are not major ones. The one problem that I am really not thrilled about is the fact the a6000 is slightly wider and taller.  One of the reasons that I do like the a5000 so much is that it is a much more compact camera
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the new Sony VX1000 for $300. I had a lot of problems with it including the power cord issue. The VX series of Walkman players are amazing! Only the Sony is on par with my old Walkman which was made before this Walkman was made! A few things I like about the Sony unit. The sound is a bit less distortion sounding, no pop or crackle but no clarity. The other thing I like is that I can adjust the volume on the head unit with the volume control knob. The bass is pretty good, and it's very comfortable to wear. I would have preferred the "walkman" sound but the sound just sounds too good. For the price I paid it's great!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As far as I know, this device works as advertised, but for $99 the features are a bit disappointing.   The software and support are extremely poor.  Even though I'm an IT guy, it's been a real pain getting these problems fixed.  It's been over a month now and I have yet to receive a response from anyone at the company, so the end result is a device that I have to be very aware of. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this in the hope that the sound quality would be better than my old Yamaha. Unfortunately, the sound is awful - I mean, the bass is sub-par, the highs are just too high and the highs were too trebly. I can't even say the bass was good as it was just way over-driven. I also noticed some feedback on certain tracks (and not good feedback, either). The only thing good about the Yamaha is that the microphone works well. If you have a lot of money to throw around, this may be the right option, but if you have the money to spare then this is an amazing value.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A good soundcard, but with the exception of the bass, which I find is lacking, there's little to recommend this particular soundcard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device because it supposedly had more features than my computer. I purchased it to use on my laptop and wanted the ability to copy my windows files. I have to say that it doesn't do anything at all for the first couple of minutes. It seems to be just a program to copy windows files to the computer but it is not that useful. After awhile, I found out that it would just do the copying with no other features and this was a bit frustrating. I eventually figured out how to do what it wanted to do without using it. I had been using the copy my files program on my PC and just wanted to copy the files from my PC to my laptop but didn't need the additional features that other programs have.   This is a very cheap program but I'm not convinced that it was worth the $19 I spent on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the end, I'm disappointed in the product. I had the opportunity to have a professional install this device, and they were very professional.   I was looking for a small and compact device that could be used with a car. It turned out to be a little bit too big and cumbersome.  I had to put the device on my dash to use it as a wireless headset and it's awkward to reach over.  And while I do love that this device does work on all of my bluetooth enabled devices, I can't tell you how many times I've needed to use Bluetooth on a car I just plugged this into and it just wouldn't work.

I also see other reviews that say that the battery is really bad, but in my opinion, it's a minor flaw.   The problem is that it will go to full brightness and stop blinking after a few seconds.  After the batteries start dying out, you have to re-insert the batteries.  This is definitely not worth the $39, but I would buy another if I were on the market, but they're not.

Instead, the unit has been leaking a lot of water into the housing and is constantly dropping. I am a big fan of Panasonic's and will be buying more Panasonic's in the future. The new HC-S7 and HC-P2 are nice and all, but the HC-7 is my "last Panasonic" unit. The HC-9 and HC10 look great, but are not as nice as my HC-6 and HC9 (the ones I have).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a Sony MDR-R10 which I think is a good, basic Walkman.   The Walkman does not hold a charge very well; its batteries will die in about a week or so unless you put them in a different case, which is quite bothersome.  The earbuds do not last very long either.  This is a product for those who are trying to live without music and who have no idea what to do about it.   It did the job just fine but had to buy another pair because it was a lemon.    Pros: -Great value and works great -Batteries last forever. -Sound quality is great. Cons: -Tinted glass (which makes them very ugly)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first one was broken in less than a week. The next one has also been broken in but the screen seems to be permanently off. Also, there's the problem of what you're getting in exchange for the "new" product:  After having the new screen installed in a new computer, I am not sure I can put up with it as the new monitor just isn't the same experience as the old. The screen is very reflective. I'm hoping they'll replace the LCD.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is a simple item for doing simple things.   In some ways it is very frustrating to try to use it correctly.  Some of the commands are written as if it were a simple joystick.  Very frustrating to find all these things wrong.  The joystick works and is easy to use with a mouse and keyboard.  There are some very small improvements that can be made in the future that would be good.  I am not happy to use this at all.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently bought an   new   laptop and   immediately   got   bad   feedback   from people using it. It   does   work   but   the   wireless   is   a  real   problem   so I  had to take it back.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have this item in my house, but it's a flimsy plastic device that's easy to break if you drop it.   The thing looks cheap and doesn't look very good on a table.  A friend who bought one said he'd give it two stars, but he can't believe all the reviews about this device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a great device for the price, but the speaker is not the greatest.

Product Review: Good, but better speaker would be nice.  is a really good speaker for the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this to use for making my living room music. It is very loud, and the buttons are very difficult to use. They have two tiny switches on the bottom that are difficult to find (when you know they are there) and only turn them on. They are easily accessible if you are standing next to your TV, but the volume control is too small to use with your thumb, which was a problem when I was using it for making music. I also used the remote to play the music but couldn't get it to work. I'm going to return it and buy the same model that I already have, which is a $20 Sonos.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is not the most beautiful or powerful device and I have to say the design is really not attractive for a small smart phone, but for a very cheap device you can not beat it, just a bit over priced. If I were to upgrade from an iPhone it would be the HTC One or the LG G4. It also has a great camera. If you are looking for a great looking smart phone then this is the one for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is not a great deal and I would not recommend it.   There are no buttons, no display, no port for headphones, no headphone jack, no USB port, no CD tray, and no volume knob. The power adapter that comes with the unit is only designed for an older Samsung unit and the connection is not as good as the ones you'll find for the Apple units.  This can't be used with any of the other portable digital music players because the unit doesn't have a built in CD player.  I would rather pay the extra money for a $50 Apple portable that does have a CD drive and has better sound quality. I think I will be using my Apple portable more often than I thought.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had some kind of electronic issue with my Dell XPS M1230, which I did not notice until after it had been sitting in my office for three days, and I couldn't get it out. A Dell customer care representative got my order shipped to a repair facility and after two days it finally arrived. The issue is that a key, which allows the XPS to connect to a monitor, is not a "key" as it appears to be. It's a "device key." It requires a specific cable to get into your computer, which takes forever, and is very expensive. My problem is that Dell refuses to send me a replacement cable, even though the warranty on the cable was voided. I can only imagine that if I was out of the office with a problem, they would have to send the Xps on a plane for me. I have had no luck with the Xpens from Dell, and no idea if the same problem will go away when the warranty is voided, but I'd rather spend the $15 to get a replacement than have to pay for the cable.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned several Samsung phones over the past 8 years, and this is the only one I can't live without.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You cannot tell a good from a bad by the quality and durability of the phone.   I don't use it very much and I have a Samsung phone but I've always felt that the Galaxy S3 is better because of the camera and the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this as a backup for my camera, and the video quality is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The problem with the remote is:  The remote is a pain to use. It's extremely awkward to use, and is just too small and light.   It is an easy fix, however.  I recommend that the remote be made smaller, as you can now use a smaller key chain for a smaller price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only problem I've had with my new   Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is that the battery is about to run out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So, I decided to try this because it seemed like a good idea. I was surprised that it was so bad. The speaker/sound volume is terrible, there is no battery indicator or any indication that you have been charged, you can't even use the power adapter the same as you can for a phone (I tried it). I have the samsung galaxy s2, I bought it from walmart and it works.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This thing doesn't work, at all. I bought it thinking it would do the job as a flashlight. The switch is not very easy to hit, which makes it useless as a weapon.   I've tried it with a bunch of batteries, the 2 that came with it were defective. I've had it for 4 months now, I've never used it for anything else, it just sits there on my shelf doing nothing. It's like a big piece of garbage.   and now I have to buy a new one, too bad they charge the same as old ones do   Was this review helpful to you?

It is the only   This is a good value   It is really   a   phone, but it is really bad   I like the S3's   hardware   but the   UI is not   good   and it's not really  very useful Rated 5 out of 5 by Piotr from Great price Very good and cheap, I use it to read a news in bed at night and I read the article it came in, it doesn't need the battery and I also put it in the pocket of my pajamas, it's light weight and very compact, the display quality is really good, the speaker is really loud, it has a micro SD card, very good quality.  Rated 1 out of 1 by kp from Disappointed in this product. The screen is bright but the sound is very weak. I thought Samsung had improved its speakers on the S4/S5 but not on this phone.  Rated 3 out of 4 by M.J. from Pretty good camera, only a few features I liked - the camera has a good autofocus and I like how I can switch the settings - a few things I found annoying - the flash doesn't work when the camera's auto focus is set to wide shot.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this a week ago and installed it yesterday.   This thing is terrible.  It takes way too long to switch out the batteries.  I have to manually push all the buttons on the unit.  The screen on this thing is horrible.  What ever the reason, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!    5 out of 5 Good starter I recently purchased this kit and found that it did what it said. It was simple to use and a lot less expensive than my older e-cig and it works well.  3 out of 3 Bought this kit about a month ago. Installation took a little longer than expected. I'm pretty sure the first 2 units I purchased I should have ordered a kit, because I did need to use a wrench to install the screws on one of the 2 batteries. Other than that it works fine.  the batteries are of low power but a nice little starter for someone that can't afford to replace the batteries every 2 weeks. I got the two batteries they sell separately which I highly recommend if you are using it everyday. The one negative is the battery holder it comes with (which isn't made with quality, plastic). The other negative is that it's so small you need to keep your hand a bit closer to the battery to see how long the last one lasts. -I will buy from a better brand, since I don't feel the batteries at all, and the tiny battery holder can't fit the 2 of them together. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had this electronic device for 3 months now and it hasn't stopped playing songs for more than a few seconds.  I bought this to replace my old turntable and I have to say that the sound quality is terrible.  This device plays only at a certain speed.  The sound quality and noise level are far inferior than a cheap digital music player like a mp3 player.  To be honest, I've tried to replace this with a cheap turntary that I got on sale for about 50 dollars and it has made a huge difference.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only negative reviews I can find regarding this product are those who think the product is a great design but it's just not very useful. One reviewer said the device would not work properly in his own house because it doesn't have a power cable.  The same reviewer said he could see "no need" for this device, but that the design was "very cool."   I bought this because it said it was compatible with all devices, like the iPhone.  But then I found the device did not work with my iPhone 5, and had to purchase a new one.   It's not that the device is useless. It's just that it's so basic and basic electronics are so much more useful than the Apple products.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a refurbished   PC from the original owner at a very reasonable price.   After installing, I ran into   major problems, and the owner had no   answers to   what was wrong.  He   didn't pay for the service, and told me that he   couldn't take it back until   he got some of the money back.  The   parts that came with it   were not even compatible with   my new PC.  Not only was the   refurbished unit defective, the  original owner had left them on the shelf after   selling the PC. My new PC was just as buggy as the  \ original. I ended up having to call the original  \ owner's company, and had to pay another $100 to get a refurb unit.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark from Well made and works great! As the name implies it's a refurbishing of the original. Installation was simple and easy. The monitor works great as do most of the other specs. I'd buy it again.

I was a little bummed because of the price. The next day I came home, saw that my phone wasn't at all where I dropped it, and I thought, 'Wow, that thing is old and stupid.' I was completely surprised at how cheap the phone is. So for $80 that's a good buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the N3DSXL and was so excited when it came. I had never owned a 3DS before, and was super excited about the fact that the DS is no longer a 2D device. However, once I took it out of the box, it became clear that Nintendo has lost it and it is no more than a 2.5D device with no 3D capabilities.  The N3 is a poor gamepad that will never be used.    Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are so many cool features to this app - but then there are so few features! There are just a couple features that I really like:  One of the cool things is the "Smart Alarm" feature. It uses a built-in app, so it is not like you have to download anything.  The other feature I like is the auto-turn-on feature. If there is something that is burning your house down and you need to make sure the house doesn't burn down, this is the way to do it! Unfortunately, this app is just not useful. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a Dell computer that is extremely fast for the price.   The first two months I used it a lot, the second two months were the first two month I used the computer.  After the second month, I found I didn't need the computer as much as I thought I did.  I would have to re-start my work at least 2 or 3 times a day.  The monitor was a disappointment to me.  It is very low resolution.  As an engineer, I thought my computer would have been high resolution for my work.  At work, the only computer I use is a high resolution Dell workstation.  When I came home, the monitor was only good for reading, not much else.  Very low resolution display for the cost.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I think the phone has an issue that can be fixed easily.   The phone is great if you're looking for a good phone for the money.   Review of DJT-SX5 - White/ Black -   This is the 5th DJT I've purchased, from this company and the others have been good. The phone was well packed and had everything I needed.  The only issue I had was the charger for the phone was not included, as this item had to be bought separately from the DJT website and the DJTT Store. It should be in stock in the next couple of days.  I'm not sure if it's worth getting another one as it has been the same problem for many years now, so it probably will be fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If this was an electronic device that had a decent battery life, great features and a good price point, I would love it. But, in all honesty, I can't imagine anyone being very pleased with this device.  Great product, but be prepared for it to burn out and drop to pieces.   In comparison to many other tablets I own, this one is the most capable, is easy to carry around, but if you want the most features and best battery life and performance, I'd still choose the HP Stream 7.  I'm hoping they have the battery life figured out, but this is likely to be my last tablet purchase. This is definitely a good device for its price point.  As long as it is able to provide the same battery life as its high-end competition, I won't complain.  When you take the battery out of the equation, you'll see that this device does everything it advertises and more.  For anyone looking for a good, but small tablet to hold in your backpack, it is hard to go wrong with this model.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPad can handle email, web surfing, and reading books, but a lot of people who are using the thing, I can see it being a nuisance. If the display and battery didn't die out, I might use the thing to browse the internet (though not to much), but I don't want to keep recharging it and it gets pretty warm after extended use, so it's more of a novelty than anything else. Also, the keyboard is awful. It just doesn't feel comfortable to type on.   I'd rather have a Kindle    For the price, I think the Kindle is a much better product for most people. The size and weight and feel of a Kindle is really nice, and it has a built-in battery that won't die on you. But the iPad is the one I use most often, and there's no doubt about the iPad's keyboard: it just works better. If you want the screen to be a little smaller, go with the Kindle, otherwise just go for the iPad.  The only reason I'm not giving the iPad a 5/5 is because the design of the iPad (and Kindle) doesn't match the product.  It's got too many different buttons, so many of the controls are a bit confusing and hard to use. I'd prefer if the buttons were more logically laid out. And the interface could use a bit more refinement and polish. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - the only thing that kept this item from being even better is that they did not put in a usb to usb adapter, I use my iPad Pro for videos, podcasts, and movies - but I'm a pro gamer that has to carry a usb keyboard and mouse, and it's annoying to have to plug it in - this is a bad device, but the best thing about it is that I used it on my old Macbook Pro which doesn't have a USB port - and that's a big plus
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It has not been the easiest or the most reliable in the past. I would recommend a case or cover for it to have. The power button gets hot if it is pressed too often and the case can get very hot to the touch.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed about this was that it does NOT work properly. If you do not have a USB port that is the way to go. If your laptop has USB ports then this is the end of the line for you.   I just replaced my laptop to a new one that has a usb port and this didn't fit.  It does not fit and is too wide for a USB slot and will not fit any type of device.  Rated 4 out of 5 by DixieRouge from The small computer doesn't get a ton of love... But I do like the small size. I do have a few small gripes, but I've read the reviews. It seems to be a good deal, especially for the price, so I'll get over it. The first problem that comes to my mind, is that the case seems very flimsy. It would not be a problem if the case were sturdy enough to hold the phone securely, but when you take it out of the case and try to push it into place you feel like you could break it. Second, when the case is closed and in your pocket it seems to have a tendency to get pulled out, and there is no way to get it back in place, just leave it on the ground and the case will fall off and you'll lose it. I have found that when you first open the case, the case needs to be kept flat on the table or you might have to try and flip the phone around, but if you have to move it around you'll probably break it anyway. Third, the battery only lasts about 20 mins. It takes 3 hours to fully charge, so you can expect to be charged for only half an hour and half the time. I would recommend this to anyone that uses a phone or tablet all day and wants the extra space and light weight for the extra battery.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    You have a great product, but the buttons don't work very well:  My computer would not come on after I had left the lights on for 15 minutes or more (or was unable to wake up the computer in the morning), I finally found this solution, I left it on while I got ready in the evening. I then returned it the next day to have it fixed, and now it works again! So I would suggest not having a single light on for a long time. The lights do not work on their own and you have to be pressing buttons to turn them on:  I bought this for a friend. When she came over she couldn't use the computer for a couple of weeks because she would have to turn off all the lights in her house, the computer is working fine on her system as well. It also has a light which goes on and off when the computer turns on and has a few more buttons. So it's not a bad device if you don't want lights, it is a good device if they are your only options and you can turn them off on a schedule.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just got this item and it is very cool. I was hoping it would have a USB connection for charging.   A USB charger would be great   However, I didn't get one and the batteries died when they went through about 6 hours of constant charging. I will be looking for an alternative to use with a phone or tablet. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - - - If you have this or another one of these and the battery dies, the unit just keeps running. That is unless you plug it in to an AC outlet and plug it back into your computer.   What's worse, you have to buy another $10 and $15 for this kind of thing.

I know it's supposed to be for a bunch of kids but that's a really big limitation   The camera is pretty much crap and the camera app is terrible   They could have at least added a small headphone jack for when you don't have any Bluetooth and just want to listen to your tunes without the mess of having a wired connection
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This review is about the battery:  It took me a long time to get over the fact that this battery is made for   a   phone and not a  laptop or   gaming console. The battery   lasts a long   time, but it takes up quite a bit of space and the little plastic box it comes in   is just not as sturdy as a  gaming or  electronic device should be. The   box also   has a "screw in" that holds the battery inside in a way that   makes it difficult to remove and even harder   to reattach. When it gets low on power, the battery just   sits in a weird position, and the metal   end of the   battery is a very sharp metal, and you can see the sharp metal end through the battery door.   It seems like there is no real way to charge this battery that works at a standard 1 amp.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, the device is not even good, its horrible. It sucks down the batteries in half to a quarter of the time. Second, when it does work, it sucks down my battery faster than I can turn it off.   And finally, it is a complete failure.   Don't waste your money, and don't waste money on this product.  This charger is the worst piece of garbage i have ever bought. I gave the company a try and the fact that they are selling this piece of trash to someone who has just ordered their first pc is the reason i gave them the 1 star rating. I will never buy this device again and will return it if i can.

I also can't find a way to install Windows 8, and if you are a PC gamer, then I recommend you to buy something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am not a big fan of using my iPhone to play a game. It's very unreliable.   It was very nice that you have a way to change your games, but this is the only way I can play any other game except "Star Wars Battlefront."   If you have an Apple product, buy one of these. If you don't have an iPhone, go buy a tablet. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device came with everything you needed, but then again everything else I need comes in a box, so I'm not sure what to complain about. The power button is easily lost. The battery comes out with the device. A couple of times the screen would turn black and I had to unplug the device to get it to turn on. This could be a flaw, but it's a little more annoying than the other bugs I have had.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only thing I don't like about this product is the price. It is expensive, especially if you want something that is going to work for many years. However, for the amount of money you spend on this you can get a much better one. The thing does have a few problems, mainly with the battery, but that is about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this watch as part of a bundle that included a smartwatch. I was disappointed by the quality of the hardware. It looks fine on the wrist and the screens are nice. It's nice to have a second display (with a secondary dial, so you can see when you have new notifications and when they are going to expire). But the screens on the side of the watch are kind of flimsy, so they don't stay flat on the watch. They are a lot harder to snap down than the front screen. Also, the band is just a little too big. I didn't think this would be a big issue, since it's only a wristwatch, but it does make it a little harder to wear than the smaller watches I usually wear.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A good, sturdy, good sound/quality sound:   I've only had it for about a week so I can't comment on the durability or sound quality. I have a couple of other headphones that are made by Fostex and they are better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was ok. I bought the "S" version because the "A" is really loud. But, the power cord is the worst ever. It was so short that when I put the battery in the device, I had to bend over to do it. And the power switch is hard to press. If I was just paying a $30 difference and I wasn't so used to using my laptop, I'd give this 3 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought an ipod from Best Buy on a whim and after reading some of the other reviews on here and in my local stores. I really didn't see how this was worth it, and the only thing I found about it was that it wasn't the exact same model as my ipod. So I decided to get the older model instead and after doing that I realized I would still have to pay a lot of money to replace my ipods.   There was no support about the fact that there were some other models out there. It also was a little hard to set up for me at first and there were a couple of things that were a little finicky. But then I got it and used it a few times and I am very happy with the product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I love my ez-pz 100 watt bulb and am very happy with it. However, the warranty was voided by the manufacturer due to some minor cosmetic flaw. They replaced the bulb, which seems a little overkill given the fact that it's just a bulb, but that's what they were trying to do. I hope they can do a better job in the future.  Rated 5 out of 5 by LASSA from Works Great I bought a replacement 100w bulb in a good size bulb and I also got a new light that is more bright. I also like the fact they came with a socket so I can plug it into my existing plug. They also included a socket to plug into. My only suggestion is I wish the switch was a bit larger so it's easier to get it in/out of the socket. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device I bought was really nice but it's too small and the buttons are too small for my liking. My iPad and iPhone are better.   If you're going to buy it, get something else that's more substantial. The device is made in Japan which is cheaper than China but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the quality of the device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was too easy to put together, but after a while my finger was so sore after using it that I ended up getting a new one. I would not recommend this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I wanted to love this device until I discovered its shortcomings.   The screen does not turn on or off - so you must press and hold the button for 2 minutes before it will turn on.  This means you have to be constantly pressing the button.  The problem isn't the screen - it's the fact that the button is very close to the screen edge.  I have an Apple keyboard, and the key that I press to turn the screen on and off is right above the button I press in order to get the device to turn on and shut down - it does the same thing, but far better.  It takes forever to turn off the phone, and there is no way to reset it without taking it apart - so when it finally turns off it is very dark and you have no idea how you have managed to lose it.  Overall, I had high hopes for this item, but ultimately I was very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This review is written by a non-computer enthusiast who bought a new computer with an old cell phone in it. He has not had this problem for a year or so. He did a lot of research before buying his new PC. The only part of the review I didn't like was the "instructions". I got it from an independent "computer shop" who apparently didn't have a good understanding of electronics. The instructions for connecting the power cord to the PC were totally wrong. I followed the instructions for a while and then went back to the web to get help from someone who did understand electronics. It wasn't much, but at least it was something.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    They are way overpriced for the amount of storage you get.   You can save a lot by buying your own e-reader.   Great value for money and size:  I bought one of these for my 13 year old son to give him a little extra room on his bed. It was pretty easy to set up and use as a stand for his iPad. It holds quite a few books so it doesn't take up much real estate. The only real problem is that the memory card is a little too small. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a very well made unit but I just wish it was better and had USB charging. I wanted it for the camera but it is too big to fit with the camera. The charger is only good if the battery is still good. Also it is very small. It can be better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery lasts a week, and that's only because the phone is so powerful that you don't notice it's running low at all. But when you can't even charge it, it's a total waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I received the keyboard, it was the worst keyboard I have ever used. The back doesn't come off of the keyboard (even though you can take a screwdriver and break off the tabs). You can't get the keyboard out without tearing it, and the keyboard doesn't have rubber strips that hold in place the keys. The keyboard is very flimsy. The keys do not act like they are supposed to, they have a weird bounce that makes them hard to type with. I used to type on a QWERTY keyboard and this is very different. The layout is so different that it will be difficult for some to use. My son has a similar keyboard but it doesn't feel as flimsy as the one I received.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The price is great for the size of the device but it lacks features which I expected. The battery only lasts a few hours but it is a bit loud at 3AM when I sleep with it on. It also has a bad smell, so that's also a problem.    4 out of 5 for cheap I bought this device as a present for my wife who's a nurse. I can't fault it for being cheap as it was. It's light weight and can fit in the pocket of my jeans. The controls are clear, the audio is good (if slightly quiet), it's reasonably accurate and it's very easy to use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've owned this item a few times and bought 2 more. These are the best speakers I've ever had. The high sound quality from the Bose speakers is a nice benefit, but the sound from these speakers is incredible. I've had them for a few weeks now and they are always blasting out a CD or listening to music. It's not even a very loud volume! I'm not even sure the speakers would work for a subwoofer. But, if I'm going to have speakers in my car, I'll have these over anything else.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a computer over 10 years ago, a Toshiba laptop that runs Windows, not Mac OS X. When I started using it, I found I had to constantly switch batteries. In fact, in a few months, the battery in the back had burned through and I had no way to restore it. I didn't even have time to change it. The only positive thing is that if your battery doesn't last a year, you can just buy a new one. However, for a 10 year old computer, this is unacceptable. You are paying over $1,000 dollars for this computer, why not spend a little more time getting a longer life out of it? In short: you get what you pay for   If you are serious about learning how to be a computer person:  Get the book by Jurgen.   Jurgens book is a fantastic primer on how to use a computer. His approach to the book is so much more approachable than what you hear from a lot of computer teachers and is full of lots of examples. He's got some great stories to share as well that I had not thought of before. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new Apple ipad tablet two years ago, and the screen is fine, but I have a feeling it will have a serious problem in the next 2-3 years (I don't see why the manufacturer would design a device this poorly).  Rated 4 out of 5 by Lillian from Good for casual use I just purchased the ipad mini in August 2016 and I am extremely pleased. It seems to be well built and easy to use. The screen is beautiful, but it is a little difficult to use for my liking. The apps do not have the flash animation or other flashy features that the iPad 2 has. I am able to type and view emails on my ipad, but when I watch videos on my iPad, the sound quality is very poor. I wish that there was a way to turn off the flash, but overall it is very easy to set up and use.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the "C" version of this "Pro" version. It's nice to have a dedicated hard drive. But it's very weak. It could not be installed in my computer without taking out the hard drive and replacing it with the card. But to the user it looks great. This is a good computer, but you won't be happy if you want it to last.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Very nice, sturdy, durable and flexible motherboard Nice motherboard. I have only had it a few days and already started getting very good use out of it. The only problem I have is the fact that the two cables that attach the card are very thick. The two cables themselves are small, but not enough to overcome the stiffness of the board.  was a little disappointed to find the motherboard was the same price as the cpu, cpu had a great design and cooling system with better heatsink, GPU is better looking than the motherboard, but the board did not have much room for the GPU. The other problem is the card, it's not made for a power supply. It takes a 2.5 inch plug adapter, not a 5.25 inch adapter. This motherboard has a great cooling system but the card does not fit. You get what you pay for. This one was good, but I would look into getting a different brand and a different card.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's just so frustrating.   I was not able to play on my PC, it only shows up on my iPad.  I tried it on my Mac.  The app crashes every now and then, which is annoying, but the actual gameplay is bad.  First of all, the graphics are terrible. They are so far off-model they look like cartoons.  Also, the games look like a 2D cartoon. I don't think they are that bad, it's just that they are so bad. I had to quit after a while due to the lag and lag.  Now the good news is that I got a refund.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these devices for my two kids, and I LOVE the wireless function but the device is defective and causes my kids to use up a lot of my allowance. I am really disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my 13 year old, who has problems with his hearing. I was going to buy the earbuds for him to listen to music with (and he does not like earbud's). This works fine for music, but he found it to be really annoying for reading. When I went to use it, it didn't come out because the ear bud didn't fit. I then tried to twist it in the ear so it would come out, but then the cord broke off. I'm not sure if I just got a bad model, but I can not recommend this earbuddy because it is too expensive for what you get.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The build quality is excellent. It's very nice. It comes with an extra battery that is nice to have. But you cannot connect a cable to this device.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my second Apple Macbook Pro. First one, bought from an authorized Apple reseller, was terrible.   I've read all the reviews of this new one and agree with most of them.  The screen is too big for my needs, the keyboard is too small for my tastes, the trackpad and buttons are terrible. The battery life is great, so it won't run out for months like the first one.  It would have been nice to get a different color case like the one I used for the first model but there is nothing wrong with the original. The only good thing is that the speakers are louder.  I hope this one lasts for years to come.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I used this device in the past when I was using a laptop and then after some time I realized that the quality of the signal in a small space was not as good as I would have thought.  The design of the circuit board is good enough but I can not accept the lack of connection between the input and output pins when it comes to charging.  As for the battery, it has a good capacity but not enough to keep the charger running forever. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (I own a Sony XBR-X930L)   I love my XB-933L.   It has a super smooth and buttery sound.  The battery life is excellent.  Unfortunately, Sony has decided to use a cheap plastic build for this. It's cheap feeling, plastic and it just feels cheap.  It's also not very rugged.  So you can't take it anywhere and you really don't want to.  You can't use the wireless connection on it.  I got mine for my wife to use while we travel, as it also has a USB connection.  And it just doesn't give me that nice deep sound when I'm using it at home. I got it for the sound, but not because it's more durable and rugged. This is a good sound, the XB933l.  But if you want that kind of audio, don't buy it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My original Samsung Galaxy S4 was great. I thought the hardware was on par with the S3, and the S4 added a little more performance, as well as some interesting features. However, the S5 takes a few steps backward. It's more expensive than the S III, and it's just as hard to use. I'm going back to my S3 with a big "meh" on the S IV.  Product Review: Galaxy S5
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item to replace an older one that had a bad design problem. This product worked great for about a month and then quit working. The new unit worked fine and has a few minor problems such as no power indicator but they are easy to deal with. My only issue is that this one won't power on at all so I bought another one to replace it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The most annoying thing about my Apple Watch was the vibration on my wrist, which wasn't a problem before the watch came out. After a few weeks of using it, my wrist started to hurt. With the watch on, the vibrations were barely noticeable, but once the watch started vibrating I could feel it in my wrist. The vibrating is extremely irritating. I also found the battery life to be very poor when compared to my phone. I'm a heavy user, and my phone has been with me all day. Now I'm out of juice. The fact that it doesn't work as a timepiece is the worst part.  My last Apple Watch The only reason I've not bought another Apple watch is I want something I can wear on my day-to-day that I trust won't break. My Apple Watch has a few minor bugs and problems I'd like fixed. But I don't believe any of the big bugs that bother me will affect the functionality or longevity of this product. I've been wearing the watch daily and haven't had a single issue with it (including the one above). The Apple Watch does everything a watch does and more. I can be out and about without my phone, which is extremely handy. It's easy to get directions to the store using the watch, and it's simple to set alerts for important appointments. I get text messages, emails and calendar events. I even use the watch to call my kids while I'm driving. It even keeps track of my flights and the amount of time I've put in. I'll be buying an Apple Watch with LTE when it becomes available. But for now I'll stick with the watch I've had for the past few months. Hats off to Apple. There are only so many things you can do with an electronic device. With Apple's first foray into the wearable market, they have the opportunity to build something more than just a fashion accessory. The potential is limitless.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product looks like a very expensive electronic device when in reality it's a very cheap electronic device with lots of bloatware and crapware. It's one of the worst things I've purchased in my life. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box is that the computer was dirty! It had some very bad scuff marks on the bottom of the case. I took out the box, and there were no cables inside! The case was so filthy I was afraid to turn it on because the bottom case would leak and you'd be stuck with a worthless box. When I started using the computer, I noticed a ton of other problems: the wireless was extremely slow, the screen was so small, the keyboard was completely non responsive. I can't believe this company will sell such a terrible product. This was a major disappointment from a company I've been shopping at for years.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve from The Best Product I've Ever Bought   I can honestly say that after purchasing a Dell i7520 I didn't want to go back to my own laptop. It was too large and heavy for my liking. It had a lot of bling, but not enough for me. I decided to upgrade to this laptop. What I got was the best purchase I've ever made. It is beautiful and the performance is outstanding. This is one of my favorite machines. There was nothing on the market that could compare with the Dell. I purchased the model A1510 (15.6" diagonal screen). This laptop is a beast. It has a 4th Gen Intel i7 processor (with 6MB cache), 4GB RAM and 1TB HD. It boots in about 10 seconds and it runs all of my PC games flawlessly. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone. If you need a great machine and don't want the size of a 13 inch laptop, this is the best. It costs nearly the same as the 13" laptop I'm used to, and it's still small enough to take everywhere. .
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had my e-mail for 4 months and it still gives me the "Your email address cannot be changed" error.   It should just send out the message and be done with it.  You should be asking about the issue rather than trying to make it worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod mini is not an iPod that will take to the road with you. It's not exactly sleek, and it has a weak battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is not the best gaming mouse I've used, but that's all I can say.   It works fine in the games I use it in, but I never get a smooth experience. I tried changing the DPI setting to something between 120 and 144 and it doesn't seem to affect the speed of the cursor. The buttons also don't work at all.   Write a positive review about the "G" edition of the G502:  The G502 features a more comfortable design than its predecessor.  The design of the sensor and the palm rest are good, but the buttons are the worst part of this mouse.  Some of the click resistance is expected from a low-end mouse, but all of the keystrokes are clunky and have a really loud click.  For a new mouse, this one works great and the G302 was a great addition to my gaming setup.  You can only use this mouse in Razer's Synapse software, which is a bit of a bummer, but it's still my favorite mouse and one of my main gaming mice of all time.

I am looking forward to getting the screen replacement because my phone is the best I have ever owned. The battery was fine. I just want to get the screen replaced. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a small computer off of Craigslist for $150.00. After 3 hours of using it I realized that the power button has a small hole that allows the power to travel down the cord with a good amount of flex. It just doesn't work well. It seems to go all the way down the wire and back up the other way. As a result the power is not where I want it. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I tried to return it for a refund but they said the warranty was good for only 30 days.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My main device is my   Kindle Fire HDX 8.0 which was not the best experience   I could give. After having a   battery in it for 8 months,   the   connector had fallen out and   it was impossible to get a new one. I bought a  Amazon replacement battery that had a small connector on the  the side. It has worked out well.   Fantastic phone:  This is the best phone  I have ever used. My phone is now   a collector for people who like   old phones. The   main reason   to own a  is the large display on the screen.  If I can afford to have an  iPhone 6S I would be able to   own both but I have a $400 phone and it has to be pretty good for that price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A terrible device. The first time I connected it it started flashing "0" when the screen went on. I took it off, tried another USB port, and it worked. That lasted about 5 seconds, then it started "0". The problem has been with this device for months and I can't get it to work. It's not even an Apple model with an "i" after it. It is the first time in years I've ever given a product negative review.

Very Disapointed: Was lookingfor a backuplight for my garage and this seemed to be a good option. However, when I turned it on, it would not turn on, and instead would blink the LED. Now, I have the same problem on my other light, so I am out two $100 lights. Not a great deal!  Customer Service  I ordered this product based on the recommendations of the site. I did however read reviews about it, and was expecting it to be better than the ones I read on other sites. As expected, it does not charge in a very fast manner, and there seems to be some type of problem. I have read reviews stating that they have ordered batteries from B&H, and it has also failed. I went to B&D on a Saturday and asked to pick up the item. I was told that if they did not have the item, they would not be able to replace it (this is a 3 day return). B&B said that they would have to contact their parts supplier and ask them to ship it back, and I would have until Monday to pick it up. I called B&C on a Monday and was told they would no longer have the part. The part was $9. I contacted customer service, and explained what I was experiencing. The customer service person said she will be in contact with B&K to see what they can do. I am going to hold off from purchasing anything else from B & C. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my son and he was not impressed.   It took me quite a bit of time to figure out what to do about it.  My son has an iPad 2 and he is a beginner at electronics.  He doesn't know that all the buttons on the keyboard are there because the buttons are not always on the keys. The keyboard is not a perfect fit for him either.  It's like putting a little baby doll's hand on his shoulder. He has been able to learn to use the touch screen and have him playing on my iPad, but it is a little hard on the back of the keyboard because he just can't sit right.  If you have an older child or you can't stand the idea of your kids using a touch screen then you might not want this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    First of all, the screen on this phone is horrible.

Not once did it ever go through, not even when I went to a wireless hotspot. The speakerphone works okay but the quality is terrible and it's a pain to use. The touch screen is a little bit better. The only thing that is better is the camera. The camera has a little glitch at times. But still, not much to work with. For the price point, this thing is a joke.    Customer Support:  (5/5)   This phone is awesome and easy to use and is very powerful! I can send and receive texts, calls, and file email messages on this mobile device. The phone's internet capabilities are excellent and it also has wifi on it, so you have great online experience! The battery life is perfect for my needs and it comes with a nice leather case to carry around. So, the phone is definitely worth buying, especially if you're looking for a phone that's easy to operate and uses the greatest phones' features.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As an engineer, I like a good mechanical keyboard, but not on this one. After spending $100, I would have expected better from a company that is not well known in the computer industry. Not only was the keyboard horrible to type on, it was also quite hard to navigate with a number pad. It has too many keys. The thumb keys are on the left side of the keyboard so the "tapping" on the number pad is harder.   I was so excited to get this keyboard, as I love mechanical keyboards. So many of them have good switches and are built well, but this one just wasn't for me. I ended up purchasing a cheap keyboard that's nearly as good for a similar price. This keyboard is a total waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My iPhone 2 is not very good.   After buying it from Amazon in early 2013, it has never been connected to an Ethernet cable.  In addition, the screen is very dim, and it has a weird sound when you type.  At the time, the iPhone 2 was on sale at $199 and the $50 for a 2.8" floppy drive made the whole package less than $300. I am so disappointed in Apple.  I do not think I will buy a new Apple product this year.   Pros: Works well on a variety of systems.  Cons: None
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are 2 main reasons the battery lasted 1 day and then stopped: The first was the charger was not in very good condition, so I was not able to do much to improve it. I put some of the original charger in and it was much better, but still not good enough. The second reason is that the charging cord was so short that it bent a lot and when I tried to use the device I just got a bunch of static from the cord. So if you want an electronic device that will charge and work but not give you static, then this device is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen is fine, but the screen goes out of focus when I close it.  I do not like to close my computer or laptop at night.   (I do use this computer, but only for web surfing, not work, so it is a good buy.)   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Buy This computer is excellent. The screen looks amazing, the sound and quality of the speakers are great, and the mouse is so comfortable. This computer has all the things I needed. I bought a second one for my brother. He is a professional and uses this computer at work. I have not used it that much yet and so far I am impressed. The computer is pretty large, and has a lot of storage capacity, so I have yet to use the internal hard drive because I do a lot online. However, I did download several programs so I am getting more of an idea of what I can do with it. So far, I am happy with this purchase and the service I received from the store was fast, professional, and courteous.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the beginning, I was excited to get the new computer in my life. However, the first time I used it, I lost my warranty, and the unit wouldn't boot up. This could have been avoided if the store had given me a good warranty and made a good replacement unit.    Great device, but, it took a long time to get back to a good place. - August 22, 2011 - August 16, 2011 Anonymous Reviewed By: This thing is great and I love it for what it is... it's a tablet. But it has a number of serious problems: I live in a cold climate, and even if I get it to work properly, it's not reliable in the winter; there are no Wi-Fi radios; there's no battery indicator (only on the device itself); there's really only a few programs that I use; and it doesn't work with a USB-C port. In summary, it is a great device for what you can do with it, but it has serious issues. For those of you who are curious about the issues: there's a "fog on the screen" issue, because the screen is so dim, it creates a fog effect on the screens. I got a working replacement and the fog is now gone. Also, there's an issue with the USB-A ports on this device; they're all dead at the time of this review, so I can't actually test them and they don't work at all. I'm not sure what the issue is, but I'll ask for a replacement and I will update this review if I hear anything. This is a "buy it now" item for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is a good product, but the quality of the product is questionable. I bought the item to repair a bad device and found out that it could not even recognize the battery. This was a huge bummer since I needed a new battery because it was getting too old. This company is good if you're willing to wait a couple of weeks to get your replacement, but not if you want to replace a bad item with a bad one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had the first of the new LG Optimus G's a few months back. It had a lot of promise. But, I really didn't have a lot to show for my $600 investment. The sound quality was awful, and the camera just wasn't the best.  I haven't had an upgrade to that model since then.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a cheapo cheapo from an Indian site, and the device never booted up. It just sat there and did nothing, and then at the end of the month it started booting up again, but with a garbled screen. The device was a brand name and model that I didn't even want or need, so I did a lot of research before purchasing the item.   That being said, I'm glad I didn the deal, as the device worked well on my network, but I would not have bought it if I had the choice.  Rated 1 out of 5 by SteveG from Bad experience so far The customer service is abysmal. I have ordered from various online vendors before but with this experience I am moving away from ebay. ,  ,
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a new iPhone 6s   from Best Buy on Friday, and received it on Saturday.   In the box I discovered a crack in the case and the screen was cracked.  I emailed the Apple support for a replacement  and was told that I should just replace the entire phone,  which will cost me around $200. I got rid of the cracked screen and case and  ordered a new  one to use while the phone is being fixed.  The case cracked again  and now  the screen is cracked again.  Please advise me how  to get the iPhone 6 to go into repair mode so  it does not crack again  I need to use the phone and  pay a premium  for a repair.  Thank you. - Mike, OH  Answer :   As you probably noticed, the iPhone is not considered to be a "broken" device, even when it has been opened and soldered together.  If you order a new phone and get a damaged unit then you are free to return it, but Apple will most likely just replace it.  To order a replacement unit, simply order an Apple Care Pack with your purchase.  Once you receive the replacement phone, you will have to buy a new screen and/or case.  All iPhone 6 units purchased on Apple.com will ship in an unopened box.  You will be refunded for your purchase at a later date.  As for getting the screen fixed, I recommend calling Apple and ordering a repair and Apple will repair it free of charge.  Here is the link to order a repair on apple.com.  It's really easy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the worst   (but probably not the last)   I used the remote for a couple of days, after which it gave a single line of gibberish. The problem:  The remote is awful and there's no way around it:  I had to go through a couple iterations of the remote before it gave any meaningful information (there's always some kind of weird button or indicator that's supposed to make the remote do something.)   In all, it's a terrible device:
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have the Panasonic TC-P90 that came with my Panasonic HD-P15.   It was very bright and the light was pretty good.  I used it a few times to adjust my color profile.  My other concern was that the cable was a little short, which made it difficult to connect.  There were no problems with the picture and I have found that most Panasonic cameras are very good.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Bill in Wisconsin from A BOLT in the Road I had the P90 for over two years but it started to die last October. I checked the batteries and the only battery was dead. I called Panasonic customer service and I had to speak with someone in the office to get my replacement battery. They told me I could bring the old one back in the same package. When I brought the old battery back in I discovered the battery had exploded. The wires came apart on all four corners of the unit. I've replaced the unit many times before and have never had anything like this happen. I will not be buying a Panasonic product again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this a few days ago for my home office. I purchased the item from Amazon, as I was unable to find it at my local electronics store. When it arrived, it was the size of a bookcase. The package had all the necessary instructions, but the device was only connected by the 3 wires. I'm not sure why they didn't include a power cord. The device works well, but I'd much rather have had a plug in my home. I did find a plug on the bottom of the case to connect it to a wall outlet. It's just too bad that this product is of poor quality, and does not work well.    Review of DJ-Cadence C5S+ $80.00 - 8/12/2016 by Anonymous - I've been using DJ-1 for quite a while now. I love the design and feel, but it tends to run hot and is too heavy for my office. This is much more compact, less heavy, and much easier to move around. The software is very intuitive, with a lot of options and features to choose from. I am really looking forward to seeing how well it performs in the heat. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to listen to my music but I have to say I had to stop using this. The sound quality is great but the volume control is really slow and the headphones have a really big sound which is really bad when it comes to the music. I love my headphones but this is a big flaw and I hope Samsung is working on it. I will return it for a different brand  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from A poor speaker system I bought the Bose QC 30 to replace my Bose earphones. This unit is excellent, but the QC 30 lacks bass and overall the sound quality seems poor. The QC 30 does not have the bass extension that I would like in headphones like this. There is plenty of treble that I prefer, but overall the bass does not add to the listening experience. The unit also has a little too much volume, I get a little buzzy/noisy sound with music.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this camera to add to a backup rig but I have not used it yet. It seems very flimsy and not very sharp, a little fiddly to use and it only comes with an ND filter and no ND filters are included with the camera. It takes a while to get the shutter to work if you set it for a long exposure and that can be annoying if you're trying to make a landscape photo with the ambient light on. You can also only use this for manual shooting which is a shame. The photos that come out of this camera are good for the price. The only reason I gave this a 3 is because the kit is not as good as the kit from some other camera stores.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I don't have the best track record with gadgets, but I've really been enjoying the Echo Show. The Echo Show, in comparison to my Echo, has more features, more speed, and more power, and I love that. The display is easy to see, the sound quality is pretty good, and the battery is large enough to last for a day, if I'm on the road for a couple of hours at a time. So far I'm pleased with the device, although it hasn't been used very much, and my Echo has a better screen. Also, the microphone on the Echo has really made an impression on me, which is why I've bought two:  The only con I have with this is that the sound is really tinny and a little too far away from you, but that can be solved by turning down the volume or changing the app.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this computer from Best Buy in October of 2013 and was very excited to get it. Well, after several months of using it I realized that it was not nearly as powerful or fast as my Dell or any of the computer I own. Also, I had a hardware and software support issue that was only resolved through a tech support call in to the store on the same day as my purchase. The computer eventually died with a black screen on September 10, 2013. This resulted in a credit of about $300 (which I'm very happy about) and a return on a used model. The Best Buy representative that I talked to also advised that this was not a warranty issue and that I should check to see if this model is available on other sites, including eBay. I was hesitant about this because I had no interest in buying the new Dell or even the new Mac that I have on order from BestBuy, so I looked at eBay for the model and then ordered the refurbished model.   When I got it I couldn't get the computer to boot up. After many failed attempts, the computer finally started. However, it just wouldn't work properly. I tried many times to boot to the Mac (not possible), tried rebooting it and rebooting the computer, but no matter what I did there was no booting to the Apple logo or to any OS other than the Apple OneTime application.  After about 15 hours I had to send it back to Best Buy with no refund and a small warranty credit. Not impressed at all.  My only hope is that this can be fixed. I will definitely not buy any Apple products again and will not be recommending this model to anyone else.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

In a word, the Noknook Color is a nice, sturdy product that is perfect for my needs.  I was excited to use my first Nook as soon as I picked it up.  When I finally tried the device, I couldn't believe my eyes.  The color, screen, screen protector, power supply...everything was in excellent condition.  This is the exact product I was hoping for and was not disappointed.  To sum up, I am very happy with my purchase, and I highly recommend this Nook to others.   4 out of 5 Excellent product I have been using my Nook color for over a month. The device has held up very well, and the color is vibrant and crisp.  5 out of 6 stars Best!  I have only been using the NOOK color for about a month now but I have already recommended it to everyone I know.  As for the color and color quality, these are probably my favorite phones in the last 8 years  They are the best colors, the pictures come out perfectly and the pictures look great on the screen.  If you want to have fun with your phone, this is the device for you  The only downside is that the buttons are quite hard to press, but other than that it's great  You don't even have to think about it to just look at a phone and enjoy it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Not really a con but not a great deal either.   I bought the 3 year warranty on the   3D printer. I wanted to print a metal prop from the latest Transformers movie that I had a 3D scan of and printed it out from the 3D scanner but I couldn't get a reliable result. After some research online I found a company called Shapeways that has been around for years and has good quality control. The prints were much better than the 3d scan. It took me about a week to print the prop.  Now, there was a little problem, you had to wait until it was hot to start the prints. That is not a problem for me as I love hot printed metal and will print anything that will fit my printer, but a few of the prints (I think the 3rd one) were over a week in the heat cycle so I gave up and bought a few others.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been looking for a good digital music player for years now and this is what I have.   The only thing that would have made it better is if there was a button to change the volume up or down.  The buttons on it don't do much and sometimes it goes to maximum and sometimes to minimum.  It doesn't seem to support bluetooth either.  There are other issues too.  If I want to listen to some music on my cell phone it's just too hard to get the volume all the way up.  Also, it's not good if you have a lot of mp3 files.  You will get a bunch of errors on some files because there isn't any space to store them.  After that, it just crashes.  This player is okay.  I just wish there were more features.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "I tried the TRS-80 for the first time a few years ago and hated it. I was really looking forward to the TTRs though, so I purchased a TTR and tried it out for about a month, and was glad to find out that it worked. But after one month, the TTTs broke! So I started looking for a replacement. I searched a bit, but was unable to find a TTT to match my need, so eventually I gave up on them, and used an 80-key Model M. It worked fine, but now I can't find a keyboard for my Model M anymore."   " I've been searching for a good mechanical keyboard and finally found this one. The fact that this is also a true typewriter keyboard, without the fancy keys, makes it a much better experience. The keys are nicely spaced, and the size and layout works perfectly. It's very tactile and not overly loud and annoying, which I found to be the case with other keyboards that I've tried."

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device itself is bad. The buttons are too small for the size of the buttons. If I had known this was coming out when I bought it I would have gotten the "pro" version instead. I have to use it with a dongle, which is not great but it still works (I did replace the dongles but I'm not sure they are worth the cost). The buttons have small nails on them. I tried to use an old screw driver to poke a hole in one but it wouldn't go through the plastic on the device (I guess the device is made of plastic and it just won't go in). The USB ports on the unit are terrible. The cable is too small to carry a big mouse so I have 2 mouse mice at my desk and one of them is a mouse but it's not very big. It's very small and it's hard to use because the small buttons on the sides of the computer make it hard to click to change the cursor or to put it in the correct place. I think the cable and porting is a bad idea and the price is bad because it's about the price of a 1.5th mouse so it's kind of a rip off. The only thing that I would call "good" about the device, is that it does have a monitor port so I could use it as a laptop (I don't like my current laptop because it has too many buttons on it so I had to put a "home" button to go back to desktop and there's only 1 mouse button so it gets to be too much and you have to remember which mouse button to press).  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this and a cheap computer monitor. The first time I plugged the USB cord into the computer monitor, it didn't work. When I plugged it into the USB port on the back of the headset, it worked! It was just too bad the USB device isn't USB 1.1 compliant! It's not that easy to use the USB cable with an older USB 1 device like a keyboard or mouse, it's the same as plugging in the phone cord instead of the computer cord.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The main selling point of the phone was the good design. The size was a great fit for my hand, the keyboard was responsive and responsive to my input, and the screen resolution was excellent. As mentioned, the phone has some significant flaws in usability, which include:  The fingerprint reader is too sensitive   It's possible to write something on the screen when the screen is unlocked, causing the screen to blank out.   A small screen size means a smaller keyboard   There's no way to adjust the backlight settings without pressing a button on the bottom   Although the phone features wireless charging, I found it to be very slow:  I had to use the charging cradle attached to the phone to get enough juice out.    Battery life was a bit short.  The phone lasted only 2 hours and 45 minutes (or about 2 hours less than the LG G3) when my usage was light, and about 3 hours and 35 minutes (about 3 hours less that the Samsung Galaxy Note 5) when it's use heavy.  Note:  This review is from a third-party store, so I'm unable to link to any reviews of the device here.

The product I bought:  There was not a single thing wrong with the product. I got it yesterday (in the mail) and was excited to start using it, especially after hearing about the "Worth the Wait" offer from the website. I started with the small amp and it's perfect for a home studio. There is very little in the way of "harsh" noise. It really does everything it's supposed to.  I will be replacing my Yamaha RB120 with this after I finish my studio. The Product I Received: 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the one that I would have to agree with, it just sucks I've been using this thing for about three months now and the battery doesn't last long. It has to be charged every week or so and the charger is a flimsy little plastic piece with no charging port. The noise of the radio is constant and if I don't have something to play music through it is annoying. The only thing I love about this thing is the battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really wanted to like the G4. It looks a lot like a Samsung phone. It has a metal frame and has a small camera on the back. The front is a huge plastic piece, that has a "Slimbook" logo printed on it. The screen is very small but it doesn't matter because the screen is the big point. It does have a camera that can take good pictures but it is not a "best" camera in the world. The camera's size and shape is similar to the Samsung Galaxy S4. The back of the phone is flat with "slimbook logo" on it, and it has an opening for a memory card. The SIM and microSD cards slot into a little hole in the back and slide in. The battery is a large piece of plastic that takes up the entire top of the smartphone. The rear is rounded like a rectangle. The display is great. I would say it's the best LCD screen I've ever seen on a smartphone. I also found that the touch sensitive area around the screen was a little tricky at times, but it gets better. The size and thickness of the device are perfect. The design isn't bad, but I have yet to come across a phone that has the same amount of space between the screen and the front of the user's hand.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The i7 920M is the best gaming laptop in the market for the money!   i5 750M is really good as well. The only problem with the tablet is the graphics, but it does work with my Windows 10 laptop. If you need the performance, get it, otherwise you will have a really good laptop for $250.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Steve from Worth the money. This thing is awesome! It does everything I need a gaming laptop for. For now I will have it with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti. I hope it is compatible with future updates. It's awesome for streaming games to my TV or watching TV shows in HD. The battery life is amazing, I'm playing on it for about 4 hours and I have it plugged into a wall socket and its good to go for two days with the AC on. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace my 3 year old computer because my old computer was having trouble running games. I wanted a gaming computer that was simple to use, and the only problem I had was that the graphics weren't up to the task of running my games. This computer works perfectly, but the graphics are so bad that I'm not playing much of anything right now. The price is decent, but I'm still waiting for my graphics to be improved.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These speakers have the same problem as the last ones, the volume is too high (not surprising considering they are about the size of a car bumper), but the sound quality is fine. I have the HD 740i, and the volume on that speaker is too loud, so I got the HD 840. So if you listen to music and have this speaker, you will be fine. But if you are on a car trip or on a boat and this is the only source, then you should get something else.  Rated 1 out of 5 by James R. from Disappointed In Loudspeaker This is a very poor product. Loudspeakers are supposed to make music louder. Not make it sound worse than it is. My HD 710i has a decent sound, but the HD840s are horrible. For a couple bucks, get something better.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only reason to buy this is to play the CD's in the car while your driving. For $150 dollars, you are getting a crap CD player with an expensive computer that can't keep up. It's useless. If I had to spend $200, I'd probably buy the $130 iPod.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a poor product. The micro USB plug is weak and fails frequently.   A good micro USB cable should make plugging in a little easier. The earphone cord gets loose very easily, and the earphone itself is small and does not hold a lot of sound.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from The best wireless headphone This is my second MDR-XB700. The first one was great, but had to buy the MDR2 to make it work with my old iPad. This one is great. It's very comfortable and I love the fact that it is wireless. The MDRXB 700 has the best sound out of any wireless headphone I have used, including the Bose and AKG wireless. It is also very portable, which is a plus for traveling. The battery life is very good. I find myself plugging the battery into my phone or tablet during the day just to keep my battery topped up. I'm very happy with this wireless product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My first computer was a PC and my first computer peripherals were a floppy drive, keyboard, mouse and hard disk. I was so excited when I got my HP computer. I had never seen one before. I got so excited I could barely stand to look at it. The first thing I did was turn the computer on. I noticed the first thing it was doing was making a big, long, deep "p" sound. I started to get annoyed. I realized that the HP computer had a bad sound chip, so I told it to make a louder, "p, p, p" sound, I got annoyed. So I had my friend open up the computer case and get me a new one. I could not believe what I saw. It turned out my HP was an 8087, and my friend's computer had an 8086. The thing just made a "p p p" noise. I did not want to spend hundreds of dollars to get another machine because the HP could not make a sound any more. After that I just stayed away from HP computers.   Posted by Anonymous at 10:34 AM
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought an Apple iPhone 6S. I love to travel and I've been searching for an all-in-one device for a long time. I've gone through some devices, including the Moto G and the Nexus 5. I bought this one because it has a waterproof case and it is not much smaller than the Moto phones. It's too bad that I am not able to connect my iPhone to this one due to the water resistance, but if I was able to use the other phones, I would buy the larger one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     I have owned the iPod touch   (4th gen)   since December 2010,   when the model was first released,  when it was the most advanced   MP3 player in the Apple lineup.   I  did upgrade to   last year,  but   after the   initial upgrade   and the   introduction of   the  iTunes music store   which allows   free   unlimited   digital music,  I decided to get   a  new   i   iPod touch  i.  At   first   it was great,  then   iTunes finally got around to supporting   streaming,  and   now   they offer   only   Apple   music   for   $10/month, .   Now   my   iPod touch is   basically   dead,  and if   you   want   to listen to iTunes music on your   computer   - you    need to    buy   an  iPod     at   double   price  ....

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my first Samsung. I have a couple other brand, but they are sooo expensive that the quality is not really as good.   I think the display quality is OK. The buttons are very tiny.  The sound quality is very, very bad. I heard some popping sounds while typing, and the phone seems to have some problem with the battery. I do not have any problems with the other features of the phone.  I love the fact that this is a Korean device but they should have at least given me a chance to check out the other phone.  No longer being sold in Europe   Samsung is discontinuing their line of Galaxy Tab.  After receiving no response from Google or Samsung to my requests to review the device, I had to purchase another and have returned it. I am not sure if this means that they will discontinue the product in Europe, but in the meantime, I would recommend that you look for a replacement at this point. A better alternative   The Samsung Galaxy Tab is a device that has a nice size and nice screen and has quite good battery life, even though its battery is not removable, which is not too surprising considering the large screen and large battery.   More than a basic tablet   For the price, Samsung has done a good job, but it still has some serious issues.  While it has a good battery, the screen and build quality is much worse.  For example, the bottom half of the screen has no support, which can be annoying. I would advise against this tablet if you have a small desk or the battery life is not important. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was really excited about the device but the battery life was terrible. The only reason i bought it was because i got a free one in my phone which was really cheap but i wish it wasnt so bad. Also i had to buy the charger becaue i couldn't find one in store. I'm just glad I found this site.  Didn't work on the first try! (2018-07-27) I bought this charger, but to my surprise, the charger did not work on my iPad. I got the wrong charger in the first place! I guess that's a good thing, because I still don't know if this is a scam or not. It was great that I ordered it online, but maybe not worth the price for the trouble. ,  It works, but... (2018) I ordered this charger through Best Buy. Upon arriving at Best Buy, it was just returned to me. The product was great. I just ordered another one. Now, the product is not working. My iPad isn't charging. Not my fault though, the Apple Store returns items to their stores after they've been used in the store. What I don't understand is the warranty that they sent out. According to this, it's okay to return the charger, right?  This product doesn't work at all. (2018 to 2018-07) The unit is not listed in Best Buy online inventory. When I called to place the order, the customer service rep at BestBuy said that the item was not listed on the website, but a similar item. The unit I ordered is listed in the inventory online, so I am getting the same thing I got from Best Buy with a different packaging. I had to return it for a new one from a different website that lists the item as listed on their website. The warranty claims to apply only to the original purchaser.  and  Bad experience (2018), I would buy elsewhere again (2018, 2018) I got a defective product, but I have ordered many things from BestBuy before, so i don't feel the need to say the product that I bought was bad. However, there was a few things that bothered me about this device, and I'd like to warn everyone about them: 1) I'm getting a new battery and charger to replace my original battery that broke about 2 years ago and this time it was very hard to get a hold of this new one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a really bad product. It is hard to install and after two days of playing it is still a clunky device. It doesn't play anything from a CD. It also uses a standard USB cable instead of a special cable that would cost the same as this unit. I can't say it's the worst I've ever used but it's pretty bad.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is amazing. This thing makes a HUGE difference when it comes to getting great sound from my Sony PX-10. The build quality is great. It has a decent battery life and is reasonably lightweight. If the build quality were more like that of other portable portable amps, I would be more satisfied. The problem is that this thing is not at all portable. I can hardly carry it in my pocket without getting it tangled in the cord or on my back (it also weighs so much).

I used to carry a Nikon for similar reasons, but recently I've switched over to a Canon body.

It doesn't do the most basic features (play/pause/stop etc) but it will get the job done. Plus, it's got a built-in battery so you won't be wasting any money on recharging!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The most annoying thing about this product is that it is very small and can be easily lost with the micro usb cable.   It takes a couple of seconds to charge if you don't have a good micro usb charger.  It would be nice if there was an option for an external battery charger if you have a USB charger already, but you can't have everything.   It's ok:  This is a very small portable charger for your ipad.  The only drawback is the micro USB cable is very short.  If you can find a longer cable make sure to connect it to the charger as well.  You can use the usb cable to charge your ipod as well as a usb wall charger.  Good:  It's a good size. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Samsung Galaxy S4 a few weeks ago for my girlfriend. I'm quite pleased with it except for the fact that I find that the battery drains way faster than my Sony Xperia Z, which is also a very good phone. I use the S4 for my work and for my personal use. I've used it several hours a day on multiple devices for 2 weeks straight and I have not been able to get it to last more than 6-7 hours without recharging. I do have a Sony Xperia, but I prefer the S3's durability. I am disappointed with this phone, not only because of the battery life, but because of this very strange behavior: the screen is black, then turns back on and it seems to be fully lit. My other phones just turn on completely dark when they need a charge. The only solution is to keep the phone plugged in until the battery gets low enough, but it never comes back. The screen is very bright. I think it's a bit annoying to have a black screen for a few seconds. I also found the camera's screen unusable because it blinks so fast in the middle of a photo.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After I bought my first iMac, a few months later i noticed that a few parts are "missing" and the battery is not rechargeable (but they have a spare iMac in the store). I asked for a refund for the defective part. They said I could either return the item, or I could contact Apple Care, and give them my email address and then they would try to figure it out. I didn't want to give that information to Apple Care. They told me they would call me. I told them I don't want a credit for the part (as I have not used the computer for at least 4 months), and that i wanted a refund. They say, "You can't give us a credit on a purchase that's been returned, it's not legal for us to do that, therefore we have to give you a refund on your purchase." i am totally confused by this and would never buy a computer from any company again.  This is a review for a brand-new, unused (with the original packaging intact) Apple iMac G5 1.83GHz/ 1.8Ghz with 256MB of RAM and a 160GB Serial ATA hard drive.   When I bought this iMac from a local Apple Store (which is the only place I've ever seen Apple Store employees walk around with this model), I got what I expected. There was no box in the box. There were no accessories. The only thing that came with the computer was a power cord and the hard drive (which I was going to upgrade anyways). After opening the box, it was obvious the item was sold without being in a box, since there was a ton of stuff in the shipping container.   and the warranty? They were going to repair my computer or replace the hard disk, no options.   be forewarned that all of the accessories you get are NOT included!

It didn't work for me at all. I tried to turn it on but it wouldn't turn. I thought that might have been my problem and didn't bother returning it but it's very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device two months ago and it seems to work fine. The problem is that if I do not connect it to a power source within 10 seconds it disconnects from the cable and disconnects itself. The device would not restart even though the charger would charge it. The user manuals do not seem to be available.   A bad review about an excellent electronic device (the battery has been on standby for 3 years and the unit works well):  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device is really expensive but has a bad battery that is hard to remove. Also, the battery is not rechargeable and the charger needs to be recharged often. The device has a hard time charging, so if you want to keep it, keep the battery in. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am a fan of the Z-Wave network and have recently purchased several of these to use with my   Z-wave controller. However, my first one started to emit weak electromagnetic interference at the end of a long cord from the wall outlet. I also noticed that the ZWave buttons could be difficult to get to (especially the Power button) when they were not in a specific position.   After spending $10-20 more on a new one, I received a refund as soon as I received the defective one, but still think they are expensive for what they offer.   Rated 3 out of 5 by JK from It works I'm using this with a Netatmo Smart Hub that I have purchased off the internet, and it works perfectly. It also works fine with a NETATMOO smart hub. You'll also need to download the NETATMAO app from the app store. The instructions are pretty clear, but they're a little vague on how you'll need the App to get started with it. It's not hard to figure out the basic concepts, but it does take a little while. If I wasn't already familiar with using the NETMATOM Smart Hub, I would say it's worth the few bucks.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought an Apple Watch and a Samsung Gear S2 with a month of warning, and I didn't enjoy the watch at all.   It started out fine, but it became incredibly annoying to go to my gym. I had to pull out my phone to text the treadmill.  That said, if I had known it was coming, I wouldn't have bought it.   Review of DJ0268-02 Submitted By: Anonymous - Verified Buyer This was a great deal to save money on a watch. I bought this watch on sale because I was trying to get to the gym more often and the Apple Watch would be a great way to do that. It has all the functions I'd need (heart rate monitor, calorie counter, step counter, and step by step recording), but I do have to be near my phone for it to sync with my phone and work with my fitness app. I wish there was a more convenient way to connect to a phone so I can sync to my watch and not have to go back to the computer to transfer things from the phone. I'm hoping Apple improves their app for it so I don't have to have a bluetooth connection to my phone when I'm near my computer. I also wish they'd make a more fashionable way to wear it on your wrist. As it is now, you can see it on the wrong side when it's on the right. I don´t use it at the gym, but I think I'll get a lot of use out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The phone had a screen crack that caused the screen to fall off during a call.   This is not acceptable! I tried calling the Verizon customer support number, but they hung up the moment I said "This device is useless." They sent a replacement, but it doesn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I think this is a very good computer. It is very convenient to use. But it is difficult to work on. The case has no back panel and a lot of dust gets inside. It takes some pressure to open the case. I would recommend this to a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I recently purchased a wireless mouse and this mouse is not what I was looking for. The mouse does not turn when you move your fingers. If you move it slowly, you do not know where your mouse is. The buttons are also difficult to activate because there is no tactile feedback. There are more issues than this, but they are not great.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound and the image quality of this little device is poor. You can hear the other unit on the same room, but you can not hear the TV at all. There is no sound on the TV when you turn it off. If you are using this in a dark room and don't need a sound, it is just as good as any other TV, so the price is right. You have to watch out though, as it will not stand up to your wall in my opinion.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this unit for my 2 year old son. The buttons are difficult to operate. The unit also has issues with the auto power off feature. It keeps turning off and the button for it keeps flashing (you have to press the power button twice to turn off the unit). The only thing that works right is the remote control. It is very accurate. It allows you to change channels. The only problem I have with this is that there is no storage compartment. I have to carry a case with me. I guess the batteries are the key factor there. I think if the batteries would last longer they would be fine.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a cheapo laptop that can only run games on it. This unit does NOT have any games. The only thing that it has that works is the power adapter and I have to get the cheapie adapter back to use this. The cheapie can be found at most computer stores.    I bought this device and i'm glad i did. i was able to play my 2nd game on my ipad but i'll be playing on my xbox 360 soon. It's good to know you can run any xbox game if you don't own a gamepad. I do recommend this as the only portable Xbox gamepad on the market for the price 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really dislike the sound of my headphones!  I think my headphones are loud but are not the same quality as other high end headphones I've heard.   The ear pads are not that great either.  The sound is so loud on these that I get dizzy just hearing them and having a conversation.  I do have a pair of very good earphones but if you are a fan of sound quality I would not recommend these.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, and the battery is a joke. I use the phone mostly to surf the web, and then take a shower and a bath. The phone won't hold a charge if left unattended for more than a few hours. This is not a small thing. If Samsung wants their tablets to be "portable" then they need to do a better job of it. Also, the display is too small for the 7 inch display. I'd love to be able to play games on it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I got this phone in the mail. It is a nice looking device. I was very pleased with the phone until I realized the fact that my old phone did not have the same speaker. So I put the phone in my old phones case and had the same thing happen again. Not happy at all. The only good thing about the phone is that it does support Bluetooth headphones. That's all I really use it for. I can't really tell you how good the speaker is without seeing it with my old old phone because I'm used to using the sound on my old one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my older phone (iPhone 4) to use as my personal phone. The phone works well, but it is a bit awkward to use. It does not take a lot of pressure on the buttons and does not work well with gloves. Also, the phone does not turn on automatically when it detects my hand on the touch pad or when I do push the power button (I use my thumb). I don't really use the camera (I like the phone). I think it is too expensive for what it gives. Overall, not a bad product but I wouldn't consider purchasing it as a daily driver.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this to use with a Samsung phone (but I just used it with a Sony Ericsson phone, and it works fine on both). I did not really care for the sound on the Sony Ericckenner. I was looking forward to the Sony being in my pocket, and this made me nervous. But it worked fine on the Samsung, and worked well with this unit.   My only complaint is that it had some noise on the iPhone. I can't say that it is annoying, but it was annoying to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The item came just fine, but the cable that came with it broke. I bought this cable from another online retailer who also gave me a different cord. The cord I got is different. I've seen some people complain about the quality of the cables they get from Sony. I think it's because of the way Sony manufactures them.  I don't know if this review is a problem of mine or if there are others, but I was having trouble with the TV and the game controller on my S7. The problem started off as a short on the TV. When I turned on the S7, it appeared to be on, but it could not access the game port. When it turned off, the TV would continue to go off and on, and sometimes when I turned it off and back on, it would start up. I did not want to give up on the console just yet, so I removed it from the S6 and used it for about a half hour. I powered the console off again, and when I powered it on, the game did appear to play, but there was no audio from the TV whatsoever. I switched over to my Xbox One and tried the same thing and was able to make a video. I then ran out and got a second S7 because I had just purchased the S5 and was waiting to replace the S4.   I bought these for the same reason I bought the S2, to replace my S3 and S4 controllers. The cables seem well made and do what they're supposed to, but just didn't work properly for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    (3.5 stars) This unit is useless for anything but making an inaudible noise at a distance of 40 feet. I bought this for use as a phone speaker. The unit is ok to use at a low volume. I would be very interested in an aftermarket replacement.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was a horrible idea. I have several digital watches I have owned in the past. They have all been great.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     " I received my Samsung tablet and was not impressed.   I thought that it looked cool and I didn't want to mess around with it.  I tried to use it with one hand and that didn't work.  After 2 weeks I realized that I was only going to use my tablet with the phone as a second monitor.  The screen on the tablet is great, but the fact that it is so big and heavy makes it difficult to use with one handed.  This doesn't bother me too much as I'm sure that my wife would also like it as a tablet but the weight and size are just too much.  If I could change something about it, I would have liked to see the tablet come in more colors.  For the price, this thing is a total ripoff.  When I first purchased the tablet, I didn t have any problems with it other than that it was too big and made my fingers sore.  But when I finally realized that this thing was just too big, and too heavy for my wife to use, I returned it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this device for 4 years now. It is just a piece of junk with no utility at all. I used to have a   Pioneer       iFi before I got this one. The   price has been going up, the   performance is no better. It seems like Pioneer was trying to make a quick buck and forgot to have the best in design. I am on my third   as I read reviews. I will probably not purchase again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product seems to be of good quality. However the "dongle" that is supplied is not a mini-dong. It is actually a full sized dongle and is about 5 inches in length. It has to be removed from the box to attach the device which takes some time. The product does not seem to be very popular with users. It would be better if the dongles were the same length as the devices that come with the unit and less than the length of the dongs that come in the box.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a terrible piece of junk. It has two USB slots, but the one on the bottom is too big and has a "slide" that allows no more than 2 cables. I used my phone charger a lot, and every time it plugged in, I'd have to use the other, useless USB port to charge my phone. I'd only use my laptop charger at night, or after a long day at work. This also means I can only connect my phone or tablet to the device once and use that to charge it.   Also, the cable can't be plugged in from the bottom, so you have to disconnect the USB before you plug in a cable. I've lost count of how many times I've plugged in my phone into the device and then disconnected it and plugged it into the PC to charge. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have an old Apple computer which has been in use for 5 years. It has no fan for the AC, so it is warm to the touch. It is so old it has no power cord and the AC plug is so big the AC cord has to be held to the case and the whole thing is so heavy it takes a hammer and screw driver to turn the AC on and off. It's a mess, there is no light at all on the front of the case, there are no cables going to it or from it. It needs to go! If you want a very good computer that has a fan for AC, you must buy an Apple computer, not a Windows computer.   -B - July 30, 2008LOST THE POWER

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    - A really nice idea in concept.   But the execution is awful.  Very high price, but a very poor build quality.  A poor screen protector with only 1/4" holes (to go through the screen) that I got damaged very quickly.  The case is really flimsy, which made the screen protector useless when the case fell off.  I'm not happy at all with the entire product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this as a backup to a hard drive but it does not work as an OS drive. It is a good backup for a backup drive but not a useful OS drive for most people. You will not be able to install many OSes such as Mac OSX on it. The power switch is a bit confusing, you have to hold the switch down for a second then it lights up and when you release it it turns off. If you're not going to use it much then it is not too much of a problem but for me it's a pain to have to go through that process. The USB cable is very cheap.

It is quite easy to program with a micro SD card, though I would have preferred a larger SD card to be used. Also, a good power button for on-board batteries.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device is just so poor and so annoying that I could never use it. It will constantly reset itself and turn off when it can't find the batteries. I bought it thinking that I'd use it to play a small game with my son, but instead it got me hooked on another game called "Zombies Run." It's even worse than the original version in that you can't play with the two players that way. It's a shame that it's so horrible that it needs to be fixed by a third party like ZXing. This should have been fixed by them already, but they chose to hold back the new version.    Rated 5 out of 5 by mjc from A Good Game for a Good Price A couple of years ago, I was reading a review on B&H's website for the Game Genie. I looked at the price of the product (the CD), and it looked very good. But when I decided to buy it, it was $20 for the one game. So I decided it would be a good deal to buy the Game Boy Advance version instead, at $8. I took a chance on the game and it was good fun to play. It did have a few small problems though. First, the game can crash if you play too quickly. Second, I didn't like that it doesn't save your scores or scores in progress. Lastly, it does not allow you to save your own personal information. But it is a good little game and worth a try.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:      If your are planning to use a Bluetooth keyboard, I highly recommend you pick one of the keyboard models in this series instead of the regular mechanical keyboard. The difference between the mechanical and the keyboard in this keyboard series is huge. I've used the mechanical keyboard and it's just way too clunky. This one is much more comfortable and easier to use. I'd also recommend that if you choose this keyboard to get one of these. The extra keys and layout make this a much better keyboard to type on than the regular one (although you might need a mouse on it).
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device has very low battery life.   This was not a huge issue for me as I'm on the move, but for other people who travel or are in remote areas that may not always be the case, I could have done without having to purchase more than one charger for multiple devices (I have 3 laptops with USB-C and 4 phones/tablets with USB).   Also, the USB charging is really slow, I'm not sure if I would buy it again.  by Robert on June 29, 2017  Product: Chameleon Keyboard - White  Pros: It's a simple keyboard. It works. It's light. I liked the small size. The light is nice for when I need to read. . The keys are pretty nice, even if they don't have a very "clicky" feel (in the same way that some keyboards are too mechanical for my taste). The keys aren't very large, but I can't complain, the size is still comfortable. It was a little hard to get used to the LED backlight on the back, but it's actually quite nice in the dark (and on a small laptop, like a 7" one). Overall, I like the keyboard. I'm planning on buying another one of these (probably a different color), and I'm definitely going to have the white one for the time being. The only thing I think Chameleons should take away from this keyboard is that the layout is very similar to the Cherry MX. Other than that, I think this is a good keyboard.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product and i can honestly say that it is the worst piece of crap i've ever owned in my life. the plastic casing around the battery door has warped to almost be in the shape of a door. there are no screw locks to keep the battery locked on. and it has a spring mechanism that the battery will pop out of the battery compartment when it is too hot. not for the person that needs this kind of power, but it's perfect for a kid.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had the original Samsung Galaxy S 3 and the only good thing is that it does not have the bug which is that the screen is always black. But the bad thing is the screen goes black when a call comes in or when you press a button and the phone go black and then it is not even the screen, but the back of the phone. I've replaced all the other S's with this model and nothing happened. And it has happened three times now. I would like to be able to use this device in bright sunlight, even in the shade because the phone is so bright. If you have any other issues with this phone, you should contact Samsung and complain.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's hard to describe exactly how you feel after a battery fails.   The last time it failed, I spent 20 minutes trying to get a power brick.  For some reason, all I could think about was how useless it was.  After about 3 hours, I gave up and charged the battery.  I haven't had this problem since.  It makes me happy to find that there is a place where people are happy to give a positive review about electronic devices.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been looking for a good quality keyboard for about a year. I decided on this because it was what I wanted but also because of what people said about it on other websites. I thought I'd be disappointed but my friend and I used it for about 2 weeks now. The only problem is the number row is kind of small and awkward to use. If your looking for great quality and good keys, look elsewhere. I also tried using an extra key to delete letters when I get to that part of the keyboard but it didn't work so that was a plus. If you need a solid keyboard that isn't overpriced, don't get this one. It just doesn't compare with the other keyboards in this category.Read full review

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had my Gee Whiz for 3 years and it's finally broken. I love the concept of the product but the Gee whiz was just a waste of money. It's hard to get a good seal when you put your phone in the bag, and the battery is just too low. I was very pleased to see that Samsung replaced this one with a much better one. I hope that one lasts too.  Style/Comfort/Function:   This phone fits well in my hand. I really like the look and feel of the screen. The buttons feel very durable and well-designed. It has a good weight to it and it fits comfortably in my front pocket. The plastic on this phone has a very satisfying feel to it. However, the size of the phone doesn't allow for a comfortable typing experience. The keyboard does have a good amount of travel, but it's still not as spacious as I like to use. This phone does run Android 4.1.2 which is a great update, but I am unsure if this is what I'm actually getting or a different model. Also, the phone will not automatically power down after you've used it for a while, you have to hit the power button. I have read reviews about other phones that are more robust and the G-Wiz is definitely more robust but I'm still waiting to hear from Samsung about the actual durability of this phone and if the screen is good enough. Also the screen doesn't come with the charging cable, which means you have the option of using a separate case, which I think would have made it so much better.  a few words about the G Phone: If you like the way Samsung makes their phones, then this is a no brainer. I like the touch-screen interface and the screen has great color representation. The only thing that I think the G is missing is a front-facing camera. I know there are other Android phones that include one, but for me personally, I don't like using the camera so that's a big bummer for me. However I do like the battery life and the way that it runs. I also appreciate the screen quality of the G series phone. The Samsung Galaxy S4 has the best screen in the business for the money and the other Samsung phones are about $50 cheaper. I recommend this phone to anyone who wants a great phone at a great price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     1 of 4 found this helpful:  This is a very cool and great gadget. A great game changer that would make the majority of the game fun. You get the game but there's a ton of cool extras. This could become one of the new "must have" gadgets in my mind if I can ever get my hands on it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After spending many hours researching, testing, reassembling, and rebuilding a broken, new, and high quality Apple TV, I found the first Apple TV to have issues. I used the TV to watch cable TV and, like others, found the video quality to be poor. The picture looked muddy and jagged (like a film scan). The remote control worked, but was a cheap plastic case that had been bent, causing it to drop. I contacted Apple about this issue. A couple weeks later, I received a new remote control, and a replacement for the old one. This is the most disappointing return I have ever had with Apple.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I just bought the WL3 wireless headset for the Xbox 360 and I couldn't find the exact model I wanted online.   This was a very fun experience and I really like that I can do the voice chat from my computer or other phone.  This does not let you chat from Xbox 360 to PC   The mic sounds good and there is a little background noise and some background noise when talking to someone that is close by, it's ok but I think I'd like a better quality microphone on the Xbox   They say to set the microphone to 'all microphone', and while it did make the Skype calls a little more comfortable, I wish I could do my voice chat via the built in mic on Xbox 360.  The other thing I didn't like about it is that I have to change the wireless device every few days so it could be a little easier to keep it plugged in.  I'm a lot happier with the XBOX 360 microphone   Overall it's a nice accessory if you want to have a phone/computer/game setup with you at the same time, the voice communication is a bit more enjoyable with the Xbox microphone rather than the W3 microphone 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the $150   I bought the   USB   i Phone   and I am   disappointed   the  I like it when I need a simple phone:  A   A phone that   can   be used   for   talking   is   a   necessity   if   one   only   wants   to   get   phone   out   then   this   must   include   all   features   of   it.   The   good   performance   but   design   does   not   measure up   with   my   other   phones  .   You have to make a choice about the price.  :  If   you   want   your   money   back then buy   cheap   android   or   goi   over   Samsung  ,   because   they   have   everything   on   them   more   affordable   than   their   competitor   in   price   which   gives   me   great   value . 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had a few of these since early '90s, all bad.   They only last a few years, and they are easy to break.  I think Apple should bring back the 2 jack version. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "I got this expecting a better device than the SONY SmartWatch 2   I was wrong and I won't buy from here   This is a shame because it has everything I liked about the Sony   Smartwatch   The thing I don't like is the way the watch is attached to the phone:  I could see it falling off with just my finger   (I'm assuming that is a design flaw)   For $200 it's pretty great, but it's just an inferior version of a Sony product   It's a shame since the SmartWatch had a lot to live up to, but Sony has lost their way and this is a very bad thing for them   Overall it's still good, just not great"
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There's no way to remove the battery or remove the USB cable. It just sticks right back in and you have to put the device back in. The USB plug and port are a complete joke and it seems like they were put there for a very small market.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I ordered the G.D.1000 from this web site and when it arrived it had an unusual noise. It was very annoying. When I went to check it out, I found out that the noise was the G-meter and the meter was faulty and the display was blank. I'm going to try to get this repaired at no charge but this is an indication of the quality control the Chinese are not getting. They should not have a device that cannot even function correctly. - April 22, 2017Great Value  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the end, my T-shirt printer is broken and the battery has quit. It will need to be replaced. This is a great idea... I would have never known about this printer.   I purchased my printer through Amazon.com and paid with credit.  It arrived yesterday.  The printer has not been used.  After removing the top of the printer I could see the problem with the cable. It was just too short.  My original printer had a 5 year warranty.  This printer has a 2 year warranty and I will have to buy another printer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:     This is my second and very last Apple product.   I was originally buying the   Retina   iMac Pro.  The  iBook was terrible and the Macbook Pro was ok.  Then i got the  iDevice.  It was terrible.  They should have gotten rid of the  iTRads.  When i received the  iPod  and   a couple weeks later i replaced it with   an  iPod Touch 3rd Generation.  What was the reason for the  iPod  Touch  being $399.00 when they should have got rid of them before shipping them to customers?  The iPod was terrible, the  iPhone   was ok and then the  iPad.  I had it for a year and it finally got junked, i was so sad.  These are the last of the i devices I was wanting.  My iPod and iPhone are still at Apple and i think they are great.  Thanks for all the good work.  I've used my new MacBook for about a month and it is just as bad as my previous one was. I'm a programmer and I have never been happier with my MacBook than I am right now. But it does have its downsides and there are some of them: 1) The trackpad is so terrible I can barely click a button or drag a finger. I could use my old mouse on the new keyboard but there is no way to use my previous mouse with the new trackpad. It is so far away from the touchpad that if I want to use it I have to lift my hand up to the trackpad which takes a lot of muscle memory to get it to register. 2) The new screen is just horrible. I love the new screen and the Retina display but the color accuracy is way off. When you make a selection on the screen you see that selection immediately but on the old display you can see that a selection was made only after a split second. I also think it is way too bright which ruins the white of the screen. 3) The back cover is terrible. I am a programmer so I need to keep the battery in my laptop charged and I don't like my laptop being so dirty or dirty looking. My old laptop had the back cover on the other side and had no problems. If the back was in the same place as the track pad it would be perfect. 4) The touch screen
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a new Xbox360 a few months ago and the unit still needs some work. My wife is a "gamer" but doesn't play many games. I bought her a new Xbone since she was interested in some of the new games. But she still gets upset when she can't play all the games that are available on her Xbox. The Xbox works fine for the most part. However, if she is just watching movies, the game starts up and plays without any problem. But if she starts playing a title, the video starts up but the game doesn't. In the Xbox, you can only play one game at a time. So if I decide to watch a movie, I can't just switch over to the other game to watch. We have tried to contact Microsoft about this issue but never got a response.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are other electronic devices I could have used for my job:  I am a professional videographer for a video production company. One day I needed to record a high-end event on location. I have been using a Zoom H4n for a long time, but it had stopped working the past few weeks. I checked the manufacturer's website and learned that the Zoom H3n has the same kind of problems: low resolution, bad color, no GPS and no flash. Then I realized I have an H2n which is a great device and a better price. I bought the H2 and it worked perfectly. The H2 is very light, very portable and very accurate. I also use a Zoom X2n on the video and a Lumagen H-E1n on audio recording.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the iphone 6/6s on sale after it first came out. I thought it was a good price, but it took months before I could even try using it for anything. At the time, the phone didn't seem to be doing anything for me.   The 6s has a 1GB memory instead of the 2GB. The battery lasts way too long. The 3G connection is very slow and unreliable. And all those little things I thought would be easy to fix are actually impossible.  I gave up on the phone. I have an iphonelike iphones (5/5) and I would recommend this one. But it will take at least a couple months to get your first month's service up. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    One of the worst electronic devices I have ever used. I have bought several from them. It doesn't take much to go off and that includes a power cord that has a tiny little slot for a battery. I bought the cheapest one on the list but that is not enough. Also, this device is too hard to take apart and I am constantly having to clean it.   I bought this because it seemed to come with the best price, but I wish I didn't have to pay $15 for one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The device works well for a while. I have used it to listen to music on the go. But then when I take my iPhone and other audio device to the gym, the bass sounds awful.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In all honesty, my first android device was the Samsung Galaxy s3 with a cracked screen, so it's no surprise that it can't run most games. It's too bad because it's one of the few phones that's actually faster than   iPhones (and I haven't been too concerned about speed with most phones, it's just that it's faster on an   android). I'd like to say that it works great for my gaming needs, but it's simply   expensive for what it is.  More
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The key of these is that it can be charged.  The charging cable has a plug.  It is plugged into my laptop, I can charge it with my laptop.  My laptop has a USB port but doesn't have a charge port.  This isn't a very good product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased a Samsung TV for our TV room and the picture quality was decent. However, the HDMI input was very poorly designed and made the picture too dark and fuzzy. It was like trying to watch a video on a 50-inch TV.   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for a friend's birthday and my son was too excited to use it. I can't imagine using something this big. The speakers are a big let down.   They sounded tinny and distorted.  I could have listened to a few songs with my phone, not that they are expensive or much different from my phone.  Also the phone came with a weird black plastic case that made it look cheap. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this charger to charge my   iPhone 6 Plus at home. It is not strong enough for the iPhone. The charging cable is really good, though I would get a  better cable if I needed to buy another battery.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A little too much, too early.   I purchased this device for my father who is in his 80s. He uses his iPhone 5s daily. So I thought that it would be a good way to communicate with him when he was home. Instead he sent it back. The battery would only last about 8-10 hours so he had to find a different source of power for the iPhone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the "T.H.E.A.T. Kit" with the idea that this would be a simple and easy process for a new customer.  It's only half of the effort.  First, the T.H ast. Kit is a complete waste of $25.  This is a nice set of tools, but a piece of plastic and cardboard (with a big "Made in America" stamp on it) that can't hold a candle to the expensive and well crafted items you will find from the same company.  Second, the instructions are awful.  The instructions include an "e-mail" to the technician, but no other contact information or phone number.  Also, the kit comes with a set of instructions with a blank piece of paper to cut out to the dimensions you need, but then you have to figure it out yourself.  I got a piece that was 1/2" longer than the dimensions I needed.  There are instructions to use an X-Acto knife to cut the plastic piece, but there is no illustration or picture of what the knife is supposed to look like.  In other words, the "e" in T. H.E.A. T. is NOT in the "h" of T.E  I will NEVER recommend this product!   The electronic cigarette was easy to install, but once it got going the unit stopped working. The batteries weren't charging the device. I thought I had a loose battery, so I decided to return it and buy another one. The replacement I received was almost identical. Once the unit got going, it didn't. I don't know what this company is thinking...
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My Samsung phone died during my first month of using it. The screen was not working for days. The replacement unit had the same problem. This is a first time I purchased a cell phone. It will probably not be used much as I use my cell phone for my e-mail and social networking. I will wait to see if I can return it. - KJWG  Read More Reviews
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After receiving my second LG 3D TV (I have the first and it has a bad picture, doesn't support 1080p video, and has the same bad picture quality), I was extremely disappointed. I got a few items from LG: 1. TV + remote. Both have the same problem. It does not show the correct picture after turning the TV on. This is a big problem because it means I have to buy another tv. The remote is also bad. It only has 5 buttons which does not allow the user to get the picture exactly right. I can't be happy with a $400+ tv. 2. The gamepad: the joystick on the bottom does not work at all (it's useless). It also does not have any way to control the video game at all. The controller also looks like junk. 3. LG's "HDR" service: This is so far the only thing to get mad about. It is not enough to get an original TV with the "Hulu" and "Netflix" content in it. It's just the content that has been provided. It still takes the original TV to have access to the content on these other services. 4. The design: the colors are so red, and everything is so flat, I don't know how anyone who has a normal TV can like it. 5. The screen itself: the picture is so much worse on the first one. It looks so flat and black. Overall, a mediocre TV. I'm sorry, but LG should know better.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Best 3D I've owned! This TV is not the best 3D screen, but it is still wonderful, and does a good job of displaying 3D. I get a nice vibrant picture, not as clear as a 4k 4k, but just as good as a 1080p, and it's nice and crisp. The sound is also great. I have it on with Dolby and it really makes the experience. I use a Dolby Atmos sound system and I really love it. I wish the 3D content was better, but again, it's not an expensive TV.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product doesn't work well and it was really hard to fix it because there's no way of seeing the battery level or how many charge cycles are left.   There were two things that would have made the product work better.  First, there's a small screw-like thing that could have been added to the inside of the charging port to make it more secure to the case.  Second, the charging plug is not the same size or shape as the charger itself.  This would have been nice if it were made of a more flexible material.  The best part is that there's nothing I can do about it because the product is no longer available on Amazon.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love the price of the product. My computer has a problem with it not powering on. I thought it was due to the wrong cable but when I plugged it in to my computer all of a sudden my screen went blank. I was so disappointed. I would not buy this device again. I am giving it zero stars because the computer still doesn't work.  Rated 5 out of 5 by tony from This product is good. The only problem i have is that the battery is not long enough to last the whole year.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These are the worst speakers I've had. The sound was terrible for a music player and I'm not sure if I can trust these to play a sound.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So, I have had this product for the past few weeks now, and I have not found any fault or fault with it at all. I used it for my camera that I bought from Amazon for about $200, and the quality of the device has been very nice. The main problem I have been having with it is the sound and video quality. It is not very good, in my opinion. I found myself watching more videos on YouTube while filming, and there was a lot of background noise.   However, if you're looking for a quality camera with good video quality for about 1/3 the price of an equivalent Sony E-mount camera, and you're not too worried about sound quality, this is the one for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's horrible  !   I had the original Motorola phone and when I upgraded to the   iPhone 4  , the  phone just did not work.   The buttons are the wrong color and don't respond as you would expect.  It's horrible!  It doesn't take pictures or videos   You can't even send a photo to your brother's   in Hawaii.  There was no way to even send pictures back because the phone couldn't recognize them.  I would recommend this phone if you are an old, cheap,   fanboy of Apple   like me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    "the battery life sucks, the speaker is loud, the charging is slow, the battery isn't removable, the size of the screen makes it a pain to read."  Reviewer: A.H. (3/11/2015)  This is a good little portable bluetooth speaker. I like the quality of the sound. The only issue I have with the bluetooth connection is that I had to replace the bluewone cable with a separate one that is shorter.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have always enjoyed my iPhone, but the touch screen was really bad. I was getting frustrated so i went online and bought this little guy to try out.   Unfortunately I have found it was not as good as advertised and as a result i have stopped using the iPhone.  If you like to touch screen but have a good phone you might want to consider this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased an iPod nano and I've had problems with it. It just wont turn on or even boot up the first time. My wife hates it too, she doesn't understand why the battery doesn't charge. I tried cleaning the device to get all the dust out but it seems to have little effect. The last time it was fixed the battery wasn't working and had to be replaced. I'm sorry i didn't give it five stars, but I have too many people commenting on it to change it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased these to replace the factory broken iPod mini and it is a very good product.   The buttons work good   and they even make the little screen change colors when I touch it, which is a first for a device of this size  . My only complaint is that the earbud cables are too short  , but they work fine for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a very good product but a few flaws in this product that we will not buy anymore: 1. The battery only lasted one day because it ran out of power too fast and then the battery was useless. It still worked the next day when I used it but still a terrible product. 2. The earphone jack is too hard and it breaks easily. 3. The phone cord which is the cable that connects the phone to the cordless phone is very weak. I have had it longer than a week now and I am sure it will break before then. 4. The charger is not strong enough and the wires don't have enough strength to hold it up. I used the corded phone for many hours while I was on the phone so the charging was very fast but then it would turn off and then stop. 5. The only good part of this purchase is that it will be on the shelves next to the more expensive earphones.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a couple of these a couple years ago as a novelty item to play with, and now use them for a few songs from my music collection. The power supply has a bad input and outputs. When I first received the unit, it was not functioning correctly. When plugged into my music player, the LED on the back of the unit would not light up. So I pulled out the batteries, got the power supply and installed it. Once I got the unit installed, it worked fine. The lights worked right away. Now I have no desire to use the unit. I tried two other cheap units, and neither worked properly.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My son has his Samsung Galaxy S2 in his closet right now. He's been looking at the phone to replace it as it is really old and not working well. When he's not playing on it he's just playing with it. He likes it, but he's tired of the phone. It has about 9 days of life left. I bought the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 in the same size and same model, with a different screen, for about the same price, so why is this S2 so much better? This is like buying a $20 laptop (and paying for the manufacturer) and then having it break down and then spending thousands on a new one.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is a very nice device, but the batteries lasted less than a year.  I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about the unit. It was my first time using one of these, so I didn't know what to expect. It's nice to have a little portable power supply, especially if you are constantly working and not charging in your pocket (unless you use a battery pack ). The only thing is that the batteries do not last very long. A little bit of a problem, since I don't need a lot of power. This is a great product, but I have to say that I would've like to have seen some sort of indicator of how much charge was left, or how long the batteries could last. I am going to buy another one. Good power supply with good features. I use a wall-plug AC power supply in my kitchen.   A great product that was easy to install.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My phone was very slow to load apps when the data was available. Then I got a message saying my data was being blocked for "system maintenance." This lasted about a week. I called a tech expert on the phone, but they could not help me. Then the phone would just hang up. The same thing happened at a different store where I went for an Iphone 5. I could never get the Iphone to start and would get a blue screen.    No longer recommend:  I have now had 2 of these phones, the iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy S4, for a total of 2 months. There is a significant difference in the performance of the two phones. The S4 is much faster in many ways, it is a much better camera, the battery life is great, the interface is simple and intuitive, the screen is great and the battery is very long. However, it has a lot of problems that make it unusable. My phone has been slow loading apps, when the information was available, it would lag. It would randomly just turn off. It seems to be unstable and the software has no idea what to do when I make a mistake or want to fix an issue. It's extremely unstable, the phone turns off at random times and I have to restart it. The camera has a glitch in it, and it seems to freeze up all the time. It uses a lot more battery than the 5. The fingerprint reader is very sensitive and I never have a chance to enter my pass code. The battery life on these phones is better than that of the S4 but the S5 doesn't give me a good experience, I can't get it to turn on and get anywhere. So I'm just not sure if I'd go with either of these as a daily driver. I'm not saying you should get the S3 or the S6 but there are much better smartphones out there.  There are worse, but these are not worth buying.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been a long time Apple customer (almost 3 years)   But,   the   Apple   iPhone   iPods   are   useless   for me,  i need a true   iPod-like   product   that   allows me to connect to   my   computer,  connect to a   portable media player   and   play my  favorite songs on   them.   My   laptop and  computer   have   to use   any   devices that  the     Mac     I used before.  The   iTools   on Apple's website   can   do   much more, it can,  make   me   more comfortable with   using it,  and give me   the ability to do   more than   just play music on my     computer.  I want a  true   iPad   as well,  but   in the  world   where   this   is   so   popular   today,  I don't need   an   even more   expensive   device  .  The Best iPad App Ever!! Review by Andrew. (Posted on 10/11/13) I have bought many apps, both paid and free. I have tried many of the different types of apps but this one is by far the best. It has everything you need: media player, game, calculator and more. This app is like having a full-fledged device with all the bells and whistles. I highly recommend this app. I am giving it 5 stars for being the best! A really nice iPad app Review by Jason. (Posted 9/8/13 4:58:00 PM) I got this when I bought my iPad. It is a very handy and nice looking app. The only thing I don;t like about it is that I would like to be able to add the apps I use to it. I like the fact that it is a complete iPad application. If you get this app you might as well get all the other ones because you wont be missing a thing. The best app for iPad Review by jen. (Published 9/1/13 8:11:00 AM)  This is one
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the P1 and really like it, I was surprised with how big it is, I always used to use a cell phone with the size of it, but now that I have a phone with a big screen it's nice to have a bigger one too. My one issue is that the touch screen sometimes stops working and I had to reset it,   but I was able to get it working again.   Overall I really like this product, I plan on buying more.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    -   The product is terrible. I spent way more money on a good-looking laptop. I have a 13" Retina display and an Intel i7. I've tried to play games but it only shows them on the built-in screen, not on my desktop, where I could use all the extra real estate to play. When I'm using it as a tablet, it is absolutely horrible. I'm in school and my laptop is in the school library, so that's a problem for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The headphone is a cheap, noisy one, not that it matters if it's an inferior headphone, but it's not worth my money.    5/5   A great headphone at a great price.  I have been looking to add to my collection of high quality, long lasting headphones, and these fit the bill. The sound quality is superb, and the construction is well thought out. The only thing I have to complain about is the cord. It's quite long, and my ear cannot wrap around the wire, so it's kind of uncomfortable to listen to music while wearing it. The other thing I noticed is the included remote. The remote is quite old, but is very functional.  I have been thinking about upgrading the other components, but the price tag is still too good.
